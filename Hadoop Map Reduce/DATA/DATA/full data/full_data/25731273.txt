25731273	alroy  or  the prince of the captivity   by benjamin disraeli   illustration cover  illustration alroyfrontis174  illustration frontislabel   authors preface  being at jerusalem in the year 1831 and visiting the traditionary tombs of the kings of israel my thoughts recurred to a personage whose marvellous career had even in boyhood attracted my attention as one fraught with the richest materials of poetic fiction and i then commenced these pages that should commemorate the name of alroy in the twelfth century when he arose this was the political condition of the east  the caliphate was in a state of rapid decay the seljukian sultans who had been called to the assistance of the commanders of the faithful had become like the mayors of the palace in france the real sovereigns of the empire out of the dominions of the successors of the prophet they had carved four kingdoms which conferred titles on four seljukian princes to wit the sultan of bagdad the sultan of persia the sultan of syria and the sultan of roum or asia minor  but these warlike princes in the relaxed discipline and doubtful conduct of their armies began themselves to evince the natural effects of luxury and indulgence they were no longer the same invincible and irresistible warriors who had poured forth from the shores of the caspian over the fairest regions of the east and although they still contrived to preserve order in their dominions they witnessed with illconcealed apprehension the rising power of the kings of karasmé whose conquests daily made their territories more contiguous  with regard to the hebrew people it should be known that after the destruction of jerusalem the eastern jews while they acknowledged the supremacy of their conquerors gathered themselves together for all purposes of jurisdiction under the control of a native ruler a reputed descendant of david whom they dignified with the title of the prince of the captivity if we are to credit the enthusiastic annalists of this imaginative people there were periods of prosperity when the princes of the captivity assumed scarcely less state and enjoyed scarcely less power than the ancient kings of judah themselves certain it is that their power increased always in an exact proportion to the weakness of the caliphate and without doubt in some of the most distracted periods of the arabian rule the hebrew princes rose into some degree of local and temporary importance their chief residence was bagdad where they remained until the eleventh century an age fatal in oriental history from the disasters of which the princes of the captivity were not exempt they are heard of even in the twelfth century i have ventured to place one at hamadan which was a favourite residence of the hebrews from being the burialplace of esther and mordecai  with regard to the supernatural machinery of this romance it is cabalistical and correct from the spirits of the tombs to the sceptre of solomon authority may be found in the traditions of the hebrews for the introduction of all these spiritual agencies  grosvenor gate july 1845      a l r o y  illustration page001   chapter i      a great day for israel  the cornets sounded a final flourish as the prince of the captivity dismounted from his white mule his train shouted as if they were once more a people and had it not been for the contemptuous leer which played upon the countenances of the moslem bystanders it might have been taken for a day of triumph rather than of tribute  the glory has not departed exclaimed the venerable bostenay as he entered the hall of his mansion it is not as the visit of sheba unto solomon nevertheless the glory has not yet departed you have done well faithful caleb the old mans courage waxed more vigorous as each step within his own walls the more assured him against the recent causes of his fear the audible curses and the threatened missiles of the unbelieving mob  it shall be a day of rejoicing and thanksgiving continued the prince and look my faithful caleb that the trumpeters be well served that last flourish was bravely done it was not as the blast before jericho nevertheless it told that the lord of hosts was for us how the accursed ishmaelites started did you mark caleb that tall turk in green upon my left by the sceptre of jacob he turned pale oh it shall be a day of rejoicing and thanksgiving and spare not the wine nor the fleshpots for the people look you to this my child for the people shouted bravely and with a stout voice it was not as the great shout in the camp when the ark returned nevertheless it was boldly done and showed that the glory had not yet departed so spare not the wine my son and drink to the desolation of ishmael in the juice which he dare not quaff  it has indeed been a great day for israel exclaimed caleb echoing his masters exultation  had the procession been forbidden continued bostenay had it been reserved for me of all the princes to have dragged the accursed tribute upon foot without trumpets and without guards by this sceptre my good caleb i really think that sluggishly as this old blood now runs i would but it is needless now to talk the god of our fathers hath been our refuge  verily my lord we were as david in the wilderness of ziph but now we are as the lords anointed in the stronghold of engedi  the glory truly has not yet utterly departed resumed the prince in a more subdued tone yet if i tell you what caleb praise the lord that you are young  my prince too may yet live to see the good day  nay my child you misinterpret me your prince has lived to see the evil day twas not of the coming that i thought when i bid you praise the lord because you were young the more my sin i was thinking caleb that if your hair was as mine if you could recollect like me the days that are gone by the days when it needed no bride to prove we were princes«the glorious days when we led captivity captive i was thinking i say my son what a gainful heritage it is to be born after the joys that have passed away  my father lived at babylon said caleb oh name it not name it not exclaimed the old chieftain dark was the day that we lost that second zion we were then also slaves to the egyptian but verily we ruled over the realm of pharaoh why caleb caleb you who know all the days of toil the nights restless as a lovesick boys which it has cost your prince to gain permission to grace our tributeday with the paltry presence of halfadozen guards you who know all my difficulties who have witnessed all my mortifications what would you say to the purse of dirhems surrounded by seven thousand scimitars  seven thousand scimitars not one less my father flourished one it was indeed a great day for israel nay that is nothing when old alroy was prince old david alroy for thirty years good caleb thirty long years we paid no tribute to the caliph  no tribute no tribute for thirty years what marvel then my prince that the philistines have of late exacted interest  nay that is nothing continued old bostenay unmindful of his servants ejaculations when moctador was caliph he sent to the same prince david to know why the dirhems were not brought up and david immediately called to horse and attended by all the chief people rode to the palace and told the caliph that tribute was an acknowledgment made from the weak to the strong to insure protection and support and inasmuch as he and his people had garrisoned the city for ten years against the seljuks he held the caliph in arrear  we shall yet see an ass mount a ladder1 exclaimed caleb with uplifted eyes of wonder  it is true though continued the prince often have i heard my father tell the tale he was then a child and his mother held him up to see the procession return and all the people shouted the sceptre has not gone out of jacob  it was indeed a great day for israel  nay that is nothing i could tell you such things but we prattle our business is not yet done you to the people the widow and the orphan are waiting give freely good caleb give freely the spoils of the canaanite are no longer ours nevertheless the lord is still our god and after all even this is a great day for israel and caleb caleb bid my nephew david alroy know that i would speak with him  i will do all promptly good master we wondered that our honoured lord your nephew went not up with the donation this day  who bade you wonder begone sir how long are you to idle here away  they wonder he went not up with the tribute today ay surely a common talk this boy will be our ruin a prudent hand to wield our shattered sceptre i have observed him from his infancy he should have lived in babylon the old alroy blood flows in his veins a stiffnecked race when i was a youth his grandsire was my friend i had some fancies then myself dreams dreams we have fallen on evil days and yet we prosper i have lived long enough to feel that a rich caravan laden with the shawls of india and the stuffs of samarcand if not exactly like dancing before the ark is still a goodly sight and our hardhearted rulers with all their pride can they subsist without us still we wax rich i have lived to see the haughty caliph sink into a slave viler far than israel and the victorious and voluptuous seljuks even now they tremble at the dim mention of the distant name of arslan yet i bostenay and the frail remnant of our scattered tribes still we exist and still thanks to our god we prosper but the age of power has passed it is by prudence now that we must flourish the gibe and jest the curse perchance the blow israel now must bear and with a calm or even smiling visage what then for every gibe and jest for every curse ill have a dirhem and for every blow let him look to it who is my debtor or wills to be so but see he comes my nephew his grandsire was my friend methinks i look upon him now the same alroy that was the partner of my boyish hours and yet that fragile form and girlish face but ill consort with the dark passions and the dangerous fancies which i fear lie hidden in that tender breast well sir  you want me uncle  what then uncles often want what nephews seldom offer  i at least can refuse nothing for i have naught to give  you have a jewel which i greatly covet a jewel see my chaplet you gave it me my uncle it is yours  i thank you many a blazing ruby many a soft and shadowy pearl and many an emerald glowing like a star in the far desert i behold my child they are choice stones and yet i miss a jewel far more precious which when i gave you this rich chaplet david i deemed you did possess how do you call it sir obedience  a word of doubtful import for to obey when duty is disgrace is not a virtue  i see you read my thought in a word i sent for you to know wherefore you joined me not today in offering ourour  tribute  be it so tribute why were you absent because it was a tribute i pay none but that the dreary course of seventy winters has not erased the memory of my boyish follies david i should esteem you mad think you because i am old i am enamoured of disgrace and love a house of bondage if life were a mere question between freedom and slavery glory and dishonour all could decide trust me there needs but little spirit to be a moody patriot in a sullen home and vent your heroic spleen upon your fellowsufferers whose sufferings you cannot remedy but of such stuff your race were ever made such deliverers ever abounded in the house of alroy and what has been the result i found you and your sister orphan infants your sceptre broken and your tribes dispersed the tribute which now at least we pay like princes was then exacted with the scourge and offered in chains i collected our scattered people i reestablished our ancient throne and this day which you look upon as a day of humiliation and of mourning is rightly considered by all a day of triumph and of feasting for has it not proved in the very teeth of the ishmaelites that the sceptre has not yet departed from jacob  i pray you uncle speak not of these things i would not willingly forget you are my kinsman and a kind one let there not be strife between us what my feelings are is nothing they are my own i cannot change them and for my ancestors if they pondered much and achieved little why then twould seem our pedigree is pure and i am their true son at least one was a hero  ah the great alroy you may well be proud of such an ancestor  i am ashamed uncle ashamed ashamed  his sceptre still exists at least i have not betrayed him and this brings me to the real purport of our interview that sceptre i would return  to whom  to its right owner to yourself  oh no no no i pray you i pray you not i do entreat you sir forget that i have a right as utterly as i disclaim it that sceptre you have wielded it wisely and well i beseech you keep it indeed good uncle i have no sort of talent for all the busy duties of this post  you sigh for glory yet you fly from toil  toil without glory is a menials lot  you are a boy you may yet live to learn that the sweetest lot of life consists in tranquil duties and wellearned repose  if my lot be repose ill find it in a lair  ah david david there is a wildness in your temper boy that makes me often tremble you are already too much alone child and for this as well as weightier reasons i am desirous that you should at length assume the office you inherit what my poor experience can afford to aid you as your counsellor i shall ever proffer and for the rest our god will not desert you an orphan child and born of royal blood  prythee no more kind uncle i have but little heart to mount a throne which only ranks me as the first of slaves  pooh pooh you are young live we like slaves is this hall a servile chamber these costly carpets and these rich divans in what proud harem shall we find their match i feel not like a slave my coffers are full of dirhems is that slavish the wealthiest company of the caravan is ever bostenays is that to be a slave walk the bazaar of bagdad and you will find my name more potent than the caliphs is that a badge of slavery  uncle you toil for others  so do we all so does the bee yet he is free and happy  at least he has a sting  which he can use but once and when he stings  he dies and like a hero such a death is sweeter than his honey  well well you are young you are young i once too had fancies dreams all dreams all i willingly would see you happy child come let that face brighten after all today is a great day if you had seen what i have seen david you too would feel grateful come let us feast the ishmaelite the accursed child of hagar he does confess today that you are a prince this day also you complete your eighteenth year the custom of our people now requires that you should assume the attributes of manhood today then your reign commences and at our festival i will present the elders to their prince for a while farewell my child array that face in smiles i shall most anxiously await your presence  farewell sir  he turned his head and watched his uncle as he departed the bitter expression of his countenance gradually melted away as bostenay disappeared dejection succeeded to sarcasm he sighed he threw himself upon a couch and buried his face in his hands  suddenly he arose and paced the chamber with an irregular and moody step he stopped and leant against a column he spoke in a tremulous and smothered voice  oh my heart is full of care and my soul is dark with sorrow what am i what is all this a cloud hangs heavy oer my life god of my fathers let it burst  i know not what i feel yet what i feel is madness thus to be is not to live if life be what i sometimes dream and dare to think it might be to breathe to feed to sleep to wake and breathe again again to feel existence without hope if this be life why then these brooding thoughts that whisper death were better  away the demon tempts me but to what what nameless deed shall desecrate this hand it must not be the royal blood of twice two thousand years it must not die die like a dream oh my heart is full of care and my soul is dark with sorrow  hark the trumpets that sound our dishonour oh that they but sounded to battle lord of hosts let me conquer or die let me conquer like david or die lord like saul  why do i live ah could the thought that lurks within my secret heart but answer not that trumpets blast could speak as loud or clear the votary of a false idea i linger in this shadowy life and feed on silent images which no eye but mine can gaze upon till at length they are invested with all the terrible circumstance of life and breathe and act and form a stirring world of fate and beauty time and death and glory and then from out this dazzling wilderness of deeds i wander forth and wake and find myself in this dull house of bondage even as i do now horrible horrible  god of my fathers for indeed i dare not style thee god of their wretched sons yet by the memory of sinai let me tell thee that some of the antique blood yet beats within these pulses and there yet is one who fain would commune with thee face to face commune and conquer  and if the promise unto which we cling be not a cheat why let him come come and come quickly for thy servant israel lord is now a slave so infamous so woebegone and so contemned that even when our fathers hung their harps by the sad waters of the babylonian stream why it was paradise compared with what we suffer  alas they do not suffer they endure and do not feel or by this time our shadowy cherubim would guard again the ark it is the will that is the father to the deed and he who broods over some long idea however wild will find his dream was but the prophecy of coming fate  and even now a vivid flash darts through the darkness of my mind methinks methinksah worst of woes to dream of glory in despair no no i live and die a most ignoble thing beauty and love and fame and mighty deeds the smile of women and the gaze of men and the ennobling consciousness of worth and all the fiery course of the creative passions these are not for me and i alroy the descendant of sacred kings and with a soul that pants for empire i stand here extending my vain arm for my lost sceptre a most dishonoured slave and do i still exist exist ay merrily hark festivity holds her fair revel in these lighthearted walls we are gay today and yet ere yon proud sun whose mighty course was stayed before our swords that now he even does not deign to shine upon ere yon proud sun shall like a hero from a glorious field enter the bright pavilion of his rest there shall a deed be done  my fathers my heroic fathers if this feeble arm cannot redeem your heritage if the foul boar must still wallow in thy sweet vineyard israel at least i will not disgrace you no let me perish the house of david is no more no more our sacred seed shall lurk and linger like a blighted thing in this degenerate earth if we cannot flourish why then we will die  oh say not so my brother  he turns he gazes on a face beauteous as a starry night his heart is full his voice is low  ah miriam thou queller of dark spirits is it thou why art thou here  why am i here are you not here and need i urge a stronger plea oh brother dear i pray you come and mingle in our festival our walls are hung with flowers you love2 i culled them by the fountains side the holy lamps are trimmed and set and you must raise their earliest flame without the gate my maidens wait to offer you a robe of state then brother dear i pray you come and mingle in our festival  why should we feast  ah is it not in thy dear name these lamps are lit these garlands hung today to us a prince is given today  a prince without a kingdom  but not without that which makes kingdoms precious and which full many a royal heart has sighed for willing subjects david  slaves miriam fellowslaves  what we are my brother our god has willed and let us bow and tremble  i will not bow i cannot tremble  hush david hush it was this haughty spirit that called the vengeance of the lord upon us  it was this haughty spirit that conquered canaan  oh my brother my dear brother they told me the dark spirit had fallen on thee and i came and hoped that miriam might have charmed it what we may have been alroy is a bright dream and what we may be at least as bright a hope and for what we are thou art my brother in thy love i find present felicity and value more thy chance embraces and thy scanty smiles than all the vanished splendour of our race our gorgeous gardens and our glittering halls  who waits without there  caleb  caleb  my lord  go tell my uncle that i will presently join the banquet leave me a moment miriam nay dry those tears  oh alroy they are not tears of sorrow  god be with thee thou art the charm and consolation of my life farewell farewell  i do observe the influence of women very potent over me tis not of such stuff that they make heroes i know not love save that pure affection which doth subsist between me and this girl an orphan and my sister we are so alike that when last passover in mimicry she twined my turban round her head our uncle called her david  the daughters of my tribe they please me not though they are passing fair were our sons as brave as they are beautiful we still might dance on sion yet have i often thought that could i pillow this moody brow upon some snowy bosom that were my own and dwell in the wilderness far from the sight and ken of man and all the care and toil and wretchedness that groan and sweat and sigh about me i might haply lose this deep sensation of overwhelming woe that broods upon by being no matter life is but a dream and mine must be a dull one  without the gates of hamadan a short distance from the city was an enclosed piece of elevated ground in the centre of which rose an ancient sepulchre the traditionary tomb of esther and mordecai3 this solemn and solitary spot was an accustomed haunt of alroy and thither escaping from the banquet about an hour before sunset he this day repaired  as he unlocked the massy gate of the burialplace he heard behind him the trampling of a horse and before he had again secured the entrance some one shouted to him  he looked up and recognised the youthful and voluptuous alschiroch the governor of the city and brother of the sultan of the seljuks he was attended only by a single running footman an arab a detested favourite and notorious minister of his pleasures  dog exclaimed the irritated alschiroch art thou deaf or obstinate or both are we to call twice to our slaves unlock that gate wherefore inquired alroy  wherefore by the holy prophet he bandies questions with us unlock that gate or thy head shall answer for it  who art thou inquired alroy whose voice is so loud art thou some holiday turk who hath transgressed the orders of thy prophet and drunken aught but water go to or i will summon thee before thy cadi and so saying he turned towards the tomb  by the eyes of my mother the dog jeers us but that we are already late and this horse is like an untamed tiger i would impale him on the spot speak to the dog mustapha manage him  worthy hebrew said the silky mustapha advancing apparently you are not aware that this is our lord alschiroch his highness would fain walk his horse through the burialground of thy excellent people as he is obliged to repair on urgent matters to a holy santon who sojourns on the other side of the hill and time presses  if this be our lord alschiroch thou doubtless art his faithful slave mustapha  i am indeed his poor slave what then young master  deem thyself lucky that the gate is closed it was but yesterday thou didst insult the sister of a servant of my house i would not willingly sully my hands with such miserable blood as thine out away wretch away  holy prophet who is this dog exclaimed the astonished governor  tis the young alroy whispered mustapha who had not at first recognised him he they call their prince a most headstrong youth my lord we had better proceed  the young alroy i mark him they must have a prince too the young alroy well let us away and dog shouted alschiroch rising in his stirrups and shaking his hand with a threatening air dog remember thy tribute  alroy rushed to the gate but the massy lock was slow to open and ere he could succeed the fiery steed had borne alschiroch beyond pursuit  an expression of baffled rage remained for a moment on his countenance for a moment he remained with his eager eye fixed on the route of his vanished enemy and then he walked slowly towards the tomb but his excited temper was now little in unison with the still reverie in which he had repaired to the sepulchre to indulge he was restless and disquieted and at length he wandered into the woods which rose on the summit of the burialplace  he found himself upon a brow crested with young pinetrees in the midst of which rose a mighty cedar he threw himself beneath its thick and shadowy branches and looked upon a valley small and green in the midst of which was a marble fountain the richlycarved cupola4 supported by twisted columns and banded by a broad inscription in hebrew characters the bases of the white pillars were covered with wild flowers or hidden by beds of variegated gourds the transparent sunset flung over the whole scene a soft but brilliant light  the tranquil hour the beauteous scene the sweetness and the stillness blending their odour and serenity the gentle breeze that softly rose and summoned forth the languid birds to cool their plumage in the twilight air and wave their radiant wings in skies as bright ah what stern spirit will not yield to the soft genius of subduing eve  and alroy gazed upon the silent loneliness of earth and a tear stole down his haughty cheek  tis singular but when i am thus alone at this still hour i ever fancy i gaze upon the land of promise and often in my dreams some sunny spot the bright memorial of a roving hour will rise upon my sight and when i wake i feel as if i had been in canaan why am i not the caravan that bears my uncles goods across the desert would bear me too but i rest here my miserable life running to seed in the dull misery of this wretched city and do nothing why the old captivity was empire to our inglorious bondage we have no esther now to share their thrones no politic mordecai no purplevested daniel o jerusalem jerusalem i do believe one sight of thee would nerve me to the stickingpoint and yet to gaze upon thy fallen state my uncle tells me that of the temple not a stone remains tis horrible is there no hope  the bricks are fallen but we will rebuild with marble the sycamores are cut down but we will replace them with cedars  the chorus of our maidens as they pay their evening visit to the fountains side5 the burden is prophetic  hark again how beautifully upon the soft and flowing air their sweet and mingled voices blend and float  yet again i will build thee and thou shalt be built o virgin of israel yet again shalt thou deck thyself with thy tabrets and go forth in the dance of those that make merry yet again shalt thou plant vineyards on the mountains of samaria  see their white forms break through the sparkling foliage of the sunny shrubs as they descend with measured step that mild declivity a fair society in bright procession each one clothed in solemn drapery veiling her shadowy face with modest hand and bearing on her graceful head a graceful vase their leader is my sister  and now they reach the fountains side and dip their vases in the water pure and beauteous as themselves some repose beneath the marble pillars some seated mid the flowers gather sweets and twine them into garlands and that wild girl now that the order is broken touches with light fingers her moist vase and showers startling drops of glittering light on her serener sisters hark again they sing  o vine of sibmah upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage a spoiler hath fallen  a scream a shriek a long wild shriek confusion flight despair behold from out the woods a turbaned man rushes and seizes the leader of the chorus her companions fly on all sides miriam alone is left in the arms of alschiroch  the water column wildly rising from the breast of summer ocean in some warm tropic clime when the sudden clouds too well discover that the holiday of heaven is over and the shrieking seabirds tell a time of fierce commotion the column rising from the sea it was not so wild as he the young alroy  pallid and mad he swift upsprang and he tore up a tree by its lusty roots and down the declivity dashing with rapid leaps panting and wild he struck the ravisher on the temple with the mighty pine alschiroch fell lifeless on the sod and miriam fainting into her brothers arms  and there he stood fixed and immovable gazing upon his sisters deathly face and himself exhausted by passion and his exploit supporting her cherished but senseless body  one of the fugitive maidens appeared reconnoitring in the distance when she observed her mistress in the arms of one of her own people her courage revived and desirous of rallying her scattered companions she raised her voice and sang  haste daughters of jerusalem o haste for the lord has avenged us and the spoiler is spoiled  and soon the verse was responded to from various quarters of the woods and soon the virgins reassembled singing  we come o daughter of jerusalem we come for the lord has avenged us and the spoiler is spoiled  they gathered round their mistress and one loosened her veil and another brought water from the fountain and sprinkled her reviving countenance and miriam opened her eyes and said my brother and he answered i am here and she replied in a low voice fly david fly for the man you have stricken is a prince among the people  he will be merciful my sister and doubtless since he first erred by this time he has forgotten my offence  justice and mercy oh my brother what can these foul tyrants know of either already he has perhaps doomed you to some refined and procrastinated torture already ah what unutterable woe is mine fly my brother fly  fly fly fly  there is no fear my miriam would all his accursed race could trouble us as little as their sometime ruler see he sleeps soundly but his carcass shall not defile our fresh fountain and our fragrant flowers ill stow it in the woods and stroll here at night to listen to the jackals at their banquet  you speak wildly david what no it is impossible he is not dead you have not slain him  he sleeps he is afraid he mimics death that we may leave his side and he may rise again in safety girls look to him david you do not answer brother dear brother surely he has swooned i thought he had fled bear water maidens to that terrible man i dare not look upon him  away ill look on him and ill triumph dead alschiroch dead why but a moment since this clotted carcass was a prince my tyrant so we can rid ourselves of them eh if the prince fall why not the people dead absolutely dead and i his slayer hah at length i am a man this this indeed is life let me live slaying  woe woe our house is fallen the wildness of his gestures frightens me david david i pray thee cease he hears me not my voice perchance is thin i am very faint maidens kneel to your prince and soothe the madness of his passion  sweet is the voice of a sister in the season of sorrow and wise is the counsel of those who love us  why this is my goliath a pebble or a stick it is the same the lord of hosts is with us rightly am i called david  deliver us from our enemies o lord from those who rise up against us and those who lie in wait for us  illustration page020  were but this blow multiplied were but the servants of my uncles house to do the same why we should see again the days of elah the philistine the foul lascivious damnable philistine and he must touch my sister oh that all his tribe were here all all id tie such firebrands to their foxes tails the blaze should light to freedom  while he spoke a maiden who had not yet rejoined the company came running towards them swiftly with an agitated countenance  fly she exclaimed they come they come  miriam was reclining in an attendants arms feeble and faint but the moment her quick ear caught these words she sprang up and seized her brothers arm  alroy david brother dear brother i beseech thee listen i am thy sister thy miriam they come they come the hardhearted wicked men they come to kill perhaps to torture thee my tender brother rouse thyself david rouse thyself from this wild fierce dream save thyself fly  ah is it thou miriam thou seest he sleepeth soundly i was dreaming of noble purposes and mighty hopes tis over now i am myself again what wouldst thou  they come the fierce retainers of this fallen man they come to seize thee fly david  and leave thee  i and my maidens we have yet time to escape by the private way we entered our uncles garden when in his house we are for a moment safe as safe as our poor race can ever be bostenay is so rich so wise so prudent so learned in mans ways and knows so well the character and spirit of these men all will go right i fear nothing but thou if thou art here or to be found thy blood alone will satiate them if they be persuaded that thou hast escaped as i yet pray thou mayest their late master here whom they could scarcely love why give me thy arm an instant sweet beruna so thats well i was saying if well bribedand they may have all my jewelswhy very soon he will be as little in their memories as he is now in life i can scarcely speak i feel my words wander or seem to wander i could swoon but will not nay do not fear i will reach home these maidens are my charge tis in these crises we should show the worth of royal blood ill see them safe or die with them  o my sister methinks i never knew i was a brother until this hour my precious miriam what is life what is revenge or even fame and freedom without thee ill stay  sweet is the voice of a sister in the season of sorrow and wise is the counsel of those who love us  fly david fly  fly whither and how  the neigh of a horse sounded from the thicket  ah they come exclaimed the distracted miriam  all this has come upon us o lord yet have we not forgotten thee neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant  hark again it neighs it is a horse that calleth to its rider i see it courage miriam it is no enemy but a very present friend in time of trouble it is alschirochs courser he passed me on it by the tomb ere sunset i marked it well a very princely steed  behold behold a ram is caught in the thicket by his horns  our god hath not forgotten us quick maidens bring forth the goodly steed what do you tremble ill be his groom  nay miriam beware beware it is an untamed beast wild as the whirlwind let me deal with him  he ran after her dashed into the thicket and brought forth the horse  short time i ween that stately steed had parted from his desert home his haughty crest his eye of fire the glory of his snorting nostril betoken well his conscious pride and pure nobility of race his colour was like the sable night shining with a thousand stars and he pawed the ground with his delicate hoof like an eagle flapping its wing  alroy vaulted on his back and reined him with a masters hand  hah he exclaimed i feel more like a hero than a fugitive farewell my sister farewell ye gentle maidens fare ye well and cherish my precious miriam one embrace sweet sister and he bent down and whispered tell the good bostenay not to spare his gold for i have a deep persuasion that ere a year shall roll its heavy course i shall return and make our masters here pay for this hurried ride and bitter parting now for the desert     chapter ii       the slaying of an ishmaelite  speed fleetly speed thou courser bold and track the deserts trackless way beneath thee is the boundless earth above thee is the boundless heaven an iron soil and brazen sky speed swiftly speed thou courser bold and track the deserts trackless way ah dost thou deem these salty plains6 lead to thy yemens happy groves and dost thou scent on the hot breeze the spicy breath of araby a sweet delusion noble steed for this briny wilderness leads not to the happy groves of yemen and the breath thou scentest on the coming breeze is not the spicy breath of araby  the day has died the stars have risen with all the splendour of a desert sky and now the night descending brings solace on her dewy wings to the fainting form and pallid cheek of the youthful hebrew prince  still the courser onward rushes still his mighty heart supports him season and space the glowing soil the burning ray yield to the tempest of his frame the thunder of his nerves and lightning of his veins  food or water they have none no genial fount no graceful tree rise with their pleasant company never a beast or bird is there in that hoary desert bare nothing breaks the almighty stillness even the jackals felon cry might seem a soothing melody a grey wild rat with snowy whiskers out of a withered bramble stealing with a youthful snake in its ivory teeth in the moonlight grins with glee this is their sole society  morn comes the fresh and fragrant morn for which even the guilty sigh morn comes and all is visible and light falls like a signet on the earth and its face is turned like wax beneath a seal before them and also on their right was the sandy desert but in the night they had approached much nearer to the mountainous chain which bounded the desert on the left and whither alroy had at first guided the steed  the mountains were a chain of the mighty elburz and as the sun rose from behind a lofty peak the horse suddenly stopped and neighed as if asking for water but alroy himself exhausted could only soothe him with caresses and the horse full of courage understood his master and neighed again more cheerfully  for an hour or two the prince and his faithful companion proceeded slowly but as the day advanced the heat became so oppressive and the desire to drink so overwhelming that alroy again urged on the steed towards the mountains where he knew that he should find a well the courser dashed willingly forward and seemed to share his masters desire to quit the arid and exhausting wilderness  more than once the unhappy fugitive debated whether he should not allow himself to drop from his seat and die no torture that could await him at hamadan but seemed preferable to the prolonged and inexpressible anguish which he now endured as he rushed along leaning on his bearers neck he perceived a patch of the desert that seemed of a darker colour than the surrounding sand here he believed might perhaps be found water he tried to check the steed but with difficulty he succeeded and with still greater difficulty dismounted he knelt down and feebly raked up the sand with his hands it was moist he nearly fainted over his fruitless labour at length when he had dug about a foot deep there bubbled up some water he dashed in his hand but it was salt as the ocean when the horse saw the water his ears rose but when he smelt it he turned away his head and neighed most piteously  alas poor beast exclaimed alroy i am the occasion of thy suffering i who would be a kind master to thee if the world would let me oh that we were once more by my own fair fountain the thought is madness and miriam too i fear i am sadly tenderhearted he leant against his horses back with a feeling of utter exhaustion and burst into hysteric sobs  and the steed softly moaned and turned its head and gently rubbed its face against his arm as if to solace him in his suffering and strange but alroy was relieved by having given way to his emotion and charmed with the fondness of the faithful horse he leant down and took water and threw it over its feet to cool them and wiped the foam from its face and washed it and the horse again neighed  and now alroy tried to remount but his strength failed him and the horse immediately knelt down and received him and the moment that the prince was in his seat the horse rose and again proceeded at a rapid pace in their old direction towards sunset they were within a few miles of the broken and rocky ground into which the mountains descended and afar off alroy recognised the cupola of the longexpected well with reanimated courage and rallied energies he patted his coursers neck and pointed in the direction of the cupola and the horse pricked up its ears and increased its pace  just us the sun set they reached the well alroy jumped off the horse and would have led it to the fountain but the animal would not advance it stood shivering with a glassy eye and then with a groan fell down and died  night brings rest night brings solace rest to the weary solace to the sad and to the desperate night brings despair  the moon has sunk to early rest but a thousand stars are in the sky the mighty mountains rise severe in the clear and silent air in the forest all is still the tired wind no longer roams but has lightly dropped on its leafy couch and sleeps like man silent all but the fountains drip and by the fountains side a youth is lying  suddenly a creature steals through the black and broken rocks ha ha the jackal smells from afar the rich corruption of the coursers clay suddenly and silently it steals and stops and smells brave banqueting i ween tonight for all that goodly company jackal and fox and martencat haste ye now ere mornings break shall call the vulture to his feast and rob you of your prey  the jackal lapped the coursers blood and moaned with exquisite delight and in a moment a faint bark was heard in the distance and the jackal peeled the flesh from one of the ribs and again burst into a shriek of mournful ecstasy  hark their quick tramp first six and then three galloping with ungodly glee and a martencat came rushing down from the woods but the jackals fierce in their number drove her away and there she stood without the circle panting beautiful and baffled with her white teeth and glossy skin and sparkling eyes of rabid rage7  suddenly as one of the halfgorged jackals retired from the main corpse dragging along a stray member by some still palpitating nerves the martencat made a spring at her enemy carried off his prey and rushed into the woods  her wild scream of triumph woke a lion from his lair his mighty form black as ebony moved on a distant eminence his tail flowed like a serpent he roared and the jackals trembled and immediately ceased from their banquet turning their heads in the direction of their sovereigns voice he advanced he stalked towards them they retired he bent his head examined the carcass with condescending curiosity and instantly quitted it with royal disdain the jackals again collected around their garbage the lion advanced to the fountain to drink he beheld a man his mane rose his tail was wildly agitated he bent over the sleeping prince he uttered an awful roar which awoke alroy  he awoke his gaze met the flaming eyes of the enormous beast fixed upon him with a blended feeling of desire and surprise he awoke and from a swoon but the dreamless trance had refreshed the exhausted energies of the desolate wanderer in an instant he collected his senses remembered all that had passed and comprehended his present situation he returned the lion a glance as imperious and fierce and scrutinsing as his own for a moment their flashing orbs vied in regal rivalry but at length the spirit of the mere animal yielded to the genius of the man the lion cowed slunk away stalked with haughty timidity through the rocks and then sprang into the forest  morn breaks a silver light is shed over the blue and starry sky pleasant to feel is the breath of dawn night brings repose but day brings joy  the carol of a lonely bird singing in the wilderness a lonely bird that sings with glee sunny and sweet and light and clear its airy notes float through the sky and trill with innocent revelry  the lonely youth on the lonely bird upgazes from the fountains side high in the air it proudly floats balancing its crimson wings and its snowy tail long delicate and thin shines like a sparkling meteor in the sun  the carol of a lonely bird singing in the wilderness suddenly it downward dashes and thrice with circling grace it flies around the head of the hebrew prince then by his side it gently drops a bunch of fresh and fragrant dates  tis gone tis gone that cheerful stranger gone to the palmy land it loves gone like a bright and pleasant dream a moment since and it was there glancing in the sunny air and now the sky is without a guest alas alas no more is heard the carol of that lonely bird singing in the wilderness  as thou didst feed elijah so also hast thou fed me god of my fathers and alroy arose and he took his turban and unfolded it and knelt and prayed and then he ate of the dates and drank of the fountain and full of confidence in the god of israel the descendant of david pursued his flight  he now commenced the ascent of the mountainous chain a wearisome and painful toil two hours past noon he reached the summit of the first ridge and looked over a wild and chaotic waste full of precipices and ravines and dark unfathomable gorges the surrounding hills were ploughed in all directions by the courses of driedup cataracts and here and there a few savage goats browsed on an occasional patch of lean and sour pasture this waste extended for many miles the distance formed by a more elevated range of mountains and beyond these high in the blue sky rose the loftiest peaks of elburz8 shining with sharp glaciers of eternal snow  it was apparent that alroy was no stranger in the scene of his flight he had never hesitated as to his course and now after having rested for a short time on the summit he descended towards the left by a natural but intricate path until his progress was arrested by a black ravine scarcely half a dozen yards divided him from the opposite precipice by which it was formed but the gulf beneath no one could shoot a glance at its invisible termination without drawing back with a cold shudder  the prince knelt down and examined the surrounding ground with great care at length he raised a small square stone which covered a metallic plate and taking from his vest a carnelian talisman covered with strange characters he knocked thrice upon the plate with the signet a low solemn murmur sounded around presently the plate flew off and alroy pulled forth several yards of an iron chain which he threw over to the opposite precipice the chain fastened without difficulty to the rock and was evidently constrained by some magnetic influence the prince seizing the chain with both his hands now swung across the ravine as he landed the chain parted from the rock swiftly disappeared down the opposite aperture and its covering closed with the same low solemn murmur as before  alroy proceeded for about a hundred paces through a natural cloister of basalt until he arrived at a large uncovered court of the same formation which a stranger might easily have been excused for believing to have been formed and smoothed by art in its centre bubbled up a perpetual spring icy cold the stream had worn a channel through the pavement and might be traced for some time wandering among the rocks until at length it leaped from a precipice into a gorge below in a gauzy shower of variegated spray crossing the court alroy now entered a vast cavern  the cavern was nearly circular in form lighted from a large aperture in the top yet a burning lamp in a distant and murky corner indicated that its inhabitant did not trust merely to this natural source of the great blessing of existence in the centre of the cave was a circular and brazen table sculptured with strange characters and mysterious figures near it was a couch on which lay several volumes9 suspended from the walls were a shield some bows and arrows and other arms  as the prince of the captivity knelt down and kissed the vacant couch a figure advanced from the extremity of the cavern into the light he was a man of middle age considerably above the common height with a remarkably athletic frame and a stronglymarked but majestic countenance his black beard descended to his waist over a dark red robe encircled by a black girdle embroidered with yellow characters like those sculptured on the brazen table black also was his turban and black his large and luminous eye  the stranger advanced so softly that alroy did not perceive him until the prince again rose  jabaster exclaimed the prince  sacred seed of david answered the cabalist10 thou art expected i read of thee in the stars last night they spoke of trouble  trouble or triumph time must prove which it is great master at present i am a fugitive and exhausted the bloodhounds track me but methinks i have baffled them now i have slain an ishmaelite     chapter iii       the hope of israel  it was midnight alroy slept upon the couch his sleep was troubled jabaster stood by his side motionless and gazing intently upon his slumbering guest  the only hope of israel murmured the cabalist my pupil and my prince i have long perceived in his young mind the seed of mighty deeds and oer his future life have often mused with a prophetic hope the blood of david the sacred offspring of a solemn race there is a magic in his flowing veins my science cannot reach  when in my youth i raised our standard by my native tigris and called our nation to restore their ark why we were numerous wealthy potent we were a people then and they flocked to it boldly did we lack counsel did we need a leader who can aver that jabasters brain or arm was ever wanting and yet the dream dissolved the glorious vision oh when i struck down marvan and the caliphs camp flung its blazing shadow over the bloody river ah then indeed i lived twenty years of vigil may gain a pardon that i then forgot we lacked the chief ingredient in the spell the blood that sleeps beside me  i recall the glorious rapture of that sacred strife amid the rocks of caucasus a fugitive a proscribed and outlawed wretch whose life is common sport and whom the vilest hind may slay without a bidding i who would have been messiah  burn thy books jabaster break thy brazen tables forget thy lofty science cabalist and read the stars no longer11 but last night i stood upon the gulf which girds my dwelling in one hand i held my sacred talisman that bears the name ineffable in the other the mystic record of our holy race i remembered that i had evoked spirits that i had communed with the great departed and that the glowing heavens were to me a natural language i recalled as consolation to my gloomy soul that never had my science been exercised but for a sacred or a noble purpose and i remembered israel my brave my chosen and my antique race slaves wretched slaves i was strongly tempted to fling me down this perilous abyss and end my learning and my life together  but as i gazed upon the star of david a sudden halo rose around its rays and ever and anon a meteor shot from out the silver veil i read that there was trouble in the holy seed and now comes this boy who has done a deed which  the ark the ark i gaze upon the ark the slumberer speaks the words of sleep are sacred salvation only from the house of david a mighty truth my life too well has proved it he is more calm it is the holy hour ill steal into the court and gaze upon the star that sways the fortunes of his royal house  the moonbeam fell upon the fountain the pavement of the court was a flood of light the rocks rose dark around jabaster seated by the spring and holding his talisman in his left hand shaded his sight with the other as he gazed upon the luminous heavens  a shriek his name was called alroy wild and panting rushed into the court with extended arms the cabalist started up seized him and held him in his careful grasp foaming and in convulsions  jabaster jabaster  i am here my child  the lord hath spoken  the lord is our refuge calm thyself son of david and tell me all  i have been sleeping master is it not so  even so my child exhausted by his flight and the exciting narrative of his exploit my prince lay down upon the couch and slumbered but i fear that slumber was not repose  repose and i have naught in common now farewell for ever to that fatal word i am the lords anointed  drink of the fountain david it will restore thee  restore the covenant restore the ark restore the holy city  the spirit of the lord hath fallen upon him son of david i adjure thee tell me all that hath passed i am a levite in my hand i hold the name ineffable  take thy trumpet then summon the people bid them swiftly raise again our temple the bricks have fallen but we will rebuild with marble didst hear that chorus sir  unto thy chosen ear alone it sounded  where am i this is not our fountain yet thou didst say the fountain think me not wild i know thee i know all thou art not miriam thou art jabaster i am alroy but thou didst say the fountain and it distracted me and called back my memory to  god of israel lo i kneel before thee here in the solitude of wildest nature my only witness here this holy man i kneel and vow lord i will do thy bidding i am young o god and weak but thou lord art allpowerful what god is like to thee doubt not my courage lord and fill me with thy spirit but remember remember her o lord remember miriam it is the only worldly thought i have and it is pure  still of his sister calm thyself my son  holy master thou dost remember when i was thy pupil in this cavern thou hast not forgotten those days of tranquil study those sweet long wandering nights of sacred science i was dutiful and hung upon each accent of thy lore with the devotion that must spring from love  i cannot weep alroy but were it in my power i would yield a tear of homage to the memory of those days  how calmly have we sat on some high brow and gazed upon the stars  tis very true sweet child  and if thou eer didst chide me twas half in jest and only for my silence  what would he now infer no matter he grows calmer how solemn is his visage in the moonlight and yet not solomon upon his youthful throne could look more beautiful  i never told thee an untruth jabaster  my life upon thy faith  fear not the pledge and so believe me on the mountain brow watching the starry heavens with thyself i was not calmer than i feel sir now  i do believe thee  then jabaster believe as fully i am the lords anointed  tell me all my child  know then that sleeping on the couch within my sleep was troubled many dreams i had indefinite and broken i recall none of their images except i feel a dim sensation twas my lot to live in brighter days than now rise on our race suddenly i stood upon a mountain tall and grey and gazed upon the stars and as i gazed a trumpet sounded its note thrilled through my soul never have i heard a sound so awful the thunder when it broke over the cavern here and shivered the peak whose ruins lie around us was but a feeble worldly sound to this almighty music my cheek grew pale i panted even for breath a flaming light spread over the sky the stars melted away and i beheld advancing from the bursting radiancy the foremost body of a mighty host  oh not when saul led forth our fighting men against the philistine not when joab numbered the warriors of my great ancestor did human vision gaze upon a scene of so much martial splendour chariots and cavalry and glittering trains of plumed warriors too robust to need a coursers solace streams of shining spears and banners like a sunset reverend priests swinging their perfumed censers and prophets hymning with their golden harps a most triumphant future  joy joy they say to israel for he cometh he cometh in his splendour and his might the great messiah of our ancient hopes  and lo a mighty chariot now appeared drawn by strange beasts whose forms were half obscured by the bright flames on which they seemed to float in that glorious car a warrior stood proud and immovable his form his countenance hold my hand jabaster while i speak that chieftain was myself  proceed proceed my son  i started in my dream and i awoke i found myself upsitting on my couch the pageantry had vanished naught was seen but the bright moonlight and the gloomy cave and as i sighed to think i eer had wakened and mused upon the strangeness of my vision a still small voice descended from above and called alroy i started but i answered not methought it was my fancy again my name was called and now i murmured lord i am here what wouldst thou naught responded and soon great dread came over me and i rushed out and called to thee my master  it was the daughter of the voice12 that spake since the captivity tis the only mode by which the saints are summoned oft have i heard of it but never in these sad degenerate days has its soft aspiration fallen upon us these are strange times and tidings the building of the temple is at hand son of david my heart is full let us to prayer  day dawned upon jabaster still musing in solitude among his rocks within the cavern alroy remained in prayer  often and anxiously the cabalist shot a glance at his companion and then again relapsed into reverie  the time is come that i must to this youth reveal the secrets of my early life much will he hear of glory much of shame naught must i conceal and naught gloss over  i must tell how in the plains of tigris i upraised the sacred standard of our chosen race and called them from their bondage how despairing of his recreant fathers and inspired by human power alone i vainly claimed the mighty office for his sacred blood alone reserved god of my fathers grant that future service the humble service of a contrite soul may in the coming glory that awaits us atone for past presumption  but for him great trials are impending not lightly must that votary be proved who fain would free a people the lord is faithful to his promise but the lord will choose his season and his minister courage and faith and deep humility and strong endurance and the watchful soul temptation cannot sully these are the fruits we lay upon his altar and meekly watch if some descending flame will vouchsafe to accept and brightly bless them  it is written in the dread volume of our mystic lore that not alone the saviour shall spring from out our house of princes but that none shall rise to free us until alone and unassisted he have gained the sceptre which solomon of old wielded within his cedar palaces  that sceptre must he gain this fragile youth untried and delicate unknowing in the ways of this strange world where every step is danger how much hardship how much peril what withering disappointment what dull care what long despondency what neverending lures now lie in ambush for this gentle boy o my countrymen is this your hope and i with all my lore and all my courage and all my deep intelligence of man unhappy israel why am i not thy prince  i check the blasphemous thought did not his great ancestor as young and as untried a beardless stripling with but a pebble a small smoothed stone level a mailed giant with the ground and save his people  he is clearly summoned the lord is with him be he with the lord and we shall prosper  it was at sunset on the third day after the arrival of alroy at the cave of the cabalist that the prince of the captivity commenced his pilgrimage in quest of the sceptre of solomon  silently the pilgrim and his master took their way to the brink of the ravine and there they stopped to part perhaps forever  it is a bitter moment alroy human feelings are not for beings like us yet they will have their way remember all cherish the talisman as thy life nay welcome death with it pressing against thy heart rather than breathe without it be firm be pious think of thy ancestors think of thy god  doubt me not dear master if i seem not full of that proud spirit which was perhaps too much my wont ascribe it not to fear jabaster nor even to the pain of leaving thee dear friend but ever since that sweet and solemn voice summoned me so thrillingly i know not how it is but a change has come over my temper yet i am firm oh firmer far than when i struck down the ishmaelite indeed indeed fear not for me the lord that knoweth all things knows full well i am prepared even to the death thy prayers jabaster and  stop stop i do remember me see this ring tis a choice emerald thou mayst have wondered i should wear a bauble alroy i had a brother once still he may live when we parted this was the signal of his love a love my child strong though we greatly differed take it the hour may come that thou mayst need his aid it will command it if he live he prospers i know his temper well he was made for what the worldly deem prosperity god be with thee sacred boy the god of our great fathers the god of abraham of isaac and of jacob  they embraced  we linger exclaimed the cabalist we linger oh in vain we quell the feelings of our kind god god bless and be with thee art sure thou hast all thy dagger and thy wallet that staff has seen some service i cut it on the jordan ah that i could be thy mate twould be nothing then at the worst to die together such a fate seems sweeter now than parting ill watch thy star my child thou weepest and i too why what is this am i indeed jabaster one more embrace and sowell not say farewell but only think it     chapter iv       alroy falls among thieves  tradition taught that the sceptre of solomon could be found only in the unknown sepulchres of the ancient hebrew monarchs and that none might dare to touch it but one of their descendants armed with the cabalistic talisman which was to guide him in his awful and difficult researches alroy commenced his pilgrimage to the holy city at this time the love of these sacred wanderings was a reigning passion among the jews as well as the christians  the prince of the captivity was to direct his course into the heart of those great deserts which in his flight from hamadan he had only skirted following the track of the caravan he was to make his way to babylon or bagdad from the capital of the caliphs his journey to jerusalem was one comparatively easy but to reach bagdad he must encounter hardship and danger the prospect of which would have divested any one of hope who did not conceive himself the object of an omnipotent and particular providence  clothed only in a coarse black frock common among the kourds girded round his waist by a cord which held his dagger his head shaven and covered with a large white turban which screened him from the heat his feet protected only by slippers supported by his staff and bearing on his shoulders a bag of dried meat and parched corn and a leathern skin of water behold toiling over the glowing sands of persia a youth whose life had hitherto been a long unbroken dream of domestic luxury and innocent indulgence  he travelled during the warm night or the early starlit morn during the day he rested happy if he could recline by the side of some charitable well shaded by a palmtree or frighten a gazelle from its restingplace among the rough bushes of some wild rocks were these resources wanting he threw himself upon the sand and made an awning with his staff and turban  three weeks had elapsed since he quitted the cavern of the cabalist hitherto he had met with no human being the desert became less arid a scanty vegetation sprang up from a more genial soil the ground broke into gentle undulations his senses were invigorated with the odour of wild plants and his sight refreshed by the glancing form of some wandering bird a pilgrim like himself but more at ease  soon sprang up a grove of graceful palmtrees with their tall thin stems and bending feathery crowns languid and beautiful around the verdant sod gleamed like an emerald silver streams flowing from a bubbling parent spring wound their white forms within the bright green turf from the grove arose the softening song of doves and showers of gay and sparkling butterflies borne on their tinted wings of shifting light danced without danger in the liquid air a fair and fresh oasis  alroy reposed in this delicious retreat for two days feeding on the living dates and drinking of the fresh water fain would he have lingered nor indeed until he rested had he been sufficiently conscious of his previous exertion but the remembrance of his great mission made him restless and steeled him to the sufferings which yet awaited him  at the dawn of the second day of his journey from the oasis he beheld to his astonishment faintly but distinctly traced on the far horizon the walls and turrets of an extensive city13 animated by this unexpected prospect he continued his progress for several hours after sunrise at length utterly exhausted he sought refuge from the overpowering heat beneath the cupola of the ruined tomb of some moslem saint at sunset he continued his journey and in the morning found himself within a few miles of the city he halted and watched with anxiety for some evidence of its inhabitants none was visible no crowds or cavalcades issued from the gates not a single human being not a solitary camel moved in the vicinity  the day was too advanced for the pilgrim to proceed but so great was his anxiety to reach this unknown settlement and penetrate the mystery of its silence that ere sunset alroy entered the gates  a magnificent city of an architecture with which he was unacquainted offered to his entranced vision its gorgeous ruins and deserted splendour long streets of palaces with their rich line of lessening pillars here and there broken by some fallen shaft vast courts surrounded by ornate and solemn temples and luxurious baths adorned with rare mosaics and yet bright with antique gilding now an arch of triumph still haughty with its broken friezes now a granite obelisk covered with strange characters and proudly towering over a prostrate companion sometimes a void and crumbling theatre sometimes a long and elegant aqueduct sometimes a porphyry column once breathing with the heroic statue that now lies shivered at its base all suffused with the warm twilight of an eastern eve  he gazed with wonder and admiration upon the strange and fascinating scene the more he beheld the more his curiosity was excited he breathed with difficulty he advanced with a blended feeling of eagerness and hesitation fresh wonders successively unfolded themselves each turn developed a new scene of still and solemn splendour the echo of his step filled him with awe he looked around him with an amazed air a fluttering heart and a changing countenance all was silent alone the hebrew prince stood amid the regal creation of the macedonian captains empires and dynasties flourish and pass away the proud metropolis becomes a solitude the conquering kingdom even a desert but israel still remains still a descendant of the most ancient kings breathed amid these royal ruins and still the eternal sun could never rise without gilding the towers of living jerusalem a word a deed a single day a single man and we might be a nation  a shout he turns he is seized four ferocious kourdish bandits grapple and bind him  the bandits hurried their captive through a street which appeared to have been the principal way of the city nearly at its termination they turned by a small ionian temple and clambering over some fallen pillars entered a quarter of the city of a more ruinous aspect than that which alroy had hitherto visited the path was narrow often obstructed and around were signs of devastation for which the exterior of the city had not prepared him  the brilliant but brief twilight of the orient was fast fading away a sombre purple tint succeeded to the rosy flush the distant towers rose black although defined in the clear and shadowy air and the moon which when he first entered had studded the heavens like a small white cloud now glittered with deceptive light  suddenly before them rose a huge pile oval in shape and formed by tiers of arches it was evidently much dilapidated and one enormous irregular and undulating rent extending from the top nearly to the foundation almost separated the side to which alroy and his companions advanced  clambering up the remainder of this massive wall the robbers and their prisoner descended into an immense amphitheatre which seemed vaster in the shadowy and streaming moonlight in it were groups of men horses and camels in the extreme distance reclining or squatting on mats and carpets was a large assembly engaged in a rough but merry banquet a fire blazed at their side its red and uncertain flame mingling with the white and steady moonbeam and throwing a flickering light over their ferocious countenances their glistening armour ample drapery and shawled heads  a spy exclaimed the captors as they dragged alroy before the leader of the band  hang him then said the chieftain without even looking up  this wine great scherirah is excellent or i am no true moslem said a principal robber but you are too cruel i hate this summary punishment let us torture him a little and extract some useful information  as you like kisloch said scherirah it may amuse us fellow where do you come from he cannot answer decidedly a spy hang him up  the captors half untied the rope that bound alroy that it might serve him for a further purpose when another of the gentle companions of scherirah interfered  spies always answer captain he is more probably a merchant in disguise  and carries hidden treasure added kisloch these rough coats often cover jewels we had better search him  ah search him said scherirah with his rough brutal voice do what you like only give me the bottle this greek wine is choice booty feed the fire men are you asleep and then kisloch who hates cruelty can roast him if he likes  the robbers prepared to strip their captive friends friends exclaimed alroy for there is no reason why you should not be friends spare me spare me i am poor i am young i am innocent i am neither a spy nor a merchant i have no plots no wealth i am a pilgrim  a decided spy exclaimed scherirah they are ever pilgrims  he speaks too well to speak truth exclaimed kisloch  all talkers are liars exclaimed scherirah  that is why kisloch is the most eloquent of the band  a jest at the banquet may prove a curse in the field replied kisloch  pooh exclaimed scherirah fellows why do you hesitate search the prisoner i say  they advanced they seized him in vain he struggled  captain exclaimed one of the band he wears upon his breast a jewel  i told you so said the third robber  give it me said scherirah  but alroy in despair at the thought of losing the talisman remembering the injunctions of jabaster and animated by supernatural courage burst from his searchers and seizing a brand from the fire held them at bay  the fellow has spirit said scherirah calmly tis pity it will cost him his life  bold man exclaimed alroy for a moment hear me i am a pilgrim poorer than a beggar the jewel they talk of is a holy emblem worthless to you to me invaluable and to be forfeited only with my life you may be careless of that beware of your own the first man who advances dies i pray you humbly chieftain let me go  kill him said scherirah  stab him exclaimed kisloch  give me the jewel said the third robber  the god of david be my refuge then exclaimed alroy  he is a hebrew he is a hebrew exclaimed scherirah jumping up spare him my mother was a jewess  the assailants lowered their arms and withdrew a few paces alroy still remained upon his guard  valiant pilgrim said scherirah advancing with a softened voice are you for the holy city  the city of my fathers  a perilous journey and whence from  hamadan  a dreary way you need repose your name  david  david you are among friends rest and repose in safety you hesitate fear not the memory of my mother is a charm that always changes me scherirah unsheathed his dagger punctured his arm14 and throwing away the weapon offered the bleeding member to alroy the prince of the captivity touched the open vein with his lips  my troth is pledged said the bandit i can never betray him in whose veins my own blood is flowing so saying he led alroy to his carpet  eat david said scherirah  i will eat bread answered alroy  what have you had so much meat lately that you will refuse this delicate gazelle that i brought down this morning with my own lance tis food for a caliph  i pray you give me bread  oh bread if you like but that a man should prefer bread to meat and such meat as this tis miraculous  a thousand thanks good scherirah but with our people the flesh of the gazelle is forbidden it is unclean its foot is cloven  i have heard of these things replied scherirah with a thoughtful air my mother was a jewess and my father was a kourd whichever be right i hope to be saved  there is but one god and mahomed is his prophet exclaimed kisloch though i drink wine your health hebrew  i will join you said to the third robber my father was a guebre and sacrificed his property to his faith and the consequence is his son has got neither  as for me said a fourth robber of very dark complexion and singularly small bright eyes i am an indian and i believe in the great golden figure with carbuncle eyes in the temple of delhi  i have no religion said a tall negro in a red turban grinning with his white teeth they have none in my country but if i had heard of your god before calidas i would have believed in him  i almost wish i had been a jew exclaimed scherirah musing my mother was a good woman the jews are very rich said the third robber when you get to jerusalem david you will see the christians continued scherirah  the accursed giaours exclaimed kisloch we are all against them  with their white faces exclaimed the negro and their blue eyes said the indian what can you expect of men who live in a country without a sun observed the guebre  alroy awoke about two hours after midnight his companions were in deep slumber the moon had set the fire had died away a few red embers alone remaining dark masses of shadow hung about the amphitheatre he arose and cautiously stepped over the sleeping bandits he was not in strictness a prisoner but who could trust to the caprice of these lawless men tomorrow might find him their slave or their companion in some marauding expedition which might make him almost retrace his steps to the caucasus or to hamadan the temptation to ensure his freedom was irresistible he clambered up the ruined wall descended into the intricate windings that led to the ionic fane that served him as a beacon hurried through the silent and starry streets gained the great portal and rushed once more into the desert  a vague fear of pursuit made him continue his course many hours without resting the desert again became sandy the heat increased the breeze that plays about the wilderness and in early spring is often scented with the wild fragrance of aromatic plants sank away a lurid brightness suffused the heavens an appalling stillness pervaded nature even the insects were silent for the first time in his pilgrimage a feeling of deep despondency fell over the soul of alroy his energy appeared suddenly to have deserted him a low hot wind began to rise and fan his cheek with pestiferous kisses and enervate his frame with its poisonous embrace his head and limbs ached with a dull sensation more terrible than pain his sight was dizzy his tongue swollen vainly he looked around for aid vainly he extended his forlorn arms and wrung them to the remorseless heaven almost frantic with thirst the boundless horizon of the desert disappeared and the unhappy victim in the midst of his torture found himself apparently surrounded by bright and running streams the fleeting waters of the false mirage  the sun became bloodred the sky darker the sand rose in fierce eddies the moaning wind burst into shrieks and exhaled more ardent and still more malignant breath the pilgrim could no longer sustain himself15 faith courage devotion deserted him with his failing energies he strove no longer with his destiny he delivered himself up to despair and death he fell upon one knee with drooping head supporting himself by one quivering hand and then full of the anguish of baffled purposes and lost affections raising his face and arm to heaven thus to the elements he poured his passionate farewell  o life once vainly deemed a gloomy toil i feel thy sweetness now farewell o life farewell my high resolves and proud conviction of almighty fame my days my short unprofitable days melt into the past and death with which i struggle horrible death arrests me in this wilderness o my sister could thy voice but murmur in my ear one single sigh of love could thine eye with its soft radiance but an instant blend with my dim fading vision the pang were nothing farewell miriam my heart is with thee by thy fountains side fatal blast bear her my dying words my blessing and ye too friends whose too neglected love i think of now farewell farewell my uncle farewell pleasant home and hamadans serene and shadowy bowers farewell jabaster and the mighty lore of which thou wert the priest and i the pupil thy talisman throbs on my faithful heart green earth and golden sun and all the beautiful and glorious sights ye fondly lavish on unthinking man farewell farewell i die in the desert tis bitter no more oh never more for me the hopeful day shall break and the fresh breeze rise on its cheering wings of health and joy heaven and earth water and air my chosen country and my antique creed farewell farewell and thou too city of my soul i cannot name thee unseen jerusalem  amid the roar of the wind the bosom of the earth heaved and opened swift columns of sand sprang up to the lurid sky and hurried towards their victim with the clang of universal chaos impenetrable darkness descended on the desert     chapter v       lord honain rescues alroy  now our dreary way is over now the deserts toil is

beast and he will pass the corpse  the prophet preaches charity abdallah he has favoured my enterprise and i will practise his precept see if he be utterly dead  it was the mecca caravan returning to bagdad the pilgrims were within a days journey of the euphrates and welcomed their approach to fertile earth with a triumphant chorus far as the eye could reach the long line of their straggling procession stretched across the wilderness thousands of camels in strings laden with bales of merchandise and each company headed by an animal of superior size leading with tinkling bells groups of horsemen clusters of litters all the pilgrims armed to their teeth the van formed by a strong division of seljukian cavalry and the rear protected by a kourdish clan who guaranteed the security of the pious travellers through their country  abdallah was the favourite slave of the charitable merchant ali in obedience to his masters orders he unwillingly descended from his camel and examined the body of the apparently lifeless alroy  a kourd by his dress exclaimed abdallah with a sneer what does he here  it is not the face of a kourd replied ali perchance a pilgrim from the mountains  whatever he be he is dead answered the slave i doubt not an accursed giaour  god is great exclaimed ali he breathes the breast of his caftan heaved  twas the wind said abdallah  twas the sigh of a human heart answered ali  several pilgrims who were on foot now gathered around the group  i am a hakim17 observed a dignified armenian i will feel his pulse tis dull but it beats  there is but one god exclaimed ali  and mahomed is his prophet responded abdallah you do not believe in him you armenian infidel  i am a hakim replied the dignified armenian although an infidel god has granted me skill to cure true believers worthy ali believe me the boy may yet live  hakim you shall count your own dirhems if he breathe in my divan in bagdad answered ali i have taken a fancy to the boy god has sent him to me he shall carry my slippers  give me a camel and i will save his life  we have none said the servant  walk abdallah said the master  is a true believer to walk to save the life of a kourd master slipperbearer shall answer for this if there be any sweetness in the bastinado murmured abdallah  the armenian bled alroy the blood flowed slowly but surely the prince of the captivity opened his eyes  there is but one god exclaimed ali  the evil eye fall on him muttered abdallah  the armenian took a cordial from his vest and poured it down his patients throat the blood flowed more freely  he will live worthy merchant said the physician  and mahomed is his prophet continued ali  by the stone of mecca i believe it is a jew shouted abdallah  the dog exclaimed ali  pah said a negro slave drawing back with disgust  he will die said the christian physician not even binding up the vein  and be damned said abdallah again jumping on his camel  the party rode on the caravan proceeded a kourdish horseman galloped forward he curbed his steed as he passed alroy bleeding to death  what accursed slave has wounded one of my clan  the kourd leaped off his horse stripped off a slip of his blue shirt stanched the wound and carried the unhappy alroy to the rear  the desert ceased the caravan entered upon a vast but fruitful plain in the extreme distance might be descried a long undulating line of palmtrees the vanguard gave a shout shook their tall lances in the air and rattled their scimitars in rude chorus against their small round iron shields all eyes sparkled all hands were raised all voices sounded save those that were breathless from overpowering joy after months wandering in the sultry wilderness they beheld the great euphrates  broad and fresh magnificent and serene the mighty waters rolled through the beautiful and fertile earth a vital breeze rose from their bosom every being responded to their genial influence the sick were cured the desponding became sanguine the healthy and lighthearted broke into shouts of laughter jumped from their camels and embraced the fragrant earth or wild in their renovated strength galloped over the plain and threw their wanton jerreeds in the air18 as if to show that suffering and labour had not deprived them of that skill and strength without which it were vain again to enter the haunts of their less adventurous brethren  the caravan halted on the banks of the broad river glowing in the cool sunset the camp was pitched the plain glittered with tents the camels falling on their knees crouched in groups the merchandise piled up in masses by their sides the unharnessed horses rushed neighing about the plain tossing their glad heads and rolling in the unaccustomed pasture spreading their mats and kneeling towards mecca the pilgrims performed their evening orisons never was thanksgiving more sincere they arose some rushed into the river some lighted lamps some pounded coffee19 troops of smiling villagers arrived with fresh provisions eager to prey upon such light hearts and heavy purses it was one of those occasions when the accustomed gravity of the orient disappears long through the night the sounds of music and the shouts of laughter were heard on the banks of that starry river long through the night you might have listened with enchantment to the wild tales of the storier or gazed with fascination on the wilder gestures of the dancing girls20  the great bazaar of bagdad afforded an animated and sumptuous spectacle on the day after the arrival of the caravan all the rare and costly products of the world were collected in that celebrated mart the shawls of cachemire and the silks of syria the ivory and plumes and gold of afric the jewels of ind the talismans of egypt the perfumes and manuscripts of persia the spices and gums of araby beautiful horses more beautiful slaves cloaks of sable pelisses of ermine armour alike magnificent in ornament and temper rare animals still rarer birds blue apes in silver collars white gazelles bound by a golden chain greyhounds peacocks paroquets and everywhere strange and busy and excited groups men of all nations creeds and climes the sumptuous and haughty turk the graceful and subtle arab the hebrew with his black cap and anxious countenance the armenian christian with his dark flowing robes and mild demeanour and serene visage here strutted the lively affected and superfine persian and there the circassian stalked with his long hair and chain cuirass the fair georgian jostled the ebony form of the merchant of dongola or sennaar  through the long narrow arched and winding streets of the bazaar lined on each side with loaded stalls all was bustle bargaining and barter a passenger approached apparently of no common rank two pages preceded him beautiful georgian boys clothed in crimson cloth and caps of the same material sitting tight to their heads with long golden tassels one bore a blue velvet bag and the other a clasped and richly bound volume four footmen armed followed their master who rode behind the pages on a milkwhite mule he was a man of middle age eminently handsome his ample robes concealed the only fault in his appearance a figure which indulgence had rendered somewhat too exuberant his eyes were large and soft and dark his nose aquiline but delicately moulded his mouth small and beautifully proportioned his lip full and red his teeth regular and dazzling white his ebony beard flowed but not at too great a length in graceful and natural curls and was richly perfumed a delicate mustachio shaded his upper lip but no whisker was permitted to screen the form and shroud the lustre of his oval countenance and brilliant complexion altogether the animal perhaps predominated too much in the expression of the strangers countenance but genius beamed from his passionate eye and craft lay concealed in that subtle lip the dress of the rider was sumptuous his turban formed by a scarlet cachemire shawl was of great breadth and concealing half of his white forehead increased by the contrast the radiant height of the other his undervest was of white damascus silk stiff with silver embroidery and confined by a girdle formed by a brusa scarf of gold stuff and holding a dagger whose hilt appeared blazing with brilliants and rubies his loose and exterior robe was of crimson cloth his white hands sparkled with rings and his ears glittered with pendulous gems  who is this asked an egyptian merchant in a low whisper of the dealer whose stuffs he was examining  tis the lord honain replied the dealer and who may he be continued the egyptian is he the caliphs son  a much greater man his physician the white mule stopped at the very stall where this conversation was taking place the pages halted and stood on each side of their master the footmen kept off the crowd  merchant said honain with a gracious smile of condescension and with a voice musical as a flute merchant did you obtain me my wish  there is but one god replied the dealer who was the charitable ali and mahomed is his prophet i succeeded please your highness in seeing at aleppo the accursed giaour of whom i spoke and behold that which you desired is here so saying ali produced several greek manuscripts and offered them to his visitor  hah said honain with a sparkling eye tis well their cost  the infidel would not part with them under five hundred dirhems replied ali  ibrahim see that this worthy merchant receive a thousand  as many thanks my lord honain  the caliphs physician bowed gracefully  advance pages continued honain why this stoppage ibrahim see that our way be cleared what is all this  a crowd of men advanced pulling along a youth who almost exhausted still singly struggled with his ungenerous adversaries  the cadi the cadi cried the foremost of them who was abdallah drag him to the cadi  noble lord cried the youth extricating himself by a sudden struggle from the grasp of his captors and seizing the robe of honain i am innocent and injured i pray thy help  the cadi the cadi exclaimed abdallah the knave has stolen my ring the ring given me by my faithful fatima on our marriageday and which i would not part with for my masters stores  the youth still clung to the robe of honain and mute from exhaustion fixed upon him his beautiful and imploring eye  silence proclaimed honain i will judge this cause  the lord honain the lord honain listen to the lord honain  speak thou brawler of what hast thou to complain said honain to abdallah  may it please your highness said abdallah in a whining voice i am the slave of your faithful servant ali often have i had the honour of waiting on your highness this young knave here a beggar has robbed me while slumbering in a coffeehouse of a ring i have my witnesses to prove my slumbering tis a fine emerald may it please your highness and doubly valuable to me as a lovetoken from my fatima no consideration in the world could induce me to part with it and so being asleep here are three honest men who will prove the sleep comes this little vagabond may it please your highness who while he pretends to offer me my coffee takes him my finger and slips off this precious ring which he now wears upon his beggarly paw and will not restore to me without the bastinado  abdallah is a faithful slave may it please your highness and a hadgee said ali his master  and what sayest thou boy inquired honain  that this is a false knave who lies as slaves ever will  pithy and perhaps true said honain  you call me a slave you young scoundrel exclaimed abdallah shall i tell you what you are why your highness do not listen to him a moment it is a shame to bring such a creature into your presence for by the holy stone and i am a hadgee i doubt little he is a jew  honain grew somewhat pale and bit his lip he was perhaps annoyed that he had interfered so publicly in behalf of so unpopular a character as a hebrew but he was unwilling to desert one whom a moment before he had resolved to befriend and he inquired of the youth where he had obtained the ring  the ring was given to me by my dearest friend when i first set out upon an arduous pilgrimage not yet completed there is but one person in the world except the donor to whom i would part with it and with that person i am unacquainted all this may seem improbable but all this is true i have truth alone to support me i am destitute and friendless but i am not a beggar nor will any suffering induce me to become one feeling from various circumstances utterly exhausted i entered a coffeehouse and lay down it may have been to die i could not sleep although my eyes were shut and nothing would have roused me from a tremulous trance which i thought was dying but this plunderer here who would not wait until death had permitted him quietly to possess himself of a jewel i value more than life  show me the jewel  the youth held up his hand to honain who felt his pulse and then took off the ring  o my fatima exclaimed abdallah  silence sir said honain page call a jeweller  honain examined the ring attentively whether he were nearsighted or whether the deceptive light of the covered bazaar prevented him from examining it with ease he certainly raised his hand to his brow and for some moments his countenance was invisible  the jeweller arrived and pressing his hand to his heart bowed before honain  value this ring said honain in a low voice  the jeweller took the ring viewed it in all directions with a scrutinising glance held it to the light pressed it to his tongue turned it over and over and finally declared that he could not sell such a ring under a thousand dirhems  whatever be the justice of the case said honain to abdallah art thou ready to part with this ring for a thousand dirhems  most certainly said abdallah and thou lad if the decision be in thy favour wilt thou take for the ring double the worth at which the jeweller prizes it  my lord i have spoken the truth i cannot part with that ring for the palace of the caliph  the truth for once is triumphant said honain boy the ring is thine and for thee thou knave turning to abdallah liar thief and slandererfor thee the bastinado21 which thou destinedst for this innocent youth ibrahim see that he receives five hundred young pilgrim thou art no longer destitute or friendless follow me to my palace  the arched chamber was of great size and beautiful proportion the ceiling encrusted with green fretwork and studded with silver stars rested upon clustered columns of white and green marble in the centre of a variegated pavement of the same material a fountain rose and fell into a green porphyry basin and by the side of the fountain upon a couch of silver reposed honain  he raised his eyes from the illuminated volume on which he had been long intent he clapped his hands and a nubian slave advanced and folding his arms upon his breast bowed in silence before his lord how fares the hebrew boy analschar  master the fever has not returned we gave him the potion he slumbered for many hours and has now awakened weak but well  let him rise and attend me  the nubian disappeared  there is nothing stranger than sympathy soliloquised the physician of the caliph with a meditative air all resolves itself into this principle and i confess this learned doctor treats it deeply and well an erudite spirit truly and an eloquent pen yet he refines too much tis too scholastic observation will teach us more than dogma meditating upon my passionate youth i gathered wisdom i have seen so much that i have ceased to wonder however we doubt there is a mystery beyond our penetration and yet tis near our grasp i sometimes deem a step a single step would launch us into light here comes my patient the rose has left his cheek and his deep brow is wan and melancholy yet tis a glorious visage meditations throne and passion lingers in that languid eye i know not why a strong attraction draws me to this lone child  gentle stranger how fares it with thee  very well my lord i come to thank thee for all thy goodness my only thanks are words and those too weak and yet the orphans blessing is a treasure  you are an orphan then  i have no parent but my fathers god  and that god is  the god of israel  so i deemed he is a deity we all must honour if he be the great creator whom we all allow  he is what he is and we are what we are a fallen people but faithful still  fidelity is strength  thy words are truth and strength must triumph  a prophecy  many a prophet is little honoured till the future proves his inspiration  you are young and sanguine  so was my ancestor within the vale of elah but i speak unto a moslem and this is foolishness  i have read something and can take your drift as for my faith i believe in truth and wish all men to do the same bythebye might i inquire the name of him who is the inmate of my house  they call me david  david you have a ring an emerald cut with curious characters hebrew i believe  tis here  a fine stone and this inscription means  a simple legend parted but one the kind memorial of a brothers love  your brother  i never had a brother  i have a silly fancy for this ring you hesitate search my palace and choose the treasure you deem its match  noble sir the gem is little worth but were it such might deck a caliphs brow twere a poor recompense for all thy goodness this ring is a trust rather than a possession and strange to say although i cannot offer it to thee who mayst command as thou hast saved the life of its unhappy wearer some stranger may cross my path tomorrow and almost claim it as his own  and that stranger is  the brother of the donor  the brother of jabaster  jabaster  even so i am that parted brother  great is the god of israel take the ring but what is this the brother of jabaster a turbaned chieftain a moslem say but say that thou hast not assumed their base belief say but say that thou hast not become a traitor to our covenant and i will bless the fortunes of this hour  i am false to no god calm thyself sweet youth these are higher questions than thy faint strength can master now another time well talk of this my boy at present of my brother and thyself he lives and prospers  he lives in faith the pious ever prosper  a glorious dreamer though our moods are different i ever loved him and thyself thou art not what thou seemest tell me all jabasters friend can be no common mind thy form has heralded thy fame trust me  i am alroy  what the prince of our captivity  even so  the slayer of alschiroch  ay  my sympathy was prophetic i loved thee from the first and what dost thou here a price is set upon thy head thou knowest it  for the first time but i am neither astonished nor alarmed i am upon the lords business  what wouldst thou  free his people  the pupil of jabaster i see it all another victim to his reveries ill save this boy davidfor thy name must not be sounded within this citythe sun is dying let us to the terrace and seek the solace of the twilight breeze  what is the hour david  near to midnight i marvel if thy brother may read in the stars our happy meeting  men read that which they wish he is a learned cabalist  but what we wish comes from above  so they say we make our fortunes and we call them fate  yet the voice sounded the daughter of the voice that summoned samuel  you have told me strange things i have heard stranger solved  my faith is a rock  on which you may split  art thou a sadducee  i am a man who knows men  you are learned but different from jabaster  we are the same though different day and night are both portions of time  and thy portion is  truth  that is light  yes so dazzling that it sometimes seems dark  like thy meaning  you are young  is youth a defect  no the reverse but we cannot eat the fruit while the tree is in blossom  what fruit  knowledge  i have studied  what  all sacred things  how know you that they are sacred  they come from god  so does everything is everything sacred  they are the deep expression of his will  according to jabaster ask the man who prays in yonder mosque and he will tell you that jabasters wrong  after all thou art a moslem  no  what then  i have told you a man  but what dost thou worship  what is worship  adoration due from the creature to the creator  which is he  our god  the god of israel  even so  a frail minority then burn incense to him  we are the chosen people  chosen for scoffs and scorns and contumelies commend me to such choice  we forgot him before he chastened us  why did we  thou knowest the records of our holy race  yes i know them like all records annals of blood  annals of victory that will dawn again  if redemption be but another name for carnage i envy no messiah  art thou jabasters brother so our mother was wont to say a meek and blessed woman  lord honain thou art rich and wise and powerful thy fellowmen speak of thee only with praise or fear and both are cheering thou hast quitted our antique ark why no matter well not discuss it tis something if a stranger at least thou art not a renegade the world goes well with thee my lord honain but if instead of bows and blessings thou like thy brethren wert greeted only with the cuff and curse if thou didst rise each morning only to feel existence to be dishonour and to find thyself marked out among surrounding men as something foul and fatal if it were thy lot like theirs at best to drag on a mean and dull career hopeless and aimless or with no other hope or aim but that which is degrading and all this too with a keen sense of thy intrinsic worth and a deep conviction of superior race why then perchance honain might even discover twere worth a struggle to be free and honoured i pray your pardon sir i thought you were jabasters pupil a dreaming student i see you have a deep ambition  i am a prince and i fain would be a prince without my fetters  listen to me alroy said honain in a low voice and he placed his arm around him i am your friend our acquaintance is very brief no matter i love you i rescued you in injury i tended you in sickness even now your life is in my power i would protect it with my own you cannot doubt me our affections are not under our own control and mine are yours the sympathy between us is entire you see me you see what i am a hebrew though unknown one of that despised rejected persecuted people of whom you are the chief i too would be free and honoured freedom and honour are mine but i was my own messiah i quitted in good time our desperate cause but i gave it a trial ask jabaster how i fought youth could be my only excuse for such indiscretion i left this country i studied and resided among the greeks i returned from constantinople with all their learning some of their craft no one knew me i assumed their turban and i am the lord honain take my experience child and save yourself much sorrow turn your late adventure to good account no one can recognise you here i will introduce you amongst the highest as my child by some fair greek the world is before you you may fight you may love you may revel war and women and luxury are all at your command with your person and talents you may be grand vizir clear your head of nonsense in the present disordered state of the empire you may even carve yourself out a kingdom infinitely more delightful than the barren land of milk and honey i have seen it child a rocky wilderness where i would not let my courser graze  he bent down and fixed his eyes upon his companion with a scrutinising glance the moonlight fell upon the resolved visage of the prince of the captivity  honain he replied pressing his hand i thank thee thou knowest not me but still i thank thee  you are resolved then on destruction  on glory eternal glory  is it possible to succeed  is it possible to fail  you are mad  i am a believer  enough you have yet one chance my brother has saddled your enterprise with a condition and an impossible one gain the sceptre of solomon and i will agree to be your subject you will waste a year in this frolic you are young and can afford it i trust you will experience nothing worse than a loss of time which is however valuable my duty will be after all your sufferings to send you forth on your adventures in good condition and to provide you means for a less toilsome pilgrimage than has hitherto been your lot trust me you will return to bagdad to accept my offers at present the dews are descending and we will return to our divan and take some coffee  some few days after this conversation on the terrace as alroy was reclining in a bower in the beautiful garden of his host meditating on the future some one touched him on the back he looked up it was honain  follow me said the brother of jabaster  the prince rose and followed him in silence they entered the house and passing through the saloon already described they proceeded down a long gallery which terminated in an arched flight of broad steps leading to the river a boat was fastened to the end of the stairs floating on the blue line of the tigris bright in the sun  honain now gave to alroy a velvet bag which he requested him to carry and then they descended the steps and entered the covered boat and without any directions to the rower they were soon skimming over the water by the sound of passing vessels and the occasional shouts of the boatmen alroy although he could observe nothing was conscious that for some time their course lay through a principal thoroughfare of the city but by degrees the sounds became less frequent and in time entirely died away and all that caught his ear was the regular and monotonous stroke of their own oar  at length after the lapse of nearly an hour from their entrance the boat stopped and was moored against a quay the curtains were withdrawn and honain and his companion debarked  a low but extensive building painted in white and gold arabesque and irregular but picturesque in form with many small domes and tall thin towers rose amid groves of cypress on the bank of the broad and silent river the rapid stream had carried them far from the city which was visible but distant around was no habitation no human being the opposite bank was occupied by enclosed gardens not even a boat passed  honain beckoning to alroy to accompany him but still silent advanced to a small portal and knocked it was instantly opened by a single nubian who bowed reverently as the visitors passed him they proceeded along a low and gloomy passage covered with arches of fretwork until they arrived at a door of tortoiseshell and motherofpearl22 here honain who was in advance turned round to alroy and said whatever happen and whoever may address you as you value your life and mine do not speak  the door opened and they found themselves in a vast and gorgeous hall pillars of manycoloured marbles rose from a red and blue pavement of the same material and supported a vaulted circular and highlyembossed roof of purple scarlet and gold23 around a fountain which rose fifty feet in height from an immense basin of lapislazuli and reclining on small yellow barbary mats was a group of nubian eunuchs dressed in rich habits of scarlet and gold24 and armed with ivory battleaxes the white handles worked in precious arabesque finely contrasting with the blue and brilliant blades  the commander of the eunuchguard rose on seeing honain and pressing his hand to his head mouth and heart saluted him the physician of the caliph motioning alroy to remain advanced some paces in front of him and entered into a whispering conversation with the eunuch after a few minutes this officer resumed his seat and honain beckoning to alroy to rejoin him crossed the hall  passing through an open arch they entered a quadrangular court of roses25 each bed of flowers surrounded by a stream of sparkling water and floating like an enchanted islet upon a fairy ocean the sound of the water and the sweetness of the flowers blended together and produced a lulling sensation which nothing but his strong and strange curiosity might have enabled alroy to resist proceeding along a cloister of light airy workmanship which connected the hall with the remainder of the buildings they stood before a lofty and sumptuous portal  it was a monolith gate thirty feet in height formed of one block of green and red jasper and cut into the fanciful undulating arch of the saracens the consummate artist had seized the advantage afforded to him by the ruddy veins of the precious stone and had formed them in bold relief into two vast and sinuous serpents which shot forth their crested heads and glittering eyes at honain and his companion  the physician of the caliph taking his dagger from his girdle struck the head of one of the serpents thrice the massy portal opened with a whirl and a roar and before them stood an abyssinian giant26 holding in his leash a roaring lion  hush haroun said honain to the animal raising at the same time his arm and the beast crouched in silence worthy morgargon i bring you a remembrance the abyssinian showed his tusks larger and whiter than the lions as he grinningly received the tribute of the courtly honain and he uttered a few uncouth sounds but he could not speak for he was a mute  the jasper portal introduced the companions to a long and lofty and arched chamber lighted by high windows of stained glass hung with tapestry of silk and silver covered with prodigious carpets and surrounded by immense couches and thus through similar chambers they proceeded in some of which were signs of recent habitation until they arrived at another quadrangle nearly filled by a most singular fountain which rose from a basin of gold encrusted with pearls and which was surrounded by figures of every rare quadruped27 in the most costly materials here a golden tiger with flaming eyes of ruby and flowing stripes of opal stole after some bloody banquet to the refreshing brink a camelopard raised its slender neck of silver from the centre of a group of every inhabitant of the forest and brilliant bands of monkeys glittering with precious stones rested in every variety of fantastic posture on the margin of the basin  the fountain itself was a tree of gold and silver28 spreading into innumerable branches covered with every variety of curious birds their plumage appropriately imitated by the corresponding tints of precious stones which warbled in beautiful melody as they poured forth from their bills the musical and refreshing element  it was with difficulty that alroy could refrain from an admiring exclamation but honain ever quick turned to him with his finger pressed on his mouth and quitting the quadrangle they entered the gardens  lofty terraces dark masses of cypress winding walks of acacia in the distance an interminable paradise and here and there a glittering pavilion and bright kiosk its appearance on the river had not prepared alroy for the extent of the palace itself it seemed infinite and it was evident that he had only viewed a small portion of it while they were moving on there suddenly rose a sound of trumpets the sound grew nearer and nearer louder and louder soon was heard the tramp of an approaching troop honain drew alroy aside a procession appeared advancing from a dark grove of cypress four hundred men led as many white bloodhounds with collars of gold and rubies29 then came one hundred men each with a hooded hawk then six horsemen in rich dresses after them a single horseman mounted on a steed marked on its forehead with a star30 the rider was middleaged handsome and dignified he was plainly dressed but the staff of his huntingspear was entirely of diamonds and the blade of gold  he was followed by a company of nubian eunuchs with their scarlet dresses and ivory battleaxes and the procession closed  the caliph whispered honain when they had passed placing at the same time his finger on his lip to prevent any inquiry this was the first intimation that had reached alroy of what he had already suspected that he was a visitor to the palace of the commander of the faithful  the companions turned down a wild and winding walk which after some time brought them to a small and gently sloping lawn surrounded by cedartrees of great size upon the lawn was a kiosk a long and manywindowed building covered with blinds and further screened by an overhanging roof the kiosk was built of white and green marble the ascent to it was by a flight of steps the length of the building alternately of white and green marble and nearly covered with rosetrees honain went up these steps alone and entered the kiosk after a few minutes he looked out from the blinds and beckoned to alroy david advanced but honain fearful of some indiscretion met him and said to him in a low whisper between his teeth remember you are deaf a mute and a eunuch alroy could scarcely refrain from smiling and the prince of the captivity and the physician of the caliph entered the kiosk together two women veiled and two eunuchs of the guard received them in an antechamber and then they passed into a room which ran nearly the whole length of the kiosk opening on one side to the gardens and on the other supported by an ivory wall with niches painted in green fresco and in each niche a rosetree each niche also was covered with an almost invisible golden grate which confined a nightingale and made him constant to the rose he loved at the foot of each niche was a fountain but instead of water each basin was replenished with the purest quicksilver31 the roof of the kiosk was of motherofpearl inlaid with tortoiseshell the pavement a mosaic of rare marbles and precious stones representing the most delicious fruits and the most beautiful flowers over this pavement a georgian page flung at intervals refreshing perfumes at the end of this elegant chamber was a divan of light green silk embroidered with pearls and covered with cushions of white satin and gold upon one of these cushions in the middle of the divan sat a lady her eyes fixed in abstraction upon a volume of persian poetry lying on her knees one hand playing with a rosary of pearls and emeralds32 and the other holding a long gold chain which imprisoned a white gazelle  the lady looked up as honain and his companion entered she was very young as youthful as alroy her long light brown hair drawn off a high white forehead covered with blue veins fell braided with pearls over each shoulder her eyes were large and deeply blue her nose small but high and aquiline the fairness of her face was dazzling and when she looked up and greeted honain her lustrous cheeks broke into dimples the more fascinating from their contrast with the general expression of her countenance which was haughty and derisive the lady was dressed in a robe of crimson silk girded round her waist by a green shawl from which peeped forth the diamond hilt of a small poniard33 her round white arms looked infinitely small as they occasionally flashed forth from their large loose hanging sleeves one was covered with jewels and the right arm was quite bare  honain advanced and bending kissed the ladys proffered hand alroy fell into the background  they told me that the rose of the world drooped this morning said the physician bending again as he smiled and her slave hastened at her command to tend her  it was a south wind the wind has changed and the rose of the world is better replied the lady laughing  honain touched her pulse  irregular said the physician  like myself said the lady is that a new slave  a recent purchase and a great bargain he is goodlooking has the advantage of being deaf and dumb and is harmless in every respect  tis a pity replied the lady it seems that all goodlooking people are born to be useless i for instance  yet rumour whispers the reverse remarked the physician  how so inquired the lady  the young king of karasmé  poh i have made up my mind to detest him a barbarian  a hero  have you ever seen him  i have  handsome  an archangel  and sumptuous  is he not a conqueror all the plunder of the world will be yours  i am tired of magnificence i built this kiosk to forget it  it is not in the least degree splendid said honain looking round with a smile  no answered the lady with a selfsatisfied air here at least one can forget one has the misfortune to be a princess  it is certainly a great misfortune said the physician  and yet it must be the only tolerable lot replied the lady  assuredly replied honain  for our unhappy sex at least  very unhappy  if i were only a man  what a hero you would be  i should like to live in endless confusion  i have not the least doubt of it  have you got me the books eagerly inquired the princess  my slave bears them replied honain  let me see them directly  honain took the bag from alroy and unfolded its contents the very volumes of greek romances which ali the merchant had obtained for him  i am tired of poetry said the princess glancing over the costly volumes and tossing them away i long to see the world  you would soon be tired of that replied the physician  i suppose common people are never tired said the princess  except with labour said the physician care keeps them alive  what is care asked the princess with a smile  it is a god replied the physician invisible but omnipotent it steals the bloom from the cheek and lightness from the pulse it takes away the appetite and turns the hair grey  it is no true divinity then replied the princess but an idol we make ourselves i am a sincere moslem and will not worship it tell me some news honain  the young king of karasmé  again the barbarian you are in his pay ill none of him to leave one prison and to be shut up in anotherwhy do you remind me of it no my dear hakim if i marry at all i will marry to be free  an impossibility said honain  my mother was free till she was a queen and a slave i intend to end as she began you know what she was  honain knew well but he was too politic not to affect ignorance  the daughter of a bandit continued the princess who fought by the side of her father that is existence i must be a robber tis in the blood i want my fate foretold honain you are an astrologer do it  i have already cast your nativity your star is à comet  that augurs well brilliant confusion and erratic splendour i wish i were a star added the princess in a deep rich voice and with a pensive air a star in the clear blue sky beautiful and free honain honain the gazelle has broken her chain and is eating my roses  alroy rushed forward and seized the graceful truant honain shot him an anxious look the princess received the chain from the hand of alroy and cast at him a scrutinising glance  what splendid eyes the poor beast has got exclaimed the princess  the gazelle inquired the physician  no your slave replied the princess why he blushes were he not deaf as well as dumb i could almost believe he understood me  he is modest replied honain rather alarmed and is frightened at the liberty he has taken  i like modesty said the princess it is interesting i am modest you think so  certainly said honain  and interesting  very  i detest an interesting person after all there is nothing like plain dulness  nothing said honain  the day flows on so serenely in such society  it does said honain  no confusion no scenes  none  i make it a rule only to have ugly slaves  you are quite right  honain will you ever contradict me you know very well i have the handsomest slaves in the world  every one knows it  and do you know i have taken a great fancy to your new purchase who according to your account is eminently qualified for the post why do you not agree with me  why yes i doubt not your highness would find him eminently qualified and certainly few things would give me greater pleasure than offering him for your acceptance but i got into such disgrace by that late affair of the circassian that  oh leave it to me said the princess  certainly said the physician turning the conversation and when the young king of karasmé arrives at bagdad you can offer him to his majesty as a present  delightful and the king is really handsome and young as well as brave but has he any taste  you have enough for both  if he would but make war against the greeks  why so violent against the poor greeks  you know they are giaours besides they might beat him and then i should have the pleasure of being taken prisoner  delightful  charming to see constantinople and marry the emperor  marry the emperor  to be sure of course he would fall in love with me  of course  and then and then i might conquer paris  paris  you have been at paris34  yes  the men are shut up there said the princess with a smile are they not and the women do what they like  you will always do what you like said honain rising  you are going  my visits must not be too long  farewell dear honain said the princess with a melancholy air you are the only person who has an idea in all bagdad and you leave me a miserable lot is mine to feel everything and be nothing these books and flowers these sweet birds and this fair gazelle ah poets may feign as they please but how cheerfully would i resign all these elegant consolations of a captive life for one hour of freedom i wrote some verses on myself yesterday take them and get them blazoned for me by the finest scribe in the city letters of silver on a violet ground with a fine flowing border i leave the design to you adieu come hither mute alroy advanced to her beckon and knelt there take that rosary for thy masters sake and those dark eyes of thine  the companions withdrew and reached their boat in silence it was sunset the musical and sonorous voice of the muezzin resounded from the innumerable minarets of the splendid city honain threw back the curtains of the barque bagdad rose before them in huge masses of sumptuous dwellings seated amid groves and gardens an infinite population summoned by the invigorating twilight poured forth in all directions the glowing river was covered with sparkling caiques the glittering terraces with showy groups splendour and power and luxury and beauty were arrayed before them in their most captivating forms and the heart of alroy responded to their magnificence a glorious vision said the prince of the captivity  very different from hamadan said the physician of the caliph  today i have seen wonders said alroy  the world is opening to you said honain  alroy did not reply but after some minutes he said in a hesitating voice who was that lady  the princess schirene replied honain the favourite daughter of the caliph her mother was a georgian and a giaour  the moonlight fell upon the figure of alroy lying on a couch his face was hidden by his arm he was motionless but did not sleep  he rose and paced the chamber with agitated steps sometimes he stopped and gazed on the pavement fixed in abstraction he advanced to the window and cooled his feverish brow in the midnight air  an hour passed away and the young prince of the captivity remained fixed in the same position suddenly he turned to a tripod of porphyry and seizing a rosary of jewels pressed it to his lips  the spirit of my dreams she comes at last the form for which i have sighed and wept the form which rose upon my radiant vision when i shut my eyes against the jarring shadows of this gloomy world  schirene schirene here in this solitude i pour to thee the passion long stored up the passion of my life no common life a life full of deep feeling and creative thought o beautiful o more than beautiful for thou to me art as a dream unbroken why art thou not mine why lose a moment in our glorious lives and balk our destiny of half its bliss  fool fool hast thou forgotten the rapture of a prisoner in his cell whose wild fancy for a moment belies his fetters the daughter of the caliph and a jew  give me my fathers sceptre  a plague on talismans oh i need no inspiration but her memory no magic but her name by heavens i will enter this glorious city a conqueror or die  why what is life for meditation mingles ever with my passion why what is life throw accidents to the dogs and tear off the painted mask of false society here am i a hero with a mind that can devise all things and a heart of superhuman daring with youth with vigour with a glorious lineage with a form that has made full many a lovely maiden of our tribe droop her fair head by hamadans sweet fount and i amnothing  out on society twas not made for me ill form my own and be the deity i sometimes feel  we make our fortunes and we call them fate thou saidst well honain most subtle sadducee the saintly blood flowed in my fathers veins and they did nothing but i have an arm formed to wield a sceptre and i will win one  i cannot doubt my triumph triumph is a part of my existence i am born for glory as a tree is born to bear its fruit or to expand its flowers the deed is done tis thought of and tis done i will confront the greatest of my diademed ancestors and in his tomb mighty solomon he wedded pharaohs daughter hah what a future dawns upon my hope an omen a choice omen  heaven and earth are mingling to form my fortunes my mournful youth which i have so often cursed i hail thee thou wert a glorious preparation and when feeling no sympathy with the life around me i deemed myself a fool i find that i was a most peculiar being by heavens i am joyful for the first time in my life i am joyful i could laugh and fight and drink i am newborn i am another being i am mad  o time great time the world belies thy fame it calls thee swift methinks thou art wondrous slow fly on great time and on thy coming wings bear me my sceptre  all is to be it is a lowering thought my fancy like a bright and wearied bird will sometimes flag and fall and then i am lost the young king of karasmé a youthful hero would he had been alschiroch my heart is sick even at the very name alas my trials have not yet begun jabaster warned me good sincere jabaster his talisman presses on my frantic heart and seems to warn me i am in danger braggart to stand here filling the careless air with idle words while all is unaccomplished i grow dull the young king of karasmé why what am i compared to this same prince nothing but in my thoughts in the full bazaar they would not deem me worthy even to hold his stirrup or his slipper oh this contest this constant bitter neverending contest between my fortune and my fancy why do i exist or if existing why am i not recognised as i would be  sweet voice that in jabasters distant cave descendedst from thy holy home above and whispered consolation breathe again again breathe thy still summons to my lonely ear and chase away the thoughts that hover round me thoughts dark and doubtful like fell birds of prey hovering around a hero in expectation of his fall and gloating on their triumph over the brave there is something fatal in these crowded cities faith flourishes in solitude  he threw himself upon the couch and leaning down his head seemed lost in meditation he started up and seizing his tablets wrote upon them these words  honain i have been the whole night like david in the wilderness of ziph but by the aid of the lord i have conquered i fly from this dangerous city upon his business which i have too much neglected attempt not to discover me and accept my gratitude     chapter vi       the learned rabbi zimri  a scorching sun a blue and burning sky on every side lofty ranges of black and barren mountains dark ravines deep caverns unfathomable gorges a solitary being moved in the distance faint and toiling a pilgrim slowly clambered up the steep and stony track  the sultry hours moved on the pilgrim at length gained the summit of the mountain a small and rugged tableland strewn with huge masses of loose and heated rock all around was desolation no spring no herbage the bird and the insect were alike mute still it was the summit no loftier peaks frowned in the distance the pilgrim stopped and breathed with more facility and a faint smile played over his languid and solemn countenance  he rested a few minutes he took from his wallet some locusts and wild honey and a small skin of water his meal was short as well as simple an ardent desire to reach his place of destination before nightfall urged him to proceed he soon passed over the tableland and commenced the descent of the mountain a straggling olivetree occasionally appeared and then a group and soon the groups swelled into a grove his way wound through the grateful and unaccustomed shade he emerged from the grove and found that he had proceeded down more than half the side of the mountain it ended precipitously in a dark and narrow ravine formed on the other side by an opposite mountain the lofty steep of which was crested by a city gently rising on a gradual slope  nothing could be conceived more barren wild and terrible than the surrounding scenery unillumined by a single trace of culture the city stood like the last gladiator in an amphitheatre of desolation  it was surrounded by a lofty turreted wall of an architecture to which the pilgrim was unaccustomed gates with drawbridge and portcullis square towers and loopholes for the archer sentinels clothed in steel and shining in the sunset paced at regular intervals the cautious wall and on a lofty tower a standard waved a snowy standard with a red red cross  the prince of the captivity at length beheld the lost capital of his fathers35  a few months back and such a spectacle would have called forth all the latent passion of alroy but time and suffering and sharp experience had already somewhat curbed the fiery spirit of the hebrew prince he gazed upon jerusalem he beheld the city of david garrisoned by the puissant warriors of christendom and threatened by the innumerable armies of the crescent the two great divisions of the world seemed contending for a prize which he a lonely wanderer had crossed the desert to rescue  if his faith restrained him from doubting the possibility of his enterprise he was at least deeply conscious that the world was a very different existence from what he had fancied amid the gardens of hamadan and the rocks of caucasus and that if his purpose could be accomplished it could only be effected by one means calm perhaps somewhat depressed but full of pious humiliation and not deserted by holy hope he descended into the valley of jehoshaphat and so slaking his thirst at siloah and mounting the opposite height david alroy entered jerusalem by the gate of zion36  he had been instructed that the quarter allotted to his people was near this entrance he inquired the direction of the sentinel who did not condescend to answer him an old man in shabby robes who was passing beckoned to him  what want you friend inquired alroy  you were asking for the quarter of our people you must be à stranger indeed in jerusalem to suppose that a frank would speak to a jew you were lucky to get neither kicked nor cursed  kicked and cursed why these dogs  hush hush for the love of god said his new companion much alarmed have you lent money to their captain that you speak thus in jerusalem our people speak only in a whisper  no matter the cure is not by words where is our quarter  was the like ever seen why he speaks as if he were a frank i save him from having his head broken by a gauntlet and  my friend i am tired our quarter  whom may you want  the chief rabbi  you bear letters to him  what is that to you  hush hush you do not know what jerusalem is young man you must not think of going on in this way where do you come from  bagdad  bagdad jerusalem is not bagdad a turk is a brute but a christian is a demon  but our quarter our quarter  hush you want the chief rabbi  ay ay  rabbi zimri  it may be so i neither know nor care  neither knows nor cares this will never do you must not go on in this way at jerusalem you must not think of it  fellow i see thou art a miserable prattler show me our quarter and i will pay thee well or be off  be off art thou a hebrew to say be off to any one you come from bagdad i tell you what go back to bagdad you will never do for jerusalem  your grizzled beard protects you old fool i am a pilgrim just arrived wearied beyond expression and you keep me here listening to your flat talk  flat talk why what would you  lead me to the rabbi zimri if that be his name  if that be his name why every one knows rabbi zimri the chief rabbi of jerusalem the successor of aaron we have our temple yet say what they like a very learned doctor is rabbi zimri  wretched driveller i am ashamed to lose my patience with such a dotard  driveller dotard why who are you  one you cannot comprehend without another word lead me to your chief  chief you have not far to go i know no one of the nation who holds his head higher than i do here and they call me zimri  what the chief rabbi that very learned doctor  no less i thought you had heard of him  let us forget the past good zimri when great men play the incognito they must sometimes hear rough phrases it is the caliphs lot as well as yours i am glad to make the acquaintance of so great a doctor though young and roughly habited i have seen the world a little and may offer next sabbath in the synagogue more dirhems than you would perhaps suppose good and learned zimri i would be your guest  a very worshipful young man and he speaks low and soft now but it was lucky i was at hand good whats your name  david  a very honest name good david it was lucky i was at hand when you spoke to the sentinel though a jew speak to a frank and a sentinel too hah hah hah that is good how rabbi maimon will laugh faith it was very lucky now was not it  indeed most fortunate  well that is candid here this way tis not far we number few sir of our brethren here but a better time will come a better time will come  i think so this is your door  an humble one jerusalem is not bagdad but you are welcome  king pirgandicus37 entered them said rabbi maimon but no one since  and when did he live inquired alroy his reign is recorded in the talmud answered rabbi zimri but in the talmud there are no dates a long while ago asked alroy since the captivity answered rabbi maimon i doubt that said rabbi zimri or why should he be called king  was he of the house of david said alroy  without doubt said rabbi maimon he was one of our greatest kings and conquered julius caesar38  his kingdom was in the northernmost parts of africa said rabbi zimri and exists to this day if we could but find it  ay truly added rabbi maimon the sceptre has never departed out of judah and he rode always upon a white elephant  covered with cloth of gold added rabbi zimri and he visited the tombs of the kings39 inquired alroy  without doubt said rabbi maimon the whole account is in the talmud  and no one can now find them no one replied rabbi zimri but according to that learned doctor moses hallevy they are in a valley in the mountains of lebanon which was sealed up by the archangel michael  the illustrious doctor abarbanel of babylon said rabbi maimon gives one hundred and twenty reasons in his commentary on the gemara to prove that they sunk under the earth at the taking of the temple  no one reasons like abarbanel of babylon said rabbi zimri  the great rabbi akiba of pundebita has answered them all said rabbi maimon and holds that they were taken up to heaven  and which is right inquired rabbi zimri  neither said rabbi maimon  one hundred and twenty reasons are strong proof said rabbi zimri  the most learned and illustrious doctor aaron mendola of granada said rabbi maimon has shown that we must look for the tombs of the kings in the south of spain  all that mendola writes is worth attention said rabbi zimri  rabbi hillel40 of samaria is worth two mendolas any day said rabbi maimon  tis a most learned doctor said rabbi zimri and what thinks he  hillel proves that there are two tombs of the kings said rabbi maimon and that neither of them are the right ones  what a learned doctor exclaimed rabbi zimri  and very satisfactory remarked alroy  these are high subjects continued maimon his blear eyes twinkling with complacency your guest rabbi zimri must read the treatise of the learned shimei of damascus on effecting impossibilities  that is a work exclaimed zimri  i never slept for three nights after reading that work said rabbi maimon it contains twelve thousand five hundred and thirtyseven quotations from the pentateuch and not a single original observation  there were giants in those days said rabbi zimri we are children now  the first chapter makes equal sense read backward or forward continued rabbi maimon ichabod exclaimed rabbi zimri and the initial letter of every section is a cabalistical type of a king of judah  the temple will yet be built said rabbi zimri ay ay that is learning exclaimed rabbi maimon but what is the great treatise on effecting impossibilities to that profound admirable and  holy rabbi said a youthful reader of the synagogue who now entered the hour is at hand  you dont say so learned miamon i must to the synagogue i could sit here all day listening to you come david the people await us  zimri and alroy quitted the house and proceeded along the narrow hilly streets to the chief temple of the hebrews  it grieves the venerable maimon much that he cannot join us said rabbi zimri you have doubtless heard of him at bagdad a most learned doctor alroy bowed in silence  he bears his years well you would hardly believe that he was my master  i perceive that you inherit much of his erudition  you are kind if he have breathed one year rabbi maimon will be a hundred and ten next passover  i doubt it not  when he is gathered to his fathers a great light will be extinguished in israel you wanted to know something about the tombs of the kings i told you he was your man how full he was his mind sir is an egg  a somewhat ancient one i fear his guidance will hardly bring me the enviable fortune of king pirgandicus  between ourselves good david talking of king pirgandicus i cannot help fancying that the learned maimon made a slight mistake i hold pirgandicus was only a prince it was after the captivity and i know no authority for any of our rulers since the destruction assuming a higher title clearly a prince eh but though i would whisper it to no one but you i think our worthy friend grows a little old we should remember his years sir a hundred and ten next passover tis a great burden  ay with his learning added a very fearful burden indeed  you have been a week in jerusalem and have not yet visited our synagogue it is not of cedar and ivory but it is still a temple this way it is only a week that you have been here why you look another man i shall never forget our first meeting you did not know me that was good eh and when i told you i was the chief rabbi zimri how you changed you have quite regained your appetite ah tis pleasant to mix once more with our own people to the left so we must descend a little we hold our meetings in an ancient cemetery you have a finer temple i warrant me in bagdad jerusalem is not bagdad but this has its conveniences tis safe and we are not very rich nor wish to seem so  a long passage brought them to a number of small square low chambers41 leading into each other they were lighted by brass lamps placed at intervals in vacant niches that once held corpses and which were now soiled by the smoky flame between two and three hundred individuals were assembled in these chambers at first scarcely distinguishable by those who descended from the broad daylight but by degrees the eyesight became accustomed to the dim and vaporous atmosphere and alroy recognised in the final and more illumined chamber a high cedar cabinet the type of the ark and which held the sacred vessels and the sanctified copy of the law  standing in lines with their heads mystically covered42 the forlorn remnant of israel captives in their ancient city avowed in spite of all their sufferings their fidelity to their god and notwithstanding all the bitterness of hope delayed their faith in the fulfilment of his promises their simple service was completed their prayers were read their responses made their law exhibited and their charitable offerings announced by their high priest after the service the venerable zimri opening a volume of the talmud and fortified by the opinions of all those illustrious and learned doctors the heroes of his erudite conversations with the aged maimon expounded the law to the congregation of the people43  it is written said the rabbi thou shalt have none other god but me now know ye what our father abraham said when nimrod ordered him to worship fire why not water answered abraham which can put out fire why not clouds which can pour forth water why not the winds which can produce clouds why not god which can create winds  a murmur of approbation sounded throughout the congregation  eliezer said zimri addressing himself to a young rabbi it is written that he took a rib from adam when he was asleep is god then a robber  the young rabbi looked puzzled and cast his eyes on the ground the congregation was perplexed and a little alarmed  is there no answer said zimri  rabbi said a stranger a tall swarthy african pilgrim standing in a corner and enveloped in a red mantle over which a lamp threw a flickering light rabbi some robbers broke into my house last night and stole an earthen pipkin but they left a golden vase in its stead  it is well said it is well said exclaimed the congregation the applause was loud  learned zimri continued the african it is written in the gemara that there was a youth in jerusalem who fell in love with a beautiful damsel and she scorned him and the youth was so stricken with his passion that he could not speak but when he beheld her he looked at her imploringly and she laughed and one day the youth not knowing what to do with himself went out into the desert and towards night he returned home but the gates of the city were shut and he went down into the valley of jehoshaphat and entered the tomb of absalom and slept44 and he dreamed a dream and next morning he came into the city smiling and the maiden met him and she said is that thou art thou a laugher and he answered behold yesterday being disconsolate i went out of the city into the desert and i returned home and the gates of the city were shut and i went down into the valley of jehoshaphat and i entered the tomb of absalom and i slept and i dreamed a dream and ever since then i have laughed and the damsel said tell me thy dream and he answered and said i may not tell my dream only to my wife for it regards her honour and the maiden grew sad and curious and said i am thy wife tell me thy dream and straightway they went and were married and ever after they both laughed now learned zimri what means this tale an idle jest for a master of the law yet it is written by the greatest doctor of the captivity  it passeth my comprehension said the chief rabbi  rabbi eliezer was silent the congregation groaned  now hear the interpretation said the african the youth is our people and the damsel is our lost sion and the tomb of absalom proves that salvation can only come from the house of david dost thou hear this young man said the african coming forward and laying his hand on alroy i speak to thee because i have observed a deep attention in thy conduct  the prince of the captivity started and shot a glance at the dark visage before him but the glance read nothing the upper part of the countenance of the african was half concealed by masses of dark matted hair and the lower by his uncouth robes a flashing eye was its only characteristic which darted forth like lightning out of a black cloud  is my attention the only reason that induces you to address me inquired alroy  whoever gave all his reasons replied the african with a laughing sneer  i seek not to learn them suffice it stranger that how much soever you may mean as much i can understand  tis well learned zimri is this thy pupil i congratulate thee i will match him against the hopeful eliezer so saying the lofty african stalked out of the chamber the assembly also broke up alroy would willingly have immediately followed the african and held some further and more private conversation with him but some minutes elapsed owing to the officious attentions of zimri before he could escape and when he did his search after the stranger was vain he inquired among the congregation but none knew the african he was no mans guest and no mans debtor and apparently had never before been seen  the trumpet was sounding to close the gates as alroy passed the zion entrance the temptation was irresistible he rushed out and ran for more than one hundred yards without looking back and when he did he had the satisfaction of ascertaining that he was fairly shut out for the night the sun had set still the mount of olives was flushed with the reflection of his dying beams but jehoshaphat at its feet was in deep shadow  he wandered among the mountains for some time beholding jerusalem from a hundred different points of view and watching the single planets and clustering constellations that gradually burst into beauty or gathered into light at length somewhat exhausted he descended into the vale the scanty rill of siloah45 looked like a thread of silver winding in the moonlight some houseless wretches were slumbering under the arch of its fountain several isolated tombs of considerable size46 rose at the base of olivet and the largest of these alroy entered proceeding through a narrow passage he entered a small square chamber on each side was an empty sarcophagus of granite one with its lid broken between these the prince of the captivity laid his robe and wearied by his ramble soon soundly slept  after some hours he woke he fancied that he had been wakened by the sound of voices the chamber was not quite dark a straggling moonbeam fought its way through an open fretwork pattern in the top of the tomb and just revealed the dim interior suddenly a voice spoke a strange and singular voice  brother brother the sounds of the night begin  another voice answered  brother brother i hear them too  the woman in labour  the thief at his craft  the sentinels challenge  the murderers step  oh the merry sounds of the night  brother brother let us come forth and wander about the world  we have seen all things ill lie here and listen to the baying hound tis music for a tomb  choice and rare you are idle i like to sport in the starry air our hours are few they should be fair  what shall we see heaven or earth hell for me tis more amusing as for me i am sick of hades let us visit solomon in his unknown metropolis  that will be rare  but where oh where  even a spirit cannot tell but they say but they say i dare not whisper what they say  who told you  no one i overheard an afrite whispering to a female ghoul he wanted to seduce  hah hah hah hah choice pair choice pair we are more ethereal  she was a beauty in her way her eyes were luminous though somewhat dank and her cheek tinged with carnation caught from infant blood  oh gay oh gay what said they  he was a deserter without leave from solomons bodyguard the trull wriggled the secret out  tell me kind brother  ill show not tell  i prythee tell me  well then well in genthesmas gloomy cave there is a river none has reached and you must sail and you must sail brother  ay  methinks i smell something too earthly  whats that  the breath of man  scent more fatal than the morning air away away  in the range of mountains that lead from olivet to the river jordan is the great cavern of genthesma a mighty excavation formed by the combined and immemorial work of nature and of art for on the high basaltic columns are cut strange characters and unearthly forms47 and in many places the natural ornaments have been completed by the hands of the sculptor into symmetrical entablatures and fanciful capitals the work they say of captive dives and conquered afrites for the great king  it was midnight the cold full moon showered it brilliancy upon this narrow valley shut in on all sides by black and barren mountains   a single being stood at the entrance of the cave  it was alroy desperate and determined after listening to the spirits in the tomb he resolved to penetrate the mysteries of genthesma  he took from his girdle a flint and steel with which he lighted a torch and then he entered  the cavern narrowed as he cautiously advanced and soon he found himself at the head of an evidently artificial gallery  a crowd of bats rushed forward and extinguished his torch 48  he leant down to relight it and in so doing observed that he had trod upon an artificial pavement  the gallery was of great extent with a gradual declination 49 being in a straight line with the mouth of the cavern the moonlit scene was long visible but alroy on looking round now perceived that the exterior was shut out by the eminence that he had left behind him  the sides of the gallery were covered with strange and sculptured forms  the prince of the captivity proceeded along this gallery for nearly two hours a distant murmur of falling water which might have been distinguished nearly from the first increased in sound as he advanced and now from the loud roar and dash at hand he felt that he was on the brink of some cataract  it as very dark his heart trembled he felt his footing ere he ventured to advance the spray suddenly leaped forward and extinguished his torch  his eminent danger filled him with terror and he receded some paces but in vain endeavoured to reillumine his torch which was soaked with water  his courage deserted him energy and exertion seemed hopeless he was about to deliver himself up to despair when and expanding lustre attracted his attention in the opposing gloom  a small and bright red cloud seemed sailing towards him  it opened discharged from its bosom as silvery star and dissolved again into darkness but the star remained the silvery star and threw a long line of tremulous light upon the vast and raging rapid which now fleet and foaming revealed itself on all sides to the eye of alroy  the beautiful interposition in his favour reanimated the adventurous pilgrim a dark shadow in the foreground breaking the line of light shed by the star upon the waters attracted his attention he advanced regained his former footing and more nearly examined it it was a boat and in the boat mute and immovable sat one of those vast singular and hidden forms which eh had observed sculptured on the walls of the gallery  david alry committing his fortunes to the god of israel leapt into the boat  and at the same moment the afrite for it was one of those dread beings50 raised the oars and the barque moved  the falling waters suddenly parted in the long line of the  stars reflection and the barque glided through their high and severed masses  in this wise they proceeded for a few minutes until they entered a beautiful and moonlit lake  in the distance was mountainous country alroy examined his companion with a feeling of curiosity not unmixed with terror it was remarkable that alroy could never succeed in any way in attracting his notice the afrite seemed totally unconscious of the presence of his passenger at length the boat reached the opposite shore of the lake and the prince of the captivity debarked  he debarked at the head of an avenue of colossal lions of red granite51 extending far as the eye could reach and ascending the side of the mountain which was cut into a flight of magnificent steps the easy ascent was in consequence soon accomplished and alroy proceeding along the avenue of lions soon gained the summit of the mountain  to his infinite astonishment he beheld jerusalem that stronglymarked locality could not be mistaken at his feet were jehoshaphat kedron siloah he stood upon olivet before him was zion but in all other respects how different was the landscape from the one that he had gazed upon a few days back for the first time the surrounding hills sparkled with vineyards and glowed with summer palaces and voluptuous pavilions and glorious gardens of pleasure the city extending all over mount sion was encompassed with a wall of white marble with battlements of gold a gorgeous mass of gates and pillars and gardened terraces lofty piles of rarest materials cedar and ivory and precious stones and costly columns of the richest workmanship and the most fanciful orders capitals of the lotus and the palm and flowing friezes of the olive and the vine  and in the front a mighty temple rose with inspiration in its very form a temple so vast so sumptuous that there needed no priest to tell us that no human hand planned that sublime magnificence  god of my fathers said alroy i am a poor weak thing and my life has been a life of dreams and visions and i have sometimes thought my brain lacked a sufficient master where am i do i sleep or live am i a slumberer or a ghost this trial is too much he sank down and hid his face in his hands his overexerted mind appeared to desert him he wept  many minutes elapsed before alroy grew composed his wild bursts of weeping sank into sobs and the sobs died off into sighs and at length calm from exhaustion he again looked up and lo the glorious city was no more before him was a moonlit plain over which the avenue of lions still advanced and appeared to terminate only in the mountainous distance  this limit the prince of the captivity at length reached and stood before a stupendous portal cut out of the solid rock four hundred feet in height and supported by clusters of colossal caryatides52 upon the portal were engraven some hebrew characters which upon examination proved to be the same as those upon the talisman of jabaster and so taking from his bosom that allprecious and longcherished deposit david alroy in obedience to his instructions pressed the signet against the gigantic portal  the portal opened with a crash of thunder louder than an earthquake pale panting and staggering the prince of the captivity entered an illimitable hall illumined by pendulous balls of glowing metal on each side of the hall sitting on golden thrones was ranged a line of kings and as the pilgrim entered the monarchs rose and took off their diadems and waved them thrice and thrice repeated in solemn chorus all hail alroy hail to thee brother king thy crown awaits thee  the prince of the captivity stood trembling with his eyes fixed upon the ground and leaning breathless against a column and when at length he had a little recovered himself and dared again to look up he found that the monarchs were reseated and from their still and vacant visages apparently unconscious of his presence and this emboldened him and so staring alternately at each side of the hall but with a firm perhaps desperate step alroy advanced  and he came to two thrones which were set apart from the others in the middle of the hall on one was seated a noble figure far above the common stature with arms folded and downcast eyes his feet rested upon a broken sword and a shivered sceptre which told that he was a monarch in spite of his discrowned head  and on the opposite throne was a venerable personage with a long flowing beard and dressed in white raiment his countenance was beautiful although ancient age had stolen on without its imperfections and time had only invested it with a sweet dignity and solemn grace the countenance of the king was upraised with a seraphic gaze and as he thus looked up on high with eyes full of love and thanksgiving and praise his consecrated fingers seemed to touch the trembling wires of a golden harp  and further on and far above the rest upon a throne that stretched across the hall a most imperial presence straightway flashed upon the startled vision of alroy fifty steps of ivory and each step guarded by golden lions53 led to a throne of jasper a dazzling light blazed forth from the glittering diadem and radiant countenance of him who sat upon the throne one beautiful as a woman but with the majesty of a god and in one hand he held a seal and in the other a sceptre  and when alroy had reached the foot of the throne he stopped and his heart misgave him and he prayed for some minutes in silent devotion and without daring to look up he mounted the first step of the throne and the second and the third and so on with slow and faltering feet until he reached the fortyninth step  the prince of the captivity raised his eyes he stood before the monarch face to face in vain alroy attempted to attract his attention or to fix his gaze the large dark eyes full of supernatural lustre appeared capable of piercing all things and illuminating all things but they flashed on without shedding a ray upon alroy  pale as a spectre the pilgrim whose pilgrimage seemed now on the point of completion stood cold and trembling before the object of all his desires and all his labours but he thought of his country his people and his god and while his noiseless lips breathed the name of jehovah solemnly he put forth his arm and with a gentle firmness grasped the unresisting sceptre of his great ancestor  and as he seized it the whole scene vanished from his sight  hours or years might have passed away so far as the sufferer was concerned when alroy again returned to selfconsciousness his eyes slowly opened he cast around a vacant stare he was lying in the cavern of genthesma the moon had set but the morn had not broken a single star glittered over the brow of the black mountains he faintly moved his limbs he would have raised his hand to his bewildered brain but found that it grasped a sceptre the memory of the past returned to him he tried to rise and found that he was reposing in the arms of a human being he turned his head he met the anxious gaze of jabaster     chapter vii       conquest of the seljuks  your face is troubled uncle so is my

these are strange tidings maidens  yes dear lady who would have thought of your brother turning out a captain  i am sure i always thought he was the quietest person in the world said beruna though he did kill alschiroch  one could never get a word out of him said rachel  he was always moping alone said beruna  and when one spoke to him he always turned away said leah  or blushed added imra  well for my part said the beautiful bathsheba i always thought prince david was a genius he had such beautiful eyes  i hope he will conquer hassan said rachel  so do i said beruna  i wonder what he has done with the harem said leah  i dont think he will dare to speak to them said imra  you are very much mistaken said bathsheba  hark said miriam  tis hassan said bathsheba may he never return  the wild drum of the seljuks sounded then a flourish of their fierce trumpets and soon the tramp of horse behind the blinds of their chamber miriam and her maidens beheld the magnificent troop of turbaned horsemen who glittering with splendid armour and bright shawls and proudly bounding on their fiery steeds now went forth to crush and conquer the only hope of israel upon an arab darker than night rode the superb hassan and as he passed the dwelling of his late prisoners whether from the exulting anticipation of coming triumph or from a soft suspicion that behind that lattice bright eyes and brilliant faces were gazing on his state the haughty but handsome seljuk flourished his scimitar over his head as he threw his managed steed into attitudes that displayed the skill of its rider  he is handsomer than alschiroch said rachel  what a shawl said beruna  his scimitar was like lightning said leah  and his steed like thunder said imra  the evil eye fall on him said bathsheba  lord exclaimed miriam remember david and all his afflictions  the deserted city of the wilderness presented a very different appearance from that which met the astonished gaze of alroy when he first beheld its noble turrets and wandered in its silent streets of palaces  without the gates was pitched a numerous camp of those low black tents common among the kourds and turkmans the principal street was full of busy groups engaged in all the preparations of warfare and all the bustling expedients of an irregular and adventurous life steeds were stalled in ruined chambers and tall camels raised their still visages among the clustering columns or crouched in kneeling tranquillity amid fallen statues and prostrate obelisks  two months had scarcely elapsed since alroy and jabaster had sought scherirah in his haunt and announced to him their sacred mission the callous heart of him whose mother was a jewess had yielded to their inspired annunciations he embraced their cause with all the fervour of conversion and his motley band were not long sceptical of a creed which while it assuredly offered danger and adventure held out the prospects of wealth and even empire from the city of the wilderness the new messiah sent forth his messengers to the neighbouring cities to announce his advent to his brethren in captivity the hebrews a proud and stiffnecked race ever prone to rebellion received the announcement of their favourite prince with transport the descendant of david and the slayer of alschiroch had double claims upon their confidence and allegiance and the flower of the hebrew youth in the neighbouring cities of the caliphate repaired in crowds to pay their homage to the recovered sceptre of solomon  the affair was at first treated by the government with contempt and the sultan of the seljuks contented himself with setting a price upon the head of the murderer of his brother but when several cities had been placed under contribution and more than one moslem caravan stopped and plundered in the name of the god of abraham of isaac and of jacob orders were despatched from bagdad to the new governor of hamadan hassan subah to suppress the robbers or the rebels and to send david alroy dead or alive to the capital  the hebrew malcontents were well apprised by their less adventurous but still sympathising brethren of everything that took place at the headquarters of the enemy spies arrived on the same day at the city of the wilderness who informed alroy that his uncle was thrown into a dungeon at hamadan and that a body of chosen troops were about to escort a royal harem from bagdad into persia  alroy attacked the escort in person utterly discomfited them and captured their charge it proved to be the harem of the governor of hamadan and if for a moment the too sanguine fancy of the captor experienced a passing pang of disappointment the prize at least obtained as we have seen the freedom and security of his dear though distant friends this exploit precipitated the expedition which was preparing at hamadan for his destruction the enraged hassan subah started from his divan seized his scimitar and without waiting for the auxiliaries he had summoned from the neighbouring chieftains called to horse and at the head of two thousand of the splendid seljuk cavalry hurried to vindicate his love and satiate his revenge  within the amphitheatre which he first entered as a prisoner alroy sat in council on his right was jabaster scherirah on his left a youth little his senior but tall as a palmtree and strong as a young lion was the fourth captain in the distance some standing some reclining were about fifty men completely armed  are the people numbered abner inquired alroy of the youth  even so three hundred effective horsemen and two thousand footmen but the footmen lack arms  the lord will send them in good time said jabaster meanwhile let them continue to make javelins  trust in the lord murmured scherirah bending his head with his eyes fixed on the ground  a loud shout was heard throughout the city alroy started from his carpet the messenger had returned pale and haggard covered with sweat and sand the faithful envoy was borne into the amphitheatre almost upon the shoulders of the people in vain the guard endeavoured to stem the passage of the multitude they clambered up the tiers of arches they filled the void and crumbling seats of the antique circus they supported themselves upon each others shoulders they clung to the capitals of the lofty columns the whole multitude had assembled to hear the intelligence the scene recalled the ancient purpose of the building and alroy and his fellowwarriors seemed like the gladiators of some old spectacle  speak said alroy speak the worst no news can be bitter to those whom the lord will avenge  ruler of israel thus saith hassan subah answered the messenger my harem shall owe their freedom to nothing but my sword i treat not with rebels but i war not with age or woman and between bostenay and his household on one side and the prisoners of thy master on the other let there be peace go tell alroy i will seal it in his best blood and lo thy uncle and thy sister are again in their palace  alroy placed his hand for a moment to his eyes and then instantly resuming his selfpossession he enquired as to the movements of the enemy  i have crossed the desert on a swift dromedary54 lent to me by shelomi of the gate whose heart is with our cause i have not tarried neither have i slept ere tomorrows sunset the philistines will be here led by hassan subah himself the lord of hosts be with us since we conquered canaan israel hath not struggled with such a power  a murmur ran through the assembly men exchanged enquiring glances and involuntarily pressed each others arms  the trial has come said a middleaged hebrew who had fought twenty years ago with jabaster  let me die for the ark said a young enthusiast of the band of abner  i thought we should get into a scrape whispered kisloch the kourd to calidas the indian what could have ever induced us to give up robbing in a quiet manner  and turn jews said the guebre with a sneer  look at scherirah said the negro grinning if he is not kissing the sceptre of solomon  i wish to heaven he had only hung alroy the first time he met him said calidas  sons of the covenant exclaimed alroy the lord hath delivered them into our hands tomorrow eve we march to hamadan  a cheer followed this exclamation  it is written said jabaster opening a volume lo i will defend this city to save it for mine own sake and for my servant davids sake  and it came to pass that night that the angel of the lord went out and smote in the camp of the assyrians an hundred four score and five thousand and when they arose early in the morning behold they were all dead corpses  now as i was gazing upon the stars this morn and reading the celestial alphabet known to the true cabalist55 behold the star of the house of david and seven other stars moved and met together and formed into a circle and the word they formed was a mystery to me but lo i have opened the book and each star is the initial letter of each line of the targum that i have now read to you therefore the fate of sennacherib is the fate of hassan subah  trust in him at all times ye people pour out your heart before him god is a refuge for us selah  at this moment a female form appeared on the very top of the amphitheatre upon the slight remains of the upper most tier of which a solitary arch alone was left the chorus instantly died away every tongue was silent every eye fixed hushed mute and immovable even kisloch and his companions were appalled as they gazed upon esther the prophetess  her eminent position her imposing action the flashing of her immense eyes her beautiful but awful countenance her black hair that hung almost to her knees and the white light of the moon just rising over the opposite side of the amphitheatre and which threw a silvery flash upon her form and seemed to invest her with some miraculous emanation while all beneath her was in deep gloomthese circumstances combined to render her an object of universal interest and attention while in a powerful but high voice she thus addressed them  they come they come but will they go lo hear ye this o house of jacob which are called by the name of israel and are come forth out of the waters of judah i hear their drum in the desert and the voice of their trumpets is like the wind of eve but a decree hath gone forth and it says that a mortal shall be more precious than fine gold yea a man than the rich ore of ophir  they come they come but will they go i see the flash of their scimitars i mark the prancing of their cruel steeds but a decree hath gone forth and it says a gleaning shall be left among them as in the shaking of the olivetree two or three berries on the top of the uppermost bough four or five on the straggling branches  they come they come but will they go lo a decree hath gone forth and it says hamadan shall be to thee for a spoil and desolation shall fall upon babylon and there shall the wild beasts of the desert lodge and howling monsters shall fill their houses and there shall the daughters of the ostrich dwell and there shall the screechowl pitch her tent and there shall the nightraven lay her eggs and there shall the satyrs hold their revels and wolves shall howl to one another in their palaces and dragons in their voluptuous pavilions her time is near at hand her days shall not be prolonged the reed and the lotus shall wither in her rivers and the meadows by her canals shall be as the sands of the desert for is it a light thing that the lord should send his servant to raise up the tribes of jacob and to restore the preserved of israel sing o heavens and be joyful o earth and break forth into singing o mountains for the lord hath comforted his people and will have mercy upon his afflicted  she ceased she descended the precipitous side of the amphitheatre with rapid steps vaulting from tier to tier and bounding with wonderful agility from one mass of ruin to another at length she reached the level and then foaming and panting she rushed to alroy threw herself upon the ground embraced his feet and wiped off the dust from his sandals with her hair  the assembly broke into long and loud acclamations of supernatural confidence and sanguine enthusiasm they beheld their messiah wave his miraculous sceptre they thought of hassan subah and his seljuks only as of victims and of tomorrow only as of a day which was to commence a new era of triumph freedom and empire  hassan subah after five days forced marches pitched his sumptuous pavilion in that beautiful oasis which had afforded such delightful refreshment to alroy when a solitary pilgrim around for nearly a mile were the tents of his warriors and of the numerous caravan that had accompanied him laden with water and provisions for his troops here while he reposed he also sought information as to the position of his enemy  a party of observation which he had immediately despatched returned almost instantly with a small caravan that had been recently plundered by the robbers the merchant a venerable and pious moslem was ushered into the presence of the governor of hamadan  from the robbers haunt enquired hassan  unfortunately so answered the merchant  is it far  a days journey  and you quitted it  yesterday morn  what is their force  the merchant hesitated  do they not make prisoners enquired the governor casting a scrutinising glance at his companion  holy prophet what a miserable wretch am i exclaimed the venerable merchant bursting into tears a faithful subject of the caliph i am obliged to serve rebels a devout moslem i am forced to aid jews order me to be hanged at once my lord continued the unfortunate merchant wringing his hands order me to be hanged at once i have lived long enough  what is all this enquired hassan speak friend without fear  i am a faithful subject of the caliph answered the merchant i am a devout moslem but i have lost ten thousand dirhems  i am sorry for you sir i also have lost something but my losses are nothing to you nor yours to me  accursed be the hour when these dogs tempted me tell me is it sin to break faith with a jew  on the contrary i could find you many reverend mollahs who will tell you that such a breach is the highest virtue come come i see how it is you have received your freedom on condition of not betraying your merciful plunderers promises exacted by terror are the bugbears of fools speak man all you know where are they what is their force are we supposed to be at hand  i am a faithful subject of the caliph and i am bound to serve him replied the merchant i am a devout moslem and tis my duty to destroy all giaours but i am also a man and i must look after my own interest noble governor the long and the short is these scoundrels have robbed me of ten thousand dirhems as my slaves will tell you at least goods to that amount no one can prove that they be worth less it is true that i include in that calculation the fifty per cent i was to make on my shawls at hamadan but still to me it is as good as ten thousand dirhems ask my slaves if such an assortment of shawls was ever yet beheld  to the point to the point the robbers i am at the point the shawls is the point for when i talked of the shawls and the heaviness of my loss you must know that the captain of the robbers  alroy  a fierce young gentleman i do not know how they call him said the captain to me merchant you look gloomy gloomy i said you would look gloomy if you were a prisoner and had lost ten thousand dirhems what is this trash worth ten thousand dirhems said he with the fifty per cent i was to make at hamadan fifty per cent said he you are an old knave knave i should like to hear any one call me knave at bagdad well knave or not you may get out of this scrape how why you are a respectablelooking man said he and are a good moslem into the bargain i warrant that i am said i although you be a jew but how the faith is to serve me here i am sure i dont know unless the angel gabriel as in the fiftyfifth verse of the twentyseventh chapter of the koran  tush tush exclaimed hassan to the point  i always am at the point only you put me out however to make it as short as possible the captain knows all about your coming and is frightened out of his wits although he did talk big i could easily see that and he let me go you see with some of my slaves and gave me an order for five thousand dirhems on one bostenay of hamadan perhaps you know him is he a good man on condition that i would fall in with you and mohammed forgive me tell you a lie  a lie  yes a lie but these jewish dogs do not understand what a truly religious man is and when i began to tell the lie i was soon put out now noble hassan if a promise to a jew be not binding on a true believer and you will see me straight with the five thousand dirhems i will betray everything at once  be easy about the five thousand dirhems good man and tell me all  you will see me paid  my honour upon it  tis well know then the infamous dogs are very weak and terrified at the news of your progress one whom i think they call jabaster has departed with the great majority of the people into the interior of the desert about seven hundred strong i heard so but mind i do not know it the young man whom you call alroy being wounded in a recent conflict could not depart with them but remains among the ruins with some female prisoners some treasure and about a hundred companions hidden in sepulchres he gave me my freedom on condition that i should fall in with you and assure you that the dogs full five thousand strong had given you the goby in the night and marched towards hamadan they wanted me to frighten you it was a lie and i could not tell it and now you know the plain truth and if it be a sin to break faith with an infidel you are responsible for it as well as for the five thousand dirhems which bythebye ought to have been ten  where is your order  tis here said the merchant drawing it from his vest a very businesslike document drawn upon one bostenay whom they described as very rich and who is here enjoined to pay me five thousand dirhems if in consequence of my information hassan subah that is yourself return forthwith to hamadan without attacking them  old bostenays head shall answer for this  i am glad of it but were i you i would make him pay me first  merchant said hassan have you any objection to pay another visit to your friend alroy  allah forbid  in my company  that makes a difference  be our guide the dirhems shall be doubled  that will make up for the fifty per cent i hardly like it but in your company that makes a difference lose no time if you push on alroy must be captured now or never the jewish dogs to rifle a true believer  oglu said hassan to one of his officers to horse you need not strike the tents can we reach the city by sunset merchant  an hour before if you be off at once sound the drums to horse to horse the seljuks halted before the walls of the deserted city their commander ordered a detachment to enter and reconnoitre they returned and reported its apparent desolation hassan subah then directing that a guard should surround the walls to prevent any of the enemy from escaping passed with his warriors through the vast portal into the silent street the still magnificence of the strange and splendid scene influenced the temper even of this ferocious cavalry they gazed around them with awe and admiration the fierceness of their visages was softened the ardour of their impulse stilled a supernatural feeling of repose stole over their senses no one brandished his scimitar the fiery courser seemed as subdued as his lord and no sound was heard but the melancholy mechanical tramp of the disciplined march unrelieved by martial music inviolate by oath or jest and unbroken even by the ostentatious caracoling of any showy steed  it was sunset the star of eve glittered over the white ionian fane that rose serene and delicate in the flashing and purple sky  this way my lord said the merchant guide turning round to hassan subah who surrounded by his officers led the van the whole of the great way of the city was filled with the seljukian warriors their ebon steeds their snowy turbans adorned with plumes of the black eagle and the red heron their dazzling shawls the blaze of their armour in the sunset and the long undulating perspective of beautiful forms and brilliant colours this regiment of heroes in a street of palaces war had seldom afforded a more imposing or more picturesque spectacle  this way my lord said the merchant pointing to the narrow turning that at the foot of the temple led through ruined streets to the amphitheatre  halt exclaimed a wild shrill voice each warrior suddenly arrested his horse  who spoke exclaimed hassan subah  i answered a voice a female form stood in the portico of the temple with uplifted arms  and who art thou enquired hassan subah not a little disconcerted  thine evil genius seljuk  hassan subah pale as his ivory battleaxe did not answer every man within hearing shuddered still the dread woman remained immovable within the porch of the temple  woman witch or goddess at length exclaimed hassan subah what wouldst thou here  seljuk behold this star tis a single drop of light yet who even of thy wild band can look upon it without awe and yet thou worse than sisera thou comest to combat against those for whom even the stars in their courses fought  a jewish witch exclaimed the seljuk  a jewish witch be it so behold then my spell falls upon thee and that spell is destruction  awake awake deborah awake awake utter a song arise barak and lead thy captivity captive thou son of abinoam  immediately the sky appeared to darken a cloud of arrows and javelins broke from all sides upon the çlevoted seljuks immense masses of stone and marble were hurled from all directions horses were stabbed by spears impelled by invisible hands and riders fell to the ground without a struggle and were trampled upon by their disordered and affrighted brethren  we are betrayed exclaimed hassan subah hurling a javelin at the merchant but the merchant was gone the seljuks raised their famous war cry  oglu regain the desert ordered the chieftain  but no sooner had the guard without the walls heard the war cry of their companions than alarmed for their safety they rushed to their assistance the retreating forces of subah each instant diminishing as they retreated were baffled in their project by the very eagerness of their auxiliaries the unwilling contention of the two parties increased the confusion and when the seljuks recently arrived having at length formed into some order had regained the gate they found to their dismay that the portal was barricadoed and garrisoned by the enemy uninspired by the presence of their commander who was in the rear the puzzled soldiers were seized with a panic and spurring their horses dispersed in all directions of the city in vain hassan subah endeavoured to restore order the moment was past dashing with about thirty men to an open ground which his quick eye had observed in his progress down the street and dealing destruction with every blow the dreaded governor of hamadan like a true soldier awaited an inevitable fate not wholly despairing that some chance might yet turn up to extricate him from his forlorn situation  and now as it were by enchantment wild armed men seemed to arise from every part of the city from every mass of ruin from every crumbling temple and mouldering mansion from every catacomb and cellar from behind every column and every obelisk upstarted some desperate warrior with a bloody weapon the massacre of the seljuks was universal the horsemen dashed wildly about the ruined streets pursued by crowds of footmen sometimes formed in small companies the seljuks charged and fought desperately but however stout might be their resistance to the open foe it was impossible to withstand their secret enemies they had no place of refuge no power of gaining even a moments breathing time if they retreated to a wall it instantly bristled with spears if they endeavoured to form in a court they sank under the falling masses which were showered upon them strange shouts of denunciation blended with the harsh braying of horns and the clang and clash of cymbals and tambours sounded in every quarter of the city  if we could only mount the walls ibrahim and leap into the desert exclaimed hassan subah to one of his few remaining comrades tis our only chance we die here like dogs could i but meet alroy  three of the seljuks dashed swiftly across the open ground in front followed by several hebrew horsemen  smite all abner spare none remember amalek exclaimed their youthful leader waving his bloody scimitar  they are down one two there goes the third my javelin has done for him  your horse bleeds freely wheres jabaster  at the gates my arm aches with slaughter the lord hath delivered them into our hands could i but meet their chieftain  turn bloodhound he is here exclaimed hassan subah  away abner this affair is mine  prince you have already slain your thousands  and abner his tens of thousands is it so this business is for me only come on turk  art thou alroy  the same  the slayer of alschiroch  even so  a rebel and a murderer  what you please look to yourself  the hebrew prince flung a javelin at the seljuk it glanced from the breastplate but hassan subah staggered in his seat recovering he charged alroy with great force their scimitars crossed and the blade of hassan shivered  he who sold me that blade told me it was charmed and could be broken only by a caliph said hassan subah he was a liar  as it may be said alroy and he cut the seljuk to the ground abner had dispersed his comrades alroy leaped from his fainting steed and mounting the ebon courser of his late enemy dashed again into the thickest of the fight  the shades of night descended the clamour gradually decreased the struggle died away a few unhappy moslemin who had quitted their saddles and sought concealment among the ruins were occasionally hunted out and brought forward and massacred long ere midnight the last of the seljuks had expired56  the moon shed a broad light upon the street of palaces crowded with the accumulated slain and the living victors fires were lit torches illumined the conquerors prepared the eager meal as they sang hymns of praise and thanksgiving  a procession approached esther the prophetess clashing her cymbals danced before the messiah of israel who leant upon his victorious scimitar surrounded by jabaster abner scherirah and his chosen chieftains who could now doubt the validity of his mission the wide and silent desert rang with the acclamations of his enthusiastic votaries  heavily the anxious hours crept on in the jewish quarter of hamadan again and again the venerable bostenay discussed the chances of success with the sympathising but desponding elders miriam was buried in constant prayer their most sanguine hopes did not extend beyond the escape of their prince  a fortnight had elapsed and no news had been received of the progress of the expedition when suddenly towards sunset a sentinel on a watchtower announced the appearance of an armed force in the distance the walls were instantly lined with the anxious inhabitants the streets and squares filled with curious crowds exultation sat on the triumphant brow of the moslemin a cold tremor stole over the fluttering heart of the hebrew  there is but one god said the captain of the gate  and mahomed is his prophet responded a sentinel  tomorrow we will cut off the noses of all these jewish dogs  the sceptre has departed exclaimed the despairing bostenay  lord remember david whispered miriam as she threw herself upon the court of the palace and buried her face in ashes  the mollahs in solemn procession advanced to the ramparts to shed their benediction on the victorious hassan subah the muezzin ascended the minarets to watch the setting sun and proclaim the power of allah with renewed enthusiasm  i wonder if alroy be dead or alive said the captain of the gate  if he be alive he will be impaled responded a sentinel  if dead the carcass will be given to the dogs rejoined the captain that is the practice  bostenay will be hung said the sentinel  and his niece too answered the captain  hem said the sentinel hassan subah loves a black eye  i hope a true moslem will not touch a jewess exclaimed an indignant black eunuch  they approach what a dust said the captain of the gate  i see hassan subah said the sentinel  so do i said the eunuch i know his black horse  i wonder how many dirhems old bostenay is worth said the captain  immense said the sentinel  no plunder i suppose said the eunuch  we shall see said the captain at any rate i owe a thousand to old shelomi we need not pay now you know  certainly not said the black eunuch the rebels  a body of horsemen dashed forward their leader in advance reined in his fiery charger beneath the walls  in the name of the prophet who is that exclaimed the captain of the gate a little confused  i never saw him before said the sentinel although he is in the seljuk dress tis some one from bagdad i guess  a trumpet sounded  who keeps the gate called out the warrior  i am the captain of the gate answered our friend  open it then to the king of israel  to whom enquired the astonished captain  to king david the lord hath delivered hassan subah and his host into our hands and of all the proud seljuks none remaineth open thy gates i say and lose no time i am jabaster a lieutenant of the lord this scimitar is my commission open thy gates and thou and thy people shall have that mercy which they have never shown but if thou delayest one instant thus saith the king our master i will burst open your portal and smite and utterly destroy all that you have and spare them not but slay both man and woman infant and suckling ox and sheep camel and ass  call forth the venerable lord bostenay said the captain of the gate with chattering teeth he will intercede for us  and the gentle lady miriam said the sentinel she is ever charitable  i will head the procession said the black eunuch i am accustomed to women  the procession of mollahs shuffled back to their college with profane precipitation the sun set and the astounded muezzin stood with their mouths open and quite forgot to announce the power of their deity and the validity of their prophet the people all called out for the venerable lord bostenay and the gentle lady miriam and ran in crowds to see who could first kiss the hem of their garments  the principal gate of hamadan opened into the square of the great mosque here the whole population of the city appeared assembled the gates were thrown open jabaster and his companions mounted guard the short twilight died away the shades of night descended the minarets were illumined57 the houses hung with garlands the ramparts covered with tapestry and carpets  a clang of drums trumpets and cymbals announced the arrival of the hebrew army the people shouted the troops without responded with a long cheer of triumph amid the blaze of torches a youth waving his scimitar upon a coalblack steed bounded into the city at the head of his guards the people fell upon their knees and shouted long live alroy  a venerable man leading a beauteous maiden with downcast eyes advanced they headed a deputation of the chief inhabitants of the city they came to solicit mercy and protection at the sight of them the youthful warrior leaped from his horse flung away his scimitar and clasping the maiden in his arms exclaimed miriam my sister this this indeed is triumph  drink said kisloch the kourd to calidas the indian you forget comrade we are no longer moslemin  wine methinks has a peculiarly pleasant flavour in a golden cup said the guebre i got this little trifle today in the bazaar he added holding up a magnificent vase studded with gems  i thought plunder was forbidden grinned the negro  so it is replied the guebre but we may purchase what we please upon credit  well for my part i am a moderate man exclaimed calidas the indian and would not injure even these accursed dogs of turks i have not cut my hosts throat but only turned him into my porter and content myself with his harem his baths his fine horses and other little trifles  what quarters we are in there is nothing like a true messiah exclaimed kisloch devoutly  nothing said calidas though to speak truth i did not much believe in the efficacy of solomons sceptre till his majesty clove the head of the valiant seljuk with it  but now theres no doubt of it said the guebre  we should indeed be infidels if we doubted now replied the indian  how lucky grinned the negro as i had no religion before that i have now fixed upon the right one  most fortunate said the guebre what shall we do to amuse ourselves tonight  let us go to the coffeehouses and make the turks drink wine said calidas the indian  what say you to burning down a mosque said kisloch the kourd  i had great fun with some dervishes this morning said the guebre i met one asking alms with a wire run through his cheek58 so i caught another bored his nose and tied them both together  hah hah hah burst the negro  asia resounded with the insurrection of the jews and the massacre of the seljuks crowds of hebrews from the rich cities of persia and the populous settlements on the tigris and the euphrates hourly poured into hamadan  the irritated moslemin persecuted the brethren of the successful rebel and this impolicy precipitated their flight the wealth of bagdad flowed into the hebrew capital seated on the divan of hassan subah and wielding the sceptre of solomon the king of israel received the homage of his devoted subjects and despatched his envoys to syria and to egypt the wellstored magazines and arsenals of hamadan soon converted the pilgrims into warriors the city was unable to accommodate the increased and increasing population an extensive camp under the command of abner was formed without the walls where the troops were daily disciplined and where they were prepared for greater exploits than a skirmish in a desert  within a month after the surrender of hamadan the congregation of the people assembled in the square of the great mosque now converted into a synagogue the multitude was disposed in ordered ranks and the terrace of every house was crowded in the centre of the square was an altar of cedar and brass and on each side stood a company of priests guarding the victims one young bullock and two rams without blemish  amid the flourish of trumpets the gates of the synagogue opened and displayed to the wondering eyes of the hebrews a vast and variegated pavilion planted in the court the holy remnant no longer forlorn beheld that tabernacle of which they had so long dreamed once more shining in the sun with its purple and scarlet hangings its curtains of rare skins and its furniture of silver and gold  a procession of priests advanced bearing with staves of cedar run through rings of gold a gorgeous ark the work of the most cunning artificers of persia night and day had they laboured under the direction of jabaster to produce this wondrous spectacle once more the children of israel beheld the cherubim they burst into a triumphant hymn of thanksgiving and many drew their swords and cried aloud to be led against the canaanites  from the mysterious curtains of the tabernacle alroy came forward leading jabaster they approached the altar and alroy took robes from the surrounding priests and put them upon jabaster and a girdle and a breastplate of jewels and alroy took a mitre and placed it upon the head of jabaster and upon the mitre he placed a crown and pouring oil upon his head the pupil anointed the master high priest of israel  the victims were slain the sinoffering burnt amid clouds of incense bursts of music and the shouts of a devoted people amid odour and melody and enthusiasm alroy mounted his charger and at the head of twenty thousand men departed to conquer media  the extensive and important province of aderbijan of which hamadan was the capital was formed of the ancient media its fate was decided by one battle on the plain of nehauend alroy met the hastilyraised levies of the atabek of kermanshah and entirely routed them in the course of a month every city of the province had acknowledged the supremacy of the new hebrew monarch and leaving abner to complete the conquest of louristan alroy entered persia  the incredible and irresistible progress of alroy roused togrul the turkish sultan of persia from the luxurious indolence of the palaces of nishapur he summoned his emirs to meet him at the imperial city of rhey and crush by one overwhelming effort the insolent rebel  religion valour and genius alike inspired the arms of alroy but he was doubtless not a little assisted by the strong national sympathy of his singular and scattered people which ever ensured him prompt information of all the movements of his enemy without any preparation he found agents in every court and camp and cabinet and by their assistance he anticipated the designs of his adversaries and turned even their ingenuity to their confusion the imperial city of rhey was surprised in the night sacked and burnt to the ground the scared and baffled emirs who escaped flew to the sultan togrul tearing their beards and prophesying the approaching termination of the world the palaces of nishapur resounded with the imprecations of their master who cursing the jewish dogs and vowing a pilgrimage to mecca placed himself at the head of a motley multitude of warriors and rushed upon the plains of irak to exterminate alroy  the persian force exceeded the hebrew at least five times in number besides a large division of seljuks the caucasus had poured forth its strange inhabitants to swell the ranks of the faithful the wild tribes of the bactiari were even enlisted with their fatal bows and the savage turkmans tempted by the sultans gold for a moment yielded their liberty and shook their tall lances in his ranks  but what is a wild bactiari and what is a savage turkman and what even a disciplined and imperious seljuk to the warriors of the god of abraham of isaac and of jacob at the first onset alroy succeeded in dividing the extended centre of togrul and separating the greater part of the turks from their less disciplined comrades at the head of his median cavalry the messiah charged and utterly routed the warriors of the caucasus the wild tribes of the bactiari discharged their arrows and fled and the savage turkmans plundered the baggage of their own commander  the turks themselves fought desperately but deserted by their allies and surrounded by an inspired foe their efforts were unavailing and their slaughter terrible togrul was slain while heading a desperate and fruitless charge and after his fall the battle resembled a massacre rather than a combat the plain was glotted with seljuk gore no quarter was given or asked twenty thousand chosen troops fell on the side of the turks the rest dispersed and gained the mountains leaving scherirah to restore order alroy the next morning pushed on to nishapur at the head of three thousand horsemen and summoned the city ere the inhabitants were apprised of the defeat and death of their sultan the capital of persia escaped the fate of rhey by an inglorious treaty and a lavish tribute the treasures of the chosroes and the gasnevides were despatched to hamadan on which city day dawned only to bring intelligence of a victory or a conquest  while alroy dictated peace on his own terms in the palaces of nishapur abner having reduced louristan crossed the mountains and entered persia with the reinforcements he had received from jabaster leaving the government and garrisoning of his new conquests to this valiant captain alroy at the head of the conquerors of persia in consequence of intelligence received from hamadan returned by forced marches to that city  leaving the army within a days march of the capital alroy accompanied only by his staff entered hamadan in the evening and immediately repairing to the citadel summoned jabaster to council the night was passed by the king and the high priest in deep consultation the next morning a decree apprised the inhabitants of the return of their monarch of the creation of the new kingdom of the medes and persians of which hamadan was declared the capital and abner the viceroy and of the intended and immediate invasion of syria and reconquest of the land of promise  the plan of this expedition had been long matured and the preparations to effect it were considerably advanced jabaster had not been idle during the absence of his pupil one hundred thousand warriors were now assembled59 at the capital of the kingdom of the medes and persians of these the greater part were hebrews but many arabs wearied of the turkish yoke and many gallant adventurers from the caspian easily converted from a vague idolatry to a religion of conquest swelled the ranks of the army of the lord of hosts  the plain of hamadan was covered with tents the streets were filled with passing troops the bazaars loaded with military stores long caravans of camels laden with supplies every day arrived from the neighbouring towns each instant some highcapped tatar with despatches60 rushed into the city and galloped his steed up the steep of the citadel the clang of arms the prance of horses the flourish of warlike music resounded from all quarters the business and the treasure of the world seemed as it were in an instant to have become concentrated in hamadan every man had some great object gold glittered in every hand all great impulses were stirring all the causes of human energy were in lively action every eye sparkled every foot trod firm and fast each man acted as if the universal fate depended upon his exertions as if the universal will sympathised with his particular desire a vast population influenced by a high degree of excitement is the most sublime of spectacles  the commander of the faithful raised the standard of the prophet on the banks of the tigris it was the secret intelligence of this intended event that had recalled alroy so suddenly from persia the latent enthusiasm of the moslemin was excited by the rare and mystic ceremony and its effects were anticipated by previous and judicious preparations the seljuks of bagdad alone amounted to fifty thousand men the sultan of syria contributed the warriors who had conquered the arabian princes of damascus and aleppo while the ancient provinces of asia minor which formed the rich and powerful kingdom of seljukian roum poured forth a myriad of that matchless cavalry which had so often baffled the armies of the cæsars never had so imposing a force been collected on the banks of the tigris since the reign of haroun alraschid each day some warlike atabek at the head of his armed train poured into the capital of the caliphs61 or pitched his pavilion on the banks of the river each day the proud emir of some remote principality astonished or affrighted the luxurious babylonians by the strange or uncouth warriors that had gathered round his standard in the deserts of arabia or on the shores of the euxine for the space of twenty miles the banks of the river were on either side far as the eye could reach covered with the variegated pavilions the glittering standards the flowing streamers and twinkling pennons of the mighty host of which malek the grand sultan of the seljuks and governor of the caliphs palace was chief commander  such was the power assembled on the plains of asia to arrest the progress of the hebrew prince and to prevent the conquest of the memorable land promised to the faith of his fathers and forfeited by their infidelity before the walls of hamadan alroy reviewed the army of israel sixty thousand heavyarmed footmen thirty thousand archers and light troops and twenty thousand cavalry besides these there had been formed a body of ten thousand picked horsemen styled the sacred guard all of whom had served in the persian campaign in their centre shrouded in a case of wrought gold studded with carbuncles and carried on a lusty lance of cedar a giantfor the height of elnebar exceeded that of common men by three feetbore the sceptre of solomon the sacred guard was commanded by asriel the brother of abner  the army was formed into three divisions all marched in solemn order before the throne of alroy raised upon the ramparts and drooped their standards and lances as they passed their heroic leader bostenay and miriam and the whole population of the city witnessed the inspiring spectacle from the walls that same eve scherirah at the head of forty thousand men pushed on towards bagdad by kermanshah and jabaster who commanded in his holy robes and who had vowed not to lay aside his sword until the rebuilding of the temple conducted his division over the victorious plain of nehauend they were to concentrate at the pass of kerrund which conducted into the province of bagdad and await the arrival of the king  at the dawn of day the royal division and the sacred guard the whole under the command of asriel quitted the capital alroy still lingered and for some hours the warriors of his staff might have been observed lounging about the citadel or practising their skill in throwing the jerreed as they exercised their impatient chargers before the gates  the king was with the lady miriam walking in the garden of their uncle one arm was wound round her delicate waist and with the other he clasped her soft and graceful hand the heavy tears burst from her downcast eyes and stole along her pale and pensive cheek they walked in silence the brother and the sister before the purity of whose surpassing love even ambition vanished he opened the lattice gate they entered into the valley small and green before them was the marble fountain with its columns and cupola and in the distance the charger of alroy and his single attendant  they stopped and alroy gathered flowers and placed them in the hair of miriam he would have softened the bitterness of parting with a smile gently he relaxed his embracing arm almost insensibly he dropped her quivering hand  sister of my soul he whispered when we last parted here i was a fugitive and now i quit you a conqueror  she turned she threw herself upon his neck and buried her face in his breast  my miriam we shall meet at bagdad  he beckoned to her distant maidens they advanced he delivered miriam into their arms he pressed her hand to his lips and rushing to his horse mounted and disappeared  a body of irregular cavalry feebly defended the pass of kerrund it was carried with slight loss by the vanguard of scherirah and the fugitives prepared the host of the caliph for the approach of the hebrew army  upon the plain of the tigris the enemy formed into battle array the centre was commanded by malek the grand sultan of the seljuks himself the right wing headed by the sultan of syria was protected by the river and the left under the sultan of roum was posted upon the advantageous position of some irregular and rising ground thus proud in the number valour discipline and disposition of his forces malek awaited the conqueror of persia  the glittering columns of the hebrews might even now be perceived defiling from the mountains and forming at the extremity of the plain before nightfall the camp of the invaders was pitched within hearing of that of malek the moving lights in the respective tents might plainly be distinguished and ever and anon the flourish of hostile music fell with an ominous sound upon the ears of the opposed foemen a few miles only separated those mighty hosts upon tomorrow depended perhaps the fortunes of ages how awful is the eve of battle  alroy attended by a few chieftains personally visited the tents of the soldiery promising them on the morrow a triumph before which the victories of nehauend and nishapur would sink into insignificance their fiery and excited visages proved at once their courage and their faith the sceptre of solomon was paraded throughout the camp in solemn procession on the summit of a huge tumulus perhaps the sepulchre of some classic hero esther the prophetess surrounded by the chief zealots of the host poured forth her exciting inspirations it was a grand picture that beautiful wild girl the groups of stern devoted warriors the red flame of the watchfires mixing with the silver shadows of the moon as they illumined the variegated turbans and gleaming armour of her votaries  in the pavilion of alroy jabaster consulted with his pupil on the conduct of the morrow  this is a different scene from the cavern of the caucasus said alroy as the high priest rose to retire  it has one great resemblance sire the god of our fathers is with us  ay the lord of hosts moses was a great man there is no career except conquest  you muse  of the past the present is prepared too much thought will mar it  the past is for wisdom the present for action but for joy the future the feeling that the building of the temple is at hand that the lords anointed will once again live in the house of david absorbs my spirit and when i muse over our coming glory in my fond ecstasy i almost lose the gravity that doth beseem my sacred office  jerusalem i have seen it how many hours to dawn  some three  tis strange i could sleep i remember on the eve of battle i was ever anxious how is this jabaster  your faith sire is profound  yes i have no fear my destiny is not complete good night jabaster see asriel valiant priest pharez  my lord  rouse me at the second watch good night boy  good night my lord  pharez be sure you rouse me at the second watch think you it wants three hours to dawn  about three hours my lord  well at the second watch remember good night  it is the second watch my lord  so soon have i slept i feel fresh as an eagle call scherirah boy  tis strange i never dream now before my flight my sleep was ever troubled say what they like man is made for action my life is now harmonious and sleep has now become what nature willed it a solace not a contest before it was a struggle of dark passions and bright dreams in whose creative fancy and fair vision my soul sought refuge from the dreary bale of daily reality  i will withdraw the curtains of my tent o most majestic vision and have i raised this host over the wide plain far as my eye can range their snowy tents studding the purple landscape embattled legions gather round their flags to struggle for my fate it is the agony of asia  a year ago upon this very spot i laid me down to die an unknown thing or known and recognised only to be despised and now the sultans of the world come forth to meet me i have no fear my destiny is not complete and whither tends it let that power decide which hitherto has fashioned all my course  jerusalem jerusalem ever harping on jerusalem with all his lore he is a narrowminded zealot whose dreaming memory would fondly make a future like the past o bagdad bagdad within thy glittering halls there is a charm worth all his cabala  hah scherirah the dawn is near at hand the stars are still shining the air is very pleasant tomorrow will be a great day scherirah for israel and for you you lead the attack a moment in my tent my brave scherirah  the dawn broke a strong column of the hebrews commanded by scherirah poured down upon the centre of the army of the caliph another column commanded by jabaster attacked the left wing headed by the sultan of roum no sooner had alroy perceived that the onset of scherirah had succeeded in penetrating the centre of the turks than he placed himself at the head of the sacred guard and by an irresistible charge completed their disorder and confusion the division of the sultan of syria and a great part of the centre were entirely routed and driven into the river and the remainder of the division of malek was effectually separated from his left wing  but while to alroy the victory seemed already decided a far different fate awaited the division of jabaster the sultan of roum posted in an extremely advantageous position and commanding troops accustomed to the discipline of the romans of constantinople received the onset of jabaster without yielding and not only repelled his attack but finally made a charge which completely disordered and dispersed the column of the hebrews in vain jabaster endeavoured to rally his troops in vain he performed prodigies of valour in vain he himself struck down the standardbearer of the sultan and once even penetrated to the pavilion of the monarch his division was fairly routed the eagerness of the sultan of roum to effect the annihilation of his antagonists prevented him from observing the forlorn condition of the turkish centre had he after routing the division of jabaster only attacked alroy in the rear the fortune of the day might have been widely different as it was the eagle eye of alroy soon detected his inadvertence and profited by his indiscretion leaving ithamar to keep the centre in check he charged the sultan of roum with the sacred guard and afforded jabaster an opportunity of rallying some part of his forces the sultan of roum perceiving that the day was lost by the illconduct of his colleagues withdrew his troops retreated in haste but in good order to bagdad carried off the caliph his harem and some of his treasure and effected his escape into syria in the meantime the discomfiture of the remaining turkish army was complete the tigris was dyed with their blood and the towns through which the river flowed were apprised of the triumph of alroy by the floating corpses of his enemies thirty thousand turks were slain in battle among them the sultans of bagdad and syria and a vast number of atabeks emirs and chieftains a whole division finding themselves surrounded surrendered on terms and delivered up their arms the camps and treasures of the three sultans were alike captured and the troops that escaped so completely dispersed that they did not attempt to rally but disbanded and desperate prowled over and plundered the adjoining provinces the loss of the division of jabaster was also severe but the rest of the army suffered little alroy himself was slightly wounded the battle lasted barely three hours its results were immense david alroy was now master of the east  the plain was covered with the corpses of men and horses arms and standards and prostrate tents returning from the pursuit of the sultan of roum alroy ordered the trumpets to sound to arms and covered with gore and dust dismounted from his charger and stood before the pavilion of malek leaning on his bloody scimitar and surrounded by his victorious generals  ah jabaster said the conqueror giving his hand to the pontiff twas well your troops had such a leader no one but you could have rallied them  you must drill your lads a little before they again meet the cappadocian cavalry brave scherirah we shall not forget our charge asriel tell the guard from me that the victory of the tigris was owing to their scimitars ithamar what are our freshest troops  the legion of aderbijan sire  how strong can they muster  it counts twelve thousand men we might collect twothirds  valiant ithamar take the aderbijans and a division of the guards push on towards bagdad and summon the city if his sultanship of roum offer battle take up a position and he shall quickly have his desire for the present after these hasty marches and sharp fighting the troops must rest i think he will not tarry summon the city and say that if any resistance be offered i will make it as desolate as old babylon treat with no armed force where is the soldier that saved me a cracked skull his name benaiah  i wait your bidding sire  youre a captain join the division of ithamar and win fresh laurels ere we meet again gentle asriel let your brother know our fortune  sire several tartars have already been despatched to hamadan  tis well send another with these tablets to the lady miriam despatch the pavilion of malek as a trophy for the town elnebar goliath of the hebrews you bore our sacred standard like a hero how fares the prophetess i saw her charging in our ranks waving a sabre with her snowy arm her long dark hair streaming like a storm from which her eyes flashed lightning   the king bleeds said jabaster  slightly it will do me service i am somewhat feverish a kingdom for a draught of water and now for our wounded friends asriel do you marshal the camp it is the sabbath eve62 time presses  the dead were plundered and thrown into the river the encampment of the hebrews completed alroy with his principal officers visited the wounded and praised the valiant the bustle which always succeeds a victory was increased in the present instance by the anxiety of the army to observe with grateful strictness the impending sabbath  when the sun set the sabbath was to commence the undulating horizon rendered it difficult to ascertain the precise moment of the setting the crimson orb sunk behind the purple mountains the sky was flushed with a rich and rosy glow then might be perceived the zealots proud in their talmudical lore holding a skein of white silk in their hands and announcing the approach of the sabbath by their observation of its shifting tints while the skein was yet golden the forge of the armourer still sounded the fire of the cook still blazed still the cavalry led their steeds to the river and still the busy footmen braced up their tents and hammered at their palisades the skein of silk became rosy the armourer worked with renewed energy the cook puffed with increased zeal the horsemen scampered from the river the footmen cast an anxious glance at the fading twilight  the skein of silk became blue a dim dull sepulchral leaden tinge fell over its purity the hum of gnats arose the bat flew in circling whirls over the tents horns sounded from all quarters the sun had set the sabbath had commenced the forge was mute the fire extinguished the prance of horses and the bustle of men in a moment ceased a deep a sudden an allpervading stillness dropped over that mighty host it was night the sacred lamp of the sabbath sparkled in every tent of the camp which vied in silence and in brilliancy with the mute and glowing heavens  morn came the warriors assembled around the altar and the sacrifice the high priest and his attendant levites proclaimed the unity and the omnipotence of the god of israel and the sympathetic responses of his conquering and chosen people reechoed over the plain they retired again to their tents to listen to the expounding of the law even the distance of a sabbath walk was not to exceed that space which lies between jerusalem and the mourft of olives this was the distance between the temple and the tabernacle it had been nicely measured and every hebrew who ventured forth from the camp this day might be observed counting the steps of a sabbathdays journey at length the sun again set and on a sudden fires blazed voices sounded men stirred in the same enchanted and instantaneous manner that had characterised the stillness of the preceding eve shouts of laughter bursts of music announced the festivity of the coming night supplies poured in from all the neighbouring villages and soon the pious conquerors commemorated their late triumph in a round of banqueting  on the morrow a tatar arrived from ithamar informing alroy that the sultan of roum had retreated into syria that bagdad was undefended but that he had acceded to the request of the inhabitants that a deputation should wait upon alroy before the troops entered the city and had granted a safe conduct for their passage  on the morrow messengers announced the approach of the deputation all the troops were under arms alroy directed that the suppliants should be conducted through the whole camp before they arrived at the royal pavilion on each side of which the sacred guard was mustered in array the curtains of his tent withdrawn displayed the conqueror himself seated on a sumptuous divan on his right hand stood jabaster in his priestly robes on his left scherirah behind him the giant elnebar supported the sacred sceptre a crowd of chieftains was ranged on each side of the pavilion  cymbals sounded muffled kettledrums and the faint flourish of trumpets the commencement of the procession might be detected in the long perspective of the tented avenue first came a company of beauteous youths walking two by two and strewing flowers then a band of musicians in flowing robes of cloth of gold plaintively sounding their silver trumpets after these followed slaves of all climes bearing a tribute of the most rare and costly productions of their countries negroes with tusks and teeth of the elephant plumes of ostrich feathers and caskets of gold dust syrians with rich armour persians with vases of atargul and indians with panniers of pearls of ormuz and soft shawls of cachemire encircled by his children each of whom held alternately a white or fawncoloured gazelle an arab clothed in his blue bornouz led by a thick cord of crimson silk a tall and tawny giraffe fifty stout men succeeded two by two carrying in company a silver shield laden with gold coin or chased goblets studded with gems  the clash of cymbals announced the presence of the robes of honour63 culled from the wardrobe of the commander of the faithful the silk of aleppo and the brocade of damascus lined with the furs of the sable and the ermine down from the breast of the swan and the skins of white foxes  after these followed two grey dromedaries with furniture of silver and many caparisoned horses each led by a groom in rich attire the last of these was a snowwhite steed upon whose front was the likeness of a ruby star a courser of the sacred stud of solomon and crossed only by the descendants of the prophet  the muffled kettledrums heralded the company of black eunuchs with their scarlet vests and ivory battleaxes they surrounded and shrouded from the vulgar gaze fourteen beautiful circassian girls whose brilliant visages and perfect forms were otherwise concealed by their long veils and ample drapery  the gorgeous procession as they approached the conqueror bowed humbly to alroy and formed in order on each side of the broad avenue the deputation appeared twelve of the principal citizens of bagdad with folded arms and downcast eyes and disordered raiment meekly and mutely each touched the earth with his hand and kissed it in token of submission and then moving aside made way for the chief envoy and orator of the company honain  humbly but gracefully the physician of the caliph bowed before the conqueror of the east his appearance and demeanour afforded a contrast to the aspect of his brother envoys not less calm or contented his countenance not less sumptuous or studied his attire than when he first rescued alroy in the bazaar of bagdad from the grip of the false abdallah  he spoke and every sound was hushed before the music of his voice  conqueror of the world that destiny with which it is in vain to struggle has placed our lives and fortunes in your power your slaves offer for your approbation specimens of their riches not as tribute for all is yours but to show you the products of security and peace and to induce you to believe that mercy may be a policy as profitable to the conqueror as to the conquered that it may be better to preserve than to destroy and wiser to enjoy than to extirpate  fate ordained that we should be born the slaves of the caliph that same fate has delivered his sceptre into your hands we offer you the same devotion that we yielded to him and we entreat the same protection which he granted to us  whatever may be your decision we must bow to your decree with the humility that recognises superior force yet we are not without hope we cannot forget that it is our good fortune not to be addressing a barbarous chieftain unable to sympathise with the claims of civilisation the creations of art and the finer impulses of humanity we acknowledge your irresistible power but we dare to hope everything from a prince whose genius all acknowledge and admire who has spared some portion of his youth from the cares of government and the pursuits of arms to the ennobling claims of learning whose morality has been moulded by a pure and sublime faith and who draws his lineage from a sacred and celebrated race the unrivalled antiquity of which even the prophet acknowledges  he ceased a buzz of approbation sounded throughout the pavilion which was hushed instantly as the lips of the conqueror moved  noble emir replied alroy return to bagdad and tell your fellowsubjects that the king of israel grants protection to their persons and security to their property  and for their faith enquired the envoy in a lower voice  toleration replied alroy turning to jabaster  until further regulations added the high priest  emir said alroy the person of the caliph will be respected  may it please your highness replied honain the sultan of roum has retired with our late ruler  and his harem  and his harem  it was needless we war not with women  men as well as women must acknowledge the gracious mercy of your highness  benomi said alroy addressing himself to a young officer of the guard command the guard of honour that will attend this noble emir on his return we soldiers deal only in iron sir and cannot vie with the magnificence of bagdad yet wear this dagger for the donors sake and alroy held out to honain a poniard flaming with gems  the envoy of bagdad advanced took the dagger pressed it to his lips and placed it in his vest64  scherirah continued alroy this noble emir is your charge see that a choice pavilion of the host be for his use and that his train complain not of the rough customs of our camp  may it please your highness replied honain i have fulfilled my office and with your gracious permission would at once return i have business only less urgent than the present because it concerns myself  as you will noble emir benomi to your post farewell sir  the deputation advanced bowed and retired alroy turned to jabaster  no common person that jabaster  a very gracious turk sire  think you he is a turk  by his dress  it may be so asriel break up the camp well march at once to bagdad  the chiefs dispersed to make the necessary arrangements for the march the news that the army was immediately to advance to bagdad soon circulated throughout the camp and excited the most lively enthusiasm every hand was at work striking the tents preparing the arms and horses alroy retired to his pavilion the curtains were drawn he was alone and plunged in profound meditation  alroy a voice sounded  he started and looked up before him stood esther the prophetess  esther is it thou  alroy enter not into babylon  indeed  as i live the lord hath spoken it enter not into babylon  not enjoy my fairest conquest maiden  enter not into babylon  what affrights thee  enter not into babylon  i shall surely change the fortunes of my life without a cause  the lord hath spoken is not that a cause  i am the lords anointed his warning has not reached me  now it reaches thee doth the king despise the prophetess of the lord it is the sin of ahab  despise thee despise the mouth that is the herald of my victories twere rank blasphemy prophesy triumph esther and alroy will never doubt thy inspiration  he doubts it now i see he doubts it now o my king i say again enter not into babylon  beauteous maiden those eyes flash lightning who can behold their wild and liquid glance and doubt that esther is inspired be calm sweet girl some dream disturbs thy fancy  alroy alroy enter not into babylon  i have no fear i bear a charmed life  ah me he will not listen all is lost  all is gained my beautiful  i would we were upon the holy mount and gazing on the stars of sacred zion  esther said alroy advancing and gently taking her hand the capital of the east will soon unfold its marvels to thy sight prepare thyself for wonders girl we are no longer in the desert forget thy fitful fancies come choose a husband from my generals child and i will give a kingdom for thy dower i would gladly see a crown upon that imperial brow it well deserves one  the prophetess turned her dark eyes full upon alroy what passed in her mind was neither evident nor expressed she gazed intently upon the calm and inscrutable countenance of the conqueror then flung away his hand and rushed out of the pavilion     chapter viii       bagdad and the princess  the waving of banners the flourish of trumpets the neighing of steeds and the glitter of spears on the distant horizon they gleam like the morning when the gloom of the night shivers bright into day hark the tramp of the foemen like the tide of the ocean flows onward and onward and conquers the shore from the brow of the mountain like the rush of a river the column defiling melts into the plain  warriors of judah holy men that battle for the lord the land wherein your fathers wept and touched their plaintive psalteries the haughty city where your sires bewailed their cold and distant hearths your steeds are prancing on its plain and you shall fill its palaces warriors of judah holy men that battle for the lord  march onward march ye valiant tribes the hour has come the hour has come all the promises of ages all the signs of sacred sages meet in this ravishing hour where is now the oppressors chariot where your tyrants purple robe the horse and the rider are both overthrown the horse and the rider are both overthrown  rise rachel from thy wilderness arise and weep no more no more thy lonely palmtrees shade need shroud thy secret sorrowing the lord hath heard the widows sigh the lord hath stilled the widows tear be comforted be comforted thy children live again  yes yes upon the bounding plain fleet asriel glances like a star and stout scherirah shakes his spear by stern jabasters scimitar and he is there the chosen one hymned by prophetic harps whose life is like the morning dew on zions holy hill the chosen one the chosen one that leads his race to victory warriors of judah holy men that battle for the lord  they come they come they come  the ramparts of the city were crowded with the inhabitants the river sparkled with ten thousand boats the bazaars were shut the streets lined with the populace and the terrace of every house covered with spectators in the morning ithamar had entered with his division and garrisoned the city and now the vanguard of the hebrew army after having been long distinguished in the distance approached the walls a large body of cavalry dashed forward at full speed from the main force upon a milkwhite charger and followed by a glittering train of warriors amid the shouts of the vast multitude alroy galloped up to the gates  he was received by ithamar and the members of the deputation but honain was not there accompanied by his staff and a strong detachment of the sacred guard alroy was conducted through the principal thoroughfares of the city until he arrived at the chief entrance of the serail or palace of the caliph the vast portal conducted him into a large quadrangular court where he dismounted and where he was welcomed by the captain of the eunuch guard accompanied by his principal generals and his immediate attendants alroy was then ushered through a suite of apartments which reminded him of his visit with honain until he arrived at the grand councilchamber of the caliphs  the conqueror threw himself upon the gorgeous divan of the commander of the faithful  an easy seat after a long march said alroy as he touched with his lips the coffee which the chief of the eunuchs presented to him in a cup of transparent pink porcelain studded with pearls65 ithamar now for your report what is the temper of the city where is his sultanship of roum  the city sire is calm and i believe content the sultan and the caliph are still hovering on the borders of the province  so i supposed scherirah will settle that let the troops be encamped without the walls the garrison ten thousand strong must be changed monthly ithamar you are governor of the city asriel commands the forces worthy jabaster draw up a report of the civil affairs of the capital your quarters are the college of the dervishes brave scherirah i cannot afford you a long rest in three days you must have crossed the river with your division it will be quick work i foresee that they will not fight meet me all here in council by tomorrows noon farewell  the chieftains retired the high priest lingered  were it not an intrusion sire i would fain entreat a moments audience  my own jabaster you have but to speak  sire i would speak of abidan as valiant a warrior as any in the host it grieves me much that by some fatality his services seem ever overlooked  abidan i know him well a valiant man but a dreamer a dreamer  a dreamer sire believe me a true son of israel and one whose faith is deep  good jabaster we are all true sons of israel yet let me have men about me who see no visions in a midday sun we must beware of dreamers  dreams are the oracles of god  when god sends them very true jabaster but this abidan and the company with whom he consorts are filled with highflown notions caught from old traditions which if acted on would render government impracticable in a word they are dangerous men  the very flower of israel some one has poisoned your sacred ear against them  no one worthy jabaster i have no counsellor except yourself they may be the flower of israel but they are not the fruit good warriors bad subjects excellent means by which we may accomplish greater ends ill have no dreamers in authority i must have practical men about me practical men see how abner asriel ithamar medad see how these conform to what surrounds them yet invincible captains invincible captains but then they are practical men jabaster they have eyes and use them they know the difference of times and seasons but this abidan he has no other thought but the rebuilding of the temple a narrowsouled bigot who would sacrifice the essence to the form the rising temple soon would fall again with such constructors why sir what think you this same abidan preached in the camp against my entry into what the quaint fanatic chooses to call babylon because he had seen what he calls a vision  there was a time your majesty thought not so ill of visions  am i abidan sir are other men to mould their conduct or their thoughts by me in this world i stand alone a being of a different order from yourselves incomprehensible even to you let this matter cease ill hear no more and have heard too much tomorrow at council  the high priest withdrew in silence  he is gone at length i am alone i cannot bear the presence of these men except in action their words even their looks disturb the still creation of my brooding thought i am once more alone and loneliness hath been the cradle of my empire now i do feel inspired there needs no mummery now to work a marvel  the sceptre of solomon it may be so what then heres now the sceptre of alroy whats that without his mind the legend said that none should free our people but he who bore the sceptre of great solomon the legend knew that none could gain that sceptre but with a mind to whose supreme volition the fortunes of the world would bow like fate i gained it i confronted the spectre monarchs in their sepulchre and the same hand that grasped their shadowy rule hath seized the diadem of the mighty caliphs by the broad rushing of their imperial river  the world is mine and shall i yield the prize the universal and heroic prize to realise the dull tradition of some dreaming priest and consecrate a legend he conquered asia and he built the temple are these my annals shall this quick blaze of empire sink to a glimmering and a twilight sway over some petty province the decent patriarch of a pastoral horde is the lord of hosts so slight a god that we must place a barrier to his sovereignty and fix the boundaries of omnipotence between the jordan and the lebanon it is not thus written and were it so ill pit my inspiration against the prescience of my ancestors i also am a prophet and bagdad shall be my zion the daughter of the voice well i am clearly summoned i am the lords servant not jabasters let me make his worship universal as his power and wheres the priest shall dare impugn my faith because his altars smoke on other hills than those of judah  i must see honain that man has a great mind he alone can comprehend my purpose universal empire must not be founded on sectarian prejudices and exclusive rights jabaster would massacre the moslemin like amalek the moslemin the vast majority and most valuable portion of my subjects he would depopulate my empire that it might not be said that ishmael shared the heritage of israel fanatic ill send him to conquer judah we must conciliate something must be done to bind the conquered to our conquering fortunes that bold sultan of roum i wish abner had opposed him to run off with the harem i have half a mind to place myself at the head of the pursuing force and passion and policy alike combine and yet honain is the man i might send him on a mission could we make terms i detest treaties my fancy flies from all other topics i must see him could i but tell him all i think this door whither leads it hah methinks i do remember yon glittering gallery no one in attendance the discipline of our palace is somewhat lax my warriors are no courtiers what an admirable marshal of the palace honain would make silence everywhere so tis well these saloons i have clearly passed through before could i but reach the private portal by the river side unseen or undetected tis not impossible here are many dresses i will disguise myself trusty scimitar thou hast done thy duty rest awhile tis lucky i am beardless i shall make a capital eunuch so a handsome robe one dagger for a pinch slippers powdered with pearls66 a caftan of cloth of gold a cachemire girdle and a pelisse of sables one glance at the mirror good i begin to look like the conqueror of the world  it was twilight a small and solitary boat with a single rower glided along the tigris and stopped at the archway of a house that descended into the river it stopped the boatman withdrew the curtains and his single passenger disembarked and ascended the stairs of the archway  the stranger reached the landingplace and unfastening a golden grate proceeded along a gallery and entered a beautiful saloon of white and green marble opening into gardens no one was in the apartment the stranger threw himself upon a silver couch placed at the side of a fountain that rose from the centre of the chamber and fell into a porphyry basin a soft whisper roused the stranger from his reverie a soft whisper that faintly uttered the word honain the stranger looked up a figure enveloped in a veil that touched the ground advanced from the gardens  honain said the advancing figure throwing off the veil honain ah the beautiful mute returned  a woman more lovely than the rosy morn beheld an unexpected guest they stood the lady and the stranger gazing on each other in silence a man with a light entered the extremity of the hall carefully he closed the portal slowly he advanced with a subdued step he approached the lady and the stranger  alroy said the astonished honain the light fell from his hand  alroy exclaimed the lady with a bewildered air she turned pale and leant against a column  daughter of the caliph said the leader of israel and he advanced and fell upon his knee and stole her passive hand i am indeed that alroy to whom destiny has delivered the empire of thy sire but the princess schirene can have nothing to fear from one who values above all his victories this memorial of her goodwill and he took from his breast a rosary of pearls and emeralds and rising slowly left it in her trembling hand  the princess turned and hid her face in her arm which reclined against the column  my kind honain said alroy you thought me forgetful of the past you thought me ungrateful my presence here proves that i am not so i come to enquire all your wishes i come to gratify and to fulfil them if that be in my power  sire replied honain who had recovered from the emotion in which he rarely indulged and from the surprise which seldom entrapped him sire my wishes are slight you see before you the daughter of my master an interview for which i fear i shall not easily gain that ladys pardon has made you somewhat acquainted with her situation and her sentiments the princess schirene seized the opportunity of the late convulsions to escape from a mode of life long repugnant to all her feelings and from a destiny at which she trembled i was her only counsellor and she may feel assured a faithful although perhaps an indiscreet one the irresistible solicitation of the inhabitants that i should become their deputy to their conqueror prevented us from escaping as we had intended since then from the movement of the troops i have deemed it more prudent that we should remain at present here although i have circulated the intelligence of my departure in the kiosk of my garden the princess is now a willing prisoner at twilight she steals forth for the poor relaxation of my society to listen to the intelligence which i acquire during the day in disguise the history sire is short and simple we are in your power but instead of deprecating your interference i now solicit your protection  dear honain tis needless the princess schirene has only to express a wish that it may be fulfilled i came to speak with you on weighty matters honain but i retire for i am an intruder now tomorrow if it please you at this hour and in this disguise i will again repair hither in the meantime this lady may perchance express to you her wishes and you will bear them to me if an escort to any country if any palace or province for her rule and residence but i will not offer to one who should command lady farewell pardon the past tomorrow good honain prythee let us meet good even  the royal brow was clouded said ithamar to asriel as departing from the council they entered their magnificent barque  with thought he has so much upon his mind tis wondrous how he bears himself  i have seen him gay on the eve of battle and lively though calm with weightier matters than now oppress him his brow was clouded but not methinks with thought one might rather say with temper mark you how he rated jabaster  roundly the stern priest writhed under it and as he signed the ordinance shivered his reed in rage i never saw a man more pale  or more silent he looked like an embodied storm i tell you what asriel that stern priest loves not us  have you just discovered that secret ithamar we are not of his school nor in good faith is our ruler i am glad to see the king is so staunch about abidan were he in council he would support jabaster  oh his mere tool what think you of scherirah  i would not trust him as long as there is fighting he will meddle with nothing else but mark my words ithamar in quiet times he will support the priest  medad will have a place in council he is with us  heart and soul i would your brother were here asriel he alone could balance jabaster alroy loves your brother like himself is it true that he marries the lady miriam  so the king wishes twill be a fine match for abner  the world is all before us i wonder who will be viceroy of syria  when we conquer it not scherirah mark my words ithamar he never will have a government you or i perchance for my own part i would rather remain as i am  yours is a good post the best  with the command of the city it should go with the guard  well then help me in getting syria and you can ask for my command  agreed jabaster will have it that in a hebrew monarchy the chief priest is in fact the grand vizir  alroy will be his own minister  i am not so sure of that he may choose to command the syrian expedition in person he must leave some head at bagdad jabaster is no general  oh none at all alroy will be glad to leave him at home the sultan of roum may not be always so merciful  hah hah that was an escape  by heavens i thought it was all over you made a fine charge  i shall never forget it i nearly ran over jabaster  would that you had  it is the tender twilight hour when maidens in their lonely bower sigh softer than the eve the languid rose her head upraises and listens to the nightingale while his wild and thrilling praises from his trembling bosom gush the languid rose her head upraises and listens with a blush  in the clear and rosy air sparkling with a single star the sharp and spiry cypresstree rises like a gloomy thought amid the flow of revelry a singing bird a single star a solemn tree an odorous flower are dangerous in the tender hour when maidens in their twilight bower sigh softer than the eve  the daughter of the caliph comes forth to breathe the air her lute her only company she sits her down by a fountains side and gazes on the waterfall her cheek reclines upon her arm like fruit upon a graceful bough very pensive is the face of that bright and beauteous lady she starts a warm voluptuous lip presses her soft and idle hand it is her own gazelle with his large and lustrous eyes more eloquent than many a tongue the fond attendant mutely asks the cause of all her thoughtfulness  ah bright gazelle ah bright gazelle the princess cried the princess cried thy lips are softer than the swan thy lips are softer than the swan but his breathed passion when they pressed my bright gazelle my bright gazelle  ah bright gazelle ah bright gazelle the princess cried the princess cried thine eyes are like the stars of night thine eyes are like the stars of night but his glanced passion when they gazed my bright gazelle my bright gazelle  she seized her lute she wildly threw her fingers oer its thrilling strings and gazing on the rosy sky to borrow all its poetry thus thus she sangthus thus she sang       he rose in beauty like the morn      that brightens in bur syrian skies      dark passion glittered in his eyes      and empire sparkled in his form       my soul thou art the dusky earth      on which his sunlight fell      the dusky earth that dim no longer      now breathes with light now beams with love       he rose in beauty like the morn      that brightens in our syrian skies      dark passion glittered in his eyes      and empire sparkled in his form  illustration page174  once more once more ah sing that strain once more  the princess started and looked round before her stood alroy she rose she would have retired but advancing the conqueror stole her hand  fair princess said alroy let it not be said that my presence banished at once beauty and music  sire i doubt not that honain awaits you let me summon him  lady it is not with honain that i would speak  he seated himself by her side his countenance was pale his heart trembled  this garden at length he observed in a low voice this garden a brief brief space has glided away since first i wandered within its beauteous limits and yet those days seem like the distant memory of another life  it is another life said the princess ourselves the world all forms and usages all feelings and all habits verily they have changed as if we had breathed within another sphere  tis a great change  since first you visited my bright kiosk pretty bauble i pray it may be spared  it is sacred like yourself  you are a courteous conqueror  i am no conqueror fair schirene but a slave more lowly than when i first bowed humbly in your presence  and bore away a token not forgotten your rosary is here  let me claim it it has been my consolation in much peril beauteous lady on the eve of battle i wound it round my heart  she held forth the rosary and turned away her head her hand remained in his he pressed it to his lips his right arm retained her hand he wound the other round her waist as he fell upon his knee  o beautiful o more than beautiful for thou to me art like a dream unbroken exclaimed the young leader of israel let me let me breathe my adoration i offer thee not empire i offer thee not wealth i offer thee not all the boundless gratification of magnificent fancythese may be thine but all these thou hast proved but if the passionate affections of a spirit which never has yielded to the power of woman or the might of man if the deep devotion of the soul of alroy be deemed an offering meet for the shrine of thy surpassing loveliness i worship thee schirene i worship thee i worship thee  since i first gazed upon thee since thy beauty first rose upon my presence like a star bright with my destiny in the still sanctuary of my secret love thy idol has ever rested then then i was a thing whose very touch thy creed might count a contumely i have avenged the insults of long centuries in the best blood of asia i have returned in glory and in pride to claim my ancient sceptre but sweeter far than vengeance sweeter far than the quick gathering of my sacred tribes the rush of triumph and the blaze of empire is this brief moment of adoring love wherein i pour the passion of my life  o my soul my life my very being thou art silent but thy silence is sweeter than others speech yield yield thee dear schirene yield to thy suppliant thy faith thy fathers faith thy native customs these these shall be respected beauteous lady pharaohs daughter yielded her dusky beauty to my great ancestor thy face is like the bright inspiring day let it not be said that the daughter of the nile shared israels crown the daughter of the tigris spurned our sceptre i am not solomon but i am one that were schirene the partner of my throne would make his glowing annals read like a wearisome and misty tale to our surpassing lustre  he ceased the princess turned her hitherto hidden countenance and bowed it on his heart o alroy she exclaimed i have no creed no country no life but thee  the king is late today  is it true asriel there is an express from hamadan  of no moment ithamar i have private letters from abner all is quiet  tis much past the hour when do you depart scherirah  the troops are ready i wait orders this mornings council will perchance decide  this mornings council is devoted to the settlement of the civil affairs of the capital remarked jabaster  indeed said asriel is your report prepared jabaster  tis here replied the high priest the hebrew legislator requires but little musing to shape his order he has a model which time cannot destroy nor thought improve  ithamar and asriel exchanged significant glances scherirah looked solemn there was a pause which was broken by asriel  tis a noble city this bagdad i have not yet visited your quarters jabaster you are well placed  as it may be i hope we shall not tarry here long the great point is still not achieved  how far is it to the holy city enquired scherirah  a months march replied jabaster  and when you get there enquired ithamar  you may fight with the franks replied asriel  jabaster how large is jerusalem enquired ithamar is it true as i have sometimes heard that it is not bigger than the serail here gardens and all  its glory hath departed replied the high priest the bricks have fallen but we will rebuild with marble and zion that is now without the christian walls shall yet sparkle as in the olden time with palaces and pavilions  a flourish of trumpets the portals flew open and alroy entered leaning on the arm of the envoy of bagdad  valiant leaders said alroy to the astonished chieftains in this noble stranger you see one like yourselves entrusted with my unbounded confidence jabaster behold thy brother  honain art thou honain exclaimed the pontiff starting from his seat i have a thousand messengers after thee with a countenance alternately pallid with surprise and burning with affection jabaster embraced his brother and overpowered with emotion hid his face on his shoulder  sire at length exclaimed the high priest in a low and tremulous voice i must pray your pardon that for an instant in this character i have indulged in any other thoughts than those that may concern your welfare tis past and you who know all will forgive me  all that respects jabaster must concern my welfare he is the pillar of my empire and holding forth his hand alroy placed the high priest on his right scherirah you depart this eve  the rough captain bowed in silence  what is this continued alroy as jabaster offered him a scroll ah your report order of the tribes service of the lévites princes of the people elders of israel the day may come when this may be effected at present jabaster we must be moderate and content ourselves with arrangements which may ensure that order shall be maintained property respected and justice administered is it true that a gang has rifled a mosque  sire of that i would speak they are no plunderers but men perhaps too zealous who have read and who have remembered that ye shall utterly destroy all the places wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods upon the high mountains and upon the hill and under every green tree and ye shall overthrow their altars and  jabaster is this a synagogue come i to a council of valiant statesmen or dreaming rabbis for a thousand years we have been quoting the laws we dared not practise is it with such aid that we captured nishapur and crossed the tigris valiant wise jabaster thou art worthy of better things and capable of all i entreat thee urge such matters for the last time are these fellows in custody  they were in custody i have freed them  freed them hang them hang them in the most public grove is this the way to make the moslem a duteous subject jabaster israel honours thee and i its chief know that one more true more valiant or more learned crowds not around our standard but i see the caverns of the caucasus are not a school for empire  sire i had humbly deemed the school for empire was the law of moses  ay adapted to these times  can aught divine be changed  am i as tall as adam if man the crown the rose of all this fair creation the most divine of all divine inventions if time have altered even this choicest of all godlike works why shall it spare a law made but to rule his conduct good jabaster we must establish the throne of israel that is my mission and for the means no matter how or where asriel what news of medad  all is quiet between the tigris and euphrates it would be better to recall his division which has been much harassed i thought of relieving him by abidan  i think so too we may as well keep abidan out of the city if the truth were known ill wager some of his company plundered the mosque we must issue a proclamation on that subject my good jabaster well talk over these matters alone at present i will leave you with your brother scherirah sup with me tonight before you quit asriel come with me to my cabinet  i must see the king  holy priest his highness has retired it is impossible  i must see the king worthy pharez i take all peril on myself  indeed his highness orders are imperative you cannot see him  knowest thou who i am  one whom all pious hebrews reverence  i say i must see the king  indeed indeed holy jabaster it cannot be  shall israel perish for a menials place go to i will see him  nay if you will ill struggle for my duty  touch not the lords anointed dog you shall suffer for this  so saying jabaster threw aside pharez and with the attendant clinging to his robes rushed into the royal chamber  what is all this exclaimed alroy starting from the divan jabaster pharez withdraw how now is bagdad in insurrection  worse much worse israel soon will be  ay  my fatal brother has told me all nor would i sleep until i lifted up my voice to save thee  am i in danger  in the wilderness when the broad desert quivered beneath thy trembling feet and the dark heavens poured down their burning torrents thou wert less so in that hour of death one guarded thee who never forgets his fond and faithful offspring and now when he has brought thee out of the house of bondage now when thy fortunes like a noble cedar swell in the air and shadow all the land thou the very leader of his people his chosen one for whom he hath worked such marvels thy heart is turned from thy fathers god and hankers after strange abominations  through the broad arch that led into the gardens of the serail the moonlight fell upon the tall figure and the upraised arm of the priest alroy stood with folded arms at some distance watching jabaster as he spoke with a calm but searching glance suddenly he advanced with a quick step and placing his hand upon jabasters arm said in a low enquiring tone you are speaking of this marriage  of that which ruined solomon  listen to me jabaster said alroy interrupting him in a calm but peremptory tone i cannot forget that i am speaking to my master as well as to my friend the lord who knoweth all things hath deemed me worthy of his mission my fitness for this high and holy office was not admitted without proof a lineage which none else could offer mystic studies shared by few a mind that dared encounter all things and a frame that could endure most these were my claims but no more of this i have passed the great ordeal the lord of hosts hath found me not unworthy of his charge i have established his ancient people his altars blaze with sacrifices his priests are honoured bear witness thou jabaster his omnipotent unity is declared what wouldst thou more  all  then moses knew you well it is a stiffnecked people  sire bear with me if i speak in heat i speak in zeal you ask me what i wish my answer is a national existence which we have not you ask me what i wish my answer is the land of promise you ask me what i wish my answer is jerusalem you ask me what i wish my answer is the temple all we have forfeited all we have yearned after all for which we have fought our beauteous country our holy creed our simple manners and our ancient customs  manners change with time and circumstances customs may be observed everywhere the ephod on thy breast proves our faith and for a country is the tigris less than siloah or the euphrates inferior to the jordan  alas alas there was a glorious prime when israel stood aloof from other nations a fair and holy thing that god had hallowed we were then a chosen family a most peculiar people set apart for gods entire enjoyment all about us was solemn deep and holy we shunned the stranger as an unclean thing that must defile our solitary sanctity and keeping to ourselves and to our god our lives flowed on in one great solemn tide of deep religion making the meanest of our multitude feel greater than the kings of other lands it was a glorious time i thought it had returned but i awake from this as other dreams  we must leave off dreaming good jabaster we must act were i by any chance to fall into one of those reveries with which i have often lost the golden hours at hamadan or in our old cave i should hear some fine morning his sultanship of roum rattling at my gates alroy smiled as he spoke he would willingly have introduced a lighter tone into the dialogue but the solemn countenance of the priest was not sympathetic with his levity  my heart is full and yet i cannot speak the memory of the past overpowers my thought i had vainly deemed that my voice inspired by the soul of truth might yet preserve him and now i stand here in his presence silent and trembling like a guilty thing o my prince my pupil said the priest advancing falling on his knee and seizing the robe of alroy by thy sacred lineage by the sweet memory of thy ardent youth and our united studies by all thy zealous thoughts and solemn musings and glorious aspirations after fame by all thy sufferings and by all thy triumphs and chiefly by the name of that great god who hath elected thee his favoured child by all the marvels of thy mighty mission i do adjure thee arise alroy arise and rouse thyself the lure that snared thy fathers may trap thee this delilah may shear thy mystic locks spirits like thee act not by halves once fall out from the straight course before thee and though thou deemest tis but to saunter mid the summer trees soon thou wilt find thyself in the dark depths of some infernal forest where none may rescue thee  what if i do inherit the eager blood of my great ancestor at least i hold his sceptre shall aught of earthly power prevail against the supernatural sway of heaven and hades  sire sire the legend that came from sinai is full of high instruction but shape thy conduct by its oracles and all were well it says our people can be established only by him who rules them with the rod of solomon sire when the lord offered his pleasure to that mighty king thou knowest his deep discretion riches and length of days empire and vengeance these were not the choice of one to whom all accidents were proffered the legend bears an inward spirit as well as an outward meaning the capture of the prize was a wise test of thy imperial fitness thou hast his sceptre but without his wisdom tis but a staff of cedar  hah art thou there i am glad to see jabaster politic hear me my friend what my feelings be unto this royal lady but little matters let them pass and let us view this question by the light wherein you have placed it the flame of policy and not of passion i am no traitor to the god of israel in whose name i have conquered and in whose name i shall rule but thou art a learned doctor thou canst inform us i have heard no mandate to yield my glorious empire for my meanest province i am lord of asia so would i have my long posterity our people are but a remnant a feeble fraction of the teeming millions that own my sway what i hold i can defend but my children may not inherit the spirit of their sire the moslemin will recognise their rule with readier hearts when they remember that a daughter of their caliphs gave them life you see i too am politic my good jabaster  the policy of the son of kareah67 twas fatal he preferred egypt to judah and he suffered sire the lord hath blessed judah it is his land he would have it filled by his peculiar people so that his worship might ever flourish for this he has by many curious rites and customs marked us out from all other nations so that we cannot at the same time mingle with them and yet be true to him we must exist alone to preserve that loneliness is the great end and essence of our law what have we to do with bagdad or its people where every instant we must witness some violation of our statutes can we pray with them can we eat with them alike in the highest duties and the lowest occupations of existence we cannot mingle from the altar of our god to our domestic boards we are alike separated from them sire you may be king of bagdad but you cannot at the same time be a jew  i am what i am i worship the lord of hosts perhaps in his mercy he will accept the days of nishapur and the tigris as a compensation for some slight relaxation in the ritual of the baker and the bath  and mark my words it was by the ritual of the baker and the bath that alroy rose and without it he will fall the genius of the people which he shared raised him and that genius has been formed by the law of moses based on that law he might indeed have handed down an empire to his long posterity and now though the tree of his fortunes seems springing up by the waterside fed by a thousand springs and its branches covered with dew there is a gangrene in the sap and tomorrow he may shrink like a shrivelled gourd alas alas for israel we have long fed on mallows but to lose the vintage in the very day of fruition tis very bitter ah when i raised thy exhausted form in the cavern of genthesma and the star of david beamed brightly in the glowing heavens upon thy high fulfilment who could have dreamed of a night like this farewell sire  stop jabaster earliest dearest friend prythee prythee stop  the priest slowly turned the prince hesitated  part not in anger good jabaster  in sorrow sire only in sorrow but deep and terrible  israel is lord of asia my jabaster why should we fear  solomon built tadmor in the wilderness and his fleet brought gold from ophir and yet alroy was born a slave  but did not die one the sultans of the world have fallen before me i have no fear nay do not go at least you will give some credence to the stars my learned cabalist see my planet shines as brightly as my fortunes alroy withdrew the curtain and with jabaster stepped out upon the terrace a beautiful star glittered on high as they gazed its colour changed and a bloodred meteor burst from its circle and fell into space the conqueror and the priest looked at each other at the same time their countenances were pale enquiring and agitated  sire said jabaster march to judah  it portends war replied alroy endeavouring to recover himself perchance some troubles in persia  troubles at home no other the danger is nigh look to thyself  a wild scream was heard in the gardens it sounded thrice  what is this exclaimed alroy really agitated rouse the guard jabaster search the gardens  tis useless and may do harm it was a spirit that shrieked  what said it  mené mené tekel upharsin  the old story the priest against the king said honain to alroy when at his morrows interview he had listened to the events of the preceding night my pious brother wishes to lead you back to the theocracy and is fearful that if he prays at bagdad instead of zion he may chance to become only the head of an inferior sect instead of revelling in the universal tithes of a whole nation as for the meteor scherirah must have crossed the river about the same time and the sultan of roum may explain the bloody portent for the shriek as i really have no acquaintance with spirits i must leave the miraculous communication to the favoured ears and initiated intelligences of your highness and my brother it seems that it differed from the daughter of the voice in more respects than one since it was not only extremely noisy but as it would appear quite unintelligible except to the individual who had an interest in the interpretation an ingenious one i confess when i enter upon my functions as your highnesss chamberlain i will at least guarantee that your slumbers shall not be disturbed either by spirits or more unwelcome visitors  enter upon them at once good honain how fares my persian rose today my sweet schirene  feeding on your image in your absence she spares no word to me i do assure your highness  nay nay we know you are a general favourite with the sex honain ifaith im jealous  i would your highness had cause said honain demurely  the approaching marriage between the king of the hebrews and the princess of bagdad was published throughout asia preparations were made on the plain of the tigris for the great rejoicing whole forests were felled to provide materials for the buildings and fuel for the banqueting all the governors of provinces and cities all the chief officers and nobility of both nations were specially invited and daily arrived in state at bagdad among them the viceroy of the medes and persians and his recent bride the princess miriam were conspicuous followed by a train of nearly ten thousand persons  a throne ascended by one hundred steps covered with crimson cloth and crowned by a golden canopy was raised in the middle of the plain on each side was a throne less elevated but equally gorgeous in the front of these thrones an immense circus was described formed by one hundred chartaks or amphitheatres ample room for the admittance of the multitude being left between the buildings these chartaks were covered with bright brocades and showy carpets on each was hoisted a brilliant banner in some of them were bands of choice musicians in others companies of jugglers buffoons and storiers five chartaks on each side of the thrones were allotted for the convenience of the court the rest were filled by the different trades of the city in one the fruiterers had formed a beautiful garden glowing with pomegranates and gourds and watermelons oranges almonds and pistachionuts in another the butchers exhibited their meats carved in fanciful shapes and the skins of animals formed into ludicrous figures here assembled the furriers all dressed in masquerade like leopards lions tigers and foxes and in another booth mustered the upholsterers proud of a camel made of wood and reeds and cord and painted linen a camel which walked about as if alive though ever and anon a curtain drawn aside discovered to the marvelling multitude the workman within performing in his own piece further on might be perceived the cotton manufacturers whose chartak was full of birds of all shapes and plumage formed nevertheless of their curious plant and in the centre rose a lofty minaret constructed of the same material with the help of reeds although every one imagined it to be built with bricks and mortar it was covered with embroidered work and on the top was placed a stork so cunningly devised that the children pelted it with pistachionuts the saddlers showed their skill in two litters open at top each carried on a dromedary and in each a beautiful woman who diverted the spectators with light balls of gilt leather throwing them up both with their hands and feet nor were the matmakers backward in the proof of their dexterity since instead of a common banner they exhibited a large standard of reeds worked with two lines of writing in kufic proclaiming the happy names of alroy and schirene  but indeed in every chartak might be seen some wondrous specimens of the wealth of bagdad and of the ingenuity of its unrivalled artisans  around this mighty circus on every side for the space of many miles the plain was studded with innumerable pavilions at measured intervals were tables furnished with every species of provision and attended by appointed servants flagons of wine and jars of sherbets mingled with infinite baskets of delicious fruits and trays of refreshing confectionery although open to all comers so great and rapid was the supply that these banqueting tables seemed ever laden and that the joys of the people might be complete they were allowed to pursue whatever pleasures they thought fit without any restraint by proclamation in these terms  this is the time of feasting pleasure and rejoicing let no person reprimand or complain of another let not the rich insult the poor or the strong the weak let no one ask another why have you done this   millions of people were collected in this paradise they rejoiced they feasted they frolicked they danced they sang they listened to the tales of the arabian storyteller at once enchanted and enchanting or melted to the strain of the persian poet as he painted the moonlit forehead of his heroine and the wasting and shadowy form of his lovesick hero they beheld with amazement the feats of the juggler of the ganges or giggled at the practised wit and the practical buffoonery of the syrian mime and the most delighted could still spare a fascinating glance to the inviting gestures and the voluptuous grace of the dancing girls of egypt68 everywhere reigned melody and merriment rarity and beauty for once mankind forgot their cares and delivered themselves up to infinite enjoyment  i grow

dainties  where are you going you accursed scoundrels grumbled kisloch wait upon the true believers we shall be more free alone whispered calidas away then dogs growled kisloch abdallah and his attendants hurried off but were soon summoned back  why did you not bring schiraz wine asked calidas with an eye of fire  the pilau is overdone thundered kisloch you have brought a lamb stuffed with

crowded with the court  the deputations made their offerings the chiefs and captains paid their homage the trades of the city moved before the throne in order and exhibited their various ingenuity thrice was the proclamation made amid the sound of trumpets and then began the games  a thousand horsemen dashed into the arena and threw the jerreed they galloped at full speed they arrested their fiery charges in mid course and flung their long javelins at the minute but sparkling target the imitative form of a rare and brilliant bird the conquerors received their prizes from the hand of the princess herself bright shawls and jewelled daggers and rosaries of gems sometimes the trumpets announced a prize from the vicequeen sometimes from the venerable bostenay sometimes from the victorious generals or the loyal deputations sometimes from the united trades sometimes from the city of bagdad sometimes from the city of hamadan the hours flew away in gorgeous and ceaseless variety  i would we were alone my own schirene said alroy to his bride  i would so too and yet i love to see all asia prostrate at the feet of alroy  will the sun never set give me thy hand to play with  hush see miriam smiles  lovest thou my sister my own schirene  none dearer but thyself  talk not of my sister but ourselves thinkest thou the sun is nearer setting love  i cannot see thine eyes they dazzle me they are so brilliant sweet  oh my soul i could pour out my passion on thy breast  thou art very serious  love is ever so  nay sweet it makes me wild and fanciful now i could do such things but what i know not i would we had wings and then we would fly away  see i must salute this victor in the games must i unloose thy hand dear hand farewell think of me while i speak my precious life tis done give back thy hand or else methinks i shall die whats this  a horseman in no holiday dress but covered with dust rushed into the circus bearing in his hand a tall lance on which was fixed a scroll the marshals of the games endeavoured to prevent his advance but he would not be stayed his message was to the king alone a rumour of news from the army circulated throughout the crowd and news from the army it was another victory scherirah had defeated the sultan of roum who was now a suppliant for peace and alliance sooth to say the intelligence had arrived at dawn of day but the courtly honain had contrived that it should be communicated at a later and more effective moment  there scarcely needed this additional excitement to this glorious day but the people cheered the golden dirhems were scattered with renewed profusion and the intelligence was received by all parties as a solemn ratification by jehovah or by allah of the morning ceremony  the sun set the court rose and returned in the same pomp to the serail the twilight died away a beacon fired on a distant eminence announced the entrance of alroy and schirene into the nuptial chamber and suddenly as by magic the mighty city every mosque and minaret and tower and terrace and the universal plain and the numberless pavilions and the immense circus and the vast and winding river blazed with light from every spot a lamp a torch a lantern tinted with every hue burst forth enormous cressets of silver radiancy beamed on the top of each chartak and huge bonfires of ruddy flame started up along the whole horizon  for seven days and seven nights this unparalleled scene of rejoicing though ever various never ceased long long was remembered the bridal feast of the hebrew prince and the caliphs daughter long long did the peasantry on the plains of tigris sit down by the side of that starry river and tell the wondrous tale to their marvelling posterity  now what a glorious man was david alroy lord of the mightiest empire in the world and wedded to the most beautiful princess surrounded by a prosperous and obedient people guarded by invincible armies one on whom earth showered all its fortune and heaven all its favour and all by the power of his own genius     chapter ix       the death of jabaster  twas midnight and the storm still raged mid the roar of the thunder and the shrieks of the wind the floods of forky lightning each instant revealed the broad and billowy breast of the troubled tigris jabaster stood gazing upon the wild scene from the gallery of his palace his countenance was solemn but disquieted  i would that he were here exclaimed the high priest yet why should i desire his presence who heralds only gloom yet in his absence am i gay i am nothing this bagdad weighs upon me like a cloak of lead my spirit is dull and broken  they say alroy gives a grand banquet in the serail tonight and toasts his harlot mid the thunderbolts is there no hand to write upon the wall he is found wanting he is weighed and is indeed found wanting the parting of his kingdom soon will come and then i could weep oh i could weep and down these stern and seldom yielding cheeks pour the wild anguish of my desperate woe so young so great so favoured but one more step a god and now a foul belshazzar  was it for this his gentle youth was passed in musing solitude and mystic studies was it for this the holy messenger summoned his most religious spirit was it for this he crossed the fiery desert and communed with his fathers in their tombs is this the end of all his victories and all his vast achievements to banquet with a wanton  a year ago this very night it was the eve of battle i stood within his tent to wait his final word he mused awhile and then he said good night jabaster i believed myself the nearest to his heart as he has ever been nearest to mine but thats all over he never says good night jabaster now why whats all this methinks i am a child  the lords anointed is a prisoner now in the light grating of a bright kiosk and never gazes on the world he conquered egypt and syria even farthest ind send forth their messengers to greet alroy the great the proud the invincible and where is he in a soft paradise of girls and eunuchs crowned with flowers listening to melting lays and the wild trilling of the amorous lute he spares no hours to council all is left to his prime favourites of whom the leader is that juggling fiend i sometime called my brother  why rest i here whither should i fly methinks my presence is still a link to decency should i tear off the ephod i scarcely fancy twould blaze upon anothers breast he goes not to the sacrifice they say he keeps no fast observes no ritual and that their festive fantasies will not be balked even by the sabbath i have not seen him thrice since the marriage honain has told her i did oppose it and she bears to me a hatred that only women feel our strong passions break into a thousand purposes women have one their love is dangerous but their hate is fatal  see a boat bounding on the waters on such a night but one would dare to venture  now visible now in darkness a single lantern at the prow jabaster watched with some anxiety the slight bark buffeting the waves a flash of lightning illumined the whole river and tipped with a spectral light even the distant piles of building the boat and the toiling figure of the single rower were distinctly perceptible now all again was darkness the wind suddenly subsided in a few minutes the plash of the oars was audible and the boat apparently stopped beneath the palace  there was a knocking at the private portal  who knocks enquired jabaster  a friend to israel  abidan by his voice art thou alone  the prophetess is with me only she  a moment ill open the gate draw the boat within the arch  jabaster descended from the gallery and in a few moments returned with two visitors the youthful prophetess esther and her companion a man short in stature but with a powerful and wellknit frame his countenance was melancholy and with harshness in the lower part not without a degree of pensive beauty in the broad clear brow and sunken eyes unusual in oriental visages  a rough night said jabaster  to those who fear it replied abidan the sun has brought so little joy to me i care not for the storm  what news  woe woe woe  thy usual note my sister will the day never come when we may change it  woe woe woe unutterable woe  abidan how fares it  very well  indeed  as it may turn out  you are brief  bitter  have you been to court that you have learnt to be so wary in your words my friend  i know not what may happen in time we may all become courtiers though i fear jabaster we have done too much to be rewarded i gave him my blood and you something more and now we are at bagdad tis a fine city i wish to heaven the shower of sodom would rain upon its terraces  i know thou hast something terrible to tell i know it by that gloomy brow of thine that lowers like the tempest speak out man i can bear the worst for which i am prepared  take it then alroy has proclaimed himself caliph abner is made sultan of persia asriel ithamar medad and the chief captains vizirs honain their chief four moslem nobles are sworn into the council the princess goes to mosque in state next friday tis said thy pupil doth accompany her  ill not believe it by the god of sinai ill not believe it were my own eye the accursed witness of the deed id not believe it go to mosque they play with thee my good abidan they play with thee  as it may be tis a rumour but rumours herald deeds the rest of my intelligence is true i had it from my kinsman stout zalmunna he left the banquet  shall i go to him methinks one single word to mosque only a rumour and a false one ill never believe it no no no never never is he not the lords anointed the ineffable curse upon this daughter ot the moabite no marvel that it thunders by heavens ill go and beard him in his orgies  you know your power better than abidan you bearded him before his marriage yet  he married tis true honain their chief and i kept his ring honain is my brother have i neer a dagger to cut the bond of brotherhood  we have all daggers jabaster if we knew but how to use them  tis strange we met after twenty years of severance you were not in the chamber abidan twas at council we met after twenty years of severance he is my brother tis strange i say i felt that man shrink from my embrace  honain is a philosopher and believes in sympathy twould appear there was none between you his system then absolves you from all ties  you are sure the rest of the intelligence is true ill not believe the mosque the rest is bad enough  zalmunna left the banquet hassan subahs brother sat above him  subahs brother tis all over then is he of the council  ay and others  where now is israel  she should be in her tents  woe woe unutterable woe exclaimed the prophetess who standing motionless at the back of the chamber seemed inattentive to their conversation  jabaster paced the gallery with agitated steps suddenly he stopped and walking up to abidan seized his arm and looked him sternly in the face i know thy thoughts abidan exclaimed the priest but it cannot be i have dismissed henceforth and for ever i have dismissed all feeling from my mind now i have no brother no friend no pupil and i fear no saviour israel is all in all to me i have no other life tis not compunction then that stays my arm my hearts as hard as thine  why stays it then  because with him we fall he is the last of all his sacred line there is no other hand to grasp our sceptre  our sceptre what sceptre  the sceptre of our kings  kings  ay why dost thou look so dark  how looked the prophet when the stiffnecked populace forsooth must have a king did he smile did he shout and clap his hands and cry god save his majesty o jabaster honoured rare jabaster thou second samuel of our lightheaded people there was a time when israel had no king except their god were we viler then did kings conquer canaan who was moses who was aaron who was mighty joshua was the sword of gideon a kingly sword did the locks of samson shade royal temples would a king have kept his awful covenant like solemn jephtha royal words are light as air when to maintain them you injure any other than a subject  kings why whats a king why should one man break the equal sanctity of our chosen race is their blood purer than our own we are all the seed of abraham who was saul and who was david i never heard that they were a different breed from our fathers grant them devout which they were not and brave and wise which other men were have their posterity a patent for all virtues no jabaster thou neer didst err but when thou placedst a crown upon this haughty stripling what he did a thousand might have done twas thy mind inspired the deed and now he is a king and now jabaster the very soul of israel who should be our judge and leader jabaster trembles in disgrace while our unhallowed sanhedrim is filled with ammonites  abidan thou hast touched me to the quick thou hast stirred up thoughts that ever and anon like strong and fatal vapours have risen from the dark abyss of thought and i have quelled them  let them rise i say let them drown the beams of that allscorching sun we suffer under that drinks all vegetation up and makes us languish with a dull exhaustion  joy joy unutterable joy  hark the prophetess has changed her note and yet she hears us not the spirit of the lord is truly with her come jabaster i see thy heart is opening to thy peoples sufferings thy people my jabaster for art not thou our judge at least thou shalt be  can we call back the theocracy ist possible  but say the word and it is done jabaster nay stare not dost thou think there are no true hearts in israel dost thou suppose thy children have beheld without a thought the foul insults poured on thee thee their priest their adored high priest one who recalls the best days of the past the days of their great judges but one word one single movement of that mitred head and but i speak unto a mind that feels more than i can express be silent tongue thou art a babbling counsellor jabasters patriot soul needs not the idle schooling of a child if he be silent tis that his wisdom deems that the hour is not ripe but when her leader speaks israel will not be slack  the moslemin in council we know what must come next our national existence is in its last agony methinks the time is very ripe abidan  why so we think great sir and say the word and twenty thousand spears will guard the ark ill answer for my men stout scherirah looks grimly on the moabites a word from thee and the whole syrian army will join our banner the lion of judah that shall be our flag the tyrant and his satraps let them die and then the rest must join us well proclaim the covenant and leaving babylon to a bloody fate march on to zion  zion his youthful dream zion  you muse  king or no king he is the lords anointed shall this hand that poured the oil on his hallowed head wash out the balmy signet with his blood must i slay him shall this kid be seethed even in its mothers milk  his voice is low and yet his face is troubled how now sir  what art thou ah abidan trusty stanch abidan you see abidan i was thinking my good abidan all this may be the frenzy of a revel tomorrows dawn may summon cooler counsels the tattle of the table it is sacred let us forget it let us pass it over the lord may turn his heart who knows who knows abidan  noble sir a moment since your mind was like your faith firm and resolved and now  school me not school me not good abidan there is that within my mind you cannot fathom some secret sorrows which are all my own leave me good friend leave me awhile when israel calls me i shall not be wanting be sure of that abidan be sure of that nay do not go the night is very rough and the fair prophetess should not again stem the swelling river ill to my closet and will soon return  jabaster quitted the gallery and entered a small apartment several large volumes unclasped and open were lying on various parts of the divan before them stood his brazen cabalistic table he closed the chamber with a cautious air he advanced into the centre of the apartment he lifted up his hands to heaven and clasped them with an expression almost of agony  is it come to this he muttered in a tone of deep oppression is it come to this what ist i have heard what done down tempting devil down o life o glory o my country my chosen people and my sacred creed why do we live why act why have we feeling for aught thats famous or for aught thats holy let me die let let me die the torture of existence is too great  he flung himself upon the couch he buried his awful countenance in his robes his mighty heart was convulsed with passion there did he lie that great and solemn man prostrate and woebegone  the noisy banquet lingers in my ear i love to be alone  with me  thou art myself i have no other life  sweet bird it is now a caliph  i am what thou wiliest soul of my sweet existence pomp and dominion fame and victory seem now but flawed and dimlyshaded gems compared with thy bright smile  my plaintive nightingale shall we hunt today  alas my rose i would rather lie upon this lazy couch and gaze upon thy beauty  or sail upon the cool and azure lake in some bright barque like to a seanymphs shell and followed by the swans  there is no lake so blue as thy deep eye there is no swan so white as thy round arm  or shall we launch our falcons in the air and bring the golden pheasant to our feet  i am the golden pheasant at thy feet why wouldst thou richer prey  rememberest thou thy earliest visit to this dear kiosk my gentle mute there thou stoodst with folded arms and looks demure as day and ever and anon with those dark eyes stealing a glance which made my cheek quite pale methinks i see thee even yet shy bird dost know i was so foolish when it quitted me dost know i cried  ah no thou didst not cry  indeed i think i did  tell me again my own schirene indeed didst cry  indeed i did my soul  i would those tears were in some crystal vase id give a province for the costly urn  she threw her arms around his neck and covered his face with kisses  sunset sounded from the minarets they arose and wandered together in the surrounding paradise the sky was tinted with a pale violet flush a single star floating by the side of the white moon that beamed with a dim lustre soft and shapely as a pearl  beautiful exclaimed the pensive schirene as she gazed upon the star o my alroy why cannot we ever live alone and ever in a paradise  i am wearied of empire replied alroy with a smile let us fly  is there no island with all that can make life charming and yet impervious to man how little do we require ah if these gardens instead of being surrounded by hateful bagdad were only encompassed by some beautiful ocean  my heart we live in a paradise and are seldom disturbed thanks to honain  but the very consciousness that there are any other persons existing besides ourselves is to me painful every one who even thinks of you seems to rob me of a part of your being besides i am weary of pomp and palaces i should like to live in a sparry grot and sleep upon a couch of sweet leaves  this interesting discussion was disturbed by a dwarf who in addition to being very small and very ugly was dumb he bowed before the princess and then had recourse to a great deal of pantomimic action by which she discovered that it was dinnertime no other person could have ventured to disturb the royal pair but this little being was a privileged favourite  so alroy and schirene entered the serail an immense cressetlamp fed with perfumed oil threw a soft light round the sumptuous chamber at the end stood a row of eunuchs in scarlet dresses and each holding a tall silver staff the caliph and the sultana threw themselves upon a couch covered with a hundred cushions on one side stood a group consisting of the captain of the guard and other officers of the household on the other of beautiful female slaves magnificently attired  the line of domestics at the end of the apartment opened and a body of slaves advanced carrying trays of ivory and gold and ebony and silver covered with the choicest dainties curiously prepared these were in turn offered to the caliph and the sultana by their surrounding attendants the princess accepted a spoon made of a single pearl the long thin golden handle of which was studded with rubies and condescended to partake of some saffron soup of which she was fond afterwards she regaled herself with the breast of a cygnet stuffed with almonds and stewed with violets and cream having now a little satisfied her appetite and wishing to show a mark of her favour to a particular individual she ordered the captain of the guard instantly to send him the whole of the next course74 with her compliments her attention was then engaged with a dish of those delicate ortolans that feed upon the vineleaves of schiraz and with which the governor of nishapur took especial care that she should be well provided tearing the delicate birds to pieces with her still more delicate fingers she insisted upon feeding alroy who of course yielded to her solicitations in the meantime they refreshed themselves with their favourite sherbet of pomegranates and the golden wine of mount lebanon76 the caliph who could eat no more ortolans although fed by such delicate fingers was at length obliged to call for rice which was synonymous to commanding the banquet to disappear the attendants now brought to each basins of gold and ewers of rock crystal filled with rose water with towels of that rare egyptian linen which can be made only of the cotton that grows upon the banks of the nile while they amused themselves with eating sugarplums and drinking coffee flavoured with cinnamon the female slaves danced before them in the most graceful attitudes to the melody of invisible musicians  my enchanting schirene said the caliph i have dined thanks to your attention very well these slaves of yours dance admirably and are exceedingly beautiful your music too is beyond all praise but for my own part i would rather be quite alone and listening to one of your songs  i have written a new one today you shall hear it so saying she clapped her little white hands and all the attendants immediately withdrew  the stars are stealing forth and so will i sorry sight to view jabaster with a stealthy step skulk like a thing dishonoured oh may the purpose consecrate the deed the die is cast  so saying the high priest muffled up in his robe emerged from his palace into the busy streets it is at night that the vitality of oriental life is most impressive the narrow winding streets crowded with a population breathing the now sufferable air the illuminated coffeehouses the groups of gay yet sober revellers the music and the dancing and the animated recitals of the poet and the storyteller all combine to invest the starry hours with a beguiling and even fascinating character of enjoyment and adventure  it was the night after the visit of abidan and the prophetess jabaster had agreed to meet abidan in the square of the great mosque two hours after sunset and thither he now repaired  i am somewhat before my time he said as he entered the great square over which the rising moon threw a full flood of light a few dark shadows of human beings alone moved in the distance the world was in the streets and coffeehouses i am somewhat before my time said jabaster conspirators are watchful i am anxious for the meeting and yet i dread it since he broke this business i have never slept my mind is a chaos i will not think if tis to be done let it be done at once i am more tempted to sheathe this dagger in jabasters breast than in alroys if life or empire were the paltry stake i would end a life that now can bring no joy and yield authority that hath no charm but israel israel thou for whom i have endured so much let me forget jabaster had a mother  but for this thought that links me with my god and leads my temper to a higher state how vain and sad how wearisome and void were this said world they think of but for this thought i could sit down and die yea my great heart could crack worn out worn out my mighty passions with their fierce but flickering flame sink down and die and the strong brain that ever hath urged my course and pricked me onward with perpetual thought desert the rudder it so long hath held like some baffled pilot in blank discomfiture in the far centre of an unknown sea  study and toil anxiety and sorrow mighty action perchance time and disappointment which is worse than all have done their work and not in vain i am no longer the same jabaster that gazed upon the stars of caucasus methinks even they look dimmer than of yore the glory of my life is fading my leaves are sear tinged but not tainted i am still the same in one respect i have not left my god in deed or thought ah who art thou  a friend to israel  i am glad that israel hath a friend noble abidan i have well considered all that hath passed between us sooth to say you touched upon a string ive played before but kept it for my loneliness a jarring tune indeed a jarring tune but so it is and being so let me at once unto your friends abidan  noble jabaster thou art what i deemed thee  abidan they say the consciousness of doing justly is the best basis of a happy mind  even so  and thou believest it  without doubt  we are doing very justly  tis a weak word for such a holy purpose  i am most wretched  the high priest and his companion entered the house of abidan jabaster addressed the already assembled guests  brave scherirah it joys me to find thee here in israels cause when was scherirah wanting stout zalmunna we have not seen enough of each other the blame is mine gentle prophetess thy blessing  good friends why we meet here is known to all little did we dream of such a meeting when we crossed the tigris but that is nothing we come to act and not to argue our great minds they are resolved our solemn purpose requires no demonstration if there be one among us who would have israel a slave to ishmael who would lose all we have prayed for all we have fought for all we have won and all for which we are prepared to die if there be one among us who would have the ark polluted and jehovahs altar stained with a gentile sacrifice if there be one among us who does not sigh for zion who would not yield his breath to build the temple and gain the heritage his fathers lost why let him go there is none such among us then stay and free your country  we are prepared great jabaster we are prepared all all  i know it you are like myself necessity hath taught decision now for our plans speak zalmunna  noble jabaster i see much difficulty alroy no longer quits his palace our entrance unwatched is you well know impossible what say you scherirah  i doubt not of my men but war against alroy is to say nought of danger of doubtful issue  i am prepared to die but not to fail said abidan we must be certain open war i fear the mass of the army will side with their leaders and they are with the tyrant let us do the deed and they must join us  is it impossible to gain his presence to some sacrifice in honour of some bygone victory what think ye  i doubt much jabaster at this moment he little wishes to sanction our national ceremonies with his royal person the woman assuredly will stay him and even if he come success is difficult and therefore doubtful  noble warriors list to a womans voice exclaimed the prophetess coming forward tis weak but with such instruments even the aspirations of a child the lord will commune with his chosen people there is a secret way by which i can gain the gardens of the palace tomorrow night just as the moon is in her midnight bower behold the accursed pile shall blaze let abidans troops be all prepared and at the moment when the flames first ascend march to the seraglio gate as if with aid the affrighted guard will offer no opposition while the troops secure the portals you yourselves zalmunna abidan and jabaster rush to the royal chamber and do the deed in the meantime let brave scherirah with his whole division surround the palace as if unconscious of the mighty work then come you forward show if it need with tears the fated body to the soldiery and announce the theocracy  it is the lord who speaks said abidan who was doubtless prepared for the proposition he has delivered them into our hands  a bold plan said jabaster musing and yet i like it tis quick and that is something i think tis sure  it cannot fail exclaimed zalmunna for if the flame ascend not still we are but where we were  i am for it said scherirah  well then said jabaster so let it be tomorrows eve will see us here again prepared good night  good night holy priest how seem the stars jabaster  very troubled so have they been some days what they portend i know not  health to israel  let us hope so good night sweet friends  good night holy jabaster thou art our cornerstone  israel hath no other hope but in jabaster  my lord said abidan remain i pray one moment  what ist i fain would go  alroy must die my lord but dost thou think a single death will seal the covenant  the woman  ay the woman i was not thinking of the woman asriel ithamar medad  valiant soldiers doubt not we shall find them useful instruments i do not fear such loose companions they follow their leaders like other things born to obey having no head themselves they must follow us who have  i think so too there is no other man who might be dangerous  zalmunna and scherirah cast their eyes upon the ground there was a dead silence broken by the prophetess  a judgment hath gone forth against honain nay he is lord jabasters brother said abidan  it is enough to save a more inveterate foe to israel if such there be  i have no brother sir the man you speak of i will not slay since there are others who may do that deed and so again good night  it was the dead of night a single lamp burned in the chamber which opened into an arched gallery that descended by a flight of steps into the gardens of the serail  a female figure ascended the flight with slow and cautious steps she paused on the gallery she looked around one foot was in the chamber  she entered she entered a chamber of small dimensions but richly adorned in the farthest corner was a couch of ivory hung with a gauzy curtain of silver tissue which without impeding respiration protected the slumberer from the fell insects of an oriental night leaning against an ottoman was a large brazen shield of ancient fashion and near it some helmets and curious weapons  an irresistible impulse hath carried me into this chamber exclaimed the prophetess the light haunted me like a spectre and wheresoever i moved it seemed to summon me  a couch and a slumberer  she approached the object she softly withdrew the curtain pale and panting she rushed back yet with a light step she beheld alroy  for a moment she leant against the wall overpowered by her emotions again she advanced and gazed on her unconscious victim  can the guilty sleep like the innocent who would deem this gentle slumberer had betrayed the highest trust that ever heaven vouchsafed to favoured man he looks not like a tyrant and a traitor calm his brow and mild his placid breath his long dark hair dark as the ravens wing hath broken from its fillet and courses like a wild and stormy night over his pale and moonlit brow his cheek is delicate and yet repose hath brought a flush and on his lip there seems some word of love that will not quit it it is the same alroy that blessed our vision when like the fresh and glittering star of morn he rose up in the desert and bringing joy to others brought to me only  oh hush my heart and let thy secret lie hid in the charnelhouse of crushed affections hard is the lot of woman to love and to conceal is our sharp doom o bitter life o most unnatural lot man made society and made us slaves and so we droop and die or else take refuge in idle fantasies to which we bring the fervour that is meant for nobler ends  beauteous hero whether i bear thee most hatred or most love i cannot tell die thou must yet i feel i should die with thee oh that tonight could lead at the same time unto our marriage bed and funeral pyre must that white bosom bleed and must those delicate limbs be hacked and handled by these bloody butchers is that justice they lie the traitors when they call thee false to our god thou art thyself a god and i could worship thee see those beauteous lips they move hark to the music  schirene schirene  there wanted but that word to summon back my senses fool whither is thy fancy wandering i will not wait for tardy justice i will do the deed myself shall i not kill my sisera she seized a dagger from the ottoman a rare and highlytempered blade up she raised it in the air and dashed it to his heart with superhuman force it struck against the talisman which jabaster had given to alroy and which from a lingering superstition he still wore it struck and shivered into a thousand pieces the caliph sprang from his couch his eyes met the prophetess standing over him in black despair with the hilt of the dagger in her hand  what is all this schirene who art thou esther he jumped from the couch called to pharez and seized her by both hands speak he continued art thou esther what dost thou here  she broke into a wild laugh she wrestled with his grasp and pulled him towards the gallery he beheld the chief tower of the serail in flames joining her hands together grasping them both in one of his and dragging her towards the ottoman he seized a helmet and flung it upon the mighty shield it sounded like a gong pharez started from his slumbers and rushed into the chamber  pharez treason treason send instant orders that the palace gates be opened on no pretence whatever go fly see the captain himself summon the household order all to arms speed for our lives  the whole palace was now roused alroy delivered esther exhausted and apparently senseless to a guard of eunuchs slaves and attendants poured in from all directions soon arrived schirene with dishevelled hair and hurried robes attended by a hundred maidens each bearing a torch  my soul what ails thee  nothing sweetest all will soon be well replied alroy picking up and examining the fragments of the shivered dagger which he had just discovered  my life has been attempted the palace is in flames i suspect the city is in insurrection look to your mistress maidens schirene fell into their arms i will soon be back so saying he hurried to the grand court  several thousand persons for the population of the serail and its liberties was very considerable were assembled in the grand court eunuchs women pages slaves and servants and a few soldiers all in confusion and alarm fire raging within and mysterious and terrible outcries without a cry of the caliph the caliph announced the arrival of alroy and produced a degree of comparative silence  where is the captain of the guard he exclaimed thats well open the gates to none who will leap the wall and bear a message to asriel you thats well too tomorrow you shall yourself command wheres mesrour take the eunuch guard and the company of gardeners76 and suppress the flames at all cost pull down the intervening buildings abidans troop arrived with succour eh i doubt it not i expected them open to none they force an entrance eh i thought so so that javelin has killed a traitor feed me with arms ill keep the gate send again to asriel wheres pharez  by your side my lord  run to the queen my faithful pharez and tell her that alls well i wish it were didst ever hear a din so awful methinks all the tambours and cymbals of the city are in full chorus foul play i guess oh for asriel has pharez returned  i am by your side my lord  hows the queen  she would gladly join your side  no no keep the gates there who says they are making fires before them tis true we must sally if the worst come to the worst and die at least like soldiers o asriel asriel  may it please your highness the troops are pouring in from all quarters  tis asriel  no your highness tis not the guard methinks they are scherirahs men  hum what it all is i know not but very foul play i do not doubt wheres honain  with the queen sire  tis well whats that shout  heres the messenger from asriel make way way  well how ist sir  please your highness i could not reach the guard  could not reach the guard god of my fathers who should let thee  sire i was taken prisoner  prisoner by the thunder of sinai are we at war who made thee prisoner  sire they have proclaimed thy death  who  the council of the elders so i heard abidan zalmunna  rebels and dogs who else  the high priest  hah is it there pharez fetch me some drink is it true scherirah has joined them  his force surrounds the serail no aid can reach us without cutting through his ranks  oh that i were there with my good guard are we to die here like rats fairly murdered cowardly knaves hold out hold out my men tis sharp work but some of us will smile at this hereafter who stands by alroy tonight bravely and truly shall have his hearts content tomorrow fear not i was not born to die in a civic broil i bear a charmed life so to it  go to the caliph good honain i pray thee go i can support myself he needs thy counsel bid him not expose his precious life the wicked men asriel must soon be here what sayest thou  there is no fear their plans are illdevised i have long expected this stormy night and feel even now more anxious than alarmed  tis at me they aim it is i whom they hate the high priest too ay ay thy proud brother good honain i have ever felt he would not rest until he drove me from this throne my right or washed my hated name from out our annals in my lifes blood wicked wicked jabaster he frowned upon me from the first honain is he indeed thy brother  i care not to remember he aims at something further than thy life but time will teach us more than all our thoughts  the fortifications of the serail resisted all the efforts of the rebels scherirah remained in his quarters with his troops under arms and recalled the small force that he had originally sent out as much to watch the course of events as to assist abidan asriel and ithamar poured down their columns in the rear of that chieftain and by dawn a division of the guard had crossed the river the care of which had been entrusted to scherirah and had thrown themselves into the palace alroy sallied forth at the head of these fresh troops his presence decided a result which was perhaps never doubtful the division of abidan fought with the desperation that became their fortunes the carnage was dreadful but their discomfiture complete they no longer acted in masses or with any general system they thought only of selfpreservation or of selling their lives at the dearest cost some dispersed some escaped others entrenched themselves in houses others fortified the bazaar all the horrors of war in the streets were now experienced the houses were in flames the thoroughfares flowed with blood  at the head of a band of faithful followers abidan proved himself by his courage and resources worthy of success at length he was alone or surrounded only by his enemies with his back against a building in a narrow street where the number of his opponents only embarrassed them the three foremost of his foes fell before his irresistible scimitar the barricaded door yielded to the pressure of the multitude abidan rushed up the narrow stairs and gaining a landingplace turned suddenly round and cleaved the skull of his nearest pursuer he hurled the mighty body at his followers and retarding their advance himself dashed onward and gained the terrace of the mansion three soldiers of the guard followed him as he bounded from terrace to terrace one armed with a javelin hurled it at the chieftain the weapon slightly wounded abidan who drawing it from his arm sent it back to the heart of its owner the two other soldiers armed only with swords gained upon him he arrived at the last terrace in the cluster of buildings he stood at bay on the brink of the precipice he regained his breath they approached him he dodged them in their course suddenly with admirable skill he flung his scimitar edgewise at the legs of his farthest foe who stopped short roaring with pain the chieftain sprang at the foremost and hurled him down into the street below where he was dashed to atoms a trapdoor offered itself to the despairing eye of the rebel he descended and found himself in a room filled with women they screamed he rushed through them and descending a staircase entered a chamber tenanted by a bedridden old man the ancient invalid enquired the cause of the uproar and died of fright before he could receive an answer at the sight of the awful being before him covered with streaming blood abidan secured the door washed his bloodstained face and disguising himself in the dusty robes of the deceased armenian sallied forth to watch the fray the obscure street was silent the chieftain proceeded unmolested at the corner he found a soldier holding a charger for his captain abidan unarmed seized a poniard from the soldiers belt stabbed him to the heart and vaulting on the steed galloped towards the river no boat was to be found he breasted the stream upon the stout courser he reached the opposite bank a company of camels were reposing by the side of a fountain alarm had dispersed their drivers he mounted the fleetest in appearance he dashed to the nearest gate of the city the guard at the gate refused him a passage he concealed his agitation a marriage procession returning from the country arrived he rushed into the centre of it and overset the bride in her gilded wagon in the midst of the confusion the shrieks the oaths and the scuffle he forced his way through the gate scoured over the country and never stopped until he had gained the desert  the uproar died away the shouts of warriors the shrieks of women the wild clang of warfare all were silent the flames were extinguished the carnage ceased the insurrection was suppressed and order restored the city all the houses of which were closed was patrolled by the conquering troops and by sunset the conqueror himself in his hall of state received the reports and the congratulations of his chieftains the escape of abidan seemed counterbalanced by the capture of jabaster after performing prodigies of valour the high priest had been overpowered and was now a prisoner in the serail the conduct of scherirah was not too curiously criticised a commission was appointed to enquire into the mysterious affair and alroy retired to the bath77 to refresh himself after the fatigues of the victory which he could not consider a triumph  as he reposed upon his couch melancholy and exhausted schirene was announced the princess threw herself upon his neck and covered him with embraces his heart yielded to her fondness his spirit became lighter his depression melted away  my ruby said schirene and she spoke in a low smothered voice her face hidden and nestled in his breast my ruby dost thou love me  he smiled in fondness as he pressed her to his heart  my ruby thy pearl is so frightened it dare not look upon thee wicked men tis i whom they hate tis i whom they would destroy  there is no danger sweet tis over now speak not nay do not think of it  ah wicked men there is no joy on earth while such things live slay alroy their mighty master who from vile slaves hath made them princes ungrateful

tis i whom they hate tis i whom they would destroy this form i fear it has lost its lustre but still tis thine and once thou saidst thou lovedst it this form was to have been hacked and mangled this ivory bosom was to have been ripped up and tortured and this warm blood that flows alone for thee that fell jabaster was to pour its tide upon the altar of his ancient vengeance he ever hated me  jabaster schirene where are we and what are we life life they lie that call thee nature nature never sent these gusts of agony oh my heart will break i drove him from my thought and now she calls him up and now must i remember he is myprisoner god of heaven god of my fathers is it come to this why did he not escape why must abidan a common cutthroat save his graceless life and this great soul this stern and mighty being ah me i have lived long enough would they had not failed would  stop stop alroy i pray thee love be calm i came to soothe thee not to raise thy passions i did not say jabaster willed thy death though asriel says so tis me he wars against and if indeed jabaster be a man so near thy heart if he indeed be one so necessary to thy prosperity and cannot live in decent order with thy slave thats here i know my duty sir i would not have thy fortunes farred to save my single heart although i think twill break i will go i will die and deem the hardest accident of life but sheer prosperity if it profit thee  o schirene what wouldst thou this this is torture  to see thee safe and happy nothing more  i am both if thou art  care not for me i am nothing  thou art all to me  calm thyself my soul it grieves me much that when i came to soothe i have only galled thee alls well alls well say that jabaster lives what then he lives and may he prove more duteous than before thats all

have been if this proud rebel live to spy my conduct  banish him banish him  to herd with rebels is this thy policy  o schirene i love not this man although methinks i should yet didst thou know but

queen she comes not yet  we are the watchers of the moon78 and live in loneliness to herald light  she comes not yet her sacred form not yet it summons to our holy feast she comes not yet our brethren far wait mute and motionless the saintly beam she comes not yet  we are the watchers of the moon and live in loneliness to herald light  she comes she comes her beauteous form sails with soft splendour in the glittering air she comes she comes the beacons fire and tell the nation that the month begins she comes she comes  we are the watchers of the moon to tell the nation that the month begins  instantly the holy watchers fired the beacons on the mountain top and anon a thousand flames blazed round the land from caucasus to lebanon on every peak a crown of light  sire a tatar has arrived from hamadan who will see none but thyself i have told him your highness was engaged and sent him to the lord honain but all denial is lost upon him and as i thought perhaps the lady miriam

have journeyed upon the swiftest dromedary the third morn sees me at bagdad  you have done your duty see this faithful courier be well tended pharez summon the lord honain  alp arslan hah a very famous warrior the moment the beacon was fired no sudden impulse then but long matured i like it not  sire said pharez reentering a tatar has arrived from the frontiers of the province who will see none but thyself i have told him your highness was deeply busied and as methinks he brings but the same news i  tis very likely yet never think good pharez ill see the man the tatar entered  well sir how now from whom  from mozul the governor bade me see the caliph and none else and tell your highness that the moment the beacon that announced the feast of the new moon was fired on the mountains the fell rebel abidan raised the standard of judah in the province and proclaimed war against your majesty  in any force  the royal power keeps within their walls  sufficient answer part of the same movement we shall have some trouble hast summoned honain  i have sire  go see this messenger be duly served and pharez come hither let none converse with them you understand  your highness may assure

catching fever  ah no dread sire lord medad has no thought but for thy glory alas alas he has now to guard it against fearful odds lord medad bade me see the caliph and none else and tell your highness that the moment the beacon which announced the feast of the new moon was fired on lebanon the sultan of roum and the old arabian caliph unfurled the standard of their prophet in great array and are now marching towards bagdad  a clear conspiracy has honain arrived summon a council of the vizirs instantly the world is up against me well im sick of peace they shall not find me napping  you see my lords said alroy ere the council broke up we must attack them singly there can be no doubt of that if they join we must combat at great odds tis in detail that we must route them i will myself to persia ithamar must throw himself between the sultan and abidan medad fall back on ithamar scherirah must guard the capital honain you are regent and so farewell i shall set off tonight courage brave companions tis a storm but many a cedar survives the thunderbolt  the council broke up  my own scherirah said the caliph as they retired stay awhile i would speak with you alone honain continued alroy following the grand vizir out of the chamber and leaving scherirah alone honain i have not yet interchanged a word with you in private what think you of all this  sire i am prepared for the worst but hope the best  tis wise if abner could only keep that karasmian in check i am about to speak with scherirah alone i do suspect him much  ill answer for his treason  hah i do suspect him therefore i give him no command i would not have him too near his old companion eh we will garrison the city with his rebels  sire these are not moments to be nice scherirah is a valiant captain a very valiant captain but lend me thy signet ring i pray thee sire  alroy turned pale  no sir it has left me once and never shall again you have touched upon a string that makes me sad there is a burden on my conscience why or what i know not i am innocent you know i am innocent honain  ill answer for your highness he who has enough of the milk of human kindness to spare a thing like scherirah when he stands in his way may well be credited for the nobler mercy that spared his better  ah me theres madness in the thought why is he not here had i but followed tush tush go see the queen and tell her all that has happened ill to scherirah  the caliph returned  thy pardon brave scherirah in these moments my friends will pardon lapse of courtesy  your highness is too considerate  you see scherirah how the wind blows brave heart theres much to do no doubt i am in sad want of some right trusty friend on whose devoted bosom i can pillow all my necessities i was thinking of sending you against this arslan but perhaps tis better that i should go myself these are moments one should not seem to shrink and yet we know not how affairs may run no we know not the capital the surrounding province one disaster and these false moslemin may rise against us i should stay here but if i leave scherirah i leave myself i feel that deeply tis a consolation it may be that i must fall back upon the city be prepared scherirah let me fall back upon supporting friends you have a great trust oh use it wisely worthily i am sure you must do  your highness may rest assured i have no other thought but for your weal and glory doubt not my devotion sire i am not one of those mealymouthed youths full of their own deeds and lipworship sire but i have a life devoted to your service and ready at all times to peril all things  i know that scherirah i know it i feel it deeply what think you of these movements  they are not ill combined and yet i doubt not your majesty will prove your fortunes most triumphant  think you the soldiery are in good cue ill answer for my own they are rough fellows like myself a little too blunt perhaps your highness we are not holiday guards but we know our duty and we will do it  thats well thats all i want i shall review the troops before i go let a donative be distributed among them and bythebye i have always forgotten it your legion should be called the legion of syria we owe our fairest province to their arms  i shall convey to them your highness wish were it possible twould add to their devotion  i do not wish it they are my very children sup at the serail tonight scherirah we shall be very private yet let us drink together ere we part we are old friends you know hast not forgotten our ruined city  alroy entered the apartment of schirene my soul thou knowest all  she sprang forward and threw her arms around his neck  fear not my life well not disgrace our queen twill be quick work twothirds of them have been beaten before and for the new champion our laurels must not fade and his blood shall nourish fresh ones  dearest dearest alroy go not thyself i pray thee may not asriel conquer  i hope so in my company for a time we part a short

repaired to his cabinet where his secretaries were occupied in writing as he paced the chamber he dictated to them the necessary instructions  who is the officer on guard  benaiah sire  i remember him he saved me a broken skull upon the tigris this is for him the queen accompanies us she is his charge these papers for the vizir let the troops be under arms by daybreak this order of the day for the lord asriel send this instantly to hamadan is the tatar despatched to medad tis well you have done your duty now to rest pharez  my lord  i shall not sleep tonight give me my drink go rest good boy i have no wants good night  good night my gracious lord  let me ponder i am alone i am calm and yet my spirit is not quick i am not what i was fourandtwenty hours ago who would have dreamed of this all at stake again once more in the field and struggling at once for empire and existence i do lack the mighty spirit of my former days i am not what i was i have little faith all about me seems changed and dull and grown mechanical where are those flashing eyes and conquering visages that clustered round me on the battle eve round me the lords anointed i see none such they are changed as i am why this abidan was a host and now he fights against me she spoke of the prophetess i remember that woman was the stirring trumpet of our ranks and now where is she the victim of my justice and where is he the mightier far the friend the counsellor the constant guide the master of my boyhood the firm the fond the faithful guardian of all my bright career whose days and nights were one unbroken study to make me glorious alas i feel more like a doomed and desperate renegade than a young hero on the eve of battle flushed with the memory of unbroken triumphs  hah what awful form art thou that risest from the dusky earth before me thou shouldst be one i dare not name yet will the likeness of jabaster away why frownest thou upon me i did not slay thee do i live or dream or what i see him ay i see thee i fear thee not i fear nothing i am alroy  speak oh speak i do conjure thee mighty spectre speak by all the memory of the past although tis madness i do conjure thee let me hear again the accents of my boyhood  alroy alroy alroy  i listen as to the last trump  meet me on the plain of nehauend  tis gone as it spoke it vanished it was jabaster god of my fathers it was jabaster life is growing too wild my courage is broken i could lie down and die it was jabaster the voice sounds in my ear like distant thunder meet me on the plain of nehauend ill not fail thee noble ghost although i meet my doom jabaster have i seen jabaster indeed indeed methinks im mad hah whats that  an awful clap of thunder broke over the palace followed by a strange clashing sound that seemed to come from one of the chambers the walls of the serail rocked  an earthquake exclaimed alroy would that the earth would open and swallow all hah pharez has it roused thee too pharez we live in strange times  your highness is very pale  and so art thou lad wouldst have me merry pale we may well be pale didst thou know all hah that awful sound again i cannot bear it pharez i cannot bear it i have borne many things but this i cannot  my lord tis in the armoury  run see no ill not be alone wheres benaiah let him go stay with me pharez stay with me i pray thee stay my child  pharez led the caliph to a couch on which alroy lay pale and trembling in a few minutes he inquired whether benaiah had returned  even now he comes sire  well how is it  sire a most awful incident as the thunder broke over the palace the sacred standard fell from its restingplace and has shivered into a thousand pieces strange to say the sceptre of solomon can neither be found nor traced  say nothing of the past as ye love me lads let none enter the armoury leave me benaiah leave me pharez  they retired alroy watched their departure with a glance of inexpressible anguish the moment that they had disappeared he flew to the couch and throwing himself upon his knees and covering his face with his hands burst into passionate tears and exclaimed o my god i have deserted thee and now thou hast deserted me  sleep crept over the senses of the exhausted and desperate caliph he threw himself upon the divan and was soon buried in profound repose he might have slept an hour he awoke suddenly from the cabinet in which he slept you entered a vast hall through a lofty and spacious arch generally covered with drapery which was now withdrawn to the astonishment of alroy this presencechamber appeared at this moment to blaze with light he rose from his couch he advanced he perceived with feelings of curiosity and fear that the hall was filled with beings terrible indeed to behold but to his sight more terrible than strange in the colossal and mysterious forms that lined the walls of the mighty chamber and each of which held in its extended arm a streaming torch he recognised the awful afrites at the end of the hall upon a sumptuous throne surrounded by priests and courtiers there was seated a monarch on whom alroy had before gazed solomon the great alroy beheld him in state and semblance the same solomon whose sceptre the prince of the captivity had seized in the royal tombs of judah  the strange assembly seemed perfectly unconscious of the presence of the child of earth who with a desperate courage leant against a column of the arch and watched with wonder their mute and motionless society nothing was said nothing done no one moved no one even by gesture seemed sensible of the presence of any other apparition save himself  suddenly there advanced from the bottom of the hall near unto alroy a procession pages and dancing girls with eyes of fire and voluptuous gestures warriors with mighty arms and venerable forms with ample robes and flowing beards and as they passed even with all the activity of their gestures they made no sound neither did the musicians whereof there was a great band playing upon harps and psalteries and timbrels and cornets break in the slightest degree the almighty silence  this great crowd poured on in beautiful order the procession never terminating yet passing thrice round the hall bowing to him that was upon the throne and ranging themselves in ranks before the afrites  and there came in twelve forms bearing a great seal the stone green and the engraven characters of living flame and the characters were those on the talisman of jabaster which alroy still wore next to his heart and the twelve forms placed the great seal before solomon and humbled themselves and the king bowed at the same moment alroy was sensible of a pang next to his heart he instantly put his hand to the suffering spot and lo the talisman crumbled into dust  the procession ceased a single form advanced recent experience alone prevented alroy from sinking before the spectre of jabaster such was the single form it advanced bearing the sceptre it advanced it knelt before the throne it offered the sceptre to the crowned and solemn vision and the form of solomon extended its arm and took the sceptre and instantly the mighty assembly vanished  alroy advanced immediately into the chamber but all was dark and silent a trumpet sounded he recognised the note of his own soldiery he groped his way to a curtain and pulling it aside beheld the first streak of dawn  once more upon his charger once more surrounded by his legions once more his senses dazzled and inflamed by the waving banners and the inspiring trumpets once more conscious of the power still at his command and the mighty stake for which he was about to play alroy in a great degree recovered his usual spirit and selfpossession his energy returned with his excited pulse and the vastness of the impending danger seemed only to stimulate the fertility of his genius  he pushed on by forced marches towards media at the head of fifty thousand men at the end of the second days march fresh couriers arrived from abner informing him that unable to resist the valiant and almost innumerable host of the king of karasmé he had entirely evacuated persia and had concentrated his forces in louristan alroy in consequence of this information despatched orders to scherirah to join him with his division instantly and leave the capital to its fate  they passed again the mountains of kerrund and joined abner and the army of media thirty thousand strong on the river abzah here alroy rested one night to refresh his men and on the ensuing morn pushed on to the persian frontier unexpectedly attacked the advanced posts of alp arslan and beat them back with great loss into the province but the force of the king of karasmé was so considerable that the caliph did not venture on a general engagement and therefore he fell back and formed in battle array upon the neighbouring plain of nehauend the theatre of one of his earliest and most brilliant victories where he awaited the hourlyexpected arrival of scherirah  the king of karasmé who was desirous of bringing affairs to an issue and felt confident in his superior force instantly advanced in two or three days at farthest it was evident that a battle must be fought that would decide the fate of the east  on the morn ensuing their arrival at nehauend while the caliph was out hunting attended only by a few officers he was suddenly attacked by an ambushed band of karasmians alroy and his companions defended themselves with such desperation that they at length succeeded in beating off their assailants although triple their number the leader of the karasmians as he retreated hurled a dart at the caliph which must have been fatal had not a young officer of the guard interposed his own breast and received the deadly wound the party in confusion returned with all speed to the camp alroy himself bearing the expiring victim of desperate loyalty and military enthusiasm  the bleeding officer was borne to the royal pavilion and placed upon the imperial couch the most skilful leech was summoned he examined the wound but shook his head the dying warrior was himself sensible of his desperate condition his agony could only be alleviated by withdrawing the javelin which would occasion his immediate decease he desired to be left alone with his sovereign  sire said the officer i must die and i die without a pang to die in your service i have ever considered the most glorious end destiny has awarded it to me and if i have not met my fate upon the field of battle it is some consolation that my death has preserved the most valuable of lives sire i have a sister  waste not thy strength dear friend in naming her rest assured i shall ever deem thy relatives my own  i doubt it not would i had a thousand lives for such a master i have a burden on my conscience sire nor can i die in peace unless i speak of it  speak speak freely if thou hast injured any one and the power or wealth of alroy can redeem thy oppressed spirit he will not spare he will not spare be assured of that  noble noble master i must be brief for although while this javelin rests within my body i yet may live the agony is great sire the deed of which i speak doth concern thee  ay  i was on guard the day jabaster died  powers of heaven i am all ear speak on speak on  he died selfstrangled so they say  so they ever told me  thou art innocent thou art innocent i thank my god my king is innocent  rest assured of that as there is hope in israel tell me all  the queen came with the signet ring to such authority i yielded way she entered and after her the lord honain i heard high words i heard jabasters voice he struggled yes he struggled but his mighty form wounded and fettered could not long resist foul play foul play sire what could i do against such adversaries they left the chamber with a stealthy step her eyes met mine i never could forget that fell and glittering visage  thou neer hast spoken of this awful end  to none but thee and why i speak it now i cannot tell save that it seems some inspiration urges me and methinks they who did this may do even feller works if such there be  thou hast robbed me of all peace and hope of peace and yet i thank thee now i know the worth of life i have never loved to think of that sad day and yet though i have sometimes dreamed of villainous work the worst were innocence to thy dread tale  tis told and now i pray thee secure thy secret by drawing from my agonised frame this javelin  trusty heart tis a sad office  i die with joy if thou performest it  tis done  god save alroy  while alroy plunged in thought stood over the body of the officer there arose a flourish of triumphant music and a eunuch entering the pavilion announced the arrival of schirene from kerrund almost immediately afterwards the princess descending from her litter entered the tent alroy tore off his robe and threw it over the corpse  my own exclaimed the princess as she ran up to the caliph i have heard all be not alarmed for me i dare look upon a corpse you know i am a soldiers bride i am used to blood  alas  why so pale thou dost not kiss me has this unhinged thee so tis a sad deed and yet tomorrows dawn may light up thousands to as grim a fate why thou tremblest alas kind soul the single death of this fond faithful heart hath quite upset my love yet art thou used to battle why this is foolishness art not glad to see me what not one smile and i have come to fight for thee i will be kissed  she flung herself upon his neck alroy faintly returned her embrace and bore her to a couch he clapped his hands and two soldiers entered and bore away the corpse  the pavilion schirene is now fitter for thy presence rest thyself i shall soon return thus speaking he quitted her  he quitted her but her humbled look of sorrowful mortification pierced to his heart he thought of all her love and all her loveliness he called to mind all the marvellous story of their united fortunes he felt that for her and her alone he cared to live that without her quick sympathy even success seemed unendurable his judgment fluctuated in an eddy of passion and reason passion conquered he dismissed from his intelligence all cognizance of good and evil he determined under all circumstances to cling ever to her he tore from his mind all memory of the late disclosure he returned to the pavilion with a countenance beaming with affection he found her weeping he folded her in his arms he kissed her with a thousand kisses and whispered between each kiss his ardent love  twas midnight schirene reposed in the arms of alroy the caliph who was restless and anxious for the arrival of scherirah was scarcely slumbering when the sound of a voice thoroughly aroused him he looked around he beheld the spectre of jabaster his hair stood on end his limbs seemed to loosen a cold dew crept over his frame as he gazed upon the awful form within a yard of his couch unconsciously he disembarrassed his arms of their fair burden and rising on the couch leant forward  alroy alroy alroy  i am here  tomorrow israel is avenged  who is that exclaimed the princess wakening  in a frenzy of fear alroy quite forgetting the spectre turned and pressed his hand over her eyes when he again looked round the apparition was invisible  what wouldst thou alroy  nothing sweet a soldiers wife must bear strange sights yet i would save you some one of my men forgetful you were here burst into my tent in such a guise as scarce would suit a female eye i must away my child ill call thy slaves one kiss farewell but for a time  tomorrow israel will be avenged what in karasmian blood i have no faith no matter all is now beyond my influence a rushing destiny carries me onward i cannot stem the course nor guide the vessel how now who is the officer on guard  benomi sire thy servant  send to the viceroy bid him meet me here who is this  a courier from the lord scherirah sire but just arrived he passed last night the kerrund mountains sire and will be with you by the break of day  good news go fetch abner haste hell find me here anon ill visit the camp awhile well my brave fellows you have hither come to conquer again with alroy you have fought before i warrant on the plain of nehauend tis a rich soil and shall be richer with karasmian gore  god save your majesty our lives are thine  please you my little ruler said a single soldier addressing alroy pardon my bluntness but i knew you before you were a caliph  stout heart i like thy freedom prythee say on  i was asaying i hope you will lead us in the charge tomorrow some say you will not  they say falsely  i thought so ill ever answer for my little ruler but then the queen  is a true soldiers wife and lives in the camp  thats brave there i told you so comrades you would not believe me but i knew our little ruler before you did i lived near the gate at hamadan please your highness old shelomis son  give me thy hand a real friend what ist ye eat here boys let me taste your mess ifaith i would my cook could dress me such a pilau tis admirable  the soldiers gathered round their chieftain with eyes beaming with adoration twas a fine picture the hero in the centre the various groups around some conversing with him some cooking some making coffee all offering him by word or deed some testimonial of their devotion and blending with that devotion the most perfect frankness  we shall beat them lads  there is no fear with you you always conquer  i do my best and so do you a good general without good troops is little worth  ifaith thats true one must have good troops what think you of alp arslan  i think he may give us as much trouble as all our other enemies together and thats not much  brave brave god save alroy  benomi approached and announced that the viceroy was in attendance  i must quit you my children said alroy well sup once more together when we have conquered  god save you sire and we will confound your enemies  good night my lads ere the dawn break we may have hot work  we are ready we are ready god save alroy  they are in good cue and yet twas a different spirit that inspired our early days that i strongly feel these are men true to a leader who has never failed them and confident in a cause that leads to plunder they are but splendid mercenaries  no more oh where are now the fighting men of judah where are the men who when they drew their scimitars joined in a conquering psalm of holy triumph last eve of battle you would have thought the field a mighty synagogue priests and altars flaming sacrifices and smoking censers groups of fiery zealots hanging with frenzy on prophetic lips and sealing with their blood and holiest vows a solemn covenant to conquer canaan all is changed as i am how now abner you are well muffled  is it true scherirah is at hand  i doubt not all is right would that the dawn would break  the enemy is advancing some of their columns are in sight my scouts have dodged them they intend doubtless to form upon the plain  they are in sight eh then we will attack them at once ere they are formed rare rare well beat them yet courage dear brother scherirah will be here at dawn in good time very good time very very good time  i like the thought  the men are in good heart at break of dawn charge with thirty thousand cavalry upon their forming ranks ill take the right asriel the left it shall be a family affair dear abner how is miriam  i heard this morn quite well she sends you her love and prayers the queen is here  she came this eve quite well  she must excuse all courtesy  say nothing she is a soldiers wife she loves thee well dear abner  i know that i hope my sword may guard her childrens throne  well give thy orders instant battle eh  indeed i think so  ill send couriers to hurry scherirah all looks well reserve the guard  ay ay farewell dear sire when we meet again i trust your enemies may be your slaves  at the first streak of dawn the hebrew cavalry with the exception of the guard charged the advancing columns of the karasmians with irresistible force and cut them in pieces alp arslan rallied his troops and at length succeeded in forming his main body in good order alroy and asriel led on their divisions and the battle now became general it raged for several hours and was on both sides well maintained the slaughter of the karasmians was great but their stern character and superior numbers counterbalanced for a time all the impetuosity of the hebrews and all the energy of their leaders this day alroy threw into the shade all his former exploits twelve times he charged at the head of the sacred guard and more than once penetrated to the very pavilion of alp arslan  in vain he endeavoured singly and hand to hand to meet that famous chieftain both monarchs fought in the ranks and yet fate decided that their scimitars should never cross four hours before noon it was evident to alroy that unless scherirah arrived he could not prevail against the vast superiority of numbers he was obliged early to call his reserve into the field and although the number of the slain on the side of arslan exceeded any in the former victories of the hebrews still the karasmians maintained an immense front which was constantly supplied by fresh troops confident in his numbers and aware of the weakness of his antagonists arslan contented himself with acting on the defensive and wearying his assailants by resisting their terrible and repeated charge  for a moment alroy at the head of the sacred guard had withdrawn from the combat abner and asriel still maintained the fight and the caliph was at the same time preparing for new efforts and watching with anxiety for the arrival of scherirah in the fifth hour from an eminence he marked with exultation the advancing banners of his expected succours confident now that the day was won he announced the exhilarating intelligence to his soldiers and while they were excited by the animating tidings led them once more to the charge it was irresistible scherirah seemed to have arrived only for the pursuit only in time to complete the victory what then was the horror the consternation of alroy when benaiah dashing up to him informed him that the longexpected succours consisted of the united forces of scherirah and abidan and had attacked him in the rear human genius could afford no resource the exhausted hebrews whose energies had been tasked to the utmost were surrounded the karasmians made a general and simultaneous advance in a few minutes the hebrew army was thrown into confusion the stoutest warriors threw away their swords in despair every one thought only of selfpreservation even abner fled towards hamadan asriel was slain alroy finding it was all over rushed to his pavilion at the head of about three hundred of the guards seized the fainting schirene threw her before him on his saddle and cutting his way through all obstacles dashed into the desert  for eightandforty hours they never stopped their band was soon reduced onethird on the morning of the third day they dismounted and refreshed themselves at a well half only regained their saddles schirene never spoke on they rushed again each hour losing some exhausted comate at length on the fifth day about eighty strong they arrived at a grove of palmtrees here they dismounted and alroy took schirene in his arms and the shade seemed to revive her she opened her eyes and pressed his hand and smiled he gathered her some dates and she drank some water  our toils will soon be over sweetest he whispered to her i have lost everything but thee  again they mounted and proceeding at a less rapid pace they arrived towards evening at the ruined city whither alroy all this time had been directing his course dashing down the great street they at length entered the old amphitheatre they dismounted alroy made a couch with their united cloaks for schirene some collected fuel great store of which was found and kindled large fires others while it was yet light chased the gazelles and were sufficiently fortunate to provide their banquet or fetched water from the well known to their leader in an hours time clustering round their fires in groups and sharing their rude fare you might have deemed them instead of the discomfited and luxurious guards of a mighty monarch the accustomed tenants of this wild abode  come my lads said alroy as he rubbed his hands over the ascending flame at any rate this is better than the desert  after all his exertions alroy fell into profound and dreamless sleep when he awoke the sun had been long up schirene was still slumbering he embraced her and she opened her eyes and smiled  you are now a bandits bride he said how like you our new life  well with thee  rest here my sweetest i must rouse our men and see how fortune speeds so saying and tripping lightly over many a sleeping form he touched benaiah  so my brave captain of the guard still napping come stir stir  benaiah jumped up with a cheerful face i am ever ready sire  i know it but remember i am no more a king only a comate away with me and let us form some order  the companions quitted the amphitheatre and reconnoitred the adjoining buildings they found many stores the remains of old days mats tents and fuel drinkingbowls and other homely furniture they fixed upon a building for their stable and others for the accommodation of their band they summoned their companions to the open place the scene of hassan subahs fate where alroy addressed them and explained to them his plans they were divided into companies each man had his allotted duty some were placed on guard at different parts some were sent out to the chase or to collect dates from the oasis others led the horses to the contiguous pasture or remained to attend to their domestic arrangements the amphitheatre was cleared out a rude but convenient pavilion was formed for schirene they covered its ground with mats and each emulated the other in his endeavours to study her accommodation her kind words and inspiring smiles animated at the same time their zeal and their invention  they soon became accustomed to their rough but adventurous life its novelty pleased them and the perpetual excitement of urgent necessity left them no time to mourn over their terrible vicissitudes while alroy lived hope indeed never deserted their sanguine bosoms and such was the influence of his genius that the most desponding felt that to be discomfited with him was preferable to conquest with another they were a faithful and devoted band and merry faces were not wanting when at night they assembled in the amphitheatre for their common meal  no sooner had alroy completed his arrangements than he sent forth spies in all directions to procure intelligence and especially to communicate if possible with ithamar and medad provided that they still survived and maintained themselves in any force  a fortnight passed away without the approach of any stranger at the end of which there arrived four personages at their haunt not very welcome to their chief who however concealed his chagrin at their appearance these were kisloch the kourd and calidas the indian and their inseparable companions the guebre and the negro  noble captain said kisloch we trust that you will permit us to enlist in the band this is not the first time we have served under your orders in this spot old comates ifaith who have seen the best and the worst we suspected where you might be found although thanks to the ever felicitous invention of man it is generally received that you died in battle i hope your majesty is well added kisloch bowing to schirene  you are welcome friends replied alroy i know your worth you have seen as you say the best and the worst and will i trust see better died in battle eh thats good  tis so received said calidas  and what news of our friends  not over good but strange  how so  hamadan is taken  i am prepared tell me all  old bostenay and the lady miriam are borne prisoners to bagdad  prisoners  but so all will be well with them i trow the lord honain is in high favour with the conqueror and will doubtless protect them  honain in favour  even so he made terms for the city and right good ones  hah he was ever dexterous well if he save my sister i care not for his favour  there is no doubt all may yet be well sir  let us act not hope wheres abner  dead  how  in battle  art sure  i saw him fall and fought beside him  a soldiers death is all our fortune now i am glad he was not captured wheres medad ithamar  fled into egypt  we have no force whatever then  none but your guards here  they are strong enough to plunder a caravan honain you say in favour  very high hell make good terms for us  this is strange news  very but true  well you are welcome share our fare tis rough and somewhat scanty but we have feasted and may feast again fled into egypt eh  ay sir  schirene shouldst like to see the nile  i have heard of crocodiles  if the presence of kisloch and his companions were not very pleasing to alroy with the rest of the band they soon became great favourites their local knowledge and their experience of desert life made them valuable allies and their boisterous jocularity and unceasing merriment were not unwelcome in the present monotonous existence of the fugitives as for alroy himself he meditated an escape to egypt he determined to seize the first opportunity of procuring some camels and then dispersing his band with the exception of benaiah and a few faithful retainers he trusted that disguised as merchants they might succeed in crossing syria and entering africa by palestine with these plans and prospects he became each day more cheerful and more sanguine as to the future he had in his possession some valuable jewels which he calculated upon disposing of at cairo for a sum sufficient for all his purposes and having exhausted all the passions of life while yet a youth he looked forward to the tranquil termination of his existence in some poetic solitude with his beautiful companion  one evening as they returned from the oasis alroy guiding the camel that bore schirene and ever and anon looking up in her inspiring face her sanguine spirit would have indulged in a delightful future  thus shall we pass the desert sweet said schirene can this be toil  there is no toil with love replied alroy  and we were made for love and not for empire rejoined schirene  the past is a dream said alroy so sages teach us but until we act their wisdom is but wind i feel it now have we ever lived in aught but deserts and fed on aught but dates methinks tis very natural but that i am tempted by the security of distant lands i could remain here a free and happy outlaw time custom and necessity form our natures when i first met scherirah in these ruins i shrank with horror from degraded man and now i sigh to be his heir we must not think  no love well only hope replied schirene and they passed through the gates  the night was beautiful the air was still warm and sweet schirene gazed upon the luminous heavens we thought not of these skies when we were at bagdad she exclaimed and yet my life what was the brightness of our palaces compared to these all is left to us that man should covet freedom beauty and youth i do believe ere long alroy we shall look back upon the wondrous past as on another and a lower world would that this were egypt tis my only wish  and it shall soon be gratified all will soon be arranged a few brief days and then schirene will mount her camel for a longer ride than just to gather dates youll make a sorry traveller i fear  not i ill tire you all  they reached the circus and seated themselves round the blazing fire seldom had alroy since his fall appeared more cheerful schirene sang an arab air to the band who joined in joyous chorus it was late ere they sought repose and they retired to their rest sanguine and contented  a few hours afterwards at the break of dawn alroy was roused from his slumbers by a rude pressure on his breast he started a ferocious soldier was kneeling over him he would have spurned him he found his hand manacled he would have risen his feet were bound he looked round for schirene and called her name he was answered only by a shriek the amphitheatre was filled with karasmian troops his own men were surprised and overpowered kisloch and the guebre had been on guard he was raised from the ground and flung upon a camel which was instantly trotted out of the circus on every side he beheld a wild scene of disorder and dismay he was speechless from passion and despair the camel was dragged into the desert a body of cavalry instantly surrounded it and they set off at a rapid pace the whole seemed the work of an instant  how many days had passed alroy knew not he had taken no account of time night and day were to him the same he was in a stupor but the sweetness of the air and the greenness of the earth at length partially roused his attention he was just conscious that they had quitted the desert before him was a noble river he beheld the euphrates from the very spot he had first viewed it in his pilgrimage the strong association of ideas called back his memory a tear stole down his cheek the bitter drop stole to his parched lips he asked the nearest horseman for water the guard gave him a wetted sponge with which he contrived with difficulty to wipe his lips and then he let it fall to the ground the karasmian struck him  they arrived at the river the prisoner was taken from the camel and placed in a covered boat after some hours they stopped and disembarked at a small village alroy was placed upon an ass with his back to its head his clothes were soiled and tattered the children pelted him with mud an old woman with a fanatic curse placed a crown of paper on his brow with difficulty his brutal guards prevented their victim from being torn to pieces and in such fashion towards noon of the fourteenth day david alroy again entered bagdad  the intelligence of the capture of alroy spread through the agitated city the moolahs bustled about as if they had received a fresh demonstration of the authenticity of the prophetic mission all the dervishes began begging the men discussed affairs in the coffeehouses and the women chatted at the fountains79  they may say what they like but i wish him well said a fair arab as she arranged her veil he may be an impostor but he was a very handsome one  all the women are for him thats the truth responded a companion but then we can do him no good  we can tear their eyes out said a third  and what do you think of alp arslan truly inquired a fourth  i wish he were a pitcher and then i could break his neck said a fifth  only think of the princess said a sixth  well she has had a glorious time of it said a seventh  nothing was too good for her said an eighth  i like true love said a ninth  well i hope he will be too much for them all yet said a tenth  i should not wonder said an eleventh  he cant said a twelfth he has lost his sceptre  you dont say so said a thirteenth  it is too true said a fourteenth  do you think he was a wizard said a fifteenth i vow if there be not a fellow looking at us behind those trees  impudent scoundrel said a sixteenth i wish it were alroy let us all scream and put down our veils  and the group ran away  two stout soldiers were playing chess80 in a coffeehouse  may i slay my mother said one but i cannot make a move i fought under him at nehauend and though i took the amnesty i have half a mind now to seize my sword and stab the first turk that enters  twere but sheer justice said his companion by my fathers blessing he was the man for a charge they may say what they like but compared with him alp arslan is a whitelivered giaour  here is confusion to him and to thy last move theres the dirhem i can play no more may i slay my mother though but i did not think he would let himself be taken  by the blessing of my father nor i but then he was asleep  that makes a difference he was betrayed  all brave men are they say kisloch and his set pocket their fifty thousand by the job  may each dirhem prove a plaguespot  amen dost remember abner  may i slay my mother if i ever forget him he spoke to his men like so many lambs what has become of the lady miriam  she is here  that will cut alroy  he was ever fond of her dost remember she gained adorams life  oh she could do anything next to the queen  before her i say before her he has refused the queen he never refused the lady miriam  because she asked less  dost know it seemed to me that things never went on so well after jabasters death  so say i there was a something eh  a sort of a peculiar as it were kind of something eh  you have well described it every man felt the same i have often mentioned it to my comrades say what you like said i but slay my mother if ever since the old man strangled himself things did not seem as it were in their natural propinquity twas the phrase i used  a choice one unless there is a natural propinquity the bestarranged matters will fall out however the ass sees farther than his rider and so it was with alroy the best commander i ever served under all the same  let us go forth and see how affairs run  ay do if we hear any one abuse alroy well cleave his skull  that will we there are a good many of our stout fellows about we might do something yet  who knows  a subterranean dungeon of the citadel of bagdad held in its gloomy limits the late lord of asia the captive did not sigh or weep or wail he did not speak he did not even think for several days he remained in a state of stupor on the morning of the fourth day he almost unconsciously partook of the wretched provision which his gaolers brought him their torches round which the bats whirled and flapped their wings and twinkled their small eyes threw a ghastly glare over the nearer walls of the dungeon the extremity of which defied the vision of the prisoner and when the gaolers retired alroy was in complete darkness  the image of the past came back to him he tried in vain to penetrate the surrounding gloom his hands were manacled his legs also were loaded with chains the notion that his life might perhaps have been cruelly spared in order that he might linger on in this horrible state of conscious annihilation filled him with frenzy he would have dashed his fetters against his brow but the chain restrained him he flung himself upon the damp and rugged ground his fall disturbed a thousand obscene things he heard the quick glide of a serpent the creeping retreat of the clustering scorpions and the swift escape of the dashing rats his mighty calamities seemed slight when compared with these petty miseries his great soul could not support him under these noisome and degrading incidents he sprang in disgust upon his feet and stood fearful of moving lest every step should introduce him to some new abomination at length exhausted nature was unable any longer to sustain him he groped his way to the rude seat cut in the rocky wall which was his only accommodation he put forth his hand it touched the slimy fur of some wild animal that instantly sprang away its fiery eyes sparkling in the dark alroy recoiled with a sensation of woebegone dismay his shaken nerves could not sustain him under this base danger and these foul and novel trials he could not refrain from an exclamation of despair and when he remembered that he was now far beyond the reach of all human solace and sympathy even all human aid for a moment his mind seemed to desert him and he wrung his hands in forlorn and almost idiotic woe an awful thing it is the failure of the energies of a mastermind he who places implicit confidence in his genius will find himself some day utterly defeated and deserted tis bitter every paltry hind seems but to breathe to mock you slow indeed is such a mind to credit that the neverfailing resource can at least be wanting but so it is like a driedup fountain the perennial flow and bright fertility have ceased and ceased for ever then comes the madness of retrospection  draw a curtain draw a curtain and fling it over this agonising anatomy  the days of childhood his sweet sisters voice and smiling love their innocent pastimes and the kind solicitude of faithful servants all the soft detail of mild domestic life these were the sights and memories that flitted in wild play before the burning vision of alroy and rose upon his tortured mind empire and glory his sacred nation his imperial bride these these were nothing their worth had vanished with the creative soul that called them into action the pure sympathies of nature alone remained and all his thought and grief all his intelligence all his emotion were centred in his sister  it was the seventh morning a guard entered at an unaccustomed hour and sticking a torch into a niche in the wall announced that a person was without who had permission to speak to the prisoner they were the first human accents that had met the ear of alroy during his captivity which seemed to him an age a long dark period that cancelled all things he shuddered at the harsh tones he tried to answer but his unaccustomed lips refused their office he raised his heavy arms and endeavoured to signify his consciousness of what had been uttered yet indeed he had not listened to the message without emotion he looked forward to the grate with strange curiosity and as he looked he trembled the visitor entered muffled in a dark caftan the guard disappeared and the caftan falling to the ground revealed honain  my beloved alroy said the brother of jabaster and he advanced and pressed him to his bosom had it been miriam alroy might have at once expired but the presence of this worldly man called back his worldliness the revulsion of his feelings was wonderful pride perhaps even hope came to his aid all the associations seemed to counsel exertion for a moment he seemed the same alroy  i rejoice to find at least thee safe honain  i also if my security may lead to thine  still whispering hope  despair is the conclusion of fools  o honain tis a great trial i can play my part and yet methinks twere better we had not again met how is schirene  thinking of thee  tis something that she can think my mind has gone wheres miriam  free  thats something thou hast done that good good honain be kind to that sweet child if only for my sake thou art all she has left  she hath thee  her desolation  live and be her refuge  hows that these walls escape no no it is impossible  i do not deem it so  indeed ill do anything speak can we bribe can we cleave their skulls can we  calm thyself my friend there is no need of bribes no need of bloodshed we must make terms  terms we might have made them on the plain of nehauend terms terms with a captive victim  why victim  is arslan then so generous  he is a beast more savage than the boar that grinds its tusks within his countrys forests  why speakest thou then of hope  i spoke of certainty i did not mention hope  dear honain my brain is weak but i can bear strange things or else i should not be here i feel thy thoughtful friendship but indeed there need no winding words to tell my fate prythee speak out  in a word thy life is safe  what spared  if it please thee  please me life is sweet i feel its sweetness i want but little freedom and solitude are all i ask my life spared ill not believe it thou hast done this deed thou mighty man that masterest all souls thou hast not forgotten me thou hast not forgotten the days gone by thou hast not forgotten thine own alroy who calls thee worldly is a slanderer o honain thou art too faithful  i have no thought but for thy service prince  call me not prince call me thine own alroy my life spared tis wonderful when may i go let no one see me manage that honain thou canst manage all things i am for egypt thou hast been to egypt hast thou not honain  a very wondrous land twill please thee much  when may i go tell me when i may go when may i quit this dark and noisome cell tis worse than all their tortures dear honain air and light and i really think my spirit never would break but this horrible dungeon i scarce can look upon thy face sweet friend tis serious  wouldst thou have me gay  yes if we are free  alroy thou art a great spirit the greatest that i eer knew have ever read of i never knew thy like and never shall  tush tush sweet friend i am a broken reed but still i am free this is no time for courtly phrases lets go and go at once  a moment dear alroy i am no flatterer what i said came from my heart and doth concern us much and instantly i was saying thou hast no common mind alroy indeed thou hast a mind unlike all others listen my prince thou hast read mankind deeply and truly few have seen more than thyself and none have so rare a spring of that intuitive knowledge of thy race which is a gem to which experience is but a jeweller and without which no action can befriend us  well well  a moments calmness thou hast entered bagdad in triumph and thou hast entered the same city with every contumely which the base spirit of our race could cast upon its victim twas a great lesson  i feel it so  and teaches us how vile and valueless is the opinion of our fellowmen  alas tis true  i am glad to see thee in this wholesome temper tis full of wisdom  the miserable are often wise  but to believe is nothing unless we act speculation should only sharpen practice the time hath come to prove thy lusty faith in this philosophy i told thee we could make terms i have made them tomorrow it was doomed alroy should dieand what a death a death of infinite torture hast ever seen a man impaled81  hah  to view it is alone a doom  god of heaven  it is so horrible that tis ever marked that when this direful ceremony occurs the average deaths in cities greatly increase tis from the turning of the blood in the spectators who yet from some ungovernable madness cannot refrain from hurrying to the scene i speak with some authority i speak as a physician  speak no more i cannot endure it  tomorrow this doom awaited thee as for schirene  not for her oh surely not for her  no they were merciful she is a caliphs daughter tis not forgotten the axe would close her life her fair neck would give slight trouble to the headsmans art but for thy sister but for miriam she is a witch a jewish witch they would have burnt her alive  ill not believe it no no ill not believe it damnable bloody demons when i had power i spared all all butah me ah me why did i live  thou dost forget thyself i speak of that which was to have been not of that which is to be i have stepped in and communed with the conqueror i have made terms  what are they what can they be  easy to a philosopher like alroy an idle ceremony  be brief be brief  thou seest thy career is a great scandal to the moslemin i mark their weakness and i have worked upon it thy mere defeat or death will not blot out the stain upon their standard and their faith the public mind is wild with fantasies since alroy rose mens opinions flit to and fro with that fearful change that bodes no stable settlement of states none know what to cling to or where to place their trust creeds are doubted authority disputed they would gladly account for thy success by other than human means yet must deny thy mission there also is the fame of a fair and mighty princess a daughter of their caliphs which they would gladly clear i mark all this observe and work upon it so could we devise some means by which thy lingering followers could be for ever silenced this great scandal fairly erased and the public frame brought to a sounder and more tranquil pulse why they would concede much much very much  thy meaning not thy means are evident  they are in thy power  in mine tis a deep riddle prythee solve it  thou wilt be summoned at tomorrows noon before this arslan there in the presence of the assembled people who are now with him as much as they were with thee thou wilt be accused of magic and of intercourse with the infernal powers plead guilty  well is there more  some trifle they will then examine thee about the princess it is not difficult to confess that alroy won the caliphs daughter by an irresistible spell and now tis broken  so so is that all  the chief thou canst then address some phrases to the hebrew prisoners denying thy divine mission and so forth to settle the public mind observe upon this point for ever  ay ay and then  no more except for form upon the completion of the conditions mind you will be conveyed to what land you please with such amount of treasure as you choose there is no more except i say for form i would if i were you twill be expected i would just publicly affect to renounce our faith and bow before their prophet  hah art thou there is this thy freedom get thee behind me tempter never never never not a jot not a jot ill not yield a jot were my doom one everlasting torture id spurn thy terms is this thy high contempt of our poor kind to outrage my god to prove myself the vilest of the vile and baser than the basest rare philosophy o honain would we had never met  or never parted true had my word been taken alroy would neer have been betrayed  no more i pray thee sir no more leave me  were this a palace i would harsh words are softened by a friendly ear when spoken in affliction  say what they will i am the lords anointed as such i should have lived as such at least ill die  and miriam  the lord will not desert her she neer deserted him  schirene  schirene why for her sake alone i will die a hero shall it be said she loved a craven slave a base impostor a vile renegade a villainous dealer in drugs and charms oh no no no if only for her sake her sweet sweet sake my end shall be like my great life as the sun i rose like him i set still the world is warm with my bright fame and my last hour shall not disgrace my noon stormy indeed but glorious  honain took the torch from the niche and advanced to the grate it was not fastened he drew it gently open and led forward a veiled and female figure the veiled and female figure threw herself at the feet of alroy who seemed lost to what was passing a soft lip pressed his hand he started his chains clanked  alroy softly murmured the kneeling female  what voice is that wildly exclaimed the prince of the captivity it falls upon my ear like longforgotten music ill not believe it no ill not believe it art thou schirene  i am that wretched thing they called thy bride  oh this indeed is torture what impalement can equal this sharp moment look not on me let not our eyes meet they have met before like to the confluence of two shining rivers blending in one great stream of rushing light bear off that torch sir let impenetrable darkness cover our darker fortunes  alroy  she speaks again is she mad as i am that thus she plays with agony  sire said honain advancing and laying his hand gently on the arm of the captive i pray thee moderate this passion thou hast some faithful friends here who would fain commune in calmness for thy lasting welfare  welfare he mocks me  i beseech thee sire be calm if indeed i speak unto that great alroy whom all men fear and still may fear i pray remember tis not in palaces or in the battlefield alone that the heroic soul can conquer and command scenes like these are the great proof of a superior soul while we live our body is a temple where our genius pours forth its godlike inspiration and while the altar is not overthrown the deity may still work marvels then rouse thyself great sire bethink thee that a caliph or a captive there is no man within this breathing world like to alroy shall such a being fall without a struggle like some poor felon who has naught to trust to but the dull shuffling accident of chance i too am a prophet and i feel thou still wilt conquer  give me my sceptre then give me the sceptre i speak to the wrong brother it was not thou it was not thou that gavest it me  gain it once more the lord deserted david for a time still he pardoned him and still he died a king  a woman worked his fall  but thee a woman raises this great princess has she not suffered too yet her spirit is still unbroken list to her counsel it is deep and fond  so was our love  and is my alroy exclaimed the princess be calm i pray thee for my sake be calm i am calm for thine thou hast listened to all honain has told thee that wise man my alroy who never erred  tis but a word he counsels an empty word a most unmeaning form but speak it and thou art free and alroy and schirene may blend again their glorious careers and lives of sweet fruition dost thou not remember when walking in the garden of our joy and palled with empire how often hast thou sighed for some sweet isle unknown to man where thou mightst pass thy days with no companion but my faithful self and no adventures but our constant loves o my beloved that life may still be thine and dost thou falter dost call thyself forlorn with such fidelity and deem thyself a wretch when paradise with all its beauteous gates but woos thy entrance oh no no no no thou hast forgot schirene i fear me much thy overfond schirene who doats upon thy image in thy chains more than she did when those sweet hands of thine were bound with gems and played with her bright locks  she speaks of another world i do remember something who has sent this music to a dungeon my spirit softens with her melting words my eyes are moist i weep tis pleasant sorrow is joy compared with my despair i never thought to shed a tear again my brain is cooler  weep weep i pray thee weep but let me kiss away thy tears my soul didst think thy schirene had deserted thee ah that was it that made my bird so sad it shall be free and fly in a sweet sky and feed on flowers with its faithful mate ah me i am once more happy with my boy there was no misery but thy absence sweet methinks this dungeon is our bright kiosk is that the sunbeam or thy smile my love that makes the walls so joyful  did i smile ill not believe it  indeed you did ah see he smiles again why this is freedom there is no such thing as sorrow tis a lie to frighten fools  why honain whats this twould seem i am really joyful theres inspiration in her very breath i am another being nay waste not kisses on those ugly fetters  methinks they are gold  they were silent schirene drew alroy to his rough seat and gently placing herself on his knees threw her arms round his neck and buried her face in his breast after a few minutes she raised her head and whispered in his ear in irresistible accents of sweet exultation we shall be free tomorrow  tomorrow is the trial so near exclaimed the captive with an agitated voice and changing countenance tomorrow he threw schirene aside somewhat hastily and sprang from his seat tomorrow would it were over tomorrow methinks there is within that single word the fate of ages shall it be said tomorrow that alroy hah what art thou that risest now before me dread mighty spirit thou hast come in time to save me from perdition take me to thy bosom tis not stabbed they did not stab thee thou seest me here communing with thy murderers what then i am innocent ask them dread ghost and call upon their fiendish souls to say i am pure they would make me dark as themselves but shall not  honain honain exclaimed the princess in a terrible whisper as she flew to the physician he is wild again calm him calm him mark how he stands with his extended arms and fixed vacant eyes muttering most awful words my spirit fails me it is too fearful  the physician advanced and stood by the side of alroy but in vain attempted to catch his attention he ventured to touch his arm the prince started turned round and recognising him exclaimed in a shrieking voice off fratricide  honain recoiled pale and quivering schirene sprang to his arm what said he honain thou dost not speak i never saw thee pale before art thou too mad  would i were  all men are growing wild i am sure he said something i pray thee tell me what was it  ask him  i dare not tell me tell me honain  that i dare not  was it a word  ay a word to wake the dead let us begone  without our end coward ill speak to him my own alroy sweetly whispered the princess as she advanced before him  what has the fox left the tigress ist so eh are there no judgments are the innocent only haunted i am innocent i did not strangle thee he said rightly beware beware they who did this may do even feller deeds and here they are quick at their damned work thy body suffered great jabaster but me they would strangle body and soul  the princess shrieked and fell into the arms of the advancing honain who bore her out of the dungeon  after the fall of hamadan bostenay and miriam had been carried prisoners to bagdad through the interference of honain their imprisonment had been exempted from the usual hardships but they were still confined to their chambers in the citadel hitherto all the endeavours of miriam to visit her brother had been fruitless honain was the only person to whom she could apply for assistance and he in answer to her importunities only regretted his want of power to aid her in vain had she attempted by the offer of some remaining jewels to secure the cooperation of her guards with whom her loveliness and the softness of her manners had already ingratiated her she had not succeeded even in communicating with alroy but after the unsuccessful mission of honain to the dungeon the late vizier visited the sister of the captive and breaking to her with delicate skill the intelligence of the impending catastrophe he announced that he had at length succeeded in obtaining for her the desired permission to visit her brother and while she shuddered at the proximity of an event for which she had long attempted to prepare herself honain with some modifications whispered the means by which he flattered himself that it might yet be averted miriam listened to him in silence nor could he with all his consummate art succeed in extracting from her the slightest indication of her own opinion as to their expediency they parted honain as sanguine as the wicked ever are  as miriam dreaded both for herself and for alroy the shock of an unexpected meeting she availed herself of the influence of honain to send caleb to her brother to prepare him for her presence and to consult him as to the desirable moment caleb found his late master lying exhausted on the floor of his dungeon at first he would not speak or even raise his head nor did he for a long time apparently recognise the faithful retainer of his uncle but at length he grew milder and when he fully comprehended who the messenger was and the object of his mission he at first seemed altogether disinclined to see his sister but in the end postponed their meeting for the present and pleading great exhaustion fixed for that sad interview the first hour of dawn  the venerable bostenay had scarcely ever spoken since the fall of his nephew indeed it was but too evident that his faculties even if they had not entirely deserted him were at least greatly impaired he never quitted his couch he took no notice of what occurred he evinced no curiosity scarcely any feeling if indeed he occasionally did mutter an observation it was generally of an irritable character nor truly did he appear satisfied if anyone approached him save miriam from whom alone he would accept the scanty viands which he ever appeared disinclined to touch but his devoted niece amid all her harrowing affliction could ever spare to the protector of her youth a placid countenance a watchful eye a gentle voice and a ready hand her religion and her virtue the strength of her faith and the inspiration of her innocence supported this pure and hapless lady amid all her undeserved and unparalleled sorrows  it was long past midnight the young widow of abner reposed upon a couch in a soft slumber the amiable beruna and the beautiful bathsheba the curtains drawn watched the progress of the night  shall i wake her said the beautiful bathsheba methinks the stars are paler she bade me rouse her long before the dawn  her sleep is too benign let us not wake her replied the amiable beruna we rouse her only to sorrow  may her dreams at least be happy rejoined the beautiful bathsheba she sleeps tranquilly as a flower  the veil has fallen from her head said the amiable beruna i will replace it lightly on her brow is that well my bathsheba  it is well sweet beruna her face shrouded by the shawl is like a pearl in its shell see she moves  bathsheba  i am here sweet lady  is it near dawn  not yet sweet lady it is yet night it is long past the noon of night sweet lady methinks i scent the rising breath of morn but still tis night and the young moon shines like a sickle in the heavenly field amid the starry harvest  beruna gentle girl give me thy arm ill rise  the maidens advanced and gently raising their mistress supported her to the window  since our calamities said miriam i have never enjoyed such tranquil slumber my dreams were slight but soothing i saw him but he smiled have i slept long sweet girls ye are very watchful  dear lady let me bring thy shawl the air is fresh  but sweet i thank thee no my brow is not so cool as to need a covering tis a fair night  miriam gazed upon the wide prospect of the moonlit capital the elevated position of the citadel afforded an extensive view of the mighty groups of buildingseach in itself a city broken only by some vast and hooded cupola the tall slender white minarets of the mosques or the black and spiral form of some lonely cypressthrough which the rushing tigris flooded with light sent forth its broad and brilliant torrent all was silent not a single boat floated on the fleet river not a solitary voice broke the stillness of slumbering millions she gazed and as she gazed she could not refrain from contrasting the present scene which seemed the sepulchre of all the passions of our race with the unrivalled excitement of that stirring spectacle which bagdad exhibited on the celebration of the marriage of alroy how different then too was her position from her present and how happy the only sister of a devoted brother the lord and conqueror of asia the bride of his most victorious captain one worthy of all her virtues and whose youthful valour had encircled her brow with a diadem to miriam exalted station had brought neither cares nor crimes it had as it were only rendered her charity universal and her benevolence omnipotent she could not accuse herself this blessed womanshe could not accuse herself even in this searching hour of selfknowledgeshe could not accuse herself with all her meekness and modesty and humility of having for a moment forgotten her dependence on her god or her duty to her neighbour  but when her thoughts recurred to that being from whom they were indeed scarcely ever absent and when she remembered him and all his life and all the thousand incidents of his youth mysteries to the world and known only to her but which were indeed the prescience of his fame and thought of all his surpassing qualities and all his sweet affection his unrivalled glory and his impending fate the tears in silent agony forced their way down her pale and pensive cheek she bowed her head upon bathshebas shoulder and sweet beruna pressed her quivering hand  the moon set the stars grew white and ghastly and vanished one by one over the distant plain of the tigris the scene of the marriage pomp the dark purple horizon shivered into a rich streak of white and orange the solemn strain of the muezzin sounded from the minarets some one knocked at the door it was caleb  i am ready said miriam and for a moment she covered her face with her right hand think of me sweet maidens pray for me  leaning on caleb and lighted by a gaoler bearing torches miriam descended the damp and broken stairs that led to the dungeon she faltered as she arrived at the grate she stopped and leant against the cold and gloomy wall the gaoler and caleb preceded her she heard the voice of alroy it was firm and sweet its accents reassured her caleb came forth with a torch and held it to her feet and as he bent down he said my lord bade me beg you to be of good heart for he is  the gaoler having stuck his torch in the niche withdrew miriam desired caleb to stay without then summoning up all her energies she entered the dreadful abode alroy was standing to receive her the light fell full upon his countenance it smiled miriam could no longer restrain herself she ran forward and pressed him to her heart  o my best my long beloved whispered alroy such a meeting indeed leads captivity captive  but the sister could not speak she leant her head upon his shoulder and closed her eyes that she might not weep  courage dear heart courage courage whispered the captive indeed i am happy  my brother my brother  had we met yesterday you would have found me perhaps a little vexed but today i am myself again since i crossed the tigris i know not that i have felt such selfcontent i have had sweet dreams dear miriam full of solace and more than dreams the lord has pardoned me i truly think  o my brother your words are full of comfort for indeed i too have dreamed and dreamed of consolation my spirit since our fall has never been more tranquil  indeed i am happy  say so again my david let me hear again these words of solace  indeed tis very true my faithful friend it is not spoken in kind mockery to make you joyous for know last eve whether the lord repented of his wrath or whether some dreadful trials of which i will not speak and wish not to remember had made atonement for my manifold sins but so it was that about the time my angel miriam sent her soothing message a feeling of repose came over me such as i long have coveted anon i fell into a slumber deep and sweet and instead of those wild and whirling images that of late have darted from my brain when it should rest glimpses of empire and conspiracy snatches of fierce wars and mocking loves i stood beside our native fountains brink and gathered flowers with my earliest friend as i placed the fragrant captives in your flowing locks there came jabaster that great injured man no longer stern and awful but with benignant looks and full of love and he said david the lord hath marked thy faithfulness in spite of the darkness of thy dungeon so he vanished he spoke my sister of some strange temptations by heavenly aid withstood no more of that i awoke and lo i heard my name still called full of my morning dream i thought it was you and i answered dear sister art thou here but no one answered and then reflecting my memory recognised those thrilling tones that summoned alroy in jabasters cave the daughter of the voice even that sacred messenger i am full of faith the lord hath pardoned me be sure of that  i cannot doubt it david you have done great things for israel no one in these latter days has risen like you if you have fallen you were young and strangely tempted  yet israel israel did i not feel a worthier leader will yet arise my heart would crack i have betrayed my country  oh no no no you have shown what we can do and shall do your memory alone is inspiration a great career although baulked of its end is still a landmark of human energy failure when sublime is not without its purpose great deeds are great legacies and work with wondrous usury by what man has done we learn what man can do and gauge the power and prospects of our race  alas there is no one to guard my name twill be reviled or worse twill be forgotten  never the memory of great actions never dies the sun of glory though awhile obscured will shine at last and so sweet brother perchance some poet in some distant age within whose veins our sacred blood may flow his fancy fired with the national theme may strike his harp to alroys wild career and consecrate a name too long forgotten  may love make thee a prophetess exclaimed alroy as he bent down his head and embraced her do not tarry he whispered tis better that we should part in this firm mood  she sprang from him she clasped her hands we will not part she exclaimed with energy i will die with thee  blessed girl be calm do not unman me  i am calm see i do not weep not a tear not a tear they are all in my heart  go go my miriam angel of light tarry no longer i pray thee go i would not think of the past let all my mind be centred in the present thy presence calls back our bygone days and softens me too much my duty to my uncle go dear one go  and leave thee leave thee tooh my david thou hast seen thou hast heardhonain  no more let not that accursed name profane those holy lips raise not the demon in me  i am silent yet tis madness oh my brother thou hast a fearful trial  the god of israel is my refuge he saved our fathers in the fiery furnace he will save me  i am full of faith i pray thee let me stay  i would be silent i would be alone i cannot speak miriam i ask one favour the last and dearest from her who has never had a thought but for my wishes blessed being leave me  i go o alroy farewell let me kiss you again once more let me kneel and bless you brother beloved brother great and glorious brother i am worthy of you i will not weep i am prouder in this dread moment of your love than all your foes can be of their hard triumph  beruna and bathsheba received their mistress when she returned to her chamber they marked her desolate air she was silent pale and cold they bore her to her couch whereon she sat with a most listless and unmeaning look her quivering lips parted her eyes fixed upon the ground in vacant abstraction and her arms languidly folded before her beruna stole behind her and supported her back with pillows and bathsheba unnoticed wiped the slight foam from her mouth thus miriam remained for several hours her faithful maidens in vain watching for any indication of her selfconsciousness  suddenly a trumpet sounded  what is that exclaimed miriam in a shrill voice and looking up with a distracted glance  neither of them answered since they were aware that it betokened the going forth of alroy to his trial  miriam remained in the same posture and with the same expression of wild inquiry another trumpet sounded and after that a shout of the people then she raised up her arms to heaven and bowed her head and died  has the second trumpet sounded  to be sure run run for a good place where is abdallah  selling sherbet in the square we shall find him has alroy come forth  yes he goes the other way we shall be too late only think of abdallah selling sherbet  father let me go  you will be in the way you are too young you will see nothing little boys should stay at home  no they should not i will go you can put me on your shoulders  where is ibrahim where is ali we must all keep together we shall have to fight for it i wish abdallah were here only think of his selling sherbet  keep straight forward that is right it is no use going that way the bazaar is shut there is fakreddin there is osman effendi he has got a new page  so he has i declare and a very pretty boy too  father will they impale alroy alive  i am sure i do not know

that is open all right all right did you push me sir  suppose i did push you sir what then sir  come along dont quarrel that is a karasmian they think they are to do what they like we are five to one to be sure but still there is nothing like peace and quiet i wish abdallah were here with his stout shoulders only think of his selling sherbet  the square of the grand mosque the same spot where jabaster met abidan by appointment was the destined scene of the pretended trial of alroy thither by break of day the sightloving thousands of the capital had repaired in the centre of the square a large circle was described by a crimson cord and guarded by karasmian soldiers around this the swelling multitude pressed like the gathering waves of ocean but whenever the tide set in with too great an impulse the savage karasmians appeased the ungovernable element by raising their battleaxes and brutally breaking the crowns and belabouring the shoulders of their nearest victims as the morning advanced the terraces of the surrounding houses covered with awnings were crowded with spectators all bagdad was astir since the marriage of alroy there had never been such a merry morn as the day of his impalement  at one end of the circle was erected a magnificent throne half way between the throne and the other end of the circle but further back stood a company of negro eunuchs hideous to behold who clothed in white and armed with various instruments of torture surrounded the enormous stakes tall thin and sharp that were prepared for the final ceremony  the flourish of trumpets the clash of cymbals and the wild beat of the tambour announced the arrival of alp arslan from the serail an avenue to the circle had been preserved through the multitude the royal procession might be traced as it wound through the populace by the sparkling and undulating line of plumes of honour and the dazzling forms of the waving streamers on which were inscribed the names of allah and the prophet suddenly amid the bursts of music and the shouts of the spectators many of whom on the terraces humbled themselves on their knees alp arslan mounted the throne around which ranged themselves his chief captains and a deputation of the mullahs and imams and cadis and other principal personages of the city  the king of karasmé was tall in stature and somewhat meagre in form he was fair or rather sandycoloured with a red beard and blue eyes and a flat nose the moment he was seated a trumpet was heard in the distance from an opposite quarter and it was soon understood throughout the assembly that the great captive was about to appear  a band of karasmian guards first entered the circle and ranged themselves round the cord with their backs to the spectators after them came fifty of the principal hebrew prisoners with their hands bound behind them but evidently more for form than security to these succeeded a small covered wagon drawn by mules and surrounded by guards from which was led forth his legs relieved from their manacles but his hands still in heavy chains david alroy  a universal buzz of blended sympathy and wonder and fear and triumph arose throughout the whole assembly each man involuntarily stirred the vast populace moved to and fro in agitation his garments soiled and tattered his head bare and his long locks drawn off his forehead pale and thin but still unsubdued the late conqueror and caliph of bagdad threw around a calm and imperial glance upon those who were but recently his slaves  the trumpets again sounded order was called and a crier announced that his highness alp arslan the mighty sovereign of karasmé their lord protector and king and avenger of allah and the prophet against all rebellious and evilminded jews and giaours was about to speak there was a deep and universal silence and then sounded a voice high as the eagles in a storm  david alroy said his conqueror you are brought hither this day neither for trial nor for judgment captured in arms against your rightful sovereign you are of course prepared like other rebels for your doom such a crime alone deserves the most avenging punishments what then do you merit who are loaded with a thousand infamies who have blasphemed allah and the prophet and by the practice of magic arts and the aid of the infernal powers have broken the peace of kingdoms occasioned infinite bloodshed outraged all law religion and decency misled the minds of your deluded votaries and especially by a direct compact with eblis by horrible spells and infamous incantations captivated the senses of an illustrious princess heretofore famous for the practice of every virtue and a descendant of the prophet himself  behold these stakes of palmwood sharper than a lance the most terrible retribution that human ingenuity has devised for the guilty awaits you but your crimes baffle all human vengeance look forward for your satisfactory reward to those infernal powers by whose dark cooperation you have occasioned such disasters your punishment is public that all men may know that the guilty never escape and that if your heart be visited by the slightest degree of compunction for your numerous victims you may this day by the frank confession of the irresistible means by which you seduced them exonerate your victims from the painful and ignominious end with which through your influence they are now threatened mark o assembled people the infinite mercy of the vicegerent of allah he allows the wretched man to confess his infamy and to save by his confession his unfortunate victims i have said it glory to allah  and the people shouted he has said it he has said it glory to allah he is great he is great and mahomed is his prophet  am i to speak enquired alroy when the tumult had subsided the melody of his voice commanded universal attention  alp arslan nodded his head in approbation  king of karasmé i stand here accused of many crimes now hear my answers tis said i am a rebel my answer is i am a prince as thou art of a sacred race and far more ancient i owe fealty to no one but to my god and if i have broken that i am yet to learn that alp arslan is the avenger of his power as for thy god and prophet i know not them though they acknowledge mine tis well understood in every polity my people stand apart from other nations and ever will in spite of suffering so much for blasphemy i am true to a deep faith of ancient days which even the sacred writings of thy race still reverence for the arts magical i practised and the communion with infernal powers tis said i held know king i raised the standard of my faith by the direct commandment of my god the great creator of the universe what need of magic then what need of paltering with petty fiends when backed by his omnipotence my magic was his inspiration need i prove why with such aid my people crowded round me the time will come when from out our ancient seed a worthier chief will rise not to be quelled even by thee sire  for that unhappy princess of whom something was said with no great mercy as it seemed to me that lady is my wife my willing wife the daughter of a caliph still my wife although your stakes may make her soon a widow i stand not here to account for female fancies believe me sire she gave her beauty to my raptured arms with no persuasions but such as became a soldier and a king it may seem strange to thee upon thy throne that the flower of asia should be plucked by one so vile as i am remember the accidents of fortune are most strange i was not always what i am we have met before there was a day and that too not long since when but for the treachery of some knaves i mark here fortune seemed half inclined to reverse our fates had i conquered i trust i should have shown more mercy  the king of karasmé was the most passionate of men he had made a speech according to the advice and instructions of his councillors who had assured him that the tone he adopted would induce alroy to confess all that he required and especially to vindicate the reputation of the princess schirene who had already contrived to persuade alp arslan that she was the most injured of her sex the king of karasmé stamped thrice on the platform of his throne and exclaimed with great fire by my beard ye have deceived me the dog has confessed nothing  all the councillors and chief captains and the mullahs and the imams and the cadis and the principal personages of the city were in consternation they immediately consulted together and after much disputation agreed that before they proceeded to extremities it was expedient to prove what the prisoner would not confess a venerable sheikh clothed in flowing robes of green with a long white beard and a turban like the tower of babel then rose his sacred reputation procured silence while he himself delivered a long prayer supplicating allah and the prophet to confound all blaspheming jews and giaours and to pour forth words of truth from the mouths of religious men and then the venerable sheikh summoned all witnesses against david alroy immediately advanced kisloch the kourd to whom being placed in an eminent position the cadi of bagdad drawing forth a scroll from his velvet bag read a deposition wherein the worthy kisloch stated that he first became acquainted with the prisoner david alroy in some ruins in the desert the haunt of banditti of whom alroy was the chief that he kisloch was a reputable merchant and that his caravan had been plundered by these robbers and he himself captured that on the second night of his imprisonment alroy appeared to him in the likeness of a lion and on the third of a bull with fiery eyes that he was in the habit of constantly transforming himself that he frequently raised spirits that at length on one terrible night eblis himself came in great procession and presented alroy with the sceptre of solomon ben daoud and that the next day alroy raised his standard and soon after massacred hassan subah and his seljuks by the visible aid of many terrible demons  calidas the indian the guebre and the negro and a few congenial spirits were not eclipsed in the satisfactory character of their evidence by the luminous testimony of kisloch the kourd the irresistible career of the hebrew conqueror was undeniably accounted for and the honour of moslem arms and the purity of moslem faith were established in their pristine glory and all their unsullied reputation david alroy was proved to be a child of eblis a sorcerer and a dealer in charms and magical poisons the people listened with horror and with indignation they would have burst through the guards and torn him in pieces had not they been afraid of the karasmian battleaxes so they consoled themselves with the prospect of his approaching tortures  the cadi of bagdad bowed himself before the king of karasmé and whispered at a respectful distance in the royal ear the trumpets sounded the criers enjoined silence and the royal lips again moved  hear o ye people and be wise the chief cadi is about to read the deposition of the royal princess schirene chief victim of the sorcerer  and the deposition was read which stated that david alroy possessed and wore next to his heart a talisman given him by eblis the virtue of which was so great that if once it were pressed to the heart of any woman she was no longer mistress of her will such had been the unhappy fate of the daughter of the commander of the faithful  is it so written enquired the captive  it is so written replied the cadi and bears the imperial signature of the princess  it is a forgery  the king of karasmé started from his throne and in his rage nearly descended its steps his face was like scarlet his beard was like a flame a favourite minister ventured gently to restrain the royal robe  kill the dog on the spot muttered the king of karasmé  the princess is herself here said the cadi to bear witness to the spells of which she was a victim but from which by the power of allah and the prophet she is now released  alroy started  advance royal princess said the cadi and if the deposition thou hast heard be indeed true condescend to hold up the imperial hand that adorned it with thy signature  a band of eunuchs near the throne gave way a female figure veiled to her feet appeared she held up her hand amid the breathless agitation of the whole assembly the ranks of the eunuchs again closed a shriek was heard and the veiled figure disappeared  i am ready for thy tortures king said alroy in a tone of deep depression his firmness appeared to have deserted him his eyes were cast upon the ground apparently he was buried in profound thought or had delivered himself up to despair  prepare the stakes said alp arslan  an involuntary but universal shudder might be distinguished through the whole assembly  a slave advanced and offered alroy a scroll he recognised the nubian who belonged to honain his former minister informed him that he was at hand that the terms he offered in the dungeon might even yet be granted that if alroy would as he doubted not as he entreated him accept them he was to place the scroll in his bosom but that if he were still inexorable still madly determined on a horrible and ignominious end he was to tear the scroll and throw it in to the arena instantly alroy took the scroll and with great energy tore it into a thousand pieces a puff of wind carried the fragments far and wide the mob fought for these last memorials of david alroy and this little incident occasioned a great confusion  in the meantime the negroes prepared the instruments of torture and of death  the obstinacy of this jewish dog makes me mad said the king of karasmé to his courtiers i will hold some parley with him before he dies the favourite minister entreated his sovereign to be content but the royal beard grew so red and the royal eyes flashed forth such terrible sparks of fire that even the favourite minister at length gave way  the trumpet sounded the criers called silence and the voice of alp arslan was again heard  thou dog dost see what is preparing for thee dost know what awaits thee in the halls of thy master eblis can a jew be influenced even by false pride is not life sweet is it not better to be my slipperbearer than to be impaled  magnanimous alp arslan replied alroy in a tone of undisguised contempt thinkest thou that any torture can be equal to the recollection that i have been conquered by thee  by my beard he mocks me exclaimed the karasmian monarch he defies me touch not my robe i will parley with him ye see no farther than a hooded hawk ye sons of a blind mother this is a sorcerer he hath yet some master spell he will yet save himself he will fly into the air or sink into the earth he laughs at our tortures the king of karasmé precipitately descended the steps of his throne followed by his favourite minister and his councillors and chief captains and the cadis and the mullahs and the imams and the principal personages of the city  sorcerer exclaimed alp arslan insolent sorcerer base son of a base mother dog of dogs dost thou defy us does thy master eblis whisper hope dost thou laugh at our punishments wilt thou fly into the air wilt thou sink into the earth eh eh is it so is it so the breathless monarch ceased from the exhaustion of passion he tore his beard out by the roots he stamped with uncontrollable rage  thou art wiser than thy councillors royal arslan i do defy thee my master although not eblis has not deserted me i laugh at thy punishments thy tortures i despise i shall both sink into the earth and mount into the air art thou answered  by my beard exclaimed the enraged arslan i am answered let eblis save thee if he can and the king of karasmé the most famous master of the sabre in asia drew his blade like lightning from its sheath and took off the head of alroy at a stroke it fell and as it fell a smile of triumphant derision seemed to play upon the dying features of the hero and to ask of his enemies where now are all your tortures82     notes to alroy  footnote 1 page 4we shall yet see

cabalists after the suppression of the sedition in which his master had been so unsuccessful he concealed himself in a cave where according to the jewish historians he received revelations which he afterwards delivered to his disciples and which they carefully preserved in the book called sohar his master akibha who lived soon after the destruction of jerusalem was the author of the famous book jezirah quoted by the jews as of divine authority when akibha was far advanced in life appeared the famous impostor barchochebas who under the character of the messiah promised to deliver his countrymen from the power of the emperor adrian akibha espoused his cause and afforded him the protection and support of his name and an army of two hundred thousand men repaired to his standard the

contest was doubtful the messiah himself was not taken until the end of four yearsenfield philosophy of the jews vol ii  two methods of instruction were in use among the jews the one public or exoteric the other secret or esoteric the exoteric doctrine was that which was openly taught the people from the law of moses and the traditions of the fathers the esoteric was that which treated of the mysteries of the divine nature and other sublime subjects and was known by the name of the cabala the latter was after the manner of the pythagorean and egyptian mysteries taught only to certain persons who were bound under the most solemn anathema not to divulge it concerning the miraculous origin and preservation of the cabala the jews relate many marvellous tales they derive these mysteries from adam and assert that while the first man was in paradise the angel rasiel brought him a book from heaven which contained the doctrines of heavenly wisdom and that when adam received this book angels came down to him to learn its contents but that he refused to admit them to the knowledge of sacred things entrusted to him alone that after the fall this book was taken back into heaven that after many prayers and tears god restored it to adam from whom it passed to seth in the degenerate age before the flood this book was lost and the mysteries it contained almost forgotten but they were restored by special revelation to abraham who committed them to writing in the book jezirahvide enfield vol ii p 219  the hebrew word cabala says dom calmet signifies tradition and the rabbins who are named cabalists apply themselves principally to the combination of certain words numbers and letters by the means of which they boasted they could reveal the future and penetrate the sense of the most difficult passages of scripture this science does not appear to have any fixed principles but depends upon certain ancient traditions whence its name cabala the cabalists have a great number of names which they style sacred by means of which they raise spirits and affect to obtain supernatural intelligencesee calmet art cabala  we spake before says lightfoot of the commonness of magick among them one singular means whereby they kept their own in delusion and whereby they affronted ours the general expectation of the nation of messias coming when he did had this double and contrary effect that it forwarded those that belonged to god to believe and receive the gospel and those that did not it gave encouragement to some to take upon them they were christ or some great prophet and to others it gave some persuasion to be deluded by them these deceivers dealt most of them with magick and that cheat ended not when jerusalem ended though one would have thought that had been a fair term of not further expecting messias but since the people were willing to be deceived by such expectation there rose up deluders still that were willing to deceive themlightfoot vol ii p

lore of their predecessors the stars moved and formed letters and lines when consulted by any of the highlyinitiated of the cabalists this they styled the celestial alphabet  footnote 12 page 38the daughter of the voice both the talmudick and the latter rabbins says lightfoot make frequent mention of bath kol or filia vocis or an echoing voice which served under the second temple for their utmost refuge of revelation for when urim and thummim the oracle was ceased and prophecy was decayed and gone they had as they say certain strange and extraordinary voices upon certain extraordinary occasions which were their warnings and advertisements in some special matters infinite instances of this might be adduced if they might be believed now here it may be questioned why they called it bath kol the daughter of a voice and not a voice itself if the strictness of the hebrew word bath be to be stood upon which always it is not it may be answered that it is called the daughter of a voice in relation to the oracles of urim and thummim for whereas that was a voice given from off the mercyseat within the vail and this upon the decay of that oracle came as it were in its place it might not unfitly or improperly be called a daughter or successor of that voicelightfoot vol i pp 485 486 consult also the learned doctor vol ii pp 128 129 it was used for a testimony from heaven but

reason to believe that it had not been introduced in the time of alroy when we consider that the life of an oriental at the present day mainly consists in drinking coffee and smoking tobacco we cannot refrain from asking ourselves what did he do before either of these comparatively modern inventions was discovered for a long time i was inclined to suspect that tobacco might have been in use in asia before it was introduced into europe but a passage in old sandys in which he mentions the wretched tobacco smoke in turkey and accounts for it by that country being supplied with the dregs of our markets demonstrates that in his time there was no native growth in asia yet the choicest tobaccos are now grown on the coast of syria the real levant but did the asiatics smoke any other plant or substance before tobacco in syria at the present day they smoke a plant called timbac the chinese smoke opium the artificial preparations for the hookah are known to all indians i believe however that these are all refinements and for this reason that in the classic writers who were as well acquainted with the oriental nations as ourselves we find no allusion to the practice of smoking the anachronism of the pipe i have not therefore ventured to commit and that of coffee will i trust be pardoned  footnote 20 page 58wilder gestures of the dancing girls these dancing girls abound

in the most magnificent style and were then invited under pain of death either to eat pork to accept a pagan mistress or to drink wine consecrated to idols after long consultation the doctors in great tribulation agreed to save their heads by accepting the last alternative since the first and second were forbidden by moses and the last only by the rabbins the king assented the doctors drank the impure wine and as it was exceedingly good drank freely the wine as will sometimes happen created a terrible appetite the table was covered with dishes and the doctors heated by the grape were not sufficiently careful of what they partook in short the wicked king pirgandicus contrived that they should sup off pork and being carried from the table quite tipsy each of the eleven had the mortification of finding himself next morning in the arms of a pagan mistress in the course of the year all the eleven died sudden deaths and this visitation occurred to them not because they had violated the law of moses but because they believed that the precepts of the rabbins could be outraged with more impunity than the word of god  footnote 38 page 94and conquered julius cæsar this

years more under shemaiah and abtalion and after them he was president of the sanhedrim forty years more the beginning of his presidency is generally conceded upon to have been just one hundred years

moon is one of the most important festivals of the hebrews our year says the learned author of the rites and ceremonies is divided into twelve lunar months some of which consist of twentynine others of thirty days which difference is occasioned by the various appearance of the new moon in point of time for if it appeared on the 30th day the 29th was the last day of the precedent month but if it did not appear till the 31st day the 30th was the last day and the 31st the first of the subsequent month and that was an intercalary moon of all which take the following account  our nation heretofore not only observing the rules of some fixed calculation also celebrated the feast of the new moon according to the phasis or first appearance of the moon which was done in compliance with gods command as our received traditions inform us  hence it came to pass that the first appearance was not to be determined only by rules of art but also by the testimony of such persons as deposed before the sanhedrim or great senate that they had seen the new moon so a committee of three were appointed from among the said sanhedrim to receive the deposition of the parties aforesaid who after having calculated what time the moon might possibly appear despatched some persons into high and mountainous places to observe and give their evidence accordingly concerning the first appearance of the moon  as soon as the new moon was either consecrated or appointed to be observed notice was given by the sanhedrim to the rest of the nation what day had been fixed for the new moon or first day of the month because that was to be the rule and measure according to which they were obliged to keep their feasts and fasts in every month respectively  this notice was given to them in time of peace by firing of beacons set up for that purpose which was looked upon as the readiest way of communication but in time of war when all places were full of enemies who made use of beacons to amuse our nation with it was thought fit to discontinue it  footnote 79 page 263the women chatted at the fountain the bath and the fountain are the favourite scenes of feminine conversation  footnote 80 page

translated into latin by vorstius lug 1654 is an extract from a hebrew ms containing an account of alroy i subjoin a translation of a passage respecting his death  r maimonides deposes that the sultan asked him whether he were the messiah and that he answered him i am and that then the monarch inquired of him what sign he had to this he replied that they might cut off his head and that he would return to life then the king commanded that his head should be cut off and he died having said previously to the monarch that the latter should not lack in his life the most grievous torments  seven years before the incident quoted above the israelites had serious troubles on account of a son of belial who called himself the messiah so that the tetrarch and the princes were justly incensed against the jews to such an extent indeed that they sent to the latter to inquire whether they desired the reign of the messiah the name of this accursed troubler was david eldavid alias alroy who hailed from the city of omadia where were gathered about a thousand rich honest happy and decentlyliving families whose tabernacle was the principal resort of those that dwelt in the neighbourhood of the river sabbathion and around them were gathered more than a hundred minor tabernacles  this city was on the border of the region of media and the dialect used there was the targum thence to the region of golan is a journey of fifty days it is under the rule of persia to which it pays a heavy tribute every fifteen years and one golden talent in addition moreover this man david eldavid was educated under the prince of the chaldean captivity in the care of the eminent scholiarch in the city of bagdad who was preeminently wise in the talmud and in all foreign sciences as well as in all books of divination magic and chaldean lore this david eldavid out of the boldness and arrogance of his heart lifted his hand against the ruling powers and collected those jews who dwelt in the neighbourhood of mount chophtan seducing them to follow him into battle against all the neighbouring peoples he showed them signsof what value they knew not there were men indeed who supported him on account of his magic art and of certain things to be done others said that his great power came from the hand of god those who flocked to him called him the messiah lauding and extolling him  in another epoch of persian history a certain jew arose calling himself the messiah and prospered greatly a large part of the israelitish population believed in him but when the king indeed heard of all this pretenders power and that he proposed to join battle with him he sent to the jews who lived thereabouts and notified them that unless they deserted this man and came oui from all association with him they certainly should be slain every one of them with the sword and afterward the children and the women should perish then the whole population of israel assembled and argued with this man and threw themselves down before him on the ground strongly supplicating him with clamour and tears to depart from them why indeed should he put them and others in danger had not the king already sworn that they should perish by the sword and wherefore should he bring affliction upon all the jewish inhabitants of persia responding he said i have come to serve you and ye will not have me whom do ye fear who dares stand in front of me and what doth this persian king that he dare not oppose me and my sword the jews asked him what sign he had that he was the messiah he answered my mission prospers the messiah needs no other sign they answered that many had acted likewise and that none had reached success then he drove them forth from his face with superb indignation
