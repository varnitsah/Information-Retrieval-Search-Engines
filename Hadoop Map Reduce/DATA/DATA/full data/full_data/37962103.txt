 mr direck visits mr britling   section 1  it was the sixth day of mr direcks first visit to england and he was at his acutest perception of differences he found england in every way gratifying and satisfactory and more of a contrast with things american than he had ever dared to hope  he had promised himself this visit for many years but being of a sunny rather than energetic temperamentthough he firmly believed himself to be a reservoir of clearsighted american energyhe had allowed all sorts of things and more particularly the uncertainties of miss mamie nelson to keep him back but now there were no more uncertainties about miss mamie nelson and mr direck had come over to england just to convince himself and everybody else that there were other interests in life for him than mamie  and also he wanted to see the old country from which his maternal grandmother had sprung wasnt there even now in his bedroom in new york a watercolour of market saffron church where the dear old lady had been confirmed and generally he wanted to see europe as an interesting side show to the excursion he hoped in his capacity of the rather underworked and rather oversalaried secretary of the massachusetts society for the study of contemporary thought to discuss certain agreeable possibilities with mr britling who lived at matchings easy  mr direck was a type of man not uncommon in america he was very much after the fashion of that clean and pleasantlooking person one sees in the advertisements in american magazines that agreeable person who smiles and says good its the fizgig brand or yes its a wilkins and thats the best or my shirtfront never rucks its a chesson but now he was saying still with the same firm smile good its english he was pleased by every unlikeness to things american by every item he could hail as characteristic in the train to london he had laughed aloud with pleasure at the chequerboard of little fields upon the hills of cheshire he had chuckled to find himself in a compartment without a corridor he had tipped the polite yet kindly guard magnificently after doubting for a moment whether he ought to tip him at all and he had gone about his hotel in london saying lordy lordy my word in a kind of ecstasy verifying the delightful absence of telephone of steamheat of any dependent bathroom at breakfast the waiter out of dickens it seemed had refused to know what cereals were and had given him his egg in a china eggcup such as you see in the pictures in punch the thames when he sallied out to see it had been too good to be true the smallest thing in rivers he had ever seen and he had had to restrain himself from affecting a marked accent and accosting some passerby with the question say but is this little wet ditch here the historical river thames  in america it must be explained mr direck spoke a very good and careful english indeed but he now found the utmost difficulty in controlling his impulse to use a highpitched nasal drone and indulge in dry americanisms and poker metaphors upon all occasions when people asked him questions he wanted to say yep or sure words he would no more have used in america than he could have used a bowie knife but he had a sense of rôle he wanted to be visibly and audibly america eyewitnessing he wanted to be just exactly what he supposed an englishman would expect him to be at any rate his clothes had been made by a strongly american new york tailor and upon the strength of them a taximan had assumed politely but firmly that the shillings on his taximeter were dollars an incident that helped greatly to sustain the effect of mr direck in mr direcks mind as something standing out with an almost representative clearness against the english scene so much so that the taximan got the dollars  because all the time he had been coming over he had dreaded that it wasnt true that england was a legend that london would turn out to be just another thundering great new york and the english exactly like new englanders   section 2  and now here he was on the branch line of the little old great eastern railway on his way to matchings easy in essex and he was suddenly in the heart of washington irvings england  washington irvings england indeed it was he couldnt sit still and just peep at it he had to stand up in the little compartment and stick his large firmfeatured kindly countenance out of the window as if he greeted it the country under the june sunshine was neat and bright as an oldworld garden with little fields of corn surrounded by dogrose hedges and woods and small rushy pastures of an infinite tidiness he had seen a real deer park it had rather tumbledown iron gates between its shieldsurmounted pillars and in the distance beyond all question was bracebridge hall nestling among great trees he had seen thatched and timbered cottages and halfadozen inns with creaking signs he had seen a fat vicar driving himself along a grassy lane in a governess cart drawn by a fat grey pony it wasnt like any reality he had ever known it was like travelling in literature  mr britlings address was the dower house and it was mr britlings note had explained on the farther edge of the park at claverings claverings the very name for some stately home of england  and yet this was only fortytwo miles from london surely it brought things within the suburban range if matchings easy were in america commuters would live there but in supposing that mr direck displayed his ignorance of a fact of the greatest importance to all who would understand england there is a gap in the suburbs of london the suburbs of london stretch west and south and even west by north but to the northeastward there are no suburbs instead there is essex essex is not a suburban county it is a characteristic and individualised county which wins the heart between dear essex and the centre of things lie two great barriers the east end of london and epping forest before a train could get to any villadom with a cargo of seasonticket holders it would have to circle about this rescued woodland and travel for twenty unprofitable miles and so once you are away from the main great eastern lines essex still lives in the peace of the eighteenth century and london the modern babylon is like the stars just a light in the nocturnal sky in matchings easy as mr britling presently explained to mr direck there are halfadozen old people who have never set eyes on london in their livesand do not want to  ayeya  fussin about thea  mr robinson e went to lon e did thats ow e urt is fut  mr direck had learnt at the mainline junction that he had to tell the guard to stop the train for matchings easy it only stopped by request the thing was getting better and better and when mr direck seized his grip and got out of the train there was just one little old essex stationmaster and porter and signalman and everything holding a red flag in his hand and talking to mr britling about the cultivation of the sweet peas which glorified the station and there was the mr britling who was the only item of business and the greatest expectation in mr direcks european journey and he was quite unlike the portraits mr direck had seen and quite unmistakably mr britling all the same since there was nobody else upon the platform and he was advancing with a gesture of welcome  did you ever see such peas mr dick said mr britling by way of introduction  my word said mr direck in a good old farmer hayseed kind of voice  ayeya said the stationmaster in singularly strident tones it be a rare year for sweet peas and then he slammed the door of the carriage in a leisurely manner and did dismissive things with his flag while the two gentlemen took stock as people say of one another   section 3  except in the doubtful instance of miss mamie nelson mr direcks habit was good fortune pleasant things came to him such was his position as the salaried secretary of this society of thoughtful massachusetts business men to which allusion has been made its purpose was to bring itself expeditiously into touch with the best thought of the age  too busily occupied with practical realities to follow the thought of the age through all its divagations and into all its recesses these massachusetts business men had had to consider methods of access more quintessential and nuclear and they had decided not to hunt out the best thought in its merely germinating stages but to wait until it had emerged and flowered to some trustworthy recognition and then rather than toil through recondite and possibly already reconsidered books and writings generally to offer an impressive fee to the emerged new thinker and to invite him to come to them and to lecture to them and to have a conference with them and to tell them simply competently and completely at first hand just all that he was about to come in fact and be himselfin a highly concentrated form in this way a number of interesting europeans had been given very pleasant excursions to america and the society had been able to form very definite opinions upon their teaching and mr britling was one of the representative thinkers upon which this society had decided to inform itself it was to broach this invitation and to offer him the impressive honorarium by which the society honoured not only its guests but itself that mr direck had now come to matchings easy he had already sent mr britling a letter of introduction not indeed intimating his precise purpose but mentioning merely a desire to know him and the letter had been so happily phrased and its writer had left such a memory of pleasant hospitality on mr britlings mind during mr britlings former visit to new york that it had immediately produced for mr direck an invitation not merely to come and see him but to come and stay over the weekend  and here they were shaking hands  mr britling did not look at all as mr direck had expected him to look he had expected an englishman in a country costume of golfing tweeds like the englishman in country costume one sees in american illustrated stories drooping out of the country costume of golfing tweeds he had expected to see the mildly unhappy face pensive even to its drooping moustache with which mr britlings publisher had for some faulty and unfortunate reason familiarised the american public instead of this mr britling was in a miscellaneous costume and mildness was the last quality one could attribute to him his moustache his hair his eyebrows bristled his flaming freckled face seemed about to bristle too his little hazel eyes came out with a ping and looked at mr direck mr britling was one of a large but still remarkable class of people who seem at the mere approach of photography to change their hair their clothes their moral natures no photographer had ever caught a hint of his essential britlingness and bristlingness only the camera could ever induce mr britling to brush his hair and for the camera alone did he reserve that expression of submissive martyrdom mr direck knew and mr direck was altogether unprepared for a certain casualness of costume that sometimes overtook mr britling he was wearing now a very old blue flannel blazer no hat and a pair of knickerbockers not tweed breeches but tweed knickerbockers of a remarkable bagginess and made of one of those virtuous socialistic homespun tweeds that drag out into woolly knots and strings wherever there is attrition his stockings were worsted and wrinkled and on his feet were those extraordinary slippers of brightcoloured bastlike interwoven material one buys in the north of france these were purple with a touch of green he had in fact thought of the necessity of meeting mr direck at the station at the very last moment and had come away from his study in the clothes that had happened to him when he got up his face wore the amiable expression of a wirehaired terrier disposed to be friendly and it struck mr direck that for a man of his real intellectual distinction mr britling was unusually short  for there can be no denying that mr britling was in a sense distinguished the hero and subject of this novel was at its very beginning a distinguished man he was in the whos who of two continents in the last few years he had grown with some rapidity into a writer recognised and welcomed by the more cultivated sections of the american public and even known to a select circle of british readers to his american discoverers he had first appeared as an essayist a serious essayist who wrote about aesthetics and oriental thought and national character and poets and painting he had come through america some years ago as one of those kahn scholars those promising writers and intelligent men endowed by auguste kahn of paris who go about the world nowadays in comfort and consideration as the travelling guests of that original philanthropistto acquire the international spirit previously he had been a critic of art and literature and a writer of thoughtful third leaders in the london times he had begun with a pembroke fellowship and a prize poem he had returned from his world tour to his reflective yet original corner of the times and to the production of books about national relationships and social psychology that had brought him rapidly into prominence  his was a naturally irritable mind which gave him point and passion and moreover he had a certain obstinate originality and a generous disposition so that he was always lively sometimes spacious and never vile he loved to write and talk he talked about everything he had ideas about everything he could no more help having ideas about everything than a dog can resist smelling at your heels he sniffed at the heels of reality lots of people found him interesting and stimulating a few found him seriously exasperating he had ideas in the utmost profusion about races and empires and social order and political institutions and gardens and automobiles and the future of india and china and aesthetics and america and the education of mankind in general and all that sort of thing  mr direck had read a very great deal of all this expressed opiniativeness of mr britling he found it entertaining and stimulating stuff and it was with genuine enthusiasm that he had come over to encounter the man himself on his way across the atlantic and during the intervening days he had rehearsed this meeting in varying keys but always on the supposition that mr britling was a large quiet thoughtful sort of man a man who would as it were sit in attentive rows like a public meeting and listen so mr direck had prepared quite a number of pleasant and attractive openings and now he felt was the moment for some one of these various simple memorable utterances but in none of these forecasts had he reckoned with either the spontaneous activities of mr britling or with the stationmaster of matchings easy oblivious of any conversational necessities between mr direck and mr britling this official now took charge of mr direcks gripsack and falling into line with the two gentlemen as they walked towards the exit gate resumed what was evidently an interrupted discourse upon sweet peas originally addressed to mr britling  he was a small elderly man with a determinedlooking face and a sea voice and it was clear he overestimated the distance of his hearers  mr darling whats head gardener up at claverings e cant get sweet peas like that try ow e will tried everything e as sand ballast es tried seeds same as me e came along ere only the other day e did and e says to me e says darned f i can see why a stationmaster should beat a professional gardener at is own game e says but you do and in your orf time too sos to speak e says ive tried sile e says  your first visit to england asked mr britling of his guest  absolutely said mr direck  i says to im theres one thing you avent tried i says the stationmaster continued raising his voice by a herculean feat still higher  ive got a little car outside here said mr britling im a couple of miles from the station  i says to im i says ave you tried the vibritation of the trains i says thats what you avent tried mr darling thats what you cant try i says but you rest assured that thats the secret of my sweet peas i says nothing less and nothing more than the vibritation of the trains  mr direcks mind was a little confused by the double nature of the conversation and by the fact that mr britling spoke of a car when he meant an automobile he handed his ticket mechanically to the stationmaster who continued to repeat and endorse his anecdote at the top of his voice as mr britling disposed himself and his guest in the automobile  you know you avent urt that mudguard sir not the slightest bit that matters shouted the stationmaster ive been a looking at iter its my fence thats suffered most and thats only strained the post a lil bit shall i put your bag in behind sir  mr direck assented and then after a momentary hesitation rewarded the stationmasters services  ready asked mr britling  thats all right sir the stationmaster reverberated  with a rather wide curve mr britling steered his way out of the station into the highroad   section 4  and now it seemed was the time for mr direck to make his meditated speeches but an unexpected complication was to defeat this intention mr direck perceived almost at once that mr britling was probably driving an automobile for the first or second or at the extremest the third time in his life  the thing became evident when he struggled to get into the high gearan attempt that stopped the engine and it was even more startlingly so when mr britling narrowly missed a collision with a bakers cart at a corner i pressed the accelerator he explained afterwards instead of the brake one does at first i missed him by less than a foot the estimate was a generous one and after that mr direck became too anxious not to distract his hosts thoughts to persist with his conversational openings an attentive silence came upon both gentlemen that was broken presently by a sudden outcry from mr britling and a great noise of tormented gears damn cried mr britling and how the devil  mr direck perceived that his host was trying to turn the car into a very beautiful gateway with gatehouses on either side then it was manifest that mr britling had abandoned this idea and then they came to a stop a dozen yards or so along the main road missed it said mr britling and took his hands off the steering wheel and blew stormily and then whistled some bars of a fretful air and became still  do we go through these ancient gates asked mr direck  mr britling looked over his right shoulder and considered problems of curvature and distance i think he said i will go round outside the park it will take us a little longer but it will be simpler than backing and manoeuvring here now these electric starters are remarkably convenient things otherwise now i should have to get down and wind up the engine  after that came a corner the rounding of which seemed to present few difficulties until suddenly mr britling cried out eh eh eh oh damn  then the two gentlemen were sitting side by side in a rather sloping car that had ascended the bank and buried its nose in a hedge of dogrose and honeysuckle from which two missel thrushes a blackbird and a number of sparrows had made a hurried escape   section 5  perhaps said mr britling without assurance and after a little peaceful pause i can reverse out of this  he seemed to feel some explanation was due to mr direck you see at firstits perfectly simpleone steers round a corner and then one doesnt put the wheels straight again and so one keeps on going roundmore than one meant to its the bicycle habit the bicycle rights itself one expects a car to do the same thing it was my fault the book explains all this question clearly but just at the moment i forgot  he reflected and experimented in a way that made the engine scold and fuss  you see she wont budge for the reverse shesembedded do you mind getting out and turning the wheel back then if i reverse perhaps well get a move on  mr direck descended and there were considerable efforts  if youd just grip the spokes yes so one two three no well lets just sit here until somebody comes along to help us oh somebody will come all right wont you get up again  and after a reflective moment mr direck resumed his seat beside mr britling   section 6  the two gentlemen smiled at each other to dispel any suspicion of discontent  my driving leaves something to be desired said mr britling with an air of frank impartiality but i have only just got this car for myselfafter some years of hired carsthe sort of lazy arrangement where people supply car driver petrol tyres insurance and everything at so much a month it bored me abominably i cant imagine now how i stood it for so long they sent me down a succession of compact scornful boys who used to go fast when i wanted to go slow and slow when i wanted to go fast and who used to take every corner on the wrong side at top speed and charge dogs and hens for the sport of it and all sorts of things like that they would not even let me choose my roads i should have got myself a car long ago and driven it if it wasnt for that infernal business with a handle one had to do when the engine stopped but here you see is a reasonably cheap car with an electric starteramerican i need scarcely say and here i amgoing at my own pace  mr direck glanced for a moment at the pretty disorder of the hedge in which they were embedded and smiled and admitted that it was certainly much more agreeable  before he had finished saying as much mr britling was talking again  he had a quick and rather jerky way of speaking he seemed to fire out a thought directly it came into his mind and he seemed to have a loaded magazine of thoughts in his head he spoke almost exactly twice as fast as mr direck clipping his words much more using much compacter sentences and generally cutting his corners and this put mr direck off his game  that rapid attack while the transatlantic interlocutor is deploying is indeed a not infrequent defect of conversations between englishmen and americans it is a source of many misunderstandings the two conceptions of conversation differ fundamentally the english are much less disposed to listen than the american they have not quite the same sense of conversational give and take and at first they are apt to reduce their visitors to the rôle of auditors wondering when their turn will begin their turn never does begin mr direck sat deeply in his slanting seat with a half face to his celebrated host and said yep and sure and that is so in the dry grave tones that he believed an englishman would naturally expect him to use realising this only very gradually  mr britling from his praise of the enterprise that had at last brought a car he could drive within his reach went on to that favourite topic of all intelligent englishmen the adverse criticism of things british he pointed out that the central position of the brake and gear levers in his automobile made it extremely easy for the american manufacturer to turn it out either as a lefthanded or a righthanded car and so adapt it either to the continental or to the british rule of the road no english cars were so adaptable we british suffered much from our insular rule of the road just as we suffered much from our insular weights and measures but we took a perverse pride in such disadvantages the irruption of american cars into england was a recent phenomenon it was another triumph for the tremendous organising ability of the american mind they were doing with the automobile what they had done with clocks and watches and rifles they had standardised and machined wholesale while the british were still making the things one by one it was an extraordinary thing that england which was the originator of the industrial system and the original developer of the division of labour should have so fallen away from systematic manufacturing he believed this was largely due to the influence of oxford and the established church  at this point mr direck was moved by an anecdote it will help to illustrate what you are saying mr britling about systematic organisation if i tell you a little incident that happened to a friend of mine in toledo where they are setting up a big plant with a view to capturing the entire american and european market in the class of the thousanddollar car  theres no end of such little incidents said mr britling cutting in without apparent effort you see we get it on both sides our manufacturer class was of course originally an insurgent class it was a class of distended craftsmen it had the craftsmans natural enterprise and natural radicalism as soon as it prospered and sent its boys to oxford it was lost our manufacturing class was assimilated in no time to the conservative classes whose education has always had a mandarin qualityvery very little of it and very cold and choice in america you have so far had no real conservative class at all fortunate continent you cast out your tories and you were left with nothing but whigs and radicals but our peculiar bad luck has been to get a sort of revolutionary who is a tory mandarin too ruskin and morris for example were as reactionary and antiscientific as the dukes and the bishops machine haters science haters rule of thumbites to the bone so are our current socialists theyve filled this country with the idea that the ideal automobile ought to be made entirely by the hand labour of traditional craftsmen quite individually out of beaten copper wrought iron and seasoned oak all this electricstarter business and this electric lighting outfit i have here is perfectly hateful to the english mind it isnt that we are simply backward in these things we are antagonistic the british mind has never really tolerated electricity at least not that sort of electricity that runs through wires too slippery and glib for it associates it with italians and fluency generally with volta galvani marconi and so on the proper british electricity is that highgrade useless longsparking stuff you get by turning round a glass machine stuff we used to call frictional electricity keep it in leyden jars at claverings here they still refuse to have electric bells there was a row when the solomonsons who were tenants here for a time tried to put them in  mr direck had followed this cascade of remarks with a patient smile and a slowly nodding head what you say he said forms a very marked contrast indeed with the sort of thing that goes on in america this friend of mine i was speaking of the one who is connected with an automobile factory in toledo  of course mr britling burst out again even conservatism isnt an ultimate thing after all we and your enterprising friend at toledo are very much the same blood the conservatism i mean isnt racial and our earlier energy shows it isnt in the air or in the soil england has become unenterprising and sluggish because england has been so prosperous and comfortable  exactly said mr direck my friend of whom i was telling you was a man named robinson which indicates pretty clearly that he was of genuine english stock and if i may say so quite of your build and complexion racially i should say he was wellvery much what you are   section 7  this rally of mr direcks mind was suddenly interrupted  mr britling stood up and putting both hands to the sides of his mouth shouted yiah ayeya thea at unseen hearers  after shouting again several times it became manifest that he had attracted the attention of two willing but deliberate labouring men they emerged slowly first as attentive heads from the landscape with their assistance the car was restored to the road again mr direck assisted manfully and noted the respect that was given to mr britling and the shillings that fell to the men with an intelligent detachment they touched their hats they called mr britling sir they examined the car distantly but kindly aint urt e not a bit e aint not really said one encouragingly and indeed except for a slight crumpling of the mudguard and the detachment of the wire of one of the headlights the automobile was uninjured mr britling resumed his seat mr direck gravely and in silence got up beside him they started with the usual convulsion as though something had pricked the vehicle unexpectedly and shamefully behind and from this point mr britling driving with meticulous care got home without further mishap excepting only that he scraped off some of the metal edge of his footboard against the gatepost of his very agreeable garden  his family welcomed his safe return visitor and all with undisguised relief and admiration a small boy appeared at the corner of the house and then disappeared hastily again daddys got back all right at last they heard him shouting to unseen hearers   section 8  mr direck though he was a little incommoded by the suppression of his story about robinsonfor when he had begun a thing he liked to finish itfound mr britlings household at once thoroughly british quite unamerican and a little difficult to follow it had a quality that at first he could not define at all compared with anything he had ever seen in his life before it struck him as beinghe found the word at lastsketchy for instance he was introduced to nobody except his hostess and she was indicated to him by a mere wave of mr britlings hand thats edith he said and returned at once to his car to put it away mrs britling was a tall freckled woman with pretty bright brown hair and preoccupied brown eyes she welcomed him with a handshake and then a wonderful english parlourmaidshe at least was according to expectationstook his gripsack and guided him to his room lunch sir she said is outside and closed the door and left him to that and a towelcovered can of hot water  it was a squarelooking old redbrick house he had come to very handsome in a simple georgian fashion with a broad lawn before it and great blue cedar trees and a drive that came frankly up to the front door and then went off with mr britling and the car round to unknown regions at the back the centre of the house was a big airy hall oakpanelled warmed in winter only by one large fireplace and abounding in doors which he knew opened into the square separate rooms that england favours bookshelves and stuffed birds comforted the landing outside his bedroom he descended to find the hall occupied by a small bright bristling boy in white flannel shirt and knickerbockers and bare legs and feet he stood before the vacant open fireplace in an attitude that mr direck knew instantly was also mr britlings lunch is in the garden the britling scion proclaimed and ive got to fetch you and i say is it true are you american  why surely said mr direck  well i know some american said the boy i learnt it  tell me some said mr direck smiling still more amiably  oh wellgod darn you ouch geewhizz soak him maud its up to you duke  now where did you learn all that asked mr direck recovering  out of the sunday supplement said the youthful britling  why then you know all about buster brown said mr direck hes fineeh  the britling child hated buster brown he regarded buster brown as a totally unnecessary infant he detested the way he wore his hair and the peculiar cut of his knickerbockers andhim he thought buster brown the one drop of paraffin in the otherwise delicious feast of the sunday supplement but he was a diplomatic child  i think i like happy hooligan better he said and dat ole maud  he reflected with joyful eyes buster clean forgotten every week he said she kicks some one  it came to mr direck as a very pleasant discovery that a british infant could find a common ground with the small people at home in these characteristically american jests he had never dreamt that the fine wine of maud and buster could travel  mauds a treat said the youthful britling relapsing into his native tongue  mr britling appeared coming to meet them he was now in a grey flannel suithe must have jumped into itand altogether very much tidier   section 9  the long narrow table under the big sycamores between the house and the adapted barn that mr direck learnt was used for dancing and all that sort of thing was covered with a blue linen diaper cloth and that too surprised him this was his first meal in a private household in england and for obscure reasons he had expected something very stiff and formal with spotless napery he had also expected a very stiff and capable service by implacable parlourmaids and the whole thing indeed highly genteel but two cheerful women servants appeared from what was presumably the kitchen direction wheeling a curious wicker erection which his small guide informed him was called aunt clattermanifestly deservedlyand which bore on its shelves the substance of the meal and while the maids at this migratory sideboard carved and opened bottles and so forth the small boy and a slightly larger brother assisted a little by two young men of no very defined position and relationship served the company mrs britling sat at the head of the table and conversed with mr direck by means of hostess questions and imperfectly accepted answers while she kept a watchful eye on the proceedings  the composition of the company was a matter for some perplexity to mr direck mr and mrs britling were at either end of the table that was plain enough it was also fairly plain that the two barefooted boys were little britlings but beyond this was a cloud of uncertainty there was a youth of perhaps seventeen much darker than britling but with nose and freckles rather like his who might be an early son or a stepson he was shockheaded and with that look about his arms and legs that suggests overnight growth and there was an unmistakable young german very pink with closecropped fair hair glasses and a panama hat who was probably the tutor of the younger boys mr direck also was wearing his hat his mind had been filled with an exaggerated idea of the treacheries of the english climate before he left new york every one else was hatless finally before one reached the limits of the explicable there was a pleasant young man with a lot of dark hair and very fine dark blue eyes whom everybody called teddy for him mr direck hazarded secretary  but in addition to these normal and understandable presences there was an entirely mysterious pretty young woman in blue linen who sat and smiled next to mr britling and there was a rather kindredlooking girl with darker hair on the right of mr direck who impressed him at the very outset as being still prettier andhe didnt quite place her at firstsomehow familiar to him there was a large irrelevant middleaged lady in black with a gold chain and a large nose between teddy and the tutor there was a tall middleaged man with an intelligent face who might be a casual guest there was an indian young gentleman faultlessly dressed up to his brown soft linen collar and cuffs and thereafter an uncontrolled outbreak of fine bronze modelling and abundant fuzzy hair and there was a very erect and attentive baby of a year or less sitting up in a perambulator and gesticulating cheerfully to everybody this baby it was that most troubled the orderly mind of mr direck the research for its paternity made his conversation with mrs britling almost as disconnected and absentminded as her conversation with him it almost certainly wasnt mrs britlings the girl next to him or the girl next to mr britling or the lady in black might any of them be married but if so where was the spouse it seemed improbable that they would wheel out a foundling to lunch  realising at last that the problem of relationship must be left to solve itself if he did not want to dissipate and consume his mind entirely mr direck turned to his hostess who was enjoying a brief lull in her administrative duties and told her what a memorable thing the meeting of mr britling in his own home would be in his life and how very highly america was coming to esteem mr britling and his essays he found that with a slight change of person one of his premeditated openings was entirely serviceable here and he went on to observe that it was novel and entertaining to find mr britling driving his own automobile and to note that it was an automobile of american manufacture in america they had standardised and systematised the making of such things as automobiles to an extent that would he thought be almost startling to europeans it was certainly startling to the european manufacturers in illustration of that he might tell a little story of a friend of his called robinsona man who curiously enough in general build and appearance was very reminiscent indeed of mr britling he had been telling mr britling as much on his way here from the station his friend was concerned with several others in one of the biggest attacks that had ever been made upon what one might describe in general terms as the thousanddollar light automobile market what they said practically was this this market is a jigsaw puzzle waiting to be put together and made one we are going to do it but that was easier to figure out than to do at the very outset of this attack he and his associates found themselves up against an unexpected and very difficult proposition  at first mrs britling had listened to mr direck with an almost undivided attention but as he had developed his opening the feast upon the blue linen table had passed on to a fresh phase that demanded more and more of her directive intelligence the two little boys appeared suddenly at her elbows shall we take the plates and get the strawberries mummy they asked simultaneously then one of the neat maids in the background had to be called up and instructed in undertones and mr direck saw that for the present robinsons illuminating experience was not for her ears a little baffled but quite understanding how things were he turned to his neighbour on his left  the girl really had an extraordinarily pretty smile and there was something in her soft bright brown eyelike the movement of some quick little bird andshe was like somebody he knew indeed she was she was quite ready to be spoken to  i was telling mrs britling said mr direck what a very great privilege i esteem it to meet mr britling in this highly familiar way  youve not met him before  i missed him by twentyfour hours when he came through boston on the last occasion just twentyfour hours it was a matter of very great regret to me  i wish id been paid to travel round the world  you must write things like mr britling and then mr kahn will send you  dont you think if i promised well  youd have to write some promissory notes i thinkjust to convince him it was all right  the young lady reflected on mr britlings good fortune  he saw india he saw japan he had weeks in egypt and he went right across america  mr direck had already begun on the liner to adapt himself to the hopping inconsecutiveness of english conversation he made now what he felt was quite a good hop and he dropped his voice to a confidential undertone it was probably adam in his first conversation with eve who discovered the pleasantness of dropping into a confidential undertone beside a pretty ear with a pretty wave of hair above it  it was in india i presume murmured mr direck that mr britling made the acquaintance of the coloured gentleman  coloured gentleman she gave a swift glance down the table as though she expected to see something purple with yellow spots oh that is one of mr lawrence carmines young men she explained even more confidentially and with an air of discussing the silver bowl of roses before him hes a great authority on indian literature he belongs to a society for making things pleasant for indian students in london and he has them down  and mr lawrence carmine he pursued  even more intimately and confidentially she indicated mr carmine as it seemed by a motion of her eyelash  mr direck prepared to be even more sottovoce and to plumb a much profounder mystery his eye rested on the perambulator he leant a little nearer to the ear but the strawberries interrupted him  strawberries said the young lady and directed his regard to his left shoulder by a little movement of her head  he found one of the boys with a highpiled plate ready to serve him  and then mrs britling resumed her conversation with him she was so ignorant she said of things american that she did not even know if they had strawberries there at any rate here they were at the crest of the season and in a very good year and in the rose season too it was one of the dearest vanities of english people to think their apples and their roses and their strawberries the best in the world  and their complexions said mr direck over the pyramid of fruit quite manifestly intending a compliment so that was all right but the girl on the left of him was speaking across the table to the german tutor and did not hear what he had said so that even if it wasnt very neat it didnt matter  then he remembered that she was like that old daguerreotype of a cousin of his grandmothers that he had fallen in love with when he was a boy it was her smile of course of course and hed sort of adored that portrait he felt a curious disposition to tell her as much  what makes this visit even more interesting if possible to me he said to mrs britling than it would otherwise be is that this essex country is the country in which my maternal grandmother was raised and also long way back my mothers fathers people my mothers fathers people were very early new england people indeed well no if i said mayflower it wouldnt be true but it would approximate they were essex hinkinsons thats what they were i must be a good third of me at least essex my grandmother was an essex corner i must confess ive had some thought  corner said the young lady at his elbow sharply  i was telling mrs britling i had some thought  but about those essex relatives of yours  well of finding if they were still about in these parts say i havent dropped a brick have i  he looked from one face to another  shes a corner said mrs britling  well said mr direck and hesitated for a moment it was so delightful that one couldnt go on being just discreet the atmosphere was free and friendly his intonation disarmed offence and he gave the young lady the full benefit of a quite expressive eye im very pleased to meet you cousin corner how are the old folks at home   section 10  the bright interest of this consulship helped mr direck more than anything to get the better of his robinsonanecdote crave and when presently he found his dialogue with mr britling resumed he turned at once to this remarkable discovery of his long lost and indeed hitherto unsuspected relative its an american sort of thing to do i suppose he said apologetically but i almost thought of going on on monday to market saffron which was the locality of the hinkinsons and just looking about at the tombstones in the churchyard for a day or so  very probably said mr britling youd find something about them in the parish registers lots of our registers go back three hundred years or more ill drive you over in my lil old car  oh i wouldnt put you to that trouble said mr direck hastily  its no trouble i like the driving what i have had of it and while were at it well come back by harborough high oak and look up the corner pedigree theyre all over that district still and the roads not really difficult its only a bit up and down and roundabout  i couldnt think mr britling of putting you to that much trouble  its no trouble i want a day off and im dying to take gladys  gladys said mr direck with sudden hope  thats my name for the lil car im dying to take her for something like a decent run ive only had her out four times altogether and ive not got her up yet to forty miles which im told she ought to do easily well consider that settled  for the moment mr direck couldnt think of any further excuse but it was very clear in his mind that something must happen he wished he knew of somebody who could send a recall telegram from london to prevent him committing himself to the casual destinies of mr britlings car again and then another interest became uppermost in his mind  youd hardly believe me he said if i told you that that miss corner of yours has a quite extraordinary resemblance to a miniature ive got away there in america of a cousin of my maternal grandmothers she seems a very pleasant young lady  but mr britling supplied no further information about miss corner  it must be very interesting he said to come over here and pick up these american families of yours on the monuments and tombstones you know of course that district south of evesham where every other church monument bears the stars and stripes the arms of departed washingtons i doubt though if youll still find the name about there nor will you find many hinkinsons in market saffron but lots of this country here has five or six hundredyearold families still flourishing thats why essex is so much more genuinely old england than surrey say or kent round here youll find corners and fairlies and then you get capels and then away down towards dunmow and braintree maynards and byngs and there are oaks and hornbeams in the park about claverings that have echoed to the howling of wolves and the clank of men in armour all the old farms here are moatedbecause of the wolves claverings itself is tudor and rather fine too and the cottages still wear thatch  he reflected now if you went south of london instead of northward its all different youre in a different period a different society youre in london suburbs right down to the sea youll find no genuine estates left not of our deeprooted familiar sort youll find millionaires and that sort of people sitting in the old places surrey is full of rich stockbrokers companypromoters bookies judges newspaper proprietors sort of people who fence the paths across their parks they do something to the old placesi dont know what they dobut instantly the countryside becomes a villadom and little subestates and redbrick villas and art cottages spring up and a kind of new hard neatness and pneumatic tyre and automobile spirit advertisements great glaring boards by the roadside and all the poor people are inspected and rushed about until they forget who their grandfathers were they become villa parasites and oddjob men and grow basely rich and buy gramophones this essex and yonder surrey are as different as russia and germany but for one american who comes to look at essex twenty go to godalming and guildford and dorking and lewes and canterbury those surrey people are not properly english at all they are strenuous you have to get on or get out they drill their gardeners lecture very fast on agricultural efficiency and have miniature rifle ranges in every village its a county of new noticeboards and barbedwire fences theres always a policeman round the corner they dress for dinner they dress for everything if a man gets up in the night to look for a burglar he puts on the correct costumeor doesnt go theyve got a special scientific system for urging on their tramps and they lock up their churches on a weekday half their soil is hard chalk or a rationalistic sand only suitable for bunkers and villa foundations and they play golf in a large expensive thorough way because its the thing to do now here in essex were as lax as the eighteenth century we hunt in any old clothes our soil is a rich succulent clay it becomes semifluid in winterwhen we go about in waders shooting duck all our fingerposts have been twisted round by facetious men years ago and we pool our breeds of hens and pigs our roses and oaks are wonderful that alone shows that this is the real england if i wanted to play golfwhich i dont being a decent essex mani should have to motor ten miles into hertfordshire and for rheumatics and longevity surrey cant touch us i want you to be clear on these points because they really will affect your impressions of this place this country is a part of the real englandengland outside london and outside manufactures its one with wessex and mercia or old yorkshireor for the matter of that with meath or lothian and its the essential england still   section 11  it detracted a little from mr direcks appreciation of this flow of information that it was taking them away from the rest of the company he wanted to see more of his newfound cousin and what the baby and the bengali gentlemanwhom manifestly one mustnt call colouredand the largenosed lady and all the other inexplicables would get up to instead of which mr britling was leading him off alone with an air of showing him round the premises and talking too rapidly and variously for a question to be got in edgeways much less any broaching of the matter that mr direck had come over to settle  there was quite a lot of rose garden it made the air delicious and it was full of great tumbling bushes of roses and of neglected standards and it had a long pergola of creepers and trailers and a great arbour and underneath over the beds everywhere contrary to all the rules the blossom of a multitude of pansies and stock and little trailing plants swarmed and crowded and scrimmaged and drilled and fought great massed attacks and then mr britling talked their way round a redwalled vegetable garden with an abundance of fruit trees and through a door into a terraced square that had once been a farmyard outside the converted barn the barn doors had been replaced by a doorpierced window of glass and in the middle of the square space a deep tank had been made full of rainwater in which mr britling remarked casually that everybody bathed when the weather was hot thyme and rosemary and suchlike sweetscented things grew on the terrace about the tank and ten trimmed little trees of arbor vitae stood sentinel mr direck was tantalisingly aware that beyond some lilac bushes were his newfound cousin and the kindred young woman in blue playing tennis with the indian and another young man while whenever it was necessary the largenosed lady crossed the stage and brooded soothingly over the perambulator and mr britling choosing a seat from which mr direck just couldnt look comfortably through the green branches at the flying glimpses of pink and blue and white and brown continued to talk about england and america in relation to each other and everything else under the sun  presently through a distant gate the two small boys were momentarily visible wheeling small but serviceable bicycles followed after a little interval by the german tutor then an enormous grey cat came slowly across the garden court and sat down to listen respectfully to mr britling the afternoon sky was an intense blue with little puffballs of cloud lined out across it  occasionally from chance remarks of mr britlings mr direck was led to infer that his first impressions as an american visitor were being related to his host but as a matter of fact he was permitted to relate nothing mr britling did all the talking he sat beside his guest and spirted and played ideas and reflections like a happy fountain in the sunshine  mr direck sat comfortably and smoked with quiet appreciation the one afterlunch cigar he allowed himself at any rate if he himself felt rather wordbound the fountain was nimble and entertaining he listened in a general sort of way to the talk it was quite impossible to follow it thoughtfully throughout all its chinks and turnings while his eyes wandered about the garden and went ever and again to the flitting tennisplayers beyond the green it was all very gay and comfortable and complete it was various and delightful without being in the least opulent that was one of the little secrets america had to learn it didnt look as though it had been made or bought or cost anything it looked as though it had happened rather luckily  mr britlings talk became like a wide stream flowing through mr direcks mind bearing along momentary impressions and observations drifting memories of all the crowded english sights and sounds of the last five days filmy imaginations about ancestral names and pretty cousins scraps of those prepared conversational openings on mr britlings standing in america the explanation about the lecture club the still incompletely forgotten purport of the robinson anecdote  nobody planned the british estate system nobody planned the british aristocratic system nobody planned the confounded constitution it came about it was like layer after layer wrapping round an agate but you see it came about so happily in a way it so suited the climate and the temperament of our people and our island it was on the whole so cosy that our people settled down into it you cant help settling down into it they had already settled down by the days of queen anne and heaven knows if we shall ever really get away again were like that little shell the lingula that is found in the oldest rocks and lives today it fitted its easy conditions and it has never modified since why should it it excretes all its disturbing forces our younger sons go away and found colonial empires our surplus cottage children emigrate to australia and canada or migrate into the towns it doesnt alter this   section 12  mr direcks eye had come to rest upon the barn and its expression changed slowly from lazy appreciation to a brightening intelligence suddenly he resolved to say something he resolved to say it so firmly that he determined to say it even if mr britling went on talking all the time  i suppose mr britling he said this barn here dates from the days of queen anne  the walls of the yard here are probably earlier probably monastic that grey patch in the corner for example the barn itself is georgian  and here it is still and this farmyard here it is still  mr britling was for flying off again but mr direck would not listen he held on like a man who keeps his grip on a lasso  theres one thing i would like to remark about your barn mr britling and i might while i am at it say the same thing about your farmyard  mr britling was held whats that he asked  well said mr direck the point that strikes me most about all this is that that barn isnt a barn any longer and that this farmyard isnt a farmyard there isnt any wheat or chaff or anything of that sort in the barn and there never will be again theres just a pianola and a dancing floor and if a cow came into this farmyard everybody in the place would be shooing it out again theyd regard it as a most unnatural object  he had a pleasant sense of talking at last he kept right on he was moved to a sweeping generalisation  you were so good as to ask me mr britling a little while ago what my first impression of england was well mr britling my first impression of england that seems to me to matter in the least is this that it looks and feels more like the traditional old england than any one could possibly have believed and that in reality it is less like the traditional old england than any one would ever possibly have imagined  he was carried on even further he made a tremendous literary epigram i thought he said when i looked out of the train this morning that i had come to the england of washington irving i find it is not even the england of mrs humphry ward     chapter the second  mr britling continues his exposition   section 1  mr direck found little reason to revise his dictum in the subsequent experiences of the afternoon indeed the afternoon and the next day were steadily consistent in confirming what a very good dictum it had been the scenery was the traditional scenery of england and all the people seemed quicker more irresponsible more chaotic than any one could have anticipated and entirely inexplicable by any recognised code of english relationships  you think that john bull is dead and a strange generation is wearing his clothes said mr britling i think youll find very soon its the old john bull perhaps not mrs humphry wards john bull or mrs henry woods john bull but true essentially to shakespeare fielding dickens meredith  i suppose he added there are changes theres a new generation grown up  he looked at his barn and the swimming pool its a good point of yours about the barn he said what you say reminds me of that very jolly thing of kiplings about the old millwheel that began by grinding corn and ended by driving dynamos  only i admit that barn doesnt exactly drive a dynamo  to be frank its just a pleasure barn  the country can afford it   section 2  he left it at that for the time but throughout the afternoon mr direck had the gratification of seeing his thought floating round and round in the backwaters of mr britlings mental current if it didnt itself get into the stream again its reflection at any rate appeared and reappeared he was taken about with great assiduity throughout the afternoon and he got no more than occasional glimpses of the rest of the dower house circle until six oclock in the evening  meanwhile the fountains of mr britlings active and encyclopædic mind played steadily  he was inordinately proud of england and he abused her incessantly he wanted to state england to mr direck as the amiable summation of a grotesque assembly of faults that was the view into which the comforts and prosperities of his middle age had brought him from a radicalism that had in its earlier stages been angry and bitter and for mr britling england was here essex was the county he knew he took mr direck out from his walled garden by a little door into a trim paddock with two white goals we play hockey here on sundays he said in a way that gave mr direck no hint of the practically compulsory participation of every visitor to matchings easy in this violent and dangerous exercise and thence they passed by a rich deep lane and into a high road that ran along the edge of the deer park of claverings we will call in on claverings later said mr britling lady homartyn has some people there for the weekend and you ought to see the sort of thing it is and the sort of people they are she wanted us to lunch there tomorrow but i didnt accept that because of our afternoon hockey  mr direck received this reason uncritically  the village reminded mr direck of abbeys pictures there was an inn with a sign standing out in the road a painted sign of the clavering arms it had a water trough such as mr weller senior ducked the dissenter in and a green painted table outside its inviting door there were also a general shop and a number of very pleasant cottages each marked with the mainstay crest all this was grouped about a green with real geese drilling thereon mr britling conducted his visitor through a lych gate into the churchyard and there they found mossy tumbledown tombstones one with a skull and crossbones upon it that went back to the later seventeenth century in the aisle of the church were three huge hatchments and there was a side chapel devoted to the mainstay family and the barons homartyn with a series of monuments that began with painted tudor effigies and came down to a vast stained glass window of the vilest commercial victorian there were also mediæval brasses of parish priests and a marble crusader and his lady of some extinguished family which had ruled matchings easy before the mainstays came and as the two gentlemen emerged from the church they ran against the perfect vicar mr dimple ample and genial with an embracing laugh and an enveloping voice come to see the old country he said to mr direck so good of you americans to do that so good of you  there was some amiable sparring between the worthy man and mr britling about bringing mr direck to church on sunday morning hes terribly lax said mr dimple to mr direck smiling radiantly terribly lax but then nowadays everybody is so lax and hes very good to my coal club i dont know what we should do without him so i just admonish him and if he doesnt go to church well anyhow he doesnt go anywhere else he may be a poor churchman but anyhow hes not a dissenter  in england you see mr britling remarked after they had parted from the reverend gentleman we have domesticated everything we have even domesticated god  for awhile mr britling showed mr direck english lanes and then came back along narrow white paths across small fields of rising wheat to the village and a little gate that led into the park  well said mr direck what you say about domestication does seem to me to be very true indeed why even those clouds up there look as though they had a shepherd and were grazing  ready for shearing almost said mr britling  indeed said mr direck raising his voice a little ive seen scarcely anything in england that wasnt domesticated unless it was some of your back streets in london  mr britling seemed to reflect for a moment theyre an excrescence he said   section 3  the park had a trim wildness like nature in an old italian picture dappled fallow deer grouped close at hand and looked at the two men fearlessly the path dropped through oak trees and some stunted bracken to a little loitering stream that paused ever and again to play at ponds and waterfalls and bear a fleet of waterlily leaves and then their way curved round in an indolent sweep towards the cedars and shrubberies of the great house the house looked low and extensive to an american eye and its redbrick chimneys rose like infantry in open order along its extended line there was a glimpse of flowerbright garden and terraces to the right as they came round the corner to the front of the house through a path cut in the laurel bushes  mr britling had a moment of exposition as they approached the entrance  i expect we shall find philbert from the home officeor is it the local government boardand sir thomas loot the treasury man there may be some other people of that sort the people we call the governing class wives also and i rather fancy the countess of frensham is coming shes strong on the irish question and lady venetia trumpington who they say is a beautyive never seen her its lady homartyns way to expect me to come innot that im an important item at these weekend social feastsbut she likes to see me on the tableto be nibbled at if any one wants to do solike the olives and the salted almonds and she always asks me to lunch on sunday and i always refusebecause of the hockey so you see i put in an appearance on the saturday afternoon  they had reached the big doorway  it opened into a large cool hall adorned with the heads of hippopotami and rhinoceroses and a stuffed lion and furnished chiefly with a vast table on which hats and sticks and newspapers were littered a manservant with a subdued semiconfidential manner conveyed to mr britling that her ladyship was on the terrace and took the hats and sticks that were handed to him and led the way through the house they emerged upon a broad terrace looking out under great cedar trees upon flower beds and stone urns and tennis lawns and yew hedges that dipped to give a view of distant hills on the terrace were grouped perhaps a dozen people for the most part holding teacups they sat in deck chairs and folding seats about a little table that bore the teathings lady homartyn came forward to welcome the newcomers  mr direck was introduced as a travelling american gratified to see a typical english country house and lady homartyn in an habituated way ran over the points of her tudor specimen mr direck was not accustomed to titled people and was suddenly in doubt whether you called a baroness my lady or your ladyship so he wisely avoided any form of address until he had a lead from mr britling mr britling presently called her lady homartyn she took mr direck and sat him down beside a lady whose name he didnt catch but who had had a lot to do with the british embassy at washington and then she handed mr britling over to the rt honble george philbert who was anxious to discuss certain points in the latest book of essays the conversation of the lady from washington was intelligent but not exacting and mr direck was able to give a certain amount of attention to the general effect of the scene  he was a little disappointed to find that the servants didnt wear livery in american magazine pictures and in american cinematograph films of english stories and in the houses of very rich americans living in england they do so and the mansion house is misleading he had met a compatriot who had recently dined at the mansion house and who had described flunkeys in hairpowder and cloth of goldlike thackerays jeames yellowplush but here the only servants were two slim discreet and attentive young gentlemen in black coats with a gentle piety in their manner instead of pride and he was a little disappointed too by a certain lack of splendour in the company the ladies affected him as being illdressed there was none of the hard snap the there and what do you say to it about them of the welldressed american woman and the men too were not so much tailored as unobtrusively and yet grammatically clothed   section 4  he was still only in the fragmentary stage of conversation when everything was thrown into commotion by the important arrival of lady frensham and there was a general reshuffling of places lady frensham had arrived from london by automobile she appeared in veils and swathings and a tremendous dust cloak with a sort of nephew in her train who had driven the car she was manifestly a constitutionally triumphant woman a certain afternoon lassitude vanished in the swirl of her arrival mr philbert removed wrappings and handed them to the manservant  i lunched with sir edward carson today my dear she told lady homartyn and rolled a belligerent eye at philbert  and is he as obdurate as ever asked sir thomas  obdurate its redmond whos obdurate cried lady frensham what do you say mr britling  a plague on both your parties said mr britling  you cant keep out of things like that said lady frensham with the utmost gusto when the countrys on the very verge of civil war you people who try to pretend there isnt a grave crisis when there is one will be more accountable than any onewhen the civil war does come it wont spare you mark my words  the party became a circle  mr direck found himself the interested auditor of a real english countryhouse weekend political conversation this at any rate was like the england of which mrs humphry wards novels had informed him but yet not exactly like it perhaps that was due to the fact that for the most part these novels dealt with the england of the nineties and things had lost a little in dignity since those days but at any rate here were political figures and titled people and they were talking about the country  was it possible that people of this sort did run the country after all when he had read mrs humphry ward in america he had always accepted this theory of the story quite easily but now that he saw and heard them  but all governments and rulers and ruling classes when you look at them closely are incredible  i dont believe the country is on the verge of civil war said mr britling  facts cried lady frensham and seemed to wipe away delusions with a rapid gesture of her hands  youre interested in ireland mr dirks asked lady homartyn  we see it first when we come over said mr direck rather neatly and after that he was free to attend to the general discussion  lady frensham it was manifest was one of that energetic body of aristocratic ladies who were taking up an irreconcilable attitude against home rule in any shape or form at that time they were rapidly turning british politics into a system of bitter personal feuds in which all sense of imperial welfare was lost a wild ambition to emulate the extremest suffragettes seems to have seized upon them they insulted they denounced they refused every invitation lest they should meet that traitor the prime minister they imitated the party hatreds of a fiercer age and even now the moderate and politic philbert found himself treated as an invisible object they were supported by the extremer section of the tory press and the most extraordinary writers were set up to froth like lunatics against the government as traitors as men who insulted the king the morning post and the lighterwitted side of the unionist press generally poured out a torrent of partisan nonsense it is now almost incredible to recall lady frensham bridling over lady homartyns party and for a time leaving mr britling hurried on to tell of the newest developments of the great feud she had a wonderful description of lady londonderry sitting opposite that old rascal the prime minister at a performance of mozarts zauberflöte  if looks could kill cried lady frensham with tremendous gusto  sir edward is quite firm that ulster means to fight they have machinegunsammunition and i am sure the army is with us  where did they get those machineguns and ammunition asked mr britling suddenly  ah thats a secret cried lady frensham  um said mr britling  you see said lady frensham it will be civil war and yet you writing people who have influence do nothing to prevent it  what are we to do lady frensham  tell people how serious it is  you mean tell the irish nationalists to lie down and be walked over they wont be  well see about that cried lady frensham well see about that  she was a large and dignified person with a kind of figurehead nobility of carriage but mr direck was suddenly reminded of a girl cousin of his who had been expelled from college for some particularly elaborate and aimless rioting  may i say something to you lady frensham said mr britling that you have just said to me do you realise that this carsonite campaign is dragging these islands within a measurable distance of civil war  its the fault of your lloyd george and his government its the fault of your socialists and sentimentalists youve made the mischief and you have to deal with it  yes but do you really figure to yourself what a civil war may mean for the empire surely there are other things in the world besides this quarrel between the loyalists of ulster and the liberal government there are other interests in this big empire than party advantages yon think you are going to frighten this home rule government into some ridiculous sort of collapse that will bring in the tories at the next election well suppose you dont manage that suppose instead that you really do contrive to bring about a civil war very few people here or in ireland want iti was over there not a month agobut when men have loaded guns in their hands they sometimes go off and then people see red few people realise what an incurable sore opens when fighting begins suppose part of the army revolts and we get some extraordinary and demoralising fighting over there india watches these things bengal may imitate ireland at that distance rebellion and treason are rebellion and treason whether they are coloured orange or green and then suppose the germans see fit to attack us  lady frensham had a womans elusiveness your redmondites would welcome them with open arms  it isnt the redmondites who invite them now anyhow said mr britling springing his mine the other day one of your loyalists andrews was talking in the morning post of preferring conquest by germany to home rule craig has been at the same game major crawford the man who ran the german mausers last april boasted that he would transfer his allegiance to the german emperor rather than see redmond in power  rhetoric said lady frensham rhetoric  but one of your ulster papers has openly boasted that arrangements have been made for a powerful continental monarch to help an ulster rebellion  which paper snatched lady frensham  mr britling hesitated  mr philbert supplied the name i saw it it was the irish churchman  you two have got your case up very well said lady frensham i didnt know mr britling was a party man  the nationalists have been circulating copies said philbert naturally  they make it look worse than mere newspaper talk and speeches mr britling pressed carson it seems was lunching with the german emperor last autumn a fine fuss youd make if redmond did that all this gunrunning too is german gunrunning  what does it matter if it is said lady frensham allowing a belligerent eye to rest for the first time on philbert you drove us to it one thing we are resolved upon at any cost johnny redmond may rule england if he likes he shant rule ireland  mr britling shrugged his shoulders and his face betrayed despair  my one consolation he said in this storm is a talk i had last month with a young irishwoman in meath she was a young person of twelve and she took a fancy to mei think because i went with her in an alleged dangerous canoe she was forbidden to navigate alone all day the eternal irish question had banged about over her observant head when we were out on the water she suddenly decided to set me right upon a disregarded essential you english she said are just a bit disposed to take all this trouble seriously dont you fret yourself about it half the time were just laffing at you youd best leave us all alone  and then he went off at a tangent from his own anecdote  but look at this miserable spectacle he cried here is a chance of getting something like a reconciliation of the old feud of english and irish and something like a settlement of these ancient distresses and there seems no power no conscience no sanity in any of us sufficient to save it from this cantankerous bitterness this sheer wicked mischief of mutual exasperation just when ireland is getting a gleam of prosperity a murrain on both your parties  i see mr britling youd hand us all over to jim larkin  id hand you all over to sir horace plunkett  that doctrinaire dairyman cried lady frensham with an air of quite conclusive repartee youre hopeless mr britling youre hopeless  and lady homartyn seeing that the phase of mere personal verdicts drew near created a diversion by giving lady frensham a second cup of tea and fluttering like a cooling fan about the heated brows of the disputants she suggested tennis   section 5  mr britling was still flushed and ruffled as he and his guest returned towards the dower house he criticised england himself unmercifully but he hated to think that in any respect she fell short of perfection even her defects he liked to imagine were just a subtler kind of power and wisdom and lady frensham had stuck her voice and her gestures through all these amiable illusions he was like a lover who calls his lady a foolish rogue and is startled to find that facts and strangers do literally agree with him  but it was so difficult to resolve lady frensham and the irish squabble generally into anything better than idiotic mischief that for a time he was unusually silentwrestling with the problem and mr direck got the conversational initiative  to an american mind its a littlestartling said mr direck to hear ladies expressing such vigorous political opinions  i dont mind that said mr britling women over here go into politics and into publichousesi dont see why they shouldnt if such things are good enough for men they are good enough for women we havent your sort of chivalry but its the peculiar malignant silliness of this sort of toryism thats so discreditable its discreditable theres no good in denying it those people you have heard and seen are a not unfair sample of our governing classof a certain section of our governing classas it is today not at all unfair and you see how amazingly they havent got hold of anything there was a time when they could be politic hidden away they have politic instincts even now but it makes me sick to think of this irish business because you know its truewe are drifting towards civil war there  you are of that opinion said mr direck  well isnt it so heres all this ulster gunrunningyou heard how she talked of it isnt it enough to drive the south into open revolt  is there very much do you think in the suggestion that some of this ulster trouble is a german intrigue you and mr philbert were saying things  i dont know said mr britling shortly  i dont know he repeated but it isnt because i dont think our unionists and their opponents arent foolish enough for anything of the sort its only because i dont believe that the germans are so stupid as to do such things why should they  it makes meexpressionless with anger said mr britling after a pause reverting to his main annoyance they wont consider any compromise its sheer love of quarrelling those people there think that nothing can possibly happen they are like children in a nursery playing at rebellion unscathed and heedless until there is death at their feet they will never realise they are playing with loaded guns  for a time he said no more and listened perfunctorily while mr direck tried to indicate the feeling in new england towards the irish question and the many difficult propositions an american politician has to face in that respect and when mr britling took up the thread of speech again it had little or no relation to mr direcks observations  the psychology of all this recent insubordination and violence iscurious exasperating too i dont quite grasp it its the same thing whether you look at the suffrage business or the labour people or at this irish muddle people may be too safe you see we live at the end of a series of secure generations in which none of the great things of life have changed materially weve grown up with no sense of dangerthat is to say with no sense of responsibility none of us none of usfor though i talk my actions belie mereally believe that life can change very fundamentally any more forever all thismr britling waved his arm comprehensivelylooks as though it was bound to go on steadily forever it seems incredible that the system could be smashed it seems incredible that anything we can do will ever smash the system lady homartyn for example is incapable of believing that she wont always be able to have weekend parties at claverings and that the letters and the tea wont come to her bedside in the morning or if her imagination goes to the point of supposing that some day she wont be there to receive the tea it means merely that she supposes somebody else will be her pleasant butler may fear to lose his situation but nothing on earth could make him imagine a time when there will not be a situation for him to lose old asquith thinks that we always have got along and that we always shall get along by being quietly artful and saying wait and see and its just because we are all convinced that we are so safe against a general breakdown that we are able to be so recklessly violent in our special cases why shouldnt women have the vote they argue what does it matter and bang goes a bomb in westminster abbey why shouldnt ulster create an impossible position and off trots some demented carsonite to germany to play at treason on some half word of the german emperors and buy half a million rifles  exactly like children being very very naughty  and said mr britling with a gesture to round off his discourse we do go on we shall go onuntil there is a spark right into the magazine we have lost any belief we ever had that fundamental things happen we are everlasting children in an everlasting nursery  and immediately he broke out again  the truth of the matter is that hardly any one has ever yet mastered the fact that the world is round the world is roundlike an orange the thing is told uslike any old scandalat school for all practical purposes we forget it practically we all live in a world as flat as a pancake where time never ends and nothing changes who really believes in any world outside the circle of the horizon here we are and visibly nothing is changing and so we go on tonothing will ever change it just goes onin space in time if we could realise that round world beyond then indeed we should go circumspectly if the world were like a whispering gallery what whispers might we not hear nowfrom india from africa from germany warnings from the past intimations of the future  we shouldnt heed them   section 6  and indeed at the very moment when mr britling was saying these words in sarajevo in bosnia where the hour was somewhat later men whispered together and one held nervously to a black parcel that had been given him and nodded as they repeated his instructions a black parcel with certain unstable chemicals and a curious arrangement of detonators therein a black parcel destined ultimately to shatter nearly every landmark of mr britlings and lady frenshams cosmogony   section 7  when mr direck and mr britling returned to the dower house the guest was handed over to mrs britling and mr britling vanished to reappear at supper time for the britlings had a supper in the evening instead of dinner when mr britling did reappear every trace of his vexation with the levities of british politics and the british ruling class had vanished altogether and he was no longer thinking of all that might be happening in germany or india  while he was out of the way mr direck extended his acquaintance with the britling household he was taken round the garden and shown the roses by mrs britling and beyond the rose garden in a little arbour they came upon miss corner reading a book she looked very grave and pretty reading a book mr direck came to a pause in front of her and mrs britling stopped beside him the young lady looked up and smiled  the last new novel asked mr direck pleasantly  campanellas city of the sun  my word but isnt that stiff reading  you havent read it said miss corner  its a dry old book anyhow  its no good pretending you have she said and there mr direck felt the conversation had to end  thats a very pleasant young lady to have about he said to mrs britling as they went on towards the barn court  shes all at loose ends said mrs britling and she reads like awhatever does read one drinks like a fish one eats like a wolf  they found the german tutor in a little court playing badminton with the two younger boys he was a plump young man with glasses and compact gestures the game progressed chiefly by misses and the score was counted in german he won thoughtfully and chiefly through the ardour of the younger brother whose enthusiastic returns invariably went out instantly the boys attacked mrs britling with a concerted enthusiasm mummy is it to be dressingup supper  mrs britling considered and it was manifest that mr direck was material to her answer  we wrap ourselves up in curtains and bright things instead of dressing she explained we have a sort of wardrobe of fancy dresses do you mind  mr direck was delighted  and this being settled the two small boys went off with their mother upon some special decorative project they had conceived and mr direck was left for a time to herr heinrich  herr heinrich suggested a stroll in the rose garden and as mr direck had not hitherto been shown the rose garden by herr heinrich he agreed sooner or later everybody it was evident had got to show him that rose garden  and how do you like living in an english household said mr direck getting to business at once its interesting to an american to see this english establishment and it must be still more interesting to a german  i find it very different from pomerania said herr heinrich in some respects it is more agreeable in others less so it is a pleasant life but it is not a serious life  at any time continued herr heinrich some one may say let us do this thing or let us do that thing and then everything is disarranged  people walk into the house without ceremony there is much kindness but no politeness mr britling will go away for three or four days and when he returns and i come forward to greet him and bow he will walk right past me or he will say just like this how do heinrich  are you interested in mr britlings writings mr direck asked  there again i am puzzled his work is known even in germany his articles are reprinted in german and austrian reviews you would expect him to have a certain authority of manner you would expect there to be discussion at the table upon questions of philosophy and aesthetics it is not so when i ask him questions it is often that they are not seriously answered sometimes it is as if he did not like the questions i askt of him yesterday i askt of him did he agree or did he not agree with mr bernard shaw he just saidi wrote it down in my memorandahe said oh mixt pickles what can one understand of thatmixt pickles  the young mans sedulous blue eyes looked out of his pink face through his glasses at mr direck anxious for any light he could offer upon the atmospheric vagueness of this england  he was he explained a student of philology preparing for his doctorate he had not yet done his year of military service he was studying the dialects of east anglia  you go about among the people mr direck inquired  no i do not do that but i ask mr carmine and mrs britling and the boys many questions and sometimes i talk to the gardener  he explained how he would prepare his thesis and how it would be accepted and the nature of his army service and the various stages by which he would subsequently ascend in the orderly professorial life to which he was destined he confessed a certain lack of interest in philology but he said it is what i have to do and so he was going to do it all his life through for his own part he was interested in ideas of universal citizenship in esperanto and ido and universal languages and suchlike attacks upon the barriers between man and man but the authorities at home did not favour cosmopolitan ideas and so he was relinquishing them here it is as if there were no authorities he said with a touch of envy  mr direck induced him to expand that idea  herr heinrich made mr britling his instance if mr britling were a german he would certainly have some sort of title a definite position responsibility here he was not even called herr doktor he said what he liked nobody rewarded him nobody reprimanded him when herr heinrich asked him of his position whether he was above or below mr bernard shaw or mr arnold white or mr garvin or any other publicist he made jokes nobody here seemed to have a title and nobody seemed to have a definite place there was mr lawrence carmine he was a student of oriental questions he had to do with some public institution in london that welcomed indian students he was a geheimrath  eh said mr direck  it iswhat do they call it the essex county council but nobody took any notice of that and when mr philbert who was a minister in the government came to lunch he was just like any one else it was only after he had gone that herr heinrich had learnt by chance that he was a minister and right honourable  in germany everything is definite every man knows his place has his papers is instructed what to do  yet said mr direck with his eyes on the glowing roses the neat arbour the long line of the red wall of the vegetable garden and a distant gleam of cornfield it all looks orderly enough  it is as if it had been put in order ages ago said herr heinrich  and was just going on by habit said mr direck taking up the idea  their comparisons were interrupted by the appearance of teddy the secretary and the indian young gentleman damp and genial as they explained from the boats it seemed that down below somewhere was a pond with a punt and an island and a toy dinghy and while they discussed swimming and boating mr carmine appeared from the direction of the park conversing gravely with the elder son they had been for a walk and a talk together there were proposals for a badminton foursome mr direck emerged from the general interchange with mr lawrence carmine and then strolled through the rose garden to see the sunset from the end mr direck took the opportunity to verify his impression that the elder son was the present mrs britlings stepson and he also contrived by a sudden admiration for a distant row of evening primroses to deflect their path past the arbour in which the evening light must now be getting a little too soft for miss corners book  miss corner was drawn into the sunset party she talked to mr carmine and displayed mr direck thought great originality of mind she said the city of the sun was like the cities the boys sometimes made on the playroom floor she said it was the dearest little city and gave some amusing particulars she described the painted walls that made the tour of the civitas solis a liberal education she asked mr carmine who was an authority on oriental literature why there were no indian nor chinese utopias  now it had never occurred to mr direck to ask why there were no indian nor chinese utopias and even mr carmine seemed surprised to discover this deficiency  the primitive patriarchal village is utopia to india and china said mr carmine when they had a little digested the inquiry or at any rate it is their social ideal they want no utopias  utopias came with cities he said considering the question and the first cities as distinguished from courts and autocratic capitals came with ships india and china belong to an earlier age ships trade disorder strange relationships unofficial literature criticismand then this idea of some novel remaking of society   section 8  then mr direck fell into the hands of hugh the eldest son and anticipating the inevitable said that he liked to walk in the rose garden so they walked in the rose garden  do you read utopias said mr direck cutting any preface in the english manner  oh rather said hugh and became at once friendly and confidential  we all do he explained in england everybody talks of change and nothing ever changes  i found miss corner readingwhat was it the sun peoplesome old classical italian work  campanella said hugh without betraying the slightest interest in miss corner nothing changes in england because the people who want to change things change their minds before they change anything else ive been in london talking for the last halfyear studying art they call it before that i was a science student and i want to be one again dont you think sir theres something about scienceits steadier than anything else in the world  mr direck thought that the moral truths of human nature were steadier than science and they had one of those little discussions of real life that begin about a difference inadequately apprehended and do not so much end as are abandoned hugh struck him as being more speculative and detached than any american college youth of his age that he knewbut that might not be a national difference but only the britling strain he seemed to have read more and more independently and to be doing less and he was rather more restrained and selfpossessed  before mr direck could begin a proper inquiry into the young mans work and outlook he had got the conversation upon america he wanted tremendously to see america the dad says in one of his books that over here we are being and that over there you are beginning it must be tremendously stimulating to think that your country is still being made  mr direck thought that an interesting point of view unless something tumbles down here we never think of altering it the young man remarked and even then we just shore it up  his remarks had the effect of floating off from some busy mill of thought within him hitherto mr direck had been inclined to think this silent observant youth with his hands in his pockets and his shoulders a little humped as probably shy and adolescently ineffective but the head was manifestly quite busy  miss corner he began taking the first thing that came into his head and then he remembered that he had already made the remark he was going to make not five minutes ago  what form of art he asked are you contemplating in your studies at the present time in london  before this question could be dealt with at all adequately the two small boys became active in the garden beating in everybody to dressup before supper the secretary teddy came in a fatherly way to look after mr direck and see to his draperies   section 9  mr direck gave his very best attention to this business of draping himself for he had not the slightest intention of appearing ridiculous in the eyes of miss corner teddy came with an armful of stuff that he thought might do  whatll i come as asked mr direck  we dont wear costumes said teddy we just put on all the brightest things we fancy if its any costume at all its futurist  and surely why shouldnt one asked mr direck greatly struck by this idea why should we always be tied by the fashions and periods of the past  he rejected a rather mephistopheleslike costume of crimson and a scheme for a brigandlike ensemble based upon what was evidently an old bolero of mrs britlings and after some reflection he accepted some black silk tights his legs were not legs to be ashamed of over this he tried various brilliant wrappings from the dower house armoire and chose at last after some hesitation in the direction of a piece of gold and purple brocade a big square of green silk curtain stuff adorned with golden pheasants and other large and dignified ornaments this he wore toga fashion over his light silken undervestteddy had insisted on the abandonment of his shirt if you want to dance at alland fastened with a large green glassjewelled brooch from this his head and neck projected he felt with a tolerable dignity teddy suggested a fillet of green ribbon and this mr direck tried but after prolonged reflection before the glass rejected he was still weighing the effect of this fillet upon the mind of miss corner when teddy left him to make his own modest preparations teddys departure gave him a chance for profile studies by means of an arrangement of the long mirror and the table lookingglass that he had been too shy to attempt in the presence of the secretary the general effect was quite satisfactory  waaal he said with a quaver of laughter now whod have thought it and smiled a consciously american smile at himself before going down  the company was assembling in the panelled hall and made a brilliant show in the light of the acetylene candles against the dark background mr britling in a black velvet cloak and black silk tights was a deeper shade among the shadows the high lights were miss corner and her sister in glittering garments of peacock green and silver that gave a snakelike quality to their lithe bodies they were talking to the german tutor who had become a sort of cotton cossack a spectacled cossack in buff and bright green mrs britling was dignified and beautiful in a purple djibbah and her stepson had become a handsome still figure of black and crimson teddy had contrived something elaborate and effective in the egyptian style with a fishbasket and a cuirass of that thin matting one finds behind washstands the small boys were brigands with immensely baggy breeches and cummerbunds in which they had stuck a selection of paperknives and toy pistols and similar weapons mr carmine and his young man had come provided with real indian costumes the feeling of the company was that mr carmine was a mullah the auntlike lady with the noble nose stood out amidst these levities in a black silk costume with a gold chain she refused it seemed to make herself absurd though she encouraged the others to extravagance by nods and enigmatical smiles nevertheless she had put pink ribbons in her cap a family of father goldenhaired mother and two young daughters sympathetically attired had just arrived and were discarding their outer wrappings with the assistance of host and hostess  it was all just exactly what mr direck had never expected in england and equally unexpected was the supper on a long candlelit table without a cloth no servants were present but on a sideboard stood a cold salmon and cold joints and kalter aufschnitt and kartoffel salat and a variety of other comestibles and many bottles of beer and wine and whisky one helped oneself and anybody else one could and mr direck did his best to be very attentive to mrs britling and miss corner and was greatly assisted by the latter  everybody seemed unusually gay and brighteyed mr direck found something exhilarating and oddly exciting in all this unusual bright costume and in this easy mutual service it made everybody seem franker and simpler even mr britling had revealed a sturdy handsomeness that had not been apparent to mr direck before and young britling left no doubts now about his good looks mr direck forgot his mission and his position and indeed things generally in an irrational satisfaction that his golden pheasants harmonised with the glitter of the warm and smiling girl beside him and he sat down beside heryou sit anywhere said mrs britlingwith far less compunction than in his ordinary costume he would have felt for so direct a confession of preference and there was something in her eyes it was quite indefinable and yet very satisfying that told him that now he escaped from the stern square imperatives of his patriotic tailor in new york she had made a discovery of him  everybody chattered gaily though mr direck would have found it difficult to recall afterwards what it was they chattered about except that somehow he acquired the valuable knowledge that miss corner was called cecily and her sister letty and thenso far old essex custom heldthe masculine section was left for a few minutes for some imaginary drinking and a lighting of cigars and cigarettes after which everybody went through interwoven moonlight and afterglow to the barn mr britling sat down to a pianola in the corner and began the familiar cadences of whistling rufus  you dance said miss cecily corner  ive never been much of a dancing man said mr direck what sort of dance is this  just anything a twostep  mr direck hesitated and regretted a wellspent youth and then hugh came prancing forward with outstretched hands and swept her away  just for an instant mr direck felt that this young man was a trifle superfluous  but it was very amusing dancing  it wasnt any sort of taught formal dancing it was a spontaneous retort to the leaping american music that mr britling footed out you kept time and for the rest you did as your nature prompted if you had a partner you joined hands you fluttered to and from one another you paced down the long floor together you involved yourselves in romantic pursuits and repulsions with other couples there was no objection to your dancing alone teddy for example danced alone in order to develop certain egyptian gestures that were germinating in his brain there was no objection to your joining hands in a cheerful serpent  mr direck hung on to cissie and her partner they danced very well together they seemed to like and understand each other it was natural of course for two young people like that thrown very much together to develop an affection for one another still she was older by three or four years  it seemed unreasonable that the boy anyhow shouldnt be in love with her  it seemed unreasonable that any one shouldnt be in love with her  then mr direck remarked that cissie was watching teddys manoeuvres over her partners shoulder with real affection and admiration  but then most refreshingly she picked up mr direcks gaze and gave him the slightest of smiles she hadnt forgotten him  the music stopped with an effect of shock and all the bobbing whirling figures became walking glories  now thats not difficult is it said miss corner glowing happily  not when you do it said mr direck  i cant imagine an american not dancing a twostep you must do the next with me listen its away down indiana  ah i knew you could  mr direck too understood now that he could and they went off holding hands rather after the fashion of two skaters  my word said mr direck to think id be dancing  but he said no more because he needed his breath  he liked it and he had another attempt with one of the visitor daughters who danced rather more formally and then teddy took the pianola and mr direck was astonished by the spectacle of an eminent british thinker in a whirl of black velvet and extremely active black legs engaged in a kind of apache dance in pursuit of the visitor wife in which mr lawrence carmine suddenly mingled  in germany said herr heinrich we do not dance like this it could not be considered seemly but it is very pleasant  and then there was a waltz and herr heinrich bowed to and took the visitor wife round three times and returned her very punctually and exactly to the point whence he had taken her and the indian young gentleman who must not be called coloured waltzed very well with cecily mr direck tried to take a tolerant european view of this brown and white combination but he secured her as soon as possible from this asiatic entanglement and danced with her again and then he danced with her again  come and look at the moonlight cried mrs britling  and presently mr direck found himself strolling through the rose garden with cecily she had the sweetest moonlight face her white shining robe made her a thing of moonlight altogether if mr direck had not been in love with her before he was now altogether in love mamie nelson whose freakish unkindness had been rankling like a poisoned thorn in his heart all the way from massachusetts suddenly became ancient history  a tremendous desire for eloquence arose in mr direcks soul a desire so tremendous that no conceivable phrase he could imagine satisfied it so he remained tonguetied and cecily was tonguetied too the scent of the roses just tinted the clear sweetness of the air they breathed  mr direcks mood was an immense solemnity like a dark ocean beneath the vast dome of the sky and something quivered in every fibre of his being like moonlit ripples on the sea he felt at the same time a portentous stillness and an immense enterprise  then suddenly the pianola pounding a cake walk burst out into ribald invitation  come back to dance cried cecily like one from whom a spell has just been broken and mr direck snatching at a vanishing scrap of everything he had not said remarked i shall never forget this evening  she did not seem to hear that  they danced together again and then mr direck danced with the visitor lady whose name he had never heard and then he danced with mrs britling and then he danced with letty and then it seemed time for him to look for miss cecily again  and so the cheerful evening passed until they were within a quarter of an hour of sunday morning mrs britling went to exert a restraining influence upon the pianola  oh one dance more cried cissie corner  oh one dance more cried letty  one dance more mr direck supported and then things really had to end  there was a rapid putting out of candles and a stowing away of things by teddy and the sons two chauffeurs appeared from the region of the kitchen and brought mr lawrence carmines car and the visitor familys car to the front door and everybody drifted gaily through the moonlight and the big trees to the front of the house and mr direck saw the perambulator waitingthe mysterious perambulatora little in the dark beyond the front door  the visitor family and mr carmine and his young indian departed come to hockey shouted mr britling to each departing carload and mr carmine receding answered ill bring three  then mr direck in accordance with a habit that had been growing on him throughout the evening looked around for miss cissie corner and failed to find her and then behold she was descending the staircase with the mysterious baby in her arms she held up a warning finger and then glanced at her sleeping burthen she looked like a silvery madonna and mr direck remembered that he was still in doubt about that baby  teddy who was back in his flannels seized upon the perambulator there was much careful baby stowing on the part of cecily she displayed an infinitely maternal solicitude letty was away changing she reappeared jauntily taking leave disregarding the baby absolutely and teddy departed bigamously wheeling the perambulator between the two sisters into the hazes of the moonlight there was much crying of good nights mr direcks curiosities narrowed down to a point of great intensity  of course mr britlings circle must be a very advanced circle   section 10  mr direck found he had taken leave of the rest of the company and drifted into a little parlour with mr britling and certain glasses and siphons and a whisky decanter on a tray  it is a very curious thing said mr direck that in england i find myself more disposed to take stimulants and that i no longer have the need for iced water that one feels at home i ascribe it to a greater humidity in the air one is less dried and one is less braced one is no longer pursued by a thirst but one needs something to buck one up a little thank you that is enough  mr direck took his glass of whisky and soda from mr britlings hand  mr britling seated himself in an armchair by the fireplace and threw one leg carelessly over the arm in his black velvet cloak and cap and his black silk tights he was very like a minor character a court chamberlain for example in some cloak and rapier drama i find this weekend dancing and kicking about wonderfully wholesome he said that and our sunday hockey one starts the new week clear and bright about the mind friday is always my worst working day  mr direck leant against the table wrapped in his golden pheasants and appreciated the point  your young people dance very cheerfully he said  we all dance very cheerfully said mr britling  then this miss corner said mr direck she is the sister i presume is she of that pleasant young lady who is marriedshe is married isnt sheto the young man you call teddy  i should have explained these young people theyre the sort of young people we are producing over here now in quite enormous quantity they are the sort of equivalent of the russian intelligentsia an irresponsible middle class with ideas teddy you know is my secretary hes the son i believe of a kilburn solicitor he was recommended to me by datcher of the times he came down here and lived in lodgings for a time then suddenly appeared the young lady  miss corners sister  exactly the village was a little startled the cottager who had let the rooms came to me privately teddy is rather touchy on the point of his personal independence he considers any demand for explanations as an insult and probably all he had said to the old lady was this is lettycome to share my rooms i put the matter to him very gently oh yes he said rather in the manner of some one who has overlooked a trifle i got married to her in the christmas holidays may i bring her along to see mrs britling we induced him to go into a little cottage i rent the wife was the daughter of a colchester journalist and printer i dont know if you talked to her  ive talked to the sister rather  well theyre both idead theyre highly educated in the sense that they do really think for themselves almost fiercely so does teddy if he thinks he hasnt thought anything he thinks for himself he goes off and thinks it different the sister is a teacher who wants to take the ba degree in london university meanwhile she pays the penalty of her sex  meaning asked mr direck startled  oh that she puts in a great deal too much of her time upon housework and minding her sisters baby  shes a very interesting and charming young lady indeed said mr direck with a sort of western college freedom of mindand something about her that isnt american at all  mr britling was following the train of his own thoughts  my household has some amusing contrasts he said i dont know if you have talked to that german  hes always asking questions and you tell him any old thing and he goes and writes it down in his room upstairs and afterwards asks you another like it in order to perplex himself by the variety of your answers he regards the whole world with a methodical distrust he wants to document it and pin it down he suspects it only too justly of disorderly impulses and a capacity for selfcontradiction he is the most extraordinary contrast to teddy whose confidence in the universe amounts almost to effrontery teddy carries our national laxness to a foolhardy extent he is capable of leaving his watch in the middle of claverings park and expecting to find it a month laterbeing carefully taken care of by a squirrel i supposewhen he happens to want it hes rather like a squirrel himselfwithout the habit of hoarding he is incapable of asking a question about anything he would be quite sure it was all right anyhow he would feel that asking questions betrayed a want of confidencewas a sort of incivility but my german if you noticehis normal expression is one of grave solicitude he is like a conscientious ticketcollector among his impressions and did you notice how beautifully my pianola rolls are all numbered and catalogued he did that he set to work and did it as soon as he got here just as a good cat when you bring it into the house sets to work and catches mice previously the pianola music was chaos you took what god sent you  and he looks like a german said mr britling  he certainly does that said mr direck  he has the fair type of complexion the rather full habit of body the temperamental disposition but in addition that closecropped head it is almost as if it were shaved the plumpness the glassesthose are things that are made and the way he carries himself and the way he thinks his meticulousness when he arrived he was delightful he was wearing a students corps cap and a rucksack he carried a violin he seemed to have come out of a book no one would ever dare to invent so german a german for a book now a young frenchman or a young italian or a young russian coming here might look like a foreigner but he wouldnt have the distinctive national stamp a german has he wouldnt be plainly french or italian or russian other peoples are not made they are neither made nor created but proceedingout of a thousand indefinable causes the germans are a triumph of directive will i had to remark the other day that when my boys talked german they shouted but when one talks german one must shout said herr heinrich it is taught so in the schools and it is they teach them to shout and to throw out their chests just as they teach them to read noticeboards and not think about politics their very ribs are not their own my herr heinrich is comparatively a liberal thinker he asked me the other day but why should i give myself up to philology but then he reflected it is what i have to do  mr britling seemed to have finished and then just as mr direck was planning a way of getting the talk back by way of teddy to miss corner he snuggled more deeply into his chair reflected and broke out again  this contrast between heinrichs carefulness and teddys easygoingness come to look at it is i suppose one of the most fundamental in the world it reaches to everything it mixes up with education statecraft morals will you make or will you take those are the two extreme courses in all such things i suppose the answer of wisdom to that is like all wise answers a compromise i suppose one must accept and then make all one can of it have you talked at all to my eldest son  hes a very interesting young man indeed said mr direck i should venture to say theres a very great deal in him i was most impressed by the few words i had with him  there for example is one of my perplexities said mr britling  mr direck waited for some further light on this sudden transition  ah your troubles in life havent begun yet wait till youre a father that cuts to the bone you have the most delicate thing in the world in hand a young kindred mind you feel responsible for it you know you are responsible for it and you lose touch with it you cant get at it nowadays weve lost the old tradition of fatherhood by divine rightand we havent got a new one ive tried not to be a cramping ruler a director a domestic tyrant to that ladand in effect its meant his going his own way i dont dominate i hoped to advise but you see he loves my respect and good opinion too much when things go well i know of them when the world goes dark for him then he keeps his trouble from me just when i would so eagerly go into it with him theres something the matter now somethingit may be grave i feel he wants to tell me and there it isit seems i am the last person to whom he can humiliate himself by a confession of blundering or weakness something i should just laugh at and say thats in the blood of all of us dear spit of myself lets see whats to be done  he paused and then went on finding in the unfamiliarity and transitoriness of his visitor a freedom he might have failed to find in a close friend  i am frightened at times at all i dont know about in that boys mind i know nothing of his religiosities hes my son and he must have religiosities i know nothing of his ideas or of his knowledge about sex and all that side of life i do not know of the things he finds beautiful i can guess at times thats all when he betrays himself you see you dont know really what love is until you have children one doesnt love women indeed you dont one gives and gets its a trade one may have tremendous excitements and expectations and overwhelming desires thats all very well in its way but the love of children is an exquisite tenderness it rends the heart its a thing of god and i lie awake at nights and stretch out my hands in the darkness to this ladwho will never knowuntil his sons come in their time  he made one of his quick turns again  and thats where our english way makes for distresses mr prussian respects and fears his father respects authorities attends obeys andhis father has a hold upon him but i said to myself at the outset no whatever happens i will not usurp the place of god i will not be the priestpatriarch of my children they shall grow and i will grow beside them helping but not cramping or overshadowing they grow more but they blunder more life ceases to be a discipline and becomes an experiment  thats very true said mr direck to whom it seemed the time was ripe to say something this is the problem of america perhaps even more than of england though i have not had the parental experience you have undergone i can see very clearly that a son is a very serious proposition  the old system of life was organisation that is where germany is still the most ancient of european states its a reversion to a tribal cult its atavistic to organise or discipline or mould characters or press authority is to assume that you have reached finality in your general philosophy it implies an assured end heinrich has his assured end his philological professorship or thereabouts as a part of the germanic machine and that too has its assured end in german national assertion here we have none of those convictions we know we havent finality and so we are open and apologetic and receptive rather than wilful you see all organisation with its implication of finality is death we feel that the germans dont what you organise you kill organised morals or organised religion or organised thought are dead morals and dead religion and dead thought yet some organisation you must have organisation is like killing cattle if you do not kill some the herd is just waste but you musnt kill all or you kill the herd the unkilled cattle are the herd the continuation the unorganised side of life is the real life the reality of life is adventure not performance what isnt adventure isnt life what can be ruled about can be machined but priests and schoolmasters and bureaucrats get hold of life and try to make it all rules all etiquette and regulation and correctitude and parents and the love of parents make for the same thing it is all very well to experiment for oneself but when one sees these dear things of ones own so young and inexperienced and so capable of every sort of gallant foolishness walking along the narrow plank going down into dark jungles ah then it makes one want to wrap them in laws and foresight and fence them about with verboten boards in all the conceivable aspects  in america of course we do set a certain store upon youthful selfreliance said mr direck  as we do here its in your blood and our blood its the instinct of the english and the irish anyhow to suspect government and take the risks of the chancy way and manifestly the russians if you read their novelists have the same twist in them when we get this young prussian here hes a marvel to us he really believes in law he likes to obey that seems a sort of joke to us its curious how foreign these germans areto all the rest of the world because of their docility scratch the russian and you get the tartar educate the russian or the american or the englishman or the irishman or frenchman or any real northern european except the german and you get the anarchist that is to say the man who dreams of order without organisationof something beyond organisation  its one oclock said mr britling abruptly perceiving a shade of fatigue upon the face of his hearer and realising that his thoughts had taken him too far and sunday lets go to bed   section 11  for a time mr direck could not sleep his mind had been too excited by this incessant day with all its novelties and all its provocations to comparison the whole complicated spectacle grouped itself with a naturalness and a complete want of logic that all who have been young will understand about cecily corner  she had to be in the picture and so she came in as though she were the central figure as though she were the quintessential england there she was the type the blood the likeness of no end of massachusetts families the very same stuff indeed and yet she was different  for a time his thoughts hovered ineffectively about certain details of her ear and cheek and one may doubt if his interest in these things was entirely international  then he found himself under way with an exposition of certain points to mr britling in the security of his bed he could imagine that he was talking very slowly and carefully while mr britling listened already he was more than half way to dreamland or he could not have supposed anything so incredible  theres a curious sort of difference he was saying it is difficult to define but on the whole i might express it by saying that such a gathering as this if it was in america would be drawn with harder lines would show its bones more and have everything more emphatic and just to take one illustrative point in america in such a gathering as this there would be bound to be several jokes going on as it were running jokes and running criticisms from day to day and from week to week there would be jokes about your writing and your influence and jokes about miss corners advanced reading you see in america we pay much more attention to personal character here people i notice are not talked to about their personal characters at all and many of them do not seem to be aware and do not seem to mind what personal characters they have  and another thing i find noteworthy is the way in which what i might call mature people seem to go on having a good time instead of standing by and applauding the young people having a good time and the young people do not seem to have set out to have a good time at all now in america a charming girl like miss corner would be distinctly more aware of herself and her vitality than she is here distinctly more her peculiarly charming sidelong look if i might make so free with herwould have been called attention to its a perfectly beautiful look the sort of look some great artist would have loved to make immortal its a look i shall find it hard to forget but she doesnt seem to be aware in the least of it in america she would be aware of it she would be distinctly aware of it she would have been made aware of it she would have been advised of it it would be looked for and she would know it was looked for she would give it as a singer gives her most popular song mamie nelson for example used to give a peculiar little throw back of the chin and a laugh it was talked about people came to see it  of course mamie nelson was a very brilliant girl indeed i suppose in england you would say we spoilt her i suppose we did spoil her  it came into mr direcks head that for a whole day he had scarcely given a thought to mamie nelson and now he was thinking of hercalmly why shouldnt one think of mamie nelson calmly  she was a proud imperious thing there was something southern in her very dark blue eyes she had much darker than miss corners  but how tortuous she had been behind that outward pride of hers for four years she had let him think he was the only man who really mattered in the world and all the time quite clearly and definitely she had deceived him she had made a fool of him and she had made a fool of the others perhapsjust to have her retinue and play the queen in her world and at last humiliation bitter humiliation and mamie with her chin in the air and her bright triumphant smile looking down on him  hadnt he she asked had the privilege of loving her  she took herself at the value they had set upon her  wellsomehowthat wasnt right  all the way across the atlantic mr direck had been trying to forget her downward glance with the chin up during that last encounterand other aspects of the same humiliation the years he had spent upon her the time always relying upon her assurance of a special preference for him he tried to think he was suffering from the pangs of unrequited love and to conceal from himself just how bitterly his pride and vanity had been rent by her ultimate rejection there had been a time when she had given him reason to laugh in his sleeve at booth wilmington  perhaps booth wilmington had also had reason for laughing in his sleeve  had she even loved booth wilmington or had she just snatched at him  wasnt he direck as good a man as booth wilmington anyhow  for some moments the old sting of jealousy rankled again he recalled the flaring rivalry that had ended in his defeat the competition of gifts and treats a thing so open that all carrierville knew of it discussed it took sides and over it all mamie with her flashing smile had sailed like a processional goddess  why they had made jokes about him in the newspapers  one couldnt imagine such a contest in matchings easy yet surely even in matchings easy there are lovers  is it something in the air something in the climate that makes things harder and clearer in america  cissiewhy shouldnt one call her cissie in ones private thoughts anyhowwould never be as hard and clear as mamie she had english eyesmerciful eyes  that was the wordmerciful  the english light the english air are merciful  merciful  they tolerate old things and slow things and imperfect apprehensions they arent always getting at you  they dont laugh at you at leastthey laugh differently  was england the tolerant country with its kind eyes and its wary sidelong look toleration in which everything mellowed and nothing was destroyed a soft country a country with a passion for imperfection a padded country  englandall stuffed with soft feathers  under ones ear a pillowwith soft kind corners  beautiful rounded corners dear dear corners cissie corners corners could there be a better family  massachusettsbut in heaven  harps playing twosteps and kind angels wrapped in moonlight    very softly i and you   one turn two turn three turn too   off we go     chapter the third  the entertainment of mr direck reaches a climax   section 1  breakfast was in the open air and a sunny easygoing feast then the small boys laid hands on mr direck and showed him the pond and the boats while mr britling strolled about the lawn with hugh talking rather intently and when mr direck returned from the boats in a state of greatly enhanced popularity he found mr britling conversing over his garden railings to what was altogether a new type of britisher in mr direcks experience it was a tall lean sunbitten youngish man of forty perhaps in brown tweeds looking more like the englishman of the american illustrations than anything mr direck had met hitherto indeed he came very near to a complete realisation of that ideal except that there was a sort of intensity about him and that his clipped moustache had the restrained stiffness of a wiryhaired terrier this gentleman mr direck learnt was colonel rendezvous he spoke in clear short sentences they had an effect of being punched out and he was refusing to come into the garden and talk  have to do my fourteen miles before lunch he said you havent seen manning about have you  he isnt here said mr britling and it seemed to mr direck that there was the faintest ambiguity in this reply  have to go alone then said colonel rendezvous they told me that he had started to come here  i shall motor over to bramley high oak for your boy scout festival said mr britling  going to have three thousand of em said the colonel good show  his steely eyes seemed to search the cover of mr britlings garden for the missing manning and then he decided to give him up i must be going he said so long come up  a welldisciplined dog came to heel and the lean figure had given mr direck a semimilitary salutation and gone upon its way it marched with a long elastic stride it never looked back  manning said mr britling is probably hiding up in my rose garden  curiously enough i guessed from your manner that that might be the case said mr direck  yes manning is a london journalist he has a little cottage about a mile over theremr britling pointed vaguelyand he comes down for the weekends and rendezvous has found out he isnt fit and everybody ought to be fit that is the beginning and end of life for rendezvous fitness an almost mineral quality an insatiable activity of body great mental simplicity so he takes possession of poor old manning and trots him for that fourteen milesat four miles an hour manning goes through all the agonies of death and damnation he half dissolves he pants and drags for the first eight or ten miles and then i must admit he rather justifies rendezvous theory he is to be found in the afternoon in a hammock suffering from blistered feet but otherwise unusually well but if he can escape it he does he hides  but if he doesnt want to go with rendezvous why does he said mr direck  well rendezvous is accustomed to the command of men and mannings only way of refusing things is on printed forms which he doesnt bring down to matchings easy ah behold  far away across the lawn between two blue cedars there appeared a leisurely form in grey flannels and a loose tie advancing with manifest circumspection  hes gone cried britling  the leisurely form obviously amiable obviously a little out of condition became more confident drew nearer  im sorry to have missed him he said cheerfully i thought he might come this way its going to be a very warm day indeed let us sit about somewhere and talk  of course he said turning to direck rendezvous is the life and soul of the country  they strolled towards a place of seats and hammocks between the big trees and the rose garden and the talk turned for a time upon rendezvous they have the tidiest garden in essex said manning its not mrs rendezvous fault that it is so mrs rendezvous as a matter of fact has a taste for the picturesque she just puts the things about in groups in the beds she wants them she says to grow anyhow she desires a romantic disorder but she never gets it when he walks down the path all the plants dress instinctively and theres a tree near their gate it used to be a willow you can ask any old man in the village but ever since rendezvous took the place its been trying to present arms with the most extraordinary results i was passing the other day with old windershin you see that there old poplar he said its a willow said i no he said it did used to be a willow before colonel rendezvous he came but now its a poplar and by jove it is a poplar  the conversation thus opened by manning centred for a time upon colonel rendezvous he was presented as a monster of energy and selfdiscipline as the determined foe of every form of looseness slackness and easygoingness  hes done wonderful work for the local boy scout movement said manning  its kitchenerism said britling  its the army side of the efficiency stunt said manning  there followed a digression upon the boy scout movement and mr direck made comparisons with the propaganda of seton thompson in america colonel teddyism said manning its a sort of reaction against everything being too easy and too safe  its got its antidecadent side said mr direck  if there is such a thing as decadence said mr britling  if there wasnt such a thing as decadence said manning we journalists would have had to invent it  there is something tragical in all thiswhat shall i call itkitchenerism mr britling reflected here you have it rushing about and keeping itselfscrewed up and trying desperately to keep the country screwed up and all because there may be a war some day somehow with germany provided germany is insane its that war like some sort of bee in rendezvous brains that is driving him along the road now to market saffronhe always keeps to the roads because they are severerthrough all the dust and sunshine when he might be here gossiping  and you know i dont see that war coming said mr britling i believe rendezvous sweats in vain i cant believe in that war it has held off for forty years it may hold off forever  he nodded his head towards the german tutor who had come into view across the lawn talking profoundly with mr britlings eldest son  look at that pleasant person there he isecht deutschif anything ever was look at my son there do you see the two of them engaged in mortal combat the things too ridiculous the world grows sane they may fight in the balkans still in many ways the balkan states are in the very rear of civilisation but to imagine decent countries like this or germany going back to bloodshed no when i see rendezvous keeping it up and keeping it up i begin to see just how poor germany must be keeping it up i begin to realise how sick germany must be getting of the high road and the dust and heat and the everlasting drill and restraint my heart goes out to the south germans old manning here always reminds me of austria think of germany coming like rendezvous on a sunday morning and looking stiffly over austrias fence come for a good hard walk man keep fit  but suppose this balkan trouble becomes acute said manning  it hasnt it wont even if it did we should keep out of it  but suppose russia grappled austria and germany flung herself suddenly upon franceperhaps taking belgium on the way  ohwe should fight of course we should fight could any one but a congenital idiot suppose we shouldnt fight they know we should fight they arent altogether idiots in germany but the things absurd why should germany attack france its as if manning here took a hatchet suddenly and assailed edith its just the dream of their military journalists its such schoolboy nonsense isnt that a beautiful pillar rose edith only put it in last year i hate all this talk of wars and rumours of wars its worried all my life and it gets worse and it gets emptier every year   section 2  now just at that moment there was a loud report  but neither mr britling nor mr manning nor mr direck was interrupted or incommoded in the slightest degree by that report because it was too far off over the curve of this round world to be either heard or seen at matchings easy nevertheless it was a very loud report it occurred at an open space by a river that ran through a cramped oriental city a city spiked with white minarets and girt about by bare hills under a blazing afternoon sky it came from a black parcel that the archduke francis ferdinand of austria with great presence of mind had just flung out from the open hood of his automobile where tossed from the side of the quay it had descended a few seconds before it exploded as it touched the cobbled road just under the front of the second vehicle in the procession and it blew to pieces the front of the automobile and injured the aidedecamp who was in it and several of the spectators its thrower was immediately gripped by the bystanders the procession stopped there was a tremendous commotion amongst that brightlycostumed crowd a hot excitement in vivid contrast to the sabbath calm of matchings easy  mr britling to whom the explosion was altogether inaudible continued his dissertation upon the commonsense of the world and the practical security of our western peace   section 3  lunch was an openair feast again three visitors had dropped in they had motored down from london piled up on a motorcycle and a sidecar a brother and two sisters they seemed to be and they had apparently reduced hilariousness to a principle the rumours of coming hockey that had been floating on the outskirts of mr direcks consciousness ever since his arrival thickened and multiplied it crept into his mind that he was expected to play  he decided he would not play he took various people into his confidence he told mr britling and mr britling said well make you full back where youll get a hit now and then and not have very much to do all you have to remember is to hit with the flat side of your stick and not raise it above your shoulders he told teddy and teddy said i strongly advise you to dress as thinly as you can consistently with decency and put your collar and tie in your pocket before the game begins hockey is properly a winter game he told the maiden auntlike lady with the prominent nose and she said almost enviously every one here is asked to play except me i assuage the perambulator i suppose one mustnt be envious i dont see why i shouldnt play im not so old as all that he told hugh and hugh warned him to be careful not to get hold of one of the sprung sticks he considered whether it wouldnt be wiser to go to his own room and lock himself in or stroll off for a walk through claverings park but then he would miss miss corner who was certain it seemed to come up for hockey on the other hand if he did not miss her he might make himself ridiculous in her eyes and efface the effect of the green silk stuff with the golden pheasants  he determined to stay behind until she arrived and explain to her that he was not going to play he didnt somehow want her to think he wasnt perfectly fit to play  mr carmine arrived in an automobile with two indians and a gentleman who had been a prospector in alaska the family who had danced overnight at the dower house reappeared and then mrs teddy very detached with a special hockey stick and miss corner wheeling the perambulator then came further arrivals at the earliest opportunity mr direck secured the attention of miss corner and lost his interest in any one else  i cant play this hockey said mr direck i feel strange about it it isnt an american game now if it were baseball  he left her to suppose him uncommonly hot stuff at baseball  if youre on my side said cecily mind you pass to me  it became evident to mr direck that he was going to play this hockey after all  well he said if ive got to play hockey i guess ive got to play hockey but cant i just get a bit of practice somewhere before the game begins  so miss corner went off to get two sticks and a ball and came back to instruct mr direck she said he had a good eye the two small boys scenting play in the air got sticks and joined them the overnight visitors wife appeared from the house in abbreviated skirts and wearing formidable shinguards with her abundant fair hair which was already breaking loose so to speak to join the fray she looked like a short stout dismounted valkyr her gaze was clear and firm   section 4  hockey as it was played at the dower house at matchings easy before the war was a game combining danger physical exercise and kindliness in a very high degree except for the infant in the perambulator and the outwardly calm but inwardly resentful aunt who wheeled the child up and down in a position of maximum danger just behind the unnetted goal every one was involved quite ablebodied people acquainted with the game played forward the less wellinformed played a defensive game behind the forward line elderly infirm and bulky persons were used chiefly as obstacles in goal several players wore padded legguards and all players were assumed to have them and expected to behave accordingly  proceedings began with an invidious ceremony called picking up this was heralded by mr britling clad in the diaphanous flannels and bearing a hockey stick advancing with loud shouts to the centre of the hockey field pick up pick up echoed the young britlings  mr direck became aware of a tall drooping man with long hair and long digressive legs in still longer white flannel trousers and a face that was somehow familiar he was talking with affectionate intimacy to manning and suddenly mr direck remembered that it was in mannings weekly paper the sectarian in which a bitter caricaturist enlivened a biting text that he had become familiar with the features of mannings companion it was raeburn raeburn the insidious raeburn the completest product of the party system well that was the english way come for the pick up cried the youngest britling seizing upon mr direcks elbow it appeared that mr britling and the overnight dinner guestmr direck never learnt his namewere picking up  names were shouted ill take cecily mr direck heard mr britling say quite early the opposing sides as they were picked fell into two groups there seemed to be difficulties about some of the names mr britling pointing to the more powerful looking of the indian gentlemen said you sir  im going to speculate on mr dinks said mr britlings opponent  mr direck gathered that mr dinks was to be his hockey name  youre on our side said mrs teddy i think youll have to play forward outer right and keep a sharp eye on cissie  ill do what i can said mr direck  his captain presently confirmed this appointment  his stick was really a sort of club and the ball was a firm hard cricket ball he resolved to be very gentle with cecily and see that she didnt get hurt  the sides took their places for the game and a kind of order became apparent to mr direck in the centre stood mr britling and the opposing captain and the ball lay between them they were preparing to bully off and start the game in a line with each of them were four other forwards they all looked spirited and intent young people and mr direck wished he had had more exercise to justify his own alert appearance behind each centre forward hovered one of the britling boys then on each side came a vaguer row of three backs persons of gentler disposition or maturer years they included mr raeburn who was considered to have great natural abilities for hockey but little experience mr raeburn was behind mr direck mrs britling was the centre back then in a corner of mr direcks side was a small girl of six or seven and in the halfcircle about the goal a lady in a motoring dust coat and a very short little man whom mr direck had not previously remarked mr lawrence carmine stripped to the braces which were richly ornamented with oriental embroidery kept goal for our team  the centre forwards went through a rapid little ceremony they smote their sticks on the ground and then hit the sticks together one said mr britling the operation was repeated two  three  smack mr britling had got it and the ball had gone to the shorter and sturdier of the younger britlings who had been standing behind mr direcks captain crack and it was away to teddy smack and it was coming right at direck  lordy he said and prepared to smite it  then something swift and blue had flashed before him intercepted the ball and shot it past him this was cecily corner and she and teddy were running abreast like the wind towards mr raeburn  hey cried mr raeburn stop and advanced as it seemed to mr direck with unseemly and threatening gestures towards cissie  but before mr direck could adjust his mind to this new phase of affairs cecily had passed the right honourable gentleman with the same mysterious ease with which she had flashed by mr direck and was bearing down upon the miscellaneous landwehr which formed the backs of mr direcks side  you rabbit cried mr raeburn and became extraordinarily active in pursuit administering great lengths of arm and leg with a centralised efficiency he had not hitherto displayed  running hard to the help of mr raeburn was the youngest britling boy a beautiful contrast it was like a puff ball supporting and assisting a conger eel in front of mr direck the little stout man was being alert teddy was supporting the attack near the middle of the field crying centre while mr britling very round and resolute was bouncing straight towards the threatened goal but mrs teddy running as swiftly as her sister was between teddy and the ball whack the little short mans stick had clashed with cecilys confused things happened with sticks and feet and the little short man appeared to be trying to cut down cecily as one cuts down a tree she tried to pass the ball to her centre forwardtoo late and then mrs teddy had intercepted it and was flickering back towards mr britlings goal in a rush in which mr direck perceived it was his duty to join  yes he had to follow up mrs teddy and pick up the ball if he had a chance and send it in to her or the captain or across to the left forwards as circumstances might decide it was perfectly clear  then came his moment the little formidably padded lady who had dined at the dower house overnight made a gallant attack upon mrs teddy out of the confusion of this clash the ball spun into mr direcks radius where should he smite and how a moment of reflection was natural  but now the easyfitting discipline of the dower house style of hockey became apparent mr direck had last observed the tall young indian gentleman full of vitality and anxious for destruction far away in the distance on the opposing right wing but now regardless of the more formal methods of the game this young man had resolved without further delay and at any cost to hit the ball hard and he was travelling like some asiatic typhoon with an extreme velocity across the remonstrances of mr britling and the general order of his side mr direck became aware of him just before his impact there was a sort of collision from which mr direck emerged with a feeling that one side of his face was permanently flattened but still gallantly resolved to hit the comparatively lethargic ball he and the staggered but resolute indian clashed sticks again and mr direck had the best of it years of experience couldnt have produced a better pass to the captain  good pass  apparently from one of the london visitors  but this was some game  the ball executed some rapid movements to and fro across the field our side was pressing hard there was a violent convergence of miscellaneous backs and suchlike irregulars upon the threatened goal mr britlings dozen was rapidly losing its disciplined order one of the sidecar ladies and the gallant indian had shifted their activities to the defensive back and with them was a spectacled gentleman waving his stick high above all recognised rules mr direcks captain and both britling boys hurried to join the fray mr britling who seemed to mr direck to be for a captain rather too demagogic also ran back to rally his forces by loud cries pass outwardly was the burthen of his contribution  the struggle about the britling goal ceased to be a game and became something between a fight and a social gathering mr britlings goalkeeper could be heard shouting i cant see the ball lift your feet the crowded conflict lurched towards the goal posts my shin cried mr manning no you dont  whack but again whack  whack ah would you whack  goal cried the sidecar gentleman  goal cried the britling boys  mr manning as goalkeeper went to recover the ball but one of the britling boys politely anticipated him  the crowd became inactive and then began to drift back to loosely conceived positions  its no good swarming into goal like that mr britling with a faint asperity in his voice explained to his followers weve got to keep open and not crowd each other  then he went confidentially to the energetic young indian to make some restrictive explanation of his activities  mr direck strolled back towards cecily he was very warm and a little blown but not he felt disgraced he was winning  youll have to take your coat off she said  it was a good idea  it had occurred to several people and the boundary line was already dotted with hastily discarded jackets and wraps and so forth but the lady in the motoring dust coat was buttoning it to the chin  one goal love said the minor britling boy  we havent begun yet sunny said cecily  sonny thats american said mr direck  no we call him sunny jim said cecily theyre bullying off again  sunny jims american too said mr direck returning to his place  the struggle was resumed and soon it became clear that the first goal was no earnest of the quality of the struggle teddy and cecily formed a terribly efficient combination against their brilliant rushes supported in a vehement but effective manner by the indian to their right and guided by loud shoutings from mr britling centre mr direck and the sidecar lady and mr raeburn struggled in vain one swift advance was only checked by the dust cloak its folds held the ball until help arrived another was countered by a tremendous swipe of mr raeburns that sent the ball within an inch of the youngest britlings head and right across the field the third resulted in a swift pass from cecily to the elder britling son away on her right and he shot the goal neatly and swiftly through the lattice of mr lawrence carmines defensive movements and after that very rapidly came another goal for mr britlings side and then another  then mr britling cried out that it was half time and explained to mr direck that whenever one side got to three goals they considered it was half time and had five minutes rest and changed sides everybody was very hot and happy except the lady in the dust cloak who was perfectly cool in everybodys eyes shone the light of battle and not a shadow disturbed the brightness of the afternoon for mr direck except a certain unspoken anxiety about mr raeburns trousers  you see mr direck had never seen mr raeburn before and knew nothing about his trousers  they appeared to be coming down  to begin with they had been rather loose over the feet and turned up and as the game progressed fold after fold of concertinaed flannel gathered about his ankles every now and then mr raeburn would seize the opportunity of some respite from the game to turn up a fresh six inches or so of this accumulation naturally mr direck expected this policy to end unhappily he did not know that the flannel trousers of mr raeburn were like a river that they could come down forever and still remain inexhaustible  he had visions of this scene of happy innocence being suddenly blasted by a monstrous disaster  apart from this worry mr direck was as happy as any one there  perhaps these apprehensions affected his game at any rate he did nothing that pleased him in the second half cecily danced all over him and round and about him and in the course of ten minutes her side had won the two remaining goals with a score of fiveone and five goals is game by the standards of matchings easy  and then with the very slightest of delays these insatiable people picked up again mr direck slipped away and returned in a white silk shirt tennis trousers and a belt this time he and cecily were on the same side the cecilyteddy combination was broken and he it seemed was to take the place of the redoubtable teddy on the left wing with her  this time the sides were better chosen and played a long obstinate even game oneone onetwo onethree half time twothree three all fourthree four all  by this time mr direck was beginning to master the simple strategy of the sport he was also beginning to master the fact that cecily was the quickest nimblest most indefatigable player on the field he scouted for her and passed to her he developed tacit understandings with her ideas of protecting her had gone to the four winds of heaven against them teddy and a sidecar girl with raeburn in support made a memorable struggle teddy was as quick as a cat fourthree looked like winning but then teddy and the tall indian and mrs teddy pulled square they almost repeated this feat and won but mr manning saved the situation with an immense oblique hit that sent the ball to mr direck he ran with the ball up to raeburn and then dodged and passed to cecily there was a lively struggle to the left the ball was hit out by mr raeburn and thrown in by a young britling lost by the forwards and rescued by the padded lady forward again this time will do it  cecily away to the left had worked round mr raeburn once more teddy realising that things were serious was tearing back to attack her  mr direck supported with silent intentness centre cried mr britling centre  mr direck came her voice full of confidence of such moments is the heroic life the ball shot behind the hurtling teddy mr direck stopped it with his foot a trick he had just learnt from the eldest britling son he was neither slow nor hasty he was in the halfcircle and the way to the goal was barred only by the dustcloak lady and mr lawrence carmine he made as if to shoot to mr carmines left and then smacked the ball with the swiftness of a serpents stroke to his right  hed done it mr carmines stick and feet were a yard away  then hard on this wild triumph came a flash of horror one cant see everything his eye following the balls trajectory  directly in its line of flight was the perambulator  the ball missed the legs of the lady with the noble nose by a kind of miracle hit and glanced off the wheel of the perambulator and went spinning into a border of antirrhinums  good cried cecily splendid shot  hed shot a goal hed done it well the perambulator it seemed didnt matter though apparently the impact had awakened the baby in the margin of his consciousness was the figure of mr britling remarking aunty you really mustnt wheel the perambulatorjust there  i thought said the aunt indicating the goal posts by a facial movement that those two sticks would be a sort of protection aah did they then  never mind that  thats game said one of the junior britlings to mr direck with a note of high appreciation and the whole party relaxing and crumpling like a lowered flag moved towards the house and tea   section 5  well play some more after tea said cecily it will be cooler then  my word im beginning to like it said mr direck  youre going to play very well she said  and such is the magic of a game that mr direck was humbly proud and grateful for her praise and trotted along by the side of this creature who had revealed herself so swift and resolute and decisive full to overflowing of the mere pleasure of just trotting along by her side and after tea which was a large confused affair enlivened by wonderful and entirely untruthful reminiscences of the afternoon by mr raeburn they played again with fewer inefficients and greater skill and swiftness and mr direck did such quick and intelligent things that everybody declared that he was a hockey player straight from heaven the dusk which at last made the position of the ball too speculative for play came all too soon for him he had played in six games and he knew he would be as stiff as a dutch doll in the morning but he was very very happy  the rest of the sunday evening was essentially a sequel to the hockey  mr direck changed again and after using some embrocation that mrs britling recommended very strongly came down in a black jacket and a cheerfully ample black tie he had a sense of physical wellbeing such as he had not experienced since he came aboard the liner at new york the curious thing was that it was not quite the same sense of physical wellbeing that one had in america that is bright and clear and a little dry this washumid his mind quivered contentedly like sunset midges over a lakeit had no hard bright flashesand his body wanted to sit about his sense of intimacy with cecily increased each time he looked at her when she met his eyes she smiled hed caught her style now he felt he attempted no more compliments and was frankly her pupil at hockey and badminton after supper mr britling renewed his suggestion of an automobile excursion on the monday  theres nothing to take you back to london said mr britling and we could just hunt about the district with the little old car and see everything you want to see  mr direck did not hesitate three seconds he thought of gladys he thought of miss cecily corner  well indeed he said if it isnt burthening you if im not being any sort of inconvenience here for another night id be really very glad indeed of the opportunity of going around and seeing all these ancient places   section 6  the newspapers came next morning at nine and were full of the sarajevo murders mr direck got the daily chronicle and found quite animated headlines for a british paper  whos this archduke he asked anyhow and where is this bosnia i thought it was a part of turkey  its in austria said teddy  its in the middle ages said mr britling what an odd pertinaceous business it seems to have been first one bomb then another then finally the man with the pistol while we were strolling about the rose garden its like something out of the prisoner of zenda  please said herr heinrich  mr britling assumed an attentive expression  will not this generally affect european politics  i dont know perhaps it will  it says in the paper that serbia has sent those bombs to sarajevo  its like another world said mr britling over his paper assassination as a political method can you imagine anything of the sort happening nowadays west of the adriatic imagine some one assassinating the american vicepresident and the bombs being at once ascribed to the arsenal at toronto we take our politics more sadly in the west wont you have another egg direck  please might this not lead to a war  i dont think so austria may threaten serbia but she doesnt want to provoke a conflict with russia it would be going too near the powder magazine but its all an extraordinary business  but if she did herr heinrich persisted  she wont some years ago i used to believe in the inevitable european war mr britling explained to mr direck but its been threatened so long that at last ive lost all belief in it the powers wrangle and threaten theyre far too cautious and civilised to let the guns go off if there was going to be a war it would have happened two years ago when the balkan league fell upon turkey or when bulgaria attacked serbia  herr heinrich reflected and received these conclusions with an expression of respectful edification  i am naturally anxious he said because i am taking tickets for my holidays at an esperanto conference at boulogne   section 7  there is only one way to master such a thing as driving an automobile said mr britling outside his front door as he took his place in the drivers seat and that is to resolve that from the first you will take no risks be slow if you like stop and think when you are in doubt but do nothing rashly permit no mistakes  it seemed to mr direck as he took his seat beside his host that this was admirable doctrine  they started out of the gates with an extreme deliberation indeed twice they stopped dead in the act of turning into the road and the engine had to be restarted  you will laugh at me said mr britling but im resolved to have no blunders this time  i dont laugh at you its excellent said mr direck  its the right way said mr britling careoh damn ive stopped the engine again ughahsocare i was sayingand calm  dont think i want to hurry you said mr direck i dont  they passed through the tillage at a slow agreeable pace tooting loudly at every corner and whenever a pedestrian was approached mr direck was reminded that he had still to broach the lecture project to mr britling so much had happened  the car halted abruptly and the engine stopped  i thought that confounded hen was thinking of crossing the road said mr britling instead of which shes gone through the hedge she certainly looked this way perhaps im a little fussy this morning ill warm up to the work presently  im convinced you cant be too careful said mr direck and this sort of thing enables one to see the country better  beyond the village mr britling seemed to gather confidence the pace quickened but whenever other traffic or any indication of a side way appeared discretion returned mr britling stalked his sign posts crawling towards them on the belly of the lowest gear he drove all the morning like a man who is flushing ambuscades and yet accident overtook him for god demands more from us than mere righteousness  he cut through the hills to market saffron along a laneroad with which he was unfamiliar it began to go up hill he explained to mr direck how admirably his engine would climb hills on the top gear  they took a curve and the hill grew steeper and mr direck opened the throttle  they rounded another corner and still more steeply the hill rose before them  the engine began to make a chinking sound and the car lost pace and then mr britling saw a pleading little white board with the inscription concealed turning for the moment he thought a turning might be concealed anywhere he threw out his clutch and clapped on his brake then he repented of what he had done but the engine after three herculean throbs ceased to work mr britling with a convulsive clutch at his steering wheel set the electric hooter snarling while one foot released the clutch again and the other on the accelerator sought in vain for help mr direck felt they were going back back in spite of all this vocalisation he clutched at the emergency brake but he was too late to avoid misfortune with a feeling like sitting gently in butter the car sank down sideways and stopped with two wheels in the ditch  mr britling said they were in the ditchsaid it with quite unnecessary violence  this time two cart horses and a retinue of five men were necessary to restore gladys to her selfrespect  after that they drove on to market saffron and got there in time for lunch and after lunch mr direck explored the church and the churchyard and the parish register  after lunch mr britling became more cheerful about his driving the road from market saffron to blandish whence one turns off to matchings easy is the london and norwich high road it is an old roman stane street and very straightforward and honest in its stretches you can see the cross roads half a mile away and the low hedges give you no chance of a surprise everybody is cheered by such a road and everybody drives more confidently and quickly and mr britling particularly was heartened by it and gradually let out gladys from the almost excessive restriction that had hitherto marked the day on a road like this nothing can happen said mr britling  unless you broke an axle or burst a tyre said mr direck  my man at matchings easy is most careful in his inspection said mr britling putting the accelerator well down and watching the speed indicator creep from forty to fortyfive he went over the car not a week ago and its not one month oldin use that is  yet something did happen  it was as they swept by the picturesque walls under the big old trees that encircle brandismead park it was nothing but a slight miscalculation of distances ahead of them and well to the left rode a postman on a bicycle towards them with that curious effect of implacable fury peculiar to motor cycles came a motor cyclist first mr britling thought that he would not pass between these two then he decided that he would hurry up and do so then he reverted to his former decision and then it seemed to him that he was going so fast that he must inevitably run down the postman his instinct not to do that pulled the car sharply across the path of the motor cyclist oh my god cried mr britling my god twisted his wheel over and distributed his feet among his levers dementedly  he had an imperfectly formed idea of getting across right in front of the motor cyclist and then they were going down the brief grassy slope between the road and the wall straight at the wall and still at a good speed the motor cyclist smacked against something and vanished from the problem the wall seemed to rush up at them and thencollapse there was a tremendous concussion mr direck gripped at his friend the emergency brake but had only time to touch it before his head hit against the frame of the glass windscreen and a curtain fell upon everything  he opened his eyes upon a broken wall a crumpled motor car and an undamaged motor cyclist in the aviators cap and thin oilskin overalls dear to motor cyclists mr direck stared and then still stunned and puzzled tried to raise himself he became aware of acute pain  dont move for a bit said the motor cyclist your arm and side are rather hurt i think   section 8  in the course of the next twelve hours mr direck was to make a discovery that was less common in the days before the war than it has been since he discovered that even pain and injury may be vividly interesting and gratifying  if any one had told him he was going to be stunned for five or six minutes cut about the brow and face and have a bone in his wrist put out and that as a consequence he would find himself pleased and exhilarated he would have treated the prophecy with ridicule but here he was lying stiffly on his back with his wrist bandaged to his side and smiling into the darkness even more brightly than he had smiled at the essex landscape two days before the fact is pain hurts or irritates but in itself it does not make a healthily constituted man miserable the expectation of pain the certainty of injury may make one hopeless enough the reality rouses our resistance nobody wants a broken bone or a delicate wrist but very few people are very much depressed by getting one people can be much more depressed by smoking a hundred cigarettes in three days or losing one per cent of their capital  and everybody had been most delightful to mr direck  he had had the monopoly of damage mr britling holding on to the steering wheel had not even been thrown out unless im internally injured he said im not hurt at all my liver perhapsbruised a little  gladys had been abandoned in the ditch and they had been very kindly brought home by a passing automobile cecily had been at the dower house at the moment of the rueful arrival she had seen how an american can carry injuries she had made sympathy and helpfulness more delightful by expressed admiration  shes a natural born nurse said mr direck and then rather in the tone of one who addressed a public meeting but this sort of thing brings out all the good there is in a woman  he had been quite explicit to them and more particularly to her when they told him he must stay at the dower house until his arm was cured he had looked the application straight into her pretty eyes  if im to stay right here just as a consequence of that little shake up may be for a couple of weeks may be three and if youre coming to do a bit of a talk to me ever and again then i tell you i dont call this a misfortune it isnt a misfortune its right down sheer good luck  and now he lay as straight as a mummy with his soul filled with radiance of complete mental peace after months of distress and confusion hed got straight again he was in the middle of a real good story bright and clean he knew just exactly what he wanted  after all he said its true theres ideals shes an ideal why i loved her before ever i set eyes on mamie i loved her before i was put into pants that old portrait there it was pointing my destiny its affinity its natural selection  well i dont know what she thinks of me yet but i do know very well what shes got to think of me shes got to think all the world of meif i break every limb of my body making her do it  id a sort of feeling it was right to go in that old automobile  say what you like theres a guidance  he smiled confidentially at the darkness as if they shared a secret     chapter the fourth  mr britling in soliloquy   section 1  very different from the painful contentment of the bruised and broken mr direck was the state of mind of his unwounded host he too was sleepless but sleepless without exaltation the day had been too much for him altogether his head to borrow an admirable american expression was busy  how busy it was a whole chapter will be needed to describe  the impression mr britling had made upon mr direck was one of indefatigable happiness but there were times when mr britling was called upon to pay for his general cheerful activity in lump sums of bitter sorrow there were nightsand especially after seasons of exceptional excitement and nervous activitywhen the reckoning would be presented and mr britling would welter prostrate and groaning under a stormy sky of unhappinessactive insatiable unhappinessa beating with rods  the sorrows of the sanguine temperament are brief but furious the world knows little of them the world has no need to reckon with them they cause no suicides and few crimes they hurry past smiting at their victim as they go none the less they are misery mr britling in these moods did not perhaps experience the grey and hopeless desolations of the melancholic nor the red damnation of the choleric but he saw a world that bristled with misfortune and error with poisonous thorns and traps and swampy places and incurable blunderings an almost insupportable remorse for being mr britling would pursue himjustifying itself upon a hundred counts  and for being such a britling  whyhe revived again that bitter question of a thousand and one unhappy nightswhy was he such a fool such a hasty fool why couldnt he look before he leapt why did he take risks why was he always so ready to act upon the supposition that all was bound to go well he might as well have asked why he had quick brown eyes  why for instance hadnt he adhered to the resolution of the early morning he had begun with an extremity of caution  it was a characteristic of these moods of mr britling that they produced a physical restlessness he kept on turning over and then turning over again and sitting up and lying back like a martyr on a gridiron  this was just the latest instance of a lifelong trouble will there ever be a sort of man whose thoughts are quick and his acts slow then indeed we shall have a formidable being mr britlings thoughts were quick and sanguine and his actions even more eager than his thoughts already while he was a young man mr britling had found his acts elbow their way through the hurry of his ideas and precipitate humiliations long before his reasons were marshalled his resolutions were formed he had attempted a thousand remonstrances with himself he had sought to remedy the defects in his own character by written inscriptions in his bedroom and memoranda inside his watch case keep steady was one of them keep the end in view and go steadfastly coherently continuously only so can you go where you will in distrusting all impulse scrutinising all imagination he was persuaded lay his one prospect of escape from the surprise of countless miseries otherwise he danced among glass bombs and barbed wire  there had been a time when he could exhort himself to such fundamental charge and go through phases of the severest discipline always at last to be taken by surprise from some unexpected quarter at last he had ceased to hope for any triumph so radical he had been content to believe that in recent years age and a gathering habit of wisdom had somewhat slowed his leaping purpose that if he hadnt overcome he had at least to a certain extent minimised it but this last folly was surely the worst to charge through this patient world withhow much did the car weigh a ton certainly and perhaps morereckless of every risk not only to himself but others at this thought he clutched the steering wheel again once more he saw the bent back of the endangered cyclist once more he felt rather than saw the seething approach of the motor bicycle and then through a long instant he drove helplessly at the wall  hell perhaps is only one such incident indefinitely prolonged  anything might have been there in front of him and indeed now out of the dreamland to which he could not escape something had come something that screamed sharply  good god he cried if i had hit a child i might have hit a child the hypothesis flashed into being with the thought tried to escape and was caught it was characteristic of mr britlings nocturnal imagination that he should individualise this child quite sharply as rather plain and slender with reddish hair staring eyes and its ribs crushed in a vivid and dreadful manner pinned against the wall mixed up with some bricks only to be extracted oh horribly  but this was not fair he had hurt no child he had merely pitched out mr direck and broken his arm  it wasnt his merit that the child hadnt been there  the child might have been there  mere luck  he lay staring in despairas an involuntary god might stare at many a thing in this amazing universestaring at the little victim his imagination had called into being only to destroy   section 2  if he had not crushed a child other people had such things happened vicariously at any rate he had crushed many children  why are children ever crushed  and suddenly all the pain and destruction and remorse of all the accidents in the world descended upon mr britling  no longer did he ask why am i such a fool but why are we all such fools he became man on the automobile of civilisation crushing his thousands daily in his headlong and yet aimless career  that was a trick of mr britlings mind it had this tendency to spread outward from himself to generalised issues many minds are like that nowadays he was not so completely individualised as people are supposed to be individualisedin our law in our stories in our moral judgments he had a vicarious factor he could slip from concentrated reproaches to the liveliest remorse for himself as the automobilist in general or for himself as england or for himself as man from remorse for smashing his guest and his automobile he could pass by what was for him the most imperceptible of transitions to remorse for every accident that has ever happened through the error of an automobilist since automobiles began all that long succession of blunderers became mr britling or rather mr britling became all that vast succession of blunderers  these fluctuating lapses from individuation made mr britling a perplexity to many who judged only by the old personal standards at times he seemed a monster of cantankerous selfrighteousness whom nobody could please or satisfy but indeed when he was most pitiless about the faults of his race or nation he was really reproaching himself and when he seemed more egotistical and introspective and selfcentred he was really ransacking himself for a clue to that same confusion of purposes that waste the hope and strength of humanity and now through the busy distresses of the night it would have perplexed a watching angel to have drawn the line and shown when mr britling was grieving for his own loss and humiliation and when he was grieving for these common human weaknesses of which he had so large a share  and this double refraction of his mind by which a concentrated and individualised britling did but present a larger impersonal britling beneath carried with it a duplication of his conscience and sense of responsibility to his personal conscience he was answerable for his private honour and his debts and the dower house he had made and so on but to his impersonal conscience he was answerable for the whole world the world from the latter point of view was his egg he had a subconscious delusion that he had laid it he had a subconscious suspicion that he had let it cool and that it was addled he had an urgency to incubate it the variety and interest of his talk was largely due to that persuasion it was a perpetual attempt to spread his mental feathers over the task before him   section 3  after this much of explanation it is possible to go on to the task which originally brought mr direck to matchings easy the task that massachusetts society had sent him upon the task of organising the mental unveiling of mr britling mr direck saw mr britling only in the daylight and with an increasing distraction of the attention towards miss cecily corner we may see him rather more clearly in the darkness without any distraction except his own  now the smashing of gladys was not only the source of a series of reproaches and remorses directly arising out of the smash it had also a wide system of collateral consequences which were also banging and blundering their way through the britling mind it was extraordinarily inconvenient in quite another direction that the automobile should be destroyed it upset certain plans of mr britlings in a direction growing right out from all the dower house world in which mr direck supposed him to be completely set and rooted there were certain matters from which mr britling had been averting his mind most strenuously throughout the weekend now there was no averting his mind any more  mr britling was entangled in a love affair it was to be exact and disregarding minor affinities his eighth love affair and the new automobile so soon as he could drive it efficiently was to have played quite a solvent and conclusive part in certain entangled complications of this relationship  a man of lively imagination and quick impulses naturally has love affairs as he drives himself through life just as he naturally has accidents if he drives an automobile  and the peculiar relations that existed between mr britling and mrs britling tended inevitably to make these love affairs troublesome undignified and futile especially when they were viewed from the point of view of insomnia  mr britlings first marriage had been a passionately happy one his second was by comparison a marriage in neutral tint there is much to be said for that extreme catholic theory which would make marriage not merely lifelong but eternal certainly mr britling would have been a finer if not a happier creature if his sentimental existence could have died with his first wife or continued only in his love for their son he had married in the glow of youth he had had two years of clean and simple loving helping quarrelling and the happy ending of quarrels something went out of him into all that which could not be renewed again in his first extremity of grief he knew that perfectly welland then afterwards he forgot it while there is life there is imagination which makes and forgets and goes on  he met edith under circumstances that did not in any way recall his lost mary he met her as people say socially mary on the other hand had been a girl at newnham while he was a fellow of pembroke and there had been something of accident and something of furtiveness in their lucky discovery of each other there had been a flush in it there was dash in it but edith he saw and chose and had to woo there was no rushing together there was solicitation and assent edith was a bachelor of science of london university and several things like that and she looked upon the universe under her broad forehead and broadwaving brown hair with quiet watchful eyes that had nothing whatever to hide a thing so incredible to mr britling that he had loved and married her very largely for the serenity of her mystery and for a time after their marriage he sailed over those brown depths plumbing furiously  of course he did not make his former passion for mary at all clear to her indeed while he was winning edith it was by no means clear to himself he was making a new emotional drama and consciously and subconsciously he dismissed a hundred reminiscences that sought to invade the new experience and which would have been out of key with it and without any deliberate intention to that effect he created an atmosphere between himself and edith in which any discussion of mary was reduced to a minimum and in which hugh was accepted rather than explained he contrived to believe that she understood all sorts of unsayable things he invented miracles of quite uncongenial mute mutuality  it was over the chessboard that they first began to discover their extensive difficulties of sympathy mr britlings play was characterised by a superficial brilliance much generosity and extreme unsoundness he always moved directly his opponent had done soand then reflected on the situation his reflection was commonly much wiser than his moves mrs britling was as it were a natural antagonist to her husband she was as calm as he was irritable she was never in a hurry to move and never disposed to make a concession quietly steadfastly by caution and deliberation without splendour without error she had beaten him at chess until it led to such dreadful fits of anger that he had to renounce the game altogether after every such occasion he would be at great pains to explain that he had merely been angry with himself nevertheless he felt and would not let himself think while she concluded from incidental heated phrases that that was not the complete truth about the outbreak  slowly they got through the concealments of that specious explanation temperamentally they were incompatible  they were profoundly incompatible in all things she was defensive she never came out never once had she surprised him halfway upon the road to her he had to go all the way to her and knock and ring and then she answered faithfully she never surprised him even by unkindness if he had a cut finger she would bind it up very skilfully and healingly but unless he told her she never discovered he had a cut finger he was amazed she did not know of it before it happened he piped and she did not dance that became the formula of his grievance for several unhappy years she thwarted him and disappointed him while he filled her with dumb inexplicable distresses he had been at first so gay an activity and then he was shattered fragments of him were still as gay and attractive as ever but between were outbreaks of anger of hostility of something very like malignity only very slowly did they realise the truth of their relationship and admit to themselves that the fine bud of love between them had failed to flower and only after long years were they able to delimit boundaries where they had imagined union and to becomeallies if it had been reasonably possible for them to part without mutual injury and recrimination they would have done so but two children presently held them and gradually they had to work out the broad mutual toleration of their later relations if there was no love and delight between them there was a real habitual affection and much mutual help she was proud of his steady progress to distinction proud of each intimation of respect he won she admired and respected his work she recognised that he had some magic of liveliness and unexpectedness that was precious and enviable so far as she could help him she did and even when he knew that there was nothing behind it that it was indeed little more than an imaginative inertness he could still admire and respect her steady dignity and her consistent honourableness her practical capacity was for him a matter for continual selfcongratulation he marked the bright order of her household her flowering borders the prosperous highborn roses of her garden with a wondering appreciation he had never been able to keep anything in order he relied more and more upon her he showed his respect for her by a scrupulous attention to her dignity and his confidence by a franker and franker emotional neglect because she expressed so little he succeeded in supposing she felt little and since nothing had come out of the brown depths of her eyes he saw fit at last to suppose no plumbline would ever find anything there he pursued his interests he reached out to this and that he travelled she made it a matter of conscience to let him go unhampered she felt she thoughtunrecorded he did and he expressed and reexpressed and overexpressed and started this and that with quick irrepressible activity and so there had accumulated about them the various items of the life to whose more ostensible accidents mr direck was now for an indefinite period joined  it was in the nature of mr britling to incur things it was in the nature of mrs britling to establish them mr britling had taken the dower house on impulse and she had made it a delightful home he had discovered the disorderly delights of mixed sunday hockey one weekend at pontings that had promised to be dull and she had made it an institution he had come to her with his orphan boy and a memory of a passionate first loss that sometimes and more particularly at first he seemed to have forgotten altogether and at other times was only too evidently lamenting with every fibre of his being she had taken the utmost care of the relics of her duskily pretty predecessor that she found in unexpected abundance in mr britlings possession and she had done her duty by her sometimes rather incomprehensible stepson she never allowed herself to examine the state of her heart towards this youngster it is possible that she did not perceive the necessity for any such examination  so she went through life outwardly serene and dignified one of a great company of rather fastidious rather unenterprising women who have turned for their happiness to secondary things to those fair inanimate things of household and garden which do not turn again and rend one to aestheticisms and delicacies to order and seemliness moreover she found great satisfaction in the health and welfare the growth and animation of her own two little boys and no one knew and perhaps even she had contrived to forget the phases of astonishment and disillusionment of doubt and bitterness and secret tears that spread out through the years in which she had slowly realised that this strange fitful animated man who had come to her vowing himself hers asking for her so urgently and persuasively was ceasing had ceased to love her that his heart had escaped her that she had missed it she never dreamt that she had hurt it and that after its first urgent tumultuous incomprehensible search for her it had hidden itself bitterly away   section 4  the mysterious processes of nature that had produced mr britling had implanted in him an obstinate persuasion that somewhere in the world from some human being it was still possible to find the utmost satisfaction for every need and craving he could imagine as existing as waiting for him he knew not where a completeness of understanding a perfection of response that would reach all the gamut of his feelings and sensations from the most poetical to the most entirely physical a beauty of relationship so transfiguring that not only would sheit went without saying that this completion was a womanbe perfectly beautiful in its light but what was manifestly more incredible that he too would be perfectly beautiful and quite at his ease in her presence there could be no selfreproaches no lapses no limitations nothing but happiness and the happiest activities to such a persuasion half the imaginative people in the world succumb as readily and naturally as ducklings take to water they do not doubt its truth any more than a thirsty camel doubts that presently it will come to a spring  this persuasion is as foolish as though a camel hoped that some day it would drink from such a spring that it would never thirst again for the most part mr britling ignored its presence in his mind and resisted the impulses it started but at odd times and more particularly in the afternoon and while travelling and in between books mr britling so far succumbed to this strange expectation of a wonder round the corner that he slipped the anchors of his humour and selfcontempt and joined the great cruising brotherhood of the pilgrims of love  in factthough he himself had never made a reckoning of ithe had been upon eight separate cruises he was now upon the eighth  between these various excursionsthey took him round and about the world so to speak they cast him away on tropical beaches they left him dismasted on desolate seas they involved the most startling interventions and the most inconvenient consequencesthere were interludes of penetrating philosophy for some years the suspicion had been growing up in mr britlings mind that in planting this persuasion in his being the mysterious processes of nature had been perhaps for some purely biological purpose pulling as people say his leg that there were not these perfect responses that loving a woman is a thing one does thoroughly once for allor soand afterwards recalls regrettably in a series of vain repetitions and that the career of the pilgrim of love so soon as you strip off its credulous glamour is either the most pitiful or the most vulgar and vile of perversions from the proper conduct of life but this suspicion had not as yet grown to prohibitive dimensions with him it was not sufficient to resist the seasons of high tide the sudden promise of the saltedged breeze the invitation of the hovering seabird and he was now concealing beneath the lively surface of activities with which mr direck was now familiar a very extensive system of distresses arising out of the latest the eighth of these digressional adventures  mr britling had got into it very much as he had got into the ditch on the morning before his smash he hadnt thought the affair out and he hadnt looked carefully enough and it kept on developing in just the ways he would rather that it didnt  the seventh affair had been very disconcerting he had made a fool of himself with quite a young girl he blushed to think how young it hadnt gone very far but it had made his nocturnal reflections so disagreeable that he hadby no means for the first timedefinitely and forever given up these foolish dreams of love and when mrs harrowdean swam into his circle she seemed just exactly what was wanted to keep his imagination out of mischief she came bearing flattery to the pitch of adoration she was the brightest and cleverest of young widows she wrote quite admirably criticism in the scrutator and the sectarian and occasionally poetry in the right reviewwhen she felt disposed to do so she had an intermittent vein of high spirits that was almost better than humour and made her quickly popular with most of the people she met and she was only twenty miles away in her pretty house and her absurd little jolly park  there was something she said in his thought and work that was like walking in mountains she came to him because she wanted to clamber about the peaks and glens of his mind  it was natural to reply that he wasnt by any means the serene mountain elevation she thought him except perhaps for a kind of loneliness  she was a great reader of eighteenth century memoirs and some she conveyed to him her mental quality was all in the vein of the friendships of rousseau and voltaire and pleasantly and trippingly she led him along the primrose path of an intellectual liaison she came first to matchings easy where she was sweet and bright and vividly interested and a great contrast to mrs britling and then he and she met in london and went off together with a fine sense of adventure for a day at richmond and then he took some work with him to her house and stayed there  then she went away into scotland for a time and he wanted her again tremendously and clamoured for her eloquently and then it was apparent and admitted between them that they were admirably in love oh immensely in love  the transitions from emotional mountaineering to ardent intimacies were so rapid and impulsive that each phase obliterated its predecessor and it was only with a vague perplexity that mr britling found himself transferred from the rôle of a mountainous objective for pretty little pilgrims to that of a sedulous lover in pursuit of the happiness of one of the most uncertain intricate and entrancing of feminine personalities this was not at all his idea of the proper relations between men and women but mrs harrowdean had a way of challenging his gallantry she made him run about for her she did not demand but she commanded presents and treats and surprises she even developed a certain jealousy in him his work began to suffer from interruptions yet they had glowing and entertaining moments together that could temper his rebellious thoughts with the threat of irreparable loss one must love and all things in life are imperfect was how mr britling expressed his reasons for submission and she had a hold upon him too in a certain facile pitifulness she was little she could be stung sometimes by the slightest touch and then her blue eyes would be bright with tears  those possible tears could weigh at times even more than those possible lost embraces  and there was oliver  oliver was a person mr britling had never seen he grew into the scheme of things by insensible gradations he was a government official in london he was she said extraordinarily dull he was lacking altogether in mr britlings charm and interest but he was faithful and tender and true and considerably younger than mr britling he asked nothing but to love he offered honourable marriage and when ones heart was swelling unendurably one could weep in safety on his patient shoulder this patient shoulder of olivers ultimately became mr britlings most exasperating rival  she liked to vex him with oliver she liked to vex him generally indeed in this by no means abnormal love affair there was a very strong antagonism she seemed to resent the attraction mr britling had for her and the emotions and pleasure she had with him she seemed under the sway of an instinctive desire to make him play heavily for her in time in emotion in selfrespect it was intolerable to her that he could take her easily and happily that would be taking her cheaply she valued his gifts by the bother they cost him and was determined that the path of true love should not if she could help it run smooth mr britling on the other hand was of the school of polite and happy lovers he thought it outrageous to dispute and contradict and he thought that making love was a cheerful comfortable thing to be done in a state of high good humour and intense mutual appreciation this levity offended the ladys pride she drew unfavourable contrasts with oliver if oliver lacked charm he certainly did not lack emotion he desired sacrifice it seemed almost more than satisfactions oliver was a person of the most exemplary miserableness he would weep copiously and frequently she could always make him weep when she wanted to do so by holding out hopes and then dashing them if by no other expedient why did mr britling never weep she wept  some base streak of competitiveness in mr britlings nature made it seem impossible that he should relinquish the lady to oliver besides then what would he do with his dull days his afternoons his need for a properly demonstrated affection  so mr britling trod the path of his eighth digression rather overworked in the matter of flowers and the selection of small jewellery stalked by the invisible and indefatigable oliver haunted into an unwilling industry of attentionsattentions on the model of the professional lover of the french novelsby the memory and expectation of tearful scenes then you dont love me and its all spoilt ive risked talk and my reputation i was a fool ever to dream of making love beautifully  exactly like running your car into a soft wet ditch when you cannot get out and you cannot get on and your work and your interests waiting and waiting for you  the car itself was an outcome of the affair it was mrs harrowdeans idea she thought chiefly of pleasant expeditions to friendly inns in remote parts of the country inns with a flavour of tacit complicity but it fell in very pleasantly with mr britlings private resentment at the extraordinary inconvenience of the railway communications between matchings easy and her station at pyecrafts which involved a journey to liverpool street and a long wait at a junction and now the car was smashed upjust when he had acquired skill enough to take it over to pyecrafts without shame and on tuesday or wednesday at latest he would have to depart in the old way by the london train  only the most superficial mind would assert nowadays that man is a reasonable creature man is an unreasonable creature and it was entirely unreasonable and human for mr britling during his nocturnal selfreproaches to mix up his secret resentment at his infatuation for mrs harrowdean with his illadvised attack upon the wall of brandismead park he ought never to have bought that car he ought never to have been so ready to meet mrs harrowdean more than halfway  what exacerbated his feeling about mrs harrowdean was a new line she had recently taken with regard to mrs britling from her first rash assumption that mr britling was indifferent to his wife she had come to realise that on the contrary he was in some ways extremely tender about his wife this struck her as an outrageous disloyalty instead of appreciating a paradox she resented an infidelity she smouldered with perplexed resentment for some days and then astonished her lover by a series of dissertations of a hostile and devastating nature upon the lady of the dower house  he tried to imagine he hadnt heard all that he had heard but mrs harrowdean had a nimble pen and nimbler afterthoughts and once her mind had got to work upon the topic she developed her offensive in halfadozen brilliant letters on the other hand she professed a steadily increasing passion for mr britling and to profess passion for mr britling was to put him under a sense of profound obligationbecause indeed he was a modest man he found himself in an emotional quandary  you see if mrs harrowdean had left mrs britling alone everything would have been quite tolerable he considered mrs harrowdean a charming human being and altogether better than he deserved ever so much better she was all initiative and response and that sort of thing and she was so discreet she had her own reputation to think about and one or two of her predecessorsgod rest the ashes of those fireshad not been so discreet yet one could not have this sort of thing going on behind ediths back all sorts of things one might have going on behind ediths back but not this writing and saying of perfectly beastly things about edith nothing could alter the fact that edith was his honour   section 5  throughout the weekend mr britling had kept this trouble well battened down he had written to mrs harrowdean a brief ambiguous note saying i am thinking over all that you have said and after that he had scarcely thought about her at all or at least he had always contrived to be much more vividly thinking about something else but now in these night silences the suppressed trouble burst hatches and rose about him  what a mess he had made of the whole scheme of his emotional life there had been a time when he had started out as gaily with his passions and his honour as he had started out with gladys to go to market saffron he had as little taste for complications as he had for ditches and now his passions and his honour were in a worse case even than poor muddy smashed up gladys as the carthorses towed her off for she at any rate might be repaired but hehe was a terribly patched fabric of explanations now not indeed that he had ever stooped to explanations but there he was far away like a star seen down the length of a tunnel was that first sad story of a love as clean as starlight it had been all over by eightandtwenty and he could find it in his heart to grieve that he had ever given a thought to love again he should have lived a decent widower then edith had come into his life edith that honest and unconscious defaulter and there again he should have stuck to his disappointment he had stuck to itnine days out of every ten its the tenth day its the odd seductive moment its the instant of confident prideand there is your sanguine temperament in the ditch  he began to recapitulate items in the catalogue of his escapades and the details of his automobile misadventures mixed themselves up with the story of his heart steering for example there was that tremendous siddons affair he had been taking the corner of a girlish friendship and he had taken it altogether too far what a frightful mess that had been when once one is off the road anything may happen from a crumpled mudguard to the car on the top of you and there was his forty miles an hour spurt with the great and gifted delphine marquisefor whom he was to have written a play and been a perfect annunzio until willersley appearedvery like the motorcyclistbuzzing in the opposite direction and then had ensued angers humiliations  had every man this sort of crowded catalogue was every fortyfiveyearold memory a dark tunnel receding from the star of youth it is surely a pity that life cannot end at thirty it comes to one clean and in perfect order  is experience worth having  what a clean straight thing the spirit of youth is it is like a bright new spear it is like a finely tempered sword the figure of his boy took possession of his mind his boy who looked out on the world with his mothers dark eyes the slender son of that wholehearted first love he was a being at once fine and simple an intimate mystery must he in his turn get dented and wrinkled and tarnished  the boy was in trouble what was the trouble  was it some form of the same trouble that had so tangled and tainted and scarred the private pride of his father and how was it possible for mr britling disfigured by heedless misadventures embarrassed by complications and concealments to help this honest youngster out of his perplexities he imagined possible forms of these perplexities graceless forms ugly forms such forms as only the nocturnal imagination would have dared present  oh why had he been such a britling why was he still such a britling  mr britling sat up in his bed and beat at the bedclothes with his fists he uttered uncompleted vows from this hour forth  from this hour forth  he must do something he felt at any rate he had his experiences he could warn he could explain away perhaps he might help to extricate if things had got to that pitch  should he write to his son for a time he revolved a long tactful letter in his mind but that was impossible suppose the trouble was something quite different it would have to be a letter in the most general terms   section 6  it was in the doubly refracting nature of mr britlings mind that while he was deploring his inefficiency in regard to his son he was also deploring the ineffectiveness of all his generation of parents quite insensibly his mind passed over to the generalised point of view  in his talks with mr direck mr britling could present england as a great and amiable spectacle of carelessness and relaxation but was it indeed an amiable spectacle the point that mr direck had made about the barn rankled in his thoughts his barn was a barn no longer his farmyard held no cattle he was just living laxly in the buildings that ancient needs had made he was living on the accumulated prosperity of former times the spendthrift heir of toiling generations not only was he a pampered undisciplined sort of human being he was living in a pampered undisciplined sort of community the two things went together this confounded irish business one could laugh at it in the daylight but was it indeed a thing to laugh at we were drifting lazily towards a real disaster we had a government that seemed guided by the principles of mr micawber and adopted for its watchword wait and see for months now this trouble had grown more threatening suppose presently that civil war broke out in ireland suppose presently that these irritated mishandled suffragettes did some desperate irreconcilable thing assassinated for example the bomb in westminster abbey the other day might have killed a dozen people suppose the smouldering criticism of british rule in india and egypt were fanned by administrative indiscretions into a flame  and then suppose germany had made trouble  usually mr britling kept his mind off germany in the daytime he pretended germany meant nothing to england he hated alarmists he hated disagreeable possibilities he declared the idea of a whole vast nation waiting to strike at us incredible why should they you cannot have seventy million lunatics but in the darkness of the night one cannot dismiss things in this way suppose after all their army was more than a parade their navy more than a protest  we might be caughtit was only in the vast melancholia of such occasions that mr britling would admit such possibilities but we might be caught by some sudden declaration of war and how should we face it  he recalled the afternoons talk at claverings and such samples of our governmental machinery as he chanced to number among his personal acquaintance suppose suddenly the enemy struck with raeburn and his friends to defend us or if the shock tumbled them out of power then with these vituperative tories these spiteful advocates of weak tyrannies and privileged pretences in the place of them there was no leadership in england in the lucid darkness he knew that with a terrible certitude he had a horrible vision of things disastrously muffled of lady frensham and her morning post friends first garrulously and maliciously patriotic screaming her way with incalculable mischiefs through the storm and finally discovering that the germans were the real aristocrats and organising our national capitulation on that understanding he knew from talk he had heard that the navy was weak in mines and torpedoes unprovided with the great monitors needed for a war with germany torn by doctrinaire feuds nevertheless the sea power was our only defence in the whole country we might muster a military miscellany of perhaps three hundred thousand men and he had no faith in their equipment in their direction general french the one man who had his entire confidence had been forced to resign through some lawyers misunderstanding about the irish difficulty he did not believe any plans existed for such a war as germany might force upon us any calculation any foresight of the thing at all  why had we no foresight why had we this wilful blindness to disagreeable possibilities why did we lie so open to the unexpected crisis just what he said of himself he said also of his country it was curious to remember that to realise how closely dower house could play the microcosm to the whole empire  it became relevant to the trend of his thoughts that his son had through his mother a strong strain of the dark irish in his composition  how we had wasted ireland the rich values that lay in ireland the gallantry and gifts the possible friendliness all these things were being left to the ulster politicians and the tory women to poison and spoil just as we left india to the traditions of the chattering army women and the repressive instincts of our mandarins we were too lazy we were too negligent we passed our indolent days leaving everything to somebody else was this the incurable british just as it was the incurable britling quality  was the whole prosperity of the british the farflung empire the securities the busy order just their good luck it was a question he had asked a hundred times of his national as of his personal self no doubt luck had favoured him he was prosperous and he was still only at the livelier end of middle age but was there not also a personal factor a meritorious factor luck had favoured the british with a wellplaced island a hardening climate accessible minerals but then too was there not also a national virtue once he had believed in that in a certain gallantry a noble levity an underlying sound sense the last ten years of politics had made him doubt that profoundly he clung to it still but without confidence in the night that dear persuasion left him altogether as for himself he had a certain brightness and liveliness of mind but the year of his fellowship had been a soft year he had got on to the times through something very like a misapprehension and it was the chances of a dinner and a duchess that had given him the opportunity of the kahn show hed dropped into good things that suited him that at any rate was the essence of it and these lucky chances had been no incentive to further effort because things had gone easily and rapidly with him he had developed indolence into a philosophy here he was just over forty and explaining to the world explaining all through the weekend to this americanuntil even god could endure it no longer and the smash stopped himhow excellent was the backwardness of essex and english goasyouplease and how through good temper it made in some mysterious way for all that was desirable a fat english doctrine punch has preached it for forty years  but this wasnt what he had always been he thought of the strenuous intentions of his youth before he had got into this turmoil of amorous experiences while he was still out there with the clean star of youth as hugh was  in those days he had had no amiable doctrine of compromise he had truckled to no domesticated god but talked of the pitiless truth he had tolerated no easygoing pseudoaristocratic social system but dreamt of such a democracy mewing its mighty youth as the world had never seen he had thought that his brains were to do their share in building up this great national imago winged divine out of the clumsy crawling snobbish comfortloving caterpillar of victorian england with such dreams his life had started and the light of them perhaps had helped him to his rapid success and then his wife had died and he had married again and become somehow more interested in his income and then the rather expensive first of the eight experiences had drained off so much of his imaginative energy and the second had drained off so much and there had been quarrels and feuds and the way had been lost and the days had passed he hadnt failed indeed he counted as a success among his generation he alone in the night watches could gauge the quality of that success he was widely known reputably known he prospered much had come oh by a mysterious luck but everything was doomed by his invincible defects beneath that hollow enviable show there ached waste waste waste wastehis heart his imagination his wife his son his countryhis automobile  then there flashed into his mind a last straw of disagreeable realisation  he hadnt as yet insured his automobile he had meant to do so the papers were on his writingdesk   section 7  on these black nights when the personal mr britling would lie awake thinking how unsatisfactorily mr britling was going on and when the impersonal mr britling would be thinking how unsatisfactorily his universe was going on the whole mental process had a likeness to some complex piece of orchestral music wherein the organ deplored the melancholy destinies of the race while the piccolo lamented the secret trouble of mrs harrowdean the big drum thundered at the irish politicians and all the violins bewailed the intellectual laxity of the university system meanwhile the trumpets prophesied wars and disasters the cymbals ever and again inserted a clashing jar about the fatal delay in the automobile insurance while the triangle broke into a plangent solo on the topic of a certain rotten gatepost he always forgot in the daytime and how in consequence the cows from the glebe farm got into the garden and ate mrs britlings carnations  time after time he had promised to see to that gatepost  the organ motif battled its way to complete predominance the lesser themes were drowned or absorbed mr britling returned from the rôle of an incompetent automobilist to the rôle of a soul naked in space and time wrestling with giant questions these cosmic solicitudes it may be are the last penalty of irreligion was huxley right and was all humanity even as mr britling a careless fitful thing playing a tragically hopeless game thinking too slightly moving too quickly against a relentless antagonist  or is the whole thing just witless accidentally cruel perhaps but not malignant or is it wise and merely refusing to pamper us is there somewhere in the immensities some responsive kindliness some faint hope of toleration and assistance something sensibly on our side against death and mechanical cruelty if so it certainly refuses to pamper us but if the whole thing is cruel perhaps also it is witless and willless one cannot imagine the ruler of everything a devilthat would be silly so if at the worst it is inanimate then anyhow we have our poor wills and our poor wits to pit against it and manifestly then the good of life the significance of any life that is not mere receptivity lies in the disciplined and clarified will and the sharpened and tempered mind and what for the last twenty yearsfor all his lectures and writingshad he been doing to marshal the will and harden the mind which were his weapons against the dark he was ready enough to blame othersdons politicians public apathy but what was he himself doing  what was he doing now  lying in bed  his son was drifting to ruin his country was going to the devil the house was a hospital of people wounded by his carelessness the country roads choked with his smashed and uninsured automobiles the cows were probably lined up along the borders and munching ediths carnations at this very moment his pocketbook and bureau were stuffed with venomous insults about herand he was just lying in bed  suddenly mr britling threw back his bedclothes and felt for the matches on his bedside table  indeed this was by no means the first time that his brain had become a whirring torment in his skull previous experiences had led to the most careful provision for exactly such states over the end of the bed hung a light warm pyjama suit of llamawool and at the feet of it were two tall boots of the same material that buckled to the middle of his calf so protected mr britling proceeded to make himself tea a primus stove stood ready inside the fender of his fireplace and on it was a brightly polished brass kettle filled with water a little table carried a teacaddy a teapot a lemon and a glass mr britling lit the stove and then strolled to his desk he was going to write certain plain words about ireland he lit his study lamp and meditated beside it until a sound of water boiling called him to his teamaking  he returned to his desk stirring the lemon in his glass of tea he would write the plain common sense of this irish situation he would put things so plainly that this squabbling folly would have to cease it should be done austerely with a sort of ironical directness there should be no abuse no bitterness only a deep passion of sanity  what is the good of grieving over a smashed automobile  he sipped his tea and made a few notes on his writing pad his face in the light of his shaded reading lamp had lost its distraught expression his hand fingered his familiar fountain pen   section 8  the next morning mr britling came into mr direcks room he was pink from his morning bath he was wearing a cheerful greenandblue silk dressing gown he had shaved already he showed no trace of his nocturnal vigil in the bathroom he had whistled like a bird had a good night he said thats famous so did i and the wrist and arm didnt even ache enough to keep you awake  i thought i heard you talking and walking about said mr direck  i got up for a little bit and worked i often do that i hope i didnt disturb you just for an hour or so its so delightfully quiet in the night  he went to the window and blinked at the garden outside his two younger sons appeared on their bicycles returning from some early expedition he waved a hand of greeting it was one of those summer mornings when attenuated mist seems to fill the very air with sunshine dust  this is the sunniest morning bedroom in the house he said its southeast  the sunlight slashed into the masses of the blue cedar outside with a score of golden spears  the dayspring from on high he said i thought of rather a useful pamphlet in the night  ive been thinking about your luggage at that hotel he went on turning to his guest again youll have to write and get it packed up and sent down here  no he said we wont let you go until you can hit out with that arm and fell a man listen  mr direck could not distinguish any definite sound  the smell of frying rashers i mean said mr britling its the clarion of the morn in every proper english home  youd like a rasher coffee  its good to work in the night and its good to wake in the morning said mr britling rubbing his hands together i suppose i wrote nearly two thousand words so quiet one is so concentrated and as soon as i have had my breakfast i shall go on with it again     chapter the fifth  the coming of the day   section 1  it was quite characteristic of the state of mind of england in the summer of 1914 that mr britling should be mightily concerned about the conflict in ireland and almost deliberately negligent of the possibility of a war with germany  the armament of germany the hostility of germany the consistent assertion of germany the worldwide clash of british and german interests had been facts in the consciousness of englishmen for more than a quarter of a century a whole generation had been born and brought up in the threat of this german war a threat that goes on for too long ceases to have the effect of a threat and this overhanging possibility had become a fixed and scarcely disturbing feature of the british situation it kept the navy sedulous and colonel rendezvous uneasy it stimulated a small and not very influential section of the press to a series of reminders that bored mr britling acutely it was the excuse for an agitation that made national service ridiculous and quite subconsciously it affected his attitude to a hundred things for example it was a factor in his very keen indignation at the tory levity in ireland in his disgust with many things that irritated or estranged indian feeling it bored him there it was a danger and there was no denying it and yet he believed firmly that it was a mine that would never be fired an avalanche that would never fall it was a nuisance a stupidity that kept europe drilling and wasted enormous sums on unavoidable preparations it hung up everything like a noisy argument in a drawingroom but that human weakness and folly would ever let the mine actually explode he did not believe he had been in france in 1911 he had seen how close things had come then to a conflict and the fact that they had not come to a conflict had enormously strengthened his natural disposition to believe that at bottom germany was sane and her militarism a bluff  but the irish difficulty was a different thing there he felt was need for the liveliest exertions a few obstinate people in influential positions were manifestly pushing things to an outrageous point  he wrote through the morningand as the morning progressed the judicial calm of his opening intentions warmed to a certain regrettable vigour of phrasing about our politicians about our political ladies and our handtomouth press  he came down to lunch in a frayed exhausted condition and was much afflicted by a series of questions from herr heinrich for it was an incurable characteristic of herr heinrich that he asked questions the greater part of his conversation took the form of question and answer and his thirst for information was as marked as his belief that german should not simply be spoken but spoken out loud he invariably prefaced his inquiries with the word please and he insisted upon ascribing an omniscience to his employer that it was extremely irksome to justify after a strenuous morning of enthusiastic literary effort he now took the opportunity of a lull in the solicitudes and congratulations that had followed mr direcks appearanceand mr direck was so little shattered by his misadventure that with the assistance of the kindly teddy he had got up and dressed and come down to lunchto put the matter that had been occupying his mind all the morning even to the detriment of the lessons of the masters britling  please he said going a deeper shade of pink and partly turning to mr britling  a look of resignation came into mr britlings eyes yes he said  i do not think it will be wise to take my ticket for the esperanto conference at boulogne because i think it is probable to be war between austria and servia and that russia may make war on austria  that may happen but i think it improbable  if russia makes war on austria germany will make war on russia will she not  not if she is wise said mr britling because that would bring in france  that is why i ask if germany goes to war with france i should have to go to germany to do my service it will be a great inconvenience to me  i dont imagine germany will do anything so frantic as to attack russia that would not only bring in france but ourselves  england  of course we cant afford to see france go under the thing is as plain as daylight so plain that it cannot possibly happen cannot unless germany wants a universal war  thank you said herr heinrich looking obedient rather than reassured  i suppose now said mr direck after a pause that there isnt any strong party in germany that wants a war that young crown prince for example  they keep him in order said mr britling a little irritably they keep him in order  i used to be an alarmist about germany said mr britling but i have come to feel more and more confidence in the sound common sense of the mass of the german population and in the emperor too if it comes to that he isif herr heinrich will permit me to agree with his own german comic paperssometimes a little theatrical sometimes a little egotistical but in his operatic boldly coloured way he means peace i am convinced he means peace   section 2  after lunch mr britling had a brilliant idea for the ease and comfort of mr direck  it seemed as though mr direck would be unable to write any letters until his wrist had mended teddy tried him with a typewriter but mr direck was very awkward with his left hand and then mr britling suddenly remembered a little peculiarity he had which it was possible that mr direck might share unconsciously and that was his gift of lookingglass writing with his left hand mr britling had found out quite by chance in his schoolboy days that while his right hand had been laboriously learning to write his left hand all unsuspected had been picking up the same lesson and that by taking a pencil in his left hand and writing from right to left without watching what he was writing and then examining the scrawl in a mirror he could reproduce his own handwriting in exact reverse about three people out of five have this often quite unsuspected ability he demonstrated his gift and then miss cecily corner who had dropped in in a casual sort of way to ask about mr direck tried it and then mr direck tried it and they could all do it and then teddy brought a sheet of copying carbon and so mr direck by using the carbon reversed under his paper was restored to the world of correspondence again  they sat round a little table under the cedar trees amusing themselves with these experiments and after that cecily and mr britling and the two small boys entertained themselves by drawing pigs with their eyes shut and then mr britling and teddy played hard at badminton until it was time for tea and cecily sat by mr direck and took an interest in his accident and he told her about summer holidays in the adirondacks and how he loved to travel she said she would love to travel he said that so soon as he was better he would go on to paris and then into germany he was extraordinarily curious about this germany and its tremendous militarism hed far rather see it than italy which was he thought just all art and ancient history his turn was for modern problems though of course he didnt intend to leave out italy while he was at it and then their talk was scattered and there was great excitement because herr heinrich had lost his squirrel  he appeared coming out of the house into the sunshine and so distraught that he had forgotten the protection of his hat he was very pink and deeply moved  but what shall i do without him he cried he has gone  the squirrel mr direck gathered had been bought by mrs britling for the boys some month or so ago it had been christened bill and adored and then neglected until herr heinrich took it over it had filled a place in his ample heart that the none too demonstrative affection of the britling household had left empty he abandoned his pursuit of philology almost entirely for the cherishing and adoration of this busy nimble little creature he carried it off to his own room where it ran loose and took the greatest liberties with him and his apartment it was an extraordinarily bold and savage little beast even for a squirrel but herr heinrich had set his heart and his very large and patient will upon the establishment of sentimental relations he believed that ultimately bill would let himself be stroked that he would make bill love him and understand him and that his would be the only hand that bill would ever suffer to touch him in the meanwhile even the untamed bill was wonderful to watch one could watch him forever his front paws were like hands like a musicians hands very long and narrow he would be a musician if he could only make his fingers go apart because when i play my violin he listens he is attentive  the entire household became interested in herr heinrichs attacks upon bills affection they watched his fingers with particular interest because it was upon those that bill vented his failures to respond to the stroking advances  today i have stroked him once and he has bitten me three times herr heinrich reported soon i will stroke him three times and he shall not bite me at all also yesterday he climbed up me and sat on my shoulder and suddenly bit my ear it was not hard he bit but sudden  he does not mean to bite said herr heinrich because when he has bit me he is sorry he is ashamed  you can see he is ashamed  assisted by the two small boys herr heinrich presently got a huge bough of oak and brought it into his room converting the entire apartment into the likeness of an aviary for this said herr heinrich looking grave and diplomatic through his glasses billy will be very grateful and it will give him confidence with me it will make him feel we are in the forest together  mrs britling came to console her husband in the matter  it is not right that the bedroom should be filled with trees all sorts of dust and litter came in with it  if it amuses him said mr britling  but it makes work for the servants  do they complain  no  things will adjust themselves and it is amusing that he should do such a thing  and now billy had disappeared and herr heinrich was on the verge of tears it was so ungrateful of billy without a word  they leave my window open he complained to mr direck often i have askit them not to and of course he did not understand he has out climbit by the ivy anything may have happened to him anything he is not used to going out alone he is too young  perhaps if i call  and suddenly he had gone off round the house crying beelee beelee here is an almond for you an almond beelee  makes me want to get up and help said mr direck its a tragedy  everybody else was helping even the gardener and his boy knocked off work and explored the upper recesses of various possible trees  he is too young said herr heinrich drifting back and then presently if he heard my voice i am sure he would show himself but he does not show himself  it was clear he feared the worst  at supper billy was the sole topic of conversation and condolence was in the air the impression that on the whole he had displayed rather a brutal character was combated by herr heinrich who held that a certain brusqueness was billys only fault and told anecdotes almost sacred anecdotes of the little creatures tenderer nobler side when i feed him always he says thank you said herr heinrich he never fails he betrayed darker thoughts when i went round by the barn there was a cat that sat and looked at me out of a laurel bush he said i do not like cats  mr lawrence carmine who had dropped in was suddenly reminded of that lugubrious old ballad the mistletoe bough and recited large worn fragments of it impressively it tells of how a beautiful girl hid away in a chest during a christmas game of hideandseek and how she was found a dried vestige years afterwards it took a very powerful hold upon herr heinrichs imagination let us now he said make an examination of every box and cupboard and drawer marking each as we go  when mr britling went to bed that night after a long gossip with carmine about the bramo samaj and modern developments of indian thought generally the squirrel was still undiscovered  the worthy modern thinker undressed slowly blew out his candle and got into bed still meditating deeply upon the god of the tagores he thrust his right hand under his pillow according to his usual practice and encountered something soft and warm and active he shot out of bed convulsively lit his candle and lifted his pillow discreetly  he discovered the missing billy looking crumpled and annoyed  for some moments there was a lively struggle before billy was gripped he chattered furiously and bit mr britling twice then mr britling was out in the passage with the wriggling lump of warm fur in his hand and paddling along in the darkness to the door of herr heinrich he opened it softly  a startled white figure sat up in bed sharply  billy said mr britling by way of explanation dropped his capture on the carpet and shut the door on the touching reunion   section 3  a day was to come when mr britling was to go over the history of that sunny july with incredulous minuteness trying to trace the real succession of events that led from the startling crime at sarajevo to europes last swift rush into war in a sense it was untraceable in a sense it was so obvious that he was amazed the whole world had not watched the coming of disaster the plain fact of the case was that there was no direct connection the sarajevo murders were dropped for two whole weeks out of the general consciousness they went out of the papers they ceased to be discussed then they were picked up again and used as an excuse for war germany armed so as to be a threat to all the world weary at last of her mighty vigil watching the course of events decided that her moment had come and snatched the dead archduke out of his grave again to serve her tremendous ambition  it may well have seemed to the belligerent german patriot that all her possible foes were confused divided within themselves at an extremity of distraction and impotence the british isles seemed slipping steadily into civil war threat was met by counterthreat violent fool competed with violent fool for the admiration of the world the national volunteers armed against the ulster men everything moved on with a kind of mechanical precision from parade and meeting towards the fatal gunrunning of howth and the first bloodshed in dublin streets that wretched affray far more than any other single thing must have stiffened germany in the course she had chosen there can be no doubt of it the mischief makers of ireland set the final confirmation upon the european war in england itself there was a summer fever of strikes liverpool was choked by a dockers strike the east anglian agricultural labourers were in revolt and the building trade throughout the country was on the verge of a lockout russia seemed to be in the crisis of a social revolution from baku to st petersburg there were insurrectionary movements in the towns and on the 23rdthe very day of the austrian ultimatumcossacks were storming barbed wire entanglements in the streets of the capital the london stock exchange was in a state of panic disorganisation because of a vast mysterious selling of securities from abroad and france france it seemed was lost to all other consideration in the enthralling confrontations and denunciations of the caillaux murder trial the trial of the wife of her exprime minister for the murder of a blackmailing journalist it was a case full of the vulgarest sexual violence before so piquant a spectacle france it seemed could have no time nor attention for the revelation of m humbert the reporter of the army committee proclaiming that the artillery was short of ammunition that her infantry had boots thirty years old and not enough of those  such were the appearances of things can it be wondered if it seemed to the german mind that the moment for the triumphant assertion of the german predominance in the world had come a day or so before the dublin shooting the murder of sarajevo had been dragged again into the foreground of the worlds affairs by an ultimatum from austria to serbia of the extremest violence from the hour when the ultimatum was discharged the way to armageddon lay wide and unavoidable before the feet of europe after the dublin conflict there was no turning back for a week europe was occupied by proceedings that were little more than the recital of a formula austria could not withdraw her unqualified threats without admitting error and defeat russia could not desert serbia without disgrace germany stood behind austria france was bound to russia by a long confederacy of mutual support and it was impossible for england to witness the destruction of france or the further strengthening of a loud and threatening rival it may be that germany counted on russia giving way to her it may be she counted on the indecisions and feeble perplexities of england both these possibilities were in the reckoning but chiefly she counted on war she counted on war and since no nation in all the world had ever been so fully prepared in every way for war as she was she also counted on victory  one writes germany that is how one writes of nations as though they had single brains and single purposes but indeed while mr britling lay awake and thought of his son and lady frensham and his smashed automobile and mrs harrowdeans trick of abusive letterwriting and of god and evil and a thousand perplexities a multitude of other brains must also have been busy lying also in beds or sitting in studies or watching in guardrooms or chatting belatedly in cafés or smokingrooms or pacing the bridges of battleships or walking along in city or country upon this huge possibility the crime of sarajevo had just opened and of the state of the world in relation to such possibilities few women one guesses heeded what was happening and of the men the men whose decision to launch that implacable threat turned the destinies of the world to war there is no reason to believe that a single one of them had anything approaching the imaginative power needed to understand fully what it was they were doing we have looked for an hour or so into the seething pot of mr britlings brain and marked its multiple strands its inconsistencies its irrational transitions it was but a specimen nearly every brain of the select few that counted in this cardinal determination of the worlds destinies had its streak of personal motive its absurd and petty impulses and deflections one man decided to say this because if he said that he would contradict something he had said and printed four or five days ago another took a certain line because so he saw his best opportunity of putting a rival into a perplexity it would be strange if one could reach out now and recover the states of mind of two such beings as the german kaiser and his eldest son as europe stumbled towards her fate through the long days and warm close nights of that july here was the occasion for which so much of their lives had been but the large pretentious preparation coming right into their hands to use or forgo here was the opportunity that would put them into the very forefront of history forever this journalist emperor with the paralysed arm this commonfibred sly lascivious son it is impossible that they did not dream of glory over all the world of triumphant processions of a worldthrone that would outshine caesars of a godlike elevation of acting divus caesar while yet alive and being what they were they must have imagined spectators and the young man who was after all a young man of particularly poor quality imagined no doubt certain women onlookers certain humiliated and astonished friends and thought of the clothes he would wear and the gestures he would make the nickname his english cousins had given this heir to all the glories was the white rabbit he was the backbone of the war party at court and presently he stole bricàbrac that will help posterity to the proper values of things in 1914 and the teutonic generals and admirals and strategists with their patient and perfect plans who were so confident of victory each within a busy skull must have enacted anticipatory dreams of his personal success and marshalled his willing and unwilling admirers readers of histories and memoirs as most of this class of men are they must have composed little eulogistic descriptions of the part themselves were to play in the opening drama imagined pleasing vindications and interesting documents some of them perhaps saw difficulties but few foresaw failure for all this set of brains the thing came as a choice to take or reject they could make war or prevent it and they chose war  it is doubtful if any one outside the directing intelligence of germany and austria saw anything so plain the initiative was with germany the russian brains and the french brains and the british brains the few that were really coming round to look at this problem squarely had a far less simple set of problems and profounder uncertainties to mr britlings mind the round table conference at buckingham palace was typical of the disunion and indecision that lasted up to the very outbreak of hostilities the solemn violence of sir edward carson was intensely antipathetic to mr britling and in his retrospective inquiries he pictured to himself that dark figure with its dropping underlip seated heavy and obstinate at that discussion still implacable though the king had but just departed after a little speech that was packed with veiled intimations of imminent danger  mr britling had no mercy in his mind for the treason of obstinate egotism and for persistence in a mistaken course his own temperamental weaknesses lay in such different directions he was always ready to leave one trail for another he was always open to conviction trusting to the essentials of his character for an ultimate consistency he hated carson in those days as a scotch terrier might hate a bloodhound as something at once more effective and impressive and exasperatingly infinitely less intelligent   section 4  thusa vivid fact as yet only in a few hundred skulls or sothe vast catastrophe of the great war gathered behind the idle dispersed and confused spectacle of an indifferent world very much as the storms and rains of late september gathered behind the glow and lassitudes of august and with scarcely more of set human intention for the greater part of mankind the european international situation was at most something in the papers no more important than the political disturbances in south africa where the herzogites were curiously uneasy or the possible trouble between turkey and greece the things that really interested people in england during the last months of peace were boxing and the summer sales a brilliant young frenchman carpentier who had knocked out bombardier wells came over again to defeat gunboat smith and did so to the infinite delight of france and the whole latin world amidst the generous applause of anglosaxondom and there was also a british triumph over the americans at polo and a lively and cultured newspaper discussion about a proper motto for the arms of the london county council the trial of madame caillaux filled the papers with animated reports and vivid pictures gregori rasputin was stabbed and became the subject of much lively gossip about the russian court and ulivi the italian impostor who claimed he could explode mines by means of an ultrared ray was exposed and fled with a lady very amusingly for a few days all the work at woolwich arsenal was held up because a certain mr entwhistle having refused to erect a machine on a concrete bed laid down by nonunionists was rather uncivilly dismissed and the irish trouble pounded along its tiresome mischievous way people gave a divided attention to these various topics and went about their individual businesses  and at dower house they went about their businesses mr direcks arm healed rapidly cecily corner and he talked of their objects in life and utopias and the books of mr britling and he got down from a london bookseller baedekers guides for holland and belgium south germany and italy herr heinrich after some doubt sent in his application form and his preliminary deposit for the esperanto conference at boulogne and billy consented to be stroked three times but continued to bite with great vigour and promptitude and the trouble about hugh mr britlings eldest son resolved itself into nothing of any vital importance and settled itself very easily   section 5  after hugh had cleared things up and gone back to london mr britling was inclined to think that such a thing as apprehension was a sin against the general fairness and integrity of life  of all things in the world hugh was the one that could most easily rouse mr britlings unhappy aptitude for distressing imaginations hugh was nearer by far to his heart and nerves than any other creature in the last few years mr britling by the light of a variety of emotional excursions in other directions had been discovering this whatever mr britling discovered he talked about he had evolved from his realisation of this tenderness which was without an effort so much tenderer than all the subtle and tremendous feelings he had attempted in hisexcursions the theory that he had expounded to mr direck that it is only through our children that we are able to achieve disinterested love real love but that left unexplained that far more intimate emotional hold of hugh than of his very jolly little stepbrothers that was a fact into which mr britling rather sedulously wouldnt look  mr britling was probably much franker and more openeyed with himself and the universe than a great number of intelligent people and yet there were quite a number of aspects of his relations with his wife with people about him with his country and god and the nature of things upon which he turned his back with an attentive persistence but a back too resolutely turned may be as indicative as a pointing finger and in this retrogressive way and tacitly even so far as his formal thoughts his unspoken comments went mr britling knew that he loved his son because he had lavished the most hope and the most imagination upon him because he was the one living continuation of that dear life with mary so lovingly stormy at the time so fine now in memory that had really possessed the whole heart of mr britling the boy had been the joy and marvel of the young parents it was incredible to them that there had ever been a creature so delicate and sweet and they brought considerable imagination and humour to the detailed study of his minute personality and to the forecasting of his future mr britlings mind blossomed with wonderful schemes for his education all that mental growth no doubt contributed greatly to mr britlings peculiar affection and with it there interwove still tenderer and subtler elements for the boy had a score of marys traits but there were other things still more conspicuously ignored one silent factor in the slow widening of the breach between edith and mr britling was her cool estimate of her stepson she was steadfastly kind to this shockheaded untidy little dreamer he was extremely well cared for in her hands she liked him and she was amused by himit is difficult to imagine what more mr britling could have expectedbut it was as plain as daylight that she felt that this was not the child she would have cared to have borne it was quite preposterous and perfectly natural that this should seem to mr britling to be unfair to hugh  ediths home was more prosperous than marys she brought her own money to it the bringing up of her children was a far more efficient business than marys instinctive proceedings hugh had very nearly died in his first year of life some summer infection had snatched at him that had tied him to his fathers heart by a knot of fear but no infection had ever come near ediths own nursery and it was hugh that mr britling had seen small and greenfaced and pitiful under an anaesthetic for some necessary small operation to his adenoids his younger children had never stabbed to mr britlings heart with any such pitifulness they were not so thinskinned as their elder brother not so assailable by the little animosities of dust and germ and out of such things as this evolved a shapeless cloud of championship for hugh jealousies and suspicions are latent in every human relationship we go about the affairs of life pretending magnificently that they are not so pretending to the generosities we desire and in all steprelationships jealousy and suspicion are not merely latent they stir  it was mr britlings case for hugh that he was something exceptional something exceptionally good and that the peculiar need there was to take care of him was due to a delicacy of nerve and fibre that was ultimately a virtue the boy was quick quick to hear quick to move very accurate in his swift way he talked unusually soon he began to sketch at an early age with an incurable roughness and a remarkable expressiveness that he was sometimes ungainly often untidy that he would become so mentally preoccupied as to be uncivil to people about him that he caught any malaise that was going was all a part of that the sense of mrs britlings unexpressed criticisms the implied contrasts with the very jolly very uninspired younger family kept up a nervous desire in mr britling for evidences and manifestations of hughs quality not always with happy results it caused much mutual irritation but not enough to prevent the growth of a real response on hughs part to his fathers solicitude the youngster knew and felt that his father was his father just as certainly as he felt that mrs britling was not his mother to his father he brought his successes and to his father he appealed  but he brought his successes more readily than he brought his troubles so far as he himself was concerned he was disposed to take a humorous view of the things that went wrong and didnt come off with him but as a tremendous setdown for the proud parent they resisted humorous treatment  now the trouble that he had been hesitating to bring before his father was concerned with that very grave interest of the young his object in life it had nothing to do with those erotic disturbances that had distressed his fathers imagination whatever was going on below the surface of hughs smiling or thoughtful presence in that respect had still to come to the surface and find expression but he was bothered very much by divergent strands in his own intellectual composition two sets of interests pulled at him oneit will seem a dry interest to many readers but for hugh it glittered and fascinatedwas crystallography and molecular physics the other was caricature both aptitudes sprang no doubt from the same exceptional sensitiveness to form as a schoolboy he exercised both very happily but now he was getting to the age of specialisation and he was fluctuating very much between science and art after a spell of scientific study he would come upon a fatigue period and find nothing in life but absurdities and a lark that one could represent very amusingly after a bout of funny drawings his mind went back to his light and crystals and films like a magdalen repenting in a church after his public school he had refused cambridge and gone to university college london to work under the great and inspiring professor cardinal simultaneously cardinal had been arranging to go to cambridge and hugh had scarcely embarked upon his london work when cardinal was succeeded by the dull conscientious and depressing pelkingham at whose touch crystals became as puddings bubble films like cotton sheets transparency vanished from the world and x rays dwarfed and died and hugh degenerated immediately into a scoffing trifler who wished to give up science for art  he gave up science for art after grave consultation with his father and the real trouble that had been fretting him it seemed was that now he repented and wanted to follow cardinal to cambridge anda year lostgo on with science again he felt it was a discreditable fluctuation he knew it would be a considerable expense and so he took two weeks before he could screw himself up to broaching the matter  so that is all said mr britling immensely relieved  my dear parent you didnt think i had backed a bill or forged a cheque  i thought you might have married a chorus girl or something of that sort said mr britling  or bought a large creamcoloured motorcar for her on the instalment system which shed smashed up no that sort of thing comes later ill just put myself down on the waiting list of one of those bits of delight in the cambridge tobacco shopsand go on with my studies for a year or two   section 6  though mr britlings anxiety about his son was dispelled his mind remained curiously apprehensive throughout july he had a feeling that things were not going well with the world a feeling he tried in vain to dispel by various distractions perhaps some subtler subconscious analysis of the situation was working out probabilities that his conscious self would not face and when presently he bicycled off to mrs harrowdean for flattery amusement and comfort generally he found her by no means the exalting confirmation of everything he wished to believe about himself and the universe that had been her delightful rôle in the early stages of their romantic friendship she maintained her hostility to edith she seemed bent on making things impossible and yet there were one or two phases of the old sustaining intimacies  they walked across her absurd little park to the summerhouse with the view on the afternoon of his arrival and they discussed the irish pamphlet which was now nearly finished  of course she said it will be a wonderful pamphlet  there was a reservation in her voice that made him wait  but i suppose all sorts of people could write an irish pamphlet nobody but you could write the silent places oh why dont you finish that great beautiful thing and leave all this world of reality and newspapers all these crude vulgar quarrelsome jarring things to other people you have the magic gift you might be a poet you can take us out of all these horrid things that are away to beautyland and you are just content to be a critic and a disputer its your surroundings its your sordid realities its that practicality at your elbow you ought never to see a newspaper you ought never to have an american come within ten miles of you you ought to live on bowls of milk drunk in valleys of asphodel  mr britling who liked this sort of thing in a way and yet at the same time felt ridiculously distended and altogether preposterous while it was going on answered feebly and selfconsciously  there was your letter in the nation the other day she said why do you get drawn into arguments i wanted to rush into the nation and pick you up and wipe the anger off you and carry you out of it allinto some quiet beautiful place  but one has to answer these people said mr britling rolling along by the side of her like a full moon beside venus and quite artlessly falling in with the tone of her  she repeated lines from the silent places from memory she threw quite wonderful emotion into her voice she made the words glow and he had only shown her the thing once  was he indeed burying a marvellous gift under the dust of current affairs when at last in the warm evening light they strolled back from the summerhouse to dinner he had definitely promised her that he would take up and finish the silent places and think over the irish pamphlet again before he published it  pyecrafts was like a crystal casket of finer soil withdrawn from the tarred highways of the earth  and yet the very next day this angel enemy of controversies broke out in the most abominable way about edith and he had to tell her more plainly than he had done hitherto that he could not tolerate that sort of thing he wouldnt have edith guyed he wouldnt have edith made to seem base and at that there was much trouble between them and tears and talk of oliver  mr britling found himself unable to get on either with the silent places or the pamphlet and he was very unhappy  afterwards she repented very touchingly and said that if only he would love her she would swallow a thousand ediths he waived a certain disrespect in the idea of her swallowing edith and they had a beautiful reconciliation and talked of exalted things and in the evening he worked quite well upon the silent places and thought of halfadozen quite wonderful lines and in the course of the next day he returned to dower house and mr direck and considerable piles of correspondence and the completion of the irish pamphlet  but he was restless he was more restless in his house than he had ever been he could not understand it everything about him was just as it had always been and yet it was unsatisfactory and it seemed more unstable than anything had ever seemed before he was bored by the solemn development of the irish dispute he was irritated by the smouldering threat of the balkans he was irritated by the suffragettes and by a string of irrational little strikes by the general absence of any main plot as it were to hold all these wranglings and trivialities together at the dower house the most unpleasant thoughts would come to him he even had doubts whether in the silent places he had been plagiarising more or less unconsciously from henry jamess great good place  on the twentyfirst of july gladys came back repaired and looking none the worse for her misadventure next day he drove her very carefully over to pyecrafts hoping to drug his uneasiness with the pretence of a grand passion and the praises of the silent places that beautiful work of art that was so free from any taint of application and alas he found mrs harrowdean in an evil mood he had been away from her for ten daysten whole days no doubt edith had manoeuvred to keep him she hadnt hadnt she how was he poor simple soul to tell that she hadnt that was the prelude to a stormy afternoon  the burthen of mrs harrowdean was that she was wasting her life that she was wasting the poor good patient olivers life that for the sake of friendship she was braving the worst imputations and that he treated her cavalierly came when he wished to do so stayed away heartlessly never thought she needed little treats little attentions little presents did he think she could settle down to her poor work such as it was in neglect and loneliness he forgot women were dear little tender things and had to be made happy and kept happy oliver might not be clever and attractive but he did at least in his clumsy way understand and try and do his duty  towards the end of the second hour of such complaints the spirit of mr britling rose in revolt he lifted up his voice against her he charged his voice with indignant sorrow and declared that he had come over to pyecrafts with no thought in his mind but sweet and loving thoughts that he had but waited for gladys to be ready before he came that he had brought over the manuscript of the silent places with him to polish and finish up that for days and days he had been longing to do this in the atmosphere of the dear old summerhouse with its distant view of the dear old sea and that now all that was impossible that mrs harrowdean had made it impossible and that indeed she was rapidly making everything impossible  and having delivered himself of this judgment mr britling a little surprised at the rapid vigour of his anger once he had let it loose came suddenly to an end of his words made a renunciatory gesture with his arms and as if struck with the idea rushed out of her room and out of the house to where gladys stood waiting he got into her and started her up and after some trouble with the gear due to the violence of his emotion he turned her round and departed with hercrushing the corner of a small bed of snapdragon as he turnedand dove her with a sulky sedulousness back to the dower house and newspapers and correspondence and irritations and that gnawing and irrational sense of a hollow and aimless quality in the world that he had hoped mrs harrowdean would assuage and the further he went from mrs harrowdean the harsher and unjuster it seemed to him that he had been to her  but he went on because he did not see how he could very well go back   section 7  mr direcks broken wrist healed sooner than he desired from the first he had protested that it was the sort of thing that one can carry about in a sling that he was quite capable of travelling about and taking care of himself in hotels that he was only staying on at matchings easy because he just loved to stay on and wallow in mrs britlings kindness and mr britlings company while as a matter of fact he wallowed as much as he could in the freshness and friendliness of miss cecily corner and for more than a third of this period mr britling was away from home altogether  mr direck it should be clear by this time was a man of more than european simplicity and directness and his intentions towards the young lady were as simple and direct and altogether honest as such intentions can be it is the american conception of gallantry more than any other peoples to let the lady call the tune in these affairs the mans place is to be protective propitiatory accommodating and clever and the ladys to be difficult but delightful until he catches her and houses her splendidly and gives her a surprising lot of pocketmoney and goes about his business and upon these assumptions mr direck went to work but quite early it was manifest to him that cecily did not recognise his assumptions she was embarrassed when he got down one or two little presents of chocolates and flowers for her from londonthe britling boys were much more appreciativeshe wouldnt let him contrive costly little expeditions for her and she protested against compliments and declared she would stay away when he paid them and she was not contented by his general sentiments about life but asked the most direct questions about his occupation and his activities his chief occupation was being the well provided heir of a capable lawyer and his activities in the light of her inquiries struck him as being light and a trifle amateurish qualities he had never felt as any drawback about them before so that he had to rely rather upon aspirations and the possibility under proper inspiration of a more actively serviceable life in future  theres a feeling in the states he said that weve had rather a tendency to overdo work and that there is scope for a leisure class to develop the refinement and the wider meanings of life  but a leisure class doesnt mean a class that does nothing said cecily it only means a class that isnt busy in business  youre too hard on me said mr direck with that quiet smile of his  and then by way of putting her on the defensive he asked her what she thought a man in his position ought to do  something she said and in the expansion of this vague demand they touched on a number of things she said that she was a socialist and there was still in mr direcks composition a streak of the oldfashioned american prejudice against the word he associated socialists with anarchists and deported aliens it was manifest too that she was deeply read in the essays and dissertations of mr britling she thought everybody man or woman ought to be chiefly engaged in doing something definite for the world at large theres my secretaryship of the massachusetts modern thought society anyhow said mr direck and she herself wanted to be doing somethingit was just because she did not know what it was she ought to be doing that she was reading so extensively and voraciously she wanted to lose herself in something deep in the being of mr direck was the conviction that what she ought to be doing was making love in a rapturously egotistical manner and enjoying every scrap of her own delightful self and her own delightful vitalitywhile she had it but for the purposes of their conversation he did not care to put it any more definitely than to say that he thought we owed it to ourselves to develop our personalities upon which she joined issue with great vigour  that is just what mr britling says about you in his american impressions she said he says that america overdoes the development of personalities altogether that whatever else is wrong about america that is where america is most clearly wrong i read that this morning and directly i read it i thought yes thats exactly it mr direck is overdoing the development of personalities  me  yes i like talking to you and i dont like talking to you and i see now it is because you keep on talking of my personality and your personality that makes me uncomfortable its like having some one following me about with a limelight and in a sort of way i do like it i like it and im flattered by it and then i go off and dislike it dislike the effect of it i find myself trying to be what you have told me i amsort of acting myself i want to glance at lookingglasses to see if i am keeping it up its just exactly what mr britling says in his book about american women they act themselves he says they get a kind of story and explanation about themselves and they are always trying to make it perfectly plain and clear to every one well when you do that you cant think nicely of other things  we like a clear light on people said mr direck  we dont i suppose were shadier said cecily  youre certainly much more in halftones said mr direck and i confess its the halftones get hold of me but still you havent told me miss cissie what you think i ought to do with myself here i am you see very much at your disposal what sort of business do you think its my duty to go in for  thats for some one with more experience than i have to tell you you should ask mr britling  id rather have it from you  i dont even know for myself she said  so why shouldnt we start to find out together he asked  it was her tantalising habit to ignore all such tentatives  one cant help the feeling that one is in the world for something more than oneself she said   section 8  soon mr direck could measure the time that was left to him at the dower house no longer by days but by hours his luggage was mostly packed his tickets to rotterdam cologne munich dresden vienna were all in order and things were still very indefinite between him and cecily but god has not made americans cleanshaven and firmfeatured for nothing and he determined that matters must be brought to some sort of definition before he embarked upon travels that were rapidly losing their attractiveness in this concentration of his attention  a considerable nervousness betrayed itself in his voice and manner when at last he carried out his determination  theres just a lil thing he said to her taking advantage of a moment when they were together after lunch that id value now more than anything else in the world  she answered by a lifted eyebrow and a glance that had not so much inquiry in it as she intended  if we could just take a lil walk together for a bit round by claverings park and all that see the deer again and the old trees sort of scenery id like to remember when im away from it  he was a little short of breath and there was a quite disproportionate gravity about her moment for consideration  yes she said with a cheerful acquiescence that came a couple of bars too late lets it will be jolly  these fine english afternoons are wonderful afternoons he remarked after a moment or so of silence not quite the splendid blaze we get in our summer butsort of glowing  its been very fine all the time youve been here she said  after which exchanges they went along the lane into the road by the park fencing and so to the little gate that lets one into the park without another word  the idea took hold of mr direcks mind that until they got through the park gate it would be quite out of order to say anything the lane and the road and the stile and the gate were all so much preliminary stuff to be got through before one could get to business but after the little white gate the way was clear the park opened out and one could get ahead without bothering about the steering and mr direck had he felt been diplomatically involved in lanes and byways long enough  well he said as he rejoined her after very carefully closing the gate what i really wanted was an opportunity of just mentioning something that happens to be of interest to youif it does happen to interest you i suppose id better put the thing as simply as possible practically im just right over the head and all in love with you i thought id like to tell you  immense silences  of course i wont pretend there havent been others mr direck suddenly resumed there have one particularly but i can assure you ive never felt the depth and height or anything like the sort of quiet clear conviction and now im just telling you these things miss corner i dont know whether it will interest you if i tell you that youre really and truly the very first love i ever had as well as my last ive had sent overi got it only yesterdaythis lil photograph of a miniature portrait of one of my ancestors relationsa corner just as you are its here  he had considerable difficulties with his pockets and papers cecily mute and flushed and inconvenienced by a preposterous and unaccountable impulse to weep took the picture he handed her  when i was a lil fellow of fifteen said mr direck in the tone of one producing a melancholy but conclusive piece of evidence i worshipped that miniature it seemed to methe loveliest person andits just you  he too was preposterously moved  it seemed a long time before cecily had anything to say and then what she had to say she said in a softened indistinct voice youre very kind she said and kept hold of the little photograph  they had halted for the photograph now they walked on again  i thought id like to tell you said mr direck and became tremendously silent  cecily found him incredibly difficult to answer she tried to make herself light and offhand and to be very frank with him  of course she said i knewi felt somehowyou meant to say something of this sort to mewhen you asked me to come with you  well he said  and ive been trying to make my poor brain think of something to say to you  she paused and contemplated her difficulties  couldnt you perhaps say something of the same kindsuch as ive been trying to say said mr direck presently with a note of earnest helpfulness id be very glad if you could  not exactly said cecily more careful than ever  meaning  i think you know that you are the best of friends i think you are oha perfect dear  wellthats all rightso far  that is as far  you dont know whether you love me thats what you mean to say  no i feel somehow it isnt that yet  theres nobody else by any chance  no cecily weighed things you neednt trouble about that  only  only you dont know  cecily made a movement of assent  its no good pretending i havent thought about you she said  well anyhow ive done my best to give you the idea said mr direck i seem now to have been doing that pretty nearly all the time  only what should we do  mr direck felt this question was singularly artless whywed marry he said and all that sort of thing  letty has marriedand all that sort of thing said cecily fixing her eye on him very firmly because she was colouring brightly and it doesnt leave letty very muchforrader  well now they have a good time dont they id have thought they have a lovely time  theyve had a lovely time and teddy is the dearest husband and they have a sweet little house and a most amusing baby and they play hockey every sunday and teddy does his work and every week is like every other week it is just heavenly just always the same heavenly every sunday there is a fresh week of heavenly beginning and this you see isnt heaven it is earth and they dont know it but they are getting bored i have been watching them and they are getting dreadfully bored its heartbreaking to watch because they are almost my dearest people teddy used to be making perpetual jokes about the house and the baby and his work and letty and nowhes made all the possible jokes its only now and then he gets a fresh one its like spring flowers and thensummer and letty sits about and doesnt sing they want something new to happen and theres mr and mrs britling they love each other much more than mrs britling dreams or mr britling for the matter of that once upon a time things were heavenly for them too i suppose until suddenly it began to happen to them that nothing new ever happened  well said mr direck people can travel  but that isnt real happening said cecily  it keeps one interested  but real happening is doing something  you come back to that said mr direck i never met any one before whod quite got that spirit as you have it i wouldnt alter it its part of you its part of this place its what mr britling always seems to be saying and never quite knowing hes said it its just as though all the things that are going on werent the things that ought to be going onbut something else quite different somehow one falls into it its as if your daily life didnt matter as if politics didnt matter as if the king and the social round and business and all those things werent anything really and as though you felt there was something elseout of sightround the cornerthat you ought to be getting at well i admit thats got hold of me too and its all mixed up with my idea of you i dont see that theres really a contradiction in it at all im in love with you all my hearts in love with you whats the good of being shy about it id just die for your littlest wish right here now its just as though id got love in my veins instead of blood but thats not taking me away from that other thing its bringing me round to that other thing i feel as if without you i wasnt up to anything at all but with youwed not go settling down in a cottage or just touring about with a baedeker guide or anything of that kind not for long anyhow wed naturally settle down side by side and do   but what should we do asked cecily  there came a hiatus in their talk  mr direck took a deep breath  you see that old felled tree there i was sitting on it the day before yesterday and thinking of you will you come there and sit with me on it when you sit on it you get a view oh a perfectly lovely english view just a bit of the house and those clumps of trees and the valley away there with the lily pond id love to have you in my memory of it  they sat down and mr direck opened his case he was shy and clumsy about opening it because he had been thinking dreadfully hard about it and he hated to seem heavy or profound or anything but artless and spontaneous to cecily and he felt even when he did open his case that the effect of it was platitudinous and disappointing yet when he had thought it out it had seemed very profound and altogether living  you see one doesnt want to use terms that have been used in a thousand different senses in any way that isnt a perfectly unambiguous sense and at the same time one doesnt want to seem to be canting about things or pitching anything a note or two higher than it ought legitimately to go but it seems to me that this sort of something that mr britling is always asking for in his essays and writings and things and what you are looking for just as much and which seems so important to you that even love itself is a secondary kind of thing until you can square the two together is nothing more nor less than religioni dont mean this religion or that religion but just religion itself a big solemn comprehensive idea that holds you and me and all the world together in one great grand universal scheme and though it isnt quite the sort of idea of lovemaking thats been popularwell in places like carriervillefor some time its the right idea its got to be followed out if we dont want lovemaking to be a sort of idle troublesome game of treats and flatteries that is sure as anything to lead right away to disappointments and foolishness and unfaithfulness andjust hell what you are driving at according to my interpretation is that marriage has got to be a religious marriage or else you are splitting up life that religion and love are most of life and all the power there is in it and that they cant afford to be harnessed in two different directions i never had these ideas until i came here and met you but they come up now in my mind as though they had always been there and thats why you dont want to marry in a hurry and thats why im glad almost that you dont want to marry in a hurry  he considered thats why ill have to go on to germany and just let both of us turn things over in our minds  yes said cecily weighing his speech i think that is it i think that i do want a religious marriage and that what is wrong with teddy and letty is that they arent religious they pretend they are religious somewhere out of sight and round the corner only  he considered her gravely  what is religion she asked  here again there was a considerable pause  very nearly twothirds of the papers read before our massachusetts society since my connection with it have dealt with that very question mr direck began and one of our most influential members was able to secure the services of a very able and highly trained young woman from michigan university to make a digest of all these representative utterances we are having it printed in a thoroughly artistic mariner as the club book for our autumn season the drift of her results is that religion isnt the same thing as religions that most religions are old and that religion is always new well putting it simply religion is the perpetual rediscovery of that great thing out there what the great thing is goes by all sorts of names but if you know its there and if you remember its there youve got religion thats about how she figured it out i shall send you the book as soon as a copy comes over to me i cant profess to put it as clearly as she puts it shes got a real analytical mind but its one of the most suggestive lil books ive ever seen it just takes hold of you and makes you think  he paused and regarded the ground before himthoughtfully  life said cecily has either got to be religious or else it goes to pieces perhaps anyhow it goes to pieces  mr direck endorsed these observations by a slow nodding of the head  he allowed a certain interval to elapse then a vaguely apprehended purpose that had been for a time forgotten in these higher interests came back to him he took it up with a breathless sense of temerity  well he said then you dont hate me  she smiled  you dont dislike me or despise me  she was still reassuring  you dont think im just a slow american sort of portent  no  you think on the whole i might evensomeday  she tried to meet his eyes with a pleasant frankness and perhaps she was franker than she meant to be  look here said mr direck with a little quiver of emotion softening his mouth ill ask you something weve got to wait until you feel clearer still could you bring yourself if just oncei could kiss you  im going away to germany he went on to her silence but i shant be giving so much attention to germany as i supposed i should when i planned it out but somehowif i feltthat id kissed you  with a delusive effect of calmness the young lady looked first over her left shoulder and then over her right and surveyed the park about them then she stood up we can go that way home she said with a movement of her head through the little covert  mr direck stood up too  if i was a poet or a bird said mr direck i should sing but being just a plain american citizen all i can do is just to talk about all id do if i wasnt  and when they had reached the little covert with its pathway of soft moss and its sheltering screen of interlacing branches he broke the silence by saying well whats wrong with right here and now and cecily stood up to him as straight as a spear with gifts in her clear eyes he took her soft cool face between his trembling hands and kissed her sweet halfparted lips when he kissed her she shivered and he held her tighter and would have kissed her again but she broke away from him and he did not press her and muter than ever pondering deeply and secretly trembling in the queerest way these two outwardly sedate young people returned to the dower house  and after tea the taxicab from the junction came for him and he vanished and was last seen as a waving hat receding along the top of the dogrose hedge that ran beyond the hockey field towards the village  he will see germany long before i shall said herr heinrich with a gust of nostalgia i wish almost i had not agreed to go to boulogne  and for some days miss cecily corner was a very grave and dignified young woman indeed pondering   section 9  after the departure of mr direck things international began to move forward with great rapidity it was exactly as if his american deliberation had hitherto kept things waiting before his postcard from rotterdam reached the dower house austria had sent an ultimatum to serbia and before cecily had got the letter he wrote her from cologne a letter in that curiously unformed handwriting the stenographer and the typewriter are making an american characteristic russia was mobilising and the vast prospect of a european war had opened like the rolling up of a curtain on which the interests of the former week had been but a trivial embroidery so insistent was this reality that revealed itself that even the shooting of the dublin people after the gunrunning of howth was dwarfed to unimportance the mind of mr britling came round from its restless wanderings to a more and more intent contemplation of the hurrying stormclouds that swept out of nothingness to blacken all his sky he watched it he watched amazed and incredulous he watched this contradiction of all his reiterated confessions of faith in german sanity and pacifism he watched it with all that was impersonal in his being and meanwhile his personal life ran in a continually deeper and narrower channel as his intelligence was withdrawn from it  never had the double refraction of his mind been more clearly defined on the one hand the britling of the disinterested intelligence saw the habitual peace of the world vanish as the daylight vanishes when a shutter falls over the window of a cell and on the other the britling of the private life saw all the pleasant comfort of his relations with mrs harrowdean disappearing in a perplexing irrational quarrel he did not want to lose mrs harrowdean he contemplated their breach with a profound and profoundly selfish dismay it seemed the wanton termination of an arrangement of which he was only beginning to perceive the extreme and irreplaceable satisfactoriness  it wasnt that he was in love with her he knew almost as clearly as though he had told himself as much that he was not but then on the other hand it was equally manifest in its subdued and ignored way that as a matter of fact she was hardly more in love with him what constituted the satisfactoriness of the whole affair was its essential unlovingness and friendly want of emotion it left their minds free to play with all the terms and methods of love without distress she could summon tears and delights as one summons servants and he could act his part as lover with no sense of lost control they supplied in each others lives a longfelt wantif only that is she could control her curious aptitude for jealousy and the sexual impulse to vex there he felt she broke the convention of their relations and brought in serious realities and this little rift it was that had widened to a now considerable breach he knew that in every sane moment she dreaded and wished to heal that breach as much as he did but the deep simplicities of the instincts they had tacitly agreed to bridge over washed the piers of their reconciliation away  and unless they could restore the bridge things would end and mr britling felt that the ending of things would involve for him the most extraordinary exasperation she would go to oliver for comfort she would marry oliver and he knew her well enough to be sure that she would thrust her matrimonial happiness with oliver unsparingly upon his attention while he on the other hand being provided with no corresponding olivette would be left a sort of emotional celibate with his slack times and his afternoons and his general need for flattery and amusement dreadfully upon his own hands he would be tormented by jealousy in which caseand here he came to veritieshis work would suffer it wouldnt grip him while all these vague demands she satisfied fermented unassuaged  and after the fashion of our still too adolescent world mr britling and mrs harrowdean proceeded to negotiate these extremely unromantic matters in the phrases of that simple honest and youthful passionateness which is still the only language available and at times mr britling came very near persuading himself that he had something of the passionate love for her that he had once had for his mary and that the possible loss of her had nothing to do with the convenience of pyecrafts or any discretion in the world though indeed the only thing in the whole plexus of emotional possibility that still kept anything of its youthful freshness in his mind was the very strong objection indeed he felt to handing her over to anybody else in the world and in addition he had just a touch of fatherly feeling that a younger man would not have had and it made him feel very anxious to prevent her making a fool of herself by marrying a man out of spite he felt that since an obstinate lover is apt to be an exacting husband in the end the heavy predominance of oliver might wring much sincerer tears from her than she had ever shed for himself but that generosity was but the bright edge to a mainly possessive jealousy  it was mr britling who reopened the correspondence by writing a little apology for the corner of the small snapdragon bed and this evoked an admirably touching reply he replied quite naturally with assurances and declarations but before she got his second letter her mood had changed she decided that if he had really and truly been lovingly sorry instead of just writing a note to her he would have rushed over to her in a wild dramatic state of mind and begged forgiveness on his knees she wrote therefore a second letter to this effect crossing his second one and her literary gift getting the better of her she expanded her thesis into a general denunciation of his habitual offhandedness with her to an abandonment of all hope of ever being happy with him to a decision to end the matter once for all and after a decent interval of dignified regrets to summon oliver to the reward of his patience and goodness the european situation was now at a pitch to get upon mr britlings nerves and he replied with a letter intended to be conciliatory but which degenerated into earnest reproaches for her unreasonableness meanwhile she had received his second and tenderly eloquent letter it moved her deeply and having now cleared her mind of much that had kept it simmering uncomfortably she replied with a sweetly loving epistle from this point their correspondence had a kind of double quality being intermittently angry and loving her third letter was tender and it was tenderly answered in his fourth but in the interim she had received his third and answered it with considerable acerbity to which his fifth was a retort just missing her generous and conclusive fifth she replied to his fifth on a saturday eveningit was that eventful saturday saturday the first of august 1914by a telegram oliver was abroad in holland engaged in a muchneeded emotional rest and she wired to mr britling have wired for oliver he will come to me do not trouble to answer this  she was astonished to get no reply for two days she got no reply for two days because remarkable things were happening to the telegraph wires of england just then and her message in the hands of a boy scout on a bicycle reached mr britlings house only on monday afternoon he was then at claverings discussing the invasion of belgium that made britains participation in the war inevitable and he did not open the little redbrown envelope until about halfpast six he failed to mark the date and hours upon it but he perceived that it was essentially a challenge he was expected he saw to go over at once with his renovated gladys and end this unfortunate clash forever in one striking and passionate scene his mind was now so full of the war that he found this the most colourless and unattractive of obligations but he felt bound by the mysterious code of honour of the illicit love affair to play his part he postponed his departure until after supperthere was no reason why he should be afraid of motoring by moonlight if he went carefullybecause hugh came in with cissie demanding a game of hockey hockey offered a nervous refreshment a scampering forgetfulness of the tremendous disaster of this war he had always believed impossible that nothing else could do and he was very glad indeed of the irruption   section 10  for days the broader side of mr britlings mind as distinguished from its egotistical edge had been reflecting more and more vividly and coherently the spectacle of civilisation casting aside the thousand dispersed activities of peace clutching its weapons and setting its teeth for a supreme struggle against militarist imperialism from the point of view of matchings easy that colossal crystallising of accumulated antagonisms was for a time no more than a confusion of headlines and a rearrangement of columns in the white windows of the newspapers through which those who lived in the securities of england looked out upon the world it was a display in the sphere of thought and print immeasurably remote from the real green turf on which one walked from the voice and the churchbells of mr dimple that sounded their ample caresses in ones ears from the clashing of the stags who were beginning to knock the velvet from their horns in the park or the clatter of the butchers cart and the respectful greeting of the butcher boy down the lane it was the spectacle of the world less real even to most imaginations than the world of novels or plays people talked of these things always with an underlying feeling that they romanced and intellectualised  on thursday july 23rd the austrohungarian minister at belgrade presented his impossible ultimatum to the serbian government and demanded a reply within fortyeight hours with the wisdom of retrospect we know now clearly enough what that meant the sarajevo crime was to be resuscitated and made an excuse for war but nine hundred and ninetynine europeans out of a thousand had still no suspicion of what was happening to them the ultimatum figured prominently in the morning papers that came to matchings easy on friday but it by no means dominated the rest of the news sir edward carsons rejection of the government proposals for ulster was given the pride of place and almost equally conspicuous with the serbian news were the caillaux trial and the storming of the st petersburg barricades by cossacks herr heinrichs questions at lunch time received reassuring replies  on saturday sir edward carson was still in the central limelight russia had intervened and demanded more time for serbia and the daily chronicle declared the day a critical one for europe dublin with bayonet charges and bullets thrust serbia into a corner on monday no shots had yet been fired in the east and the mischief in ireland that germany had counted on was well ahead sir edward grey was said to be working hard for peace  its the cry of wolf said mr britling to herr heinrich  but at last there did come a wolf said herr heinrich i wish i had not sent my first moneys to that conference upon esperanto i feel sure it will be put off  see said teddy very cheerfully to herr heinrich on tuesday and held up the paper in which the bloodshed in dublin had squeezed the war cloud lifting into a quite subordinate position  what did we tell you said mrs britling nobody wants a european war  but wednesdays paper vindicated his fears germany had commanded russia not to mobilise  of course russia will mobilise said herr heinrich  or else forever after hold her peace said teddy  and then germany will mobilise said herr heinrich and all my holiday will vanish i shall have to go and mobilise too i shall have to fight i have my papers  i never thought of you as a soldier before said teddy  i have deferred my service until i have done my thesis said herr heinrich now all that will bepiff and my thesis threequarters finished  that is serious said teddy  verdammte dummheit said herr heinrich why do they do such things  on thursday the 30th of july caillaux carson strikes and all the common topics of life had been swept out of the front page of the paper altogether the stock exchanges were in a state of wild perturbation and food prices were leaping fantastically austria was bombarding belgrade contrary to the rules of war hitherto accepted russia was mobilising mr asquith was he declared not relaxing his efforts to do everything possible to circumscribe the area of possible conflict and the vienna conference of peace societies was postponed i do not see why a conflict between russia and austria should involve western europe said mr britling our concern is only for belgium and france  but herr heinrich knew better no he said it is the war it has come i have heard it talked about in germany many times but i have never believed that it was obliged to come ach it considers no one so long as esperanto is disregarded all these things must be  friday brought photographs of the mobilisation in vienna and the news that belgrade was burning young men in straw hats very like english or french or belgian young men in straw hats were shown parading the streets of vienna carrying flags and banners portentously blowing trumpets or waving hats and shouting saturday saw all europe mobilising and herr heinrich upon teddys bicycle in wild pursuit of evening papers at the junction mobilisation and the emotions of herr heinrich now became the central facts of the dower house situation the two younger britlings mobilised with great vigour upon the playroom floor the elder had one hundred and ninety toy soldiers with a considerable equipment of guns and wagons the younger had a force of a hundred and twentythree not counting three railway porters with trucks complete a policeman five civilians and two ladies also they made a number of british and german flags out of paper but as neither would allow his troops to be any existing foreign army they agreed to be redland and blueland according to the colour of their prevailing uniforms meanwhile herr heinrich confessed almost promiscuously the complication of his distresses by a hitherto unexpected emotional interest in the daughter of the village publican she was a placid receptive young woman named maud hickson on whom the young man had it seemed imposed the more poetical name of marguerite  often we have spoken together oh yes often he assured mrs britling and now it must all end she loves flowers she loves birds she is most sweet and innocent i have taught her many words in german and several times i have tried to draw her in pencil and now i must go away and never see her any more  his implicit appeal to the whole literature of teutonic romanticism disarmed mrs britlings objection that he had no business whatever to know the young woman at all  also cried herr heinrich facing another aspect of his distresses how am i to pack my things since i have been here i have bought many things many books and two pairs of white flannel trousers and some shirts and a tin instrument that i cannot work for developing privately kodak films all this must go into my little portmanteau and it will not go into my little portmanteau  and there is billy who will now go on with the education of billy  the hands of fate paused not for herr heinrichs embarrassments and distresses he fretted from his room downstairs and back to his room he went out upon mysterious and futile errands towards the village inn he prowled about the garden his head and face grew pinker and pinker his eyes were flushed and distressed everybody sought to say and do kind and reassuring things to him  ach he said to teddy you are a civilian you live in a free country it is not your war you can be amused at it  but then teddy was amused at everything  something but very dimly apprehended at matchings easy something methodical and compelling away in london seemed to be fumbling and feeling after herr heinrich and herr heinrich it appeared was responding sundays post brought the decision  i have to go he said i must go right up to london today to an address in bloomsbury then they will tell me how to go to germany i must pack and i must get the taxicab from the junction and i must go why are there no trains on the branch line on sundays for me to go by it  at lunch he talked politics i am entirely opposed to the war he said i am entirely opposed to any war  then why go asked mr britling stay here with us we all like you stay here and do not answer your mobilisation summons  but then i shall lose all my country i shall lose my papers i shall be outcast i must go  i suppose a man should go with his own country mr britling reflected  if there was only one language in all the world none of such things would happen herr heinrich declared there would be no english no germans no russians  just esperantists said teddy  or idoists said herr heinrich i am not convinced of which in some ways ido is much better  perhaps there would have to be a war between ido and esperanto to settle it said teddy  who shall we play skat with when you have gone asked mrs britling  all this morning said herr heinrich expanding in the warmth of sympathy i have been trying to pack and i have been unable to pack my mind is too greatly disordered i have been told not to bring much luggage mrs britling please  mrs britling became attentive  if i could leave much of my luggage my clothes some of them and particularly my violin it would be much more to my convenience i do not care to be mobilised with my violin there may be much crowding then i would but just take my rucksack  if you will leave your things packed up  and afterwards they could be sent  but he did not leave them packed up the taxicab to order which he had gone to the junction in the morning on teddys complaisant machine came presently to carry him off and the whole family and the first contingent of the usual hockey players gathered about it to see him off the elder boy of the two juniors put a distended rucksack upon the seat herr heinrich then shook hands with every one  write and tell us how you get on cried mrs britling  but if england also makes war  write to reynoldslet me give you his address he is my agent in new york said mr britling and wrote it down  well come to the village corner with you herr heinrich cried the boys  no said herr heinrich sitting down into the automobile i will part with you altogether it is too much  auf wiedersehen cried mr britling remember whatever happens there will be peace at last  then why not at the beginning herr heinrich demanded with a reasonable exasperation and repeated his maturer verdict on the whole european situation verdammte bummelei  go said mr britling to the taxi driver  auf wiedersehen herr heinrich  auf wiedersehen  goodbye herr heinrich  good luck herr heinrich  the taxi started with a whir and herr heinrich passed out of the gates and along the same hungry road that had so recently consumed mr direck give him a last sendoff cried teddy one two three auf wiedersehen  the voices gruff and shrill sounded raggedly together the dogrose hedge cut off the sight of the little face then the pink head bobbed up again he was standing up and waving the panama hat careless of sunstroke  then herr heinrich had gone altogether  well said mr britling turning away  i do hope they wont hurt him said a visitor  oh they wont put a youngster like that in the fighting line said mr britling hes had no training yet and he has to wear glasses how can he shoot theyll make a clerk of him  he hasnt packed at all said mrs britling to her husband just come up for an instant and peep at his room itstouching  it was touching  it was more than touching in its minute absurd way it was symbolical and prophetic it was the miniature of one small life uprooted  the door stood wide open as he had left it open careless of all the little jealousies and privacies of occupation and ownership even the windows were wide open as though he had needed air he who had always so sedulously shut his windows since first he came to england across the empty fireplace stretched the great bough of oak he had brought in for billy but now its twigs and leaves had wilted and many had broken off and fallen on the floor billys cage stood empty upon a little table in the corner of the room instead of packing the young man had evidently paced up and down in a state of emotional elaboration the bed was disordered as though he had several times flung himself upon it and his books had been thrown about the room despairfully he had made some little commencements of packing in a borrowed cardboard box the violin lay as if it lay in state upon the chest of drawers the drawers were all partially open and in the middle of the floor sprawled a pitiful shirt of blue dropped there the most flattened and brokenhearted of garments the fireplace contained an unsuccessful pencil sketch of a girls face torn across  husband and wife regarded the abandoned room in silence for a time and when mr britling spoke he lowered his voice  i dont see billy he said  perhaps he has gone out of the window said mrs britling also in a hushed undertone  well said mr britling abruptly and loudly turning away from this first intimation of coming desolations let us go down to our hockey he had to go you know and billy will probably come back again when he begins to feel hungry   section 11  monday was a public holiday the first monday in august and the day consecrated by longestablished custom to the matchings easy flower show in claverings park the day was to live in mr britlings memory with a harsh brightness like the brightness of that sunshine one sees at times at the edge of a thunderstorm there were tents with the exhibits and a tent for popular refreshments there was a gorgeous gold and yellow steam roundabout with motorcars and horses and another in green and silver with wonderfully undulating ostriches and lions and each had an organ that went by steam there were cocoanut shies and many ingenious prizegiving shooting and dartthrowing and ringthrowing stalls each displaying a marvellous array of crockery clocks metal ornaments and suchlike rewards there was a race of gas balloons each with a postcard attached to it begging the finder to say where it descended and you could get a balloon for a shilling and have a chance of winning various impressive and embarrassing prizes if your balloon went far enoughfish carvers a silverhandled walkingstick a bogoak gramophonerecord cabinet and things like that and by a special gate one could go for sixpence into the claverings gardens and the sixpence would be doubled by lady homartyn and devoted next winter to the matchings easy coal club and mr britling went through all the shows with his boys and finally left them with a shilling each and his blessing and paid his sixpence for the gardens and made his way as he had promised to have tea with lady homartyn  the morning papers had arrived late and he had been reading them and rereading them and musing over them intermittently until his family had insisted upon his coming out to the festivities they said that if for no other reason he must come to witness aunt wilshires extraordinary skill at the cocoanut shy she could beat everybody well one must not miss a thing like that the headlines proclaimed the great powers at war france invaded by germany germany invaded by russia 100000 germans march into luxemburg can england abstain fifty million loan to be issued and germany had not only violated the treaty of london but she had seized a british ship in the kiel canal the roundabouts were very busy and windily melodious and the shooting gallery kept popping and jingling as people shot and broke bottles and the voices of the young men and women inviting the crowd to try their luck at this and that rang loud and clear teddy and letty and cissie and hugh were developing a quite disconcerting skill at the dartthrowing and were bent upon compiling a complete teaset for the teddy cottage out of their winnings there was a score of automobiles and a number of traps and gigs about the entrance to the portion of the park that had been railed off for the festival the small britling boys had met some nursery visitors from claverings house and were busy displaying skill and calm upon the roundabout ostriches and less than four hundred miles away with a front that reached from nancy to liège more than a million and a quarter of greyclad men the greatest and bestequipped host the world had ever seen were pouring westward to take paris grip and paralyse france seize the channel ports invade england and make the german empire the masterstate of the earth their equipment was a marvel of foresight and scientific organisation from the motor kitchens that rumbled in their wake to the telescopic sights of the sharpshooters the innumerable machineguns of the infantry the supply of entrenching material the preparations already made in the invaded country  lets try at the other place for the sugarbasin said teddy hurrying past dont get two sugarbasins said cissie breathless in pursuit hugh is trying for a sugarbasin at the other place  then mr britling heard a bellicose note  lets have a go at the bottles said a cheerful young farmer ought to keep up our shooting these warlike times  mr britling ran against hickson from the village inn and learnt that he was disturbed about his son being called up as a reservist just when he was settling down here it seems a pity they couldnt leave him for a bit  tis a noosence said hickson but anyhow they give first prize to his radishes hell be glad to hear they give first prize to his radishes do you think sir theres very much probability of this war it do seem to be beginning like  it looks more like beginning than it has ever done said mr britling its a foolish business  i suppose if they start in on us we got to hit back at them said mr hickson postmanhes got his papers too  mr britling made his way through the drifting throng towards the little wicket that led into the gardens  he was swung round suddenly by a loud bang  it was the gun proclaiming the start of the balloon race  he stood for some moments watching the scene the balloon start had gathered a little crowd of people village girls in white gloves and cheerful hats young men in bright ties and readymade sunday suits fathers and mothers boy scouts children clerks in straw hats bicyclists and miscellaneous folk over their heads rose mr cheshunt the factotum of the estate he was standing on a table and handing the little balloons up into the air one by one they floated up from his hand like manycoloured grapes some rising and falling some soaring steadily upward some spinning and eddying drifting eastward before the gentle breeze a string of bubbles against the sky and the big trees that bounded the park farther away to the right were the striped canvas tents of the flowershow still farther off the roundabouts churned out their music the shooting galleries popped and the swing boats creaked through the air cut off from these things by a line of fencing lay the open park in which the deer grouped themselves under the great trees and regarded the festival mistrustfully teddy and hugh appeared breaking away from the balloon race cluster and hurrying back to their dartthrowing a man outside a little tent that stood apart was putting up a bravelooking notice unstinted teas one shilling the teddy perambulator was moored against the cocoanut shy and aunt wilshire was still displaying her terrible prowess at the cocoanuts already she had won twentyseven strange children had been impressed by her to carry them and formed her retinue a wonderful old lady was aunt wilshire  then across all the sunshine of this artless festival there appeared as if it were writing showing through a picture france invaded by germany germany invaded by russia  mr britling turned again towards the wicket with its collectors of tribute that led into the gardens   section 12  the claverings gardens and particularly the great rockery the lily pond and the herbaceous borders were unusually populous with unaccustomed visitors and shy young couples mr britling had to go to the house for instructions and guided by the underbutler found lady homartyn hiding away in the walled dutch garden behind the dairy she had been giving away the prizes of the flowershow and she was resting in a deck chair while a spinster relation presided over the tea mrs britling had fled the outer festival earlier and was sitting by the teathings lady meade and two or three visitors had motored out from hartleytree to assist and manning had come in with his tremendous confirmation of all that the morning papers had foreshadowed  have you any news asked mr britling  its war said mrs britling  they are in luxemburg said manning that can only mean that they are coming through belgium  then i was wrong said mr britling and the world is altogether mad and so there is nothing else for us to do but win why could they not leave belgium alone  its been in all their plans for the last twenty years said manning  but it brings us in for certain  i believe they have reckoned on that  well mr britling took his tea and sat down and for a time he said nothing  it is three against three said one of the visitors trying to count the powers engaged  italy said manning will almost certainly refuse to fight in fact italy is friendly to us she is bound to be this is to begin with an austrian war and japan will fight for us  i think said old lady meade that this is the suicide of germany they cannot possibly fight against russia and france and ourselves why have they ever begun it  it may be a longer and more difficult war than people suppose said manning the germans reckon they are going to win  against us all  against us all they are tremendously prepared  it is impossible that germany should win said mr britling breaking his silence against her germany has something more than armies all reason all instinctthe three greatest peoples in the world  at present very badly supplied with war material  that may delay things it may make the task harder but it will not alter the end of course we are going to win nothing else is thinkable i have never believed they meant it but i see now they meant it this insolent arming and marching this forty years of national blustering sooner or later it had to topple over into action  he paused and found they were listening and he was carried on by his own thoughts into further speech  this isnt the sort of war he said that is settled by counting guns and rifles something that has oppressed us all has become intolerable and has to be ended and it will be ended i dont know what soldiers and politicians think of our prospects but i do know what ordinary reasonable men think of the business i know that all we millions of reasonable civilised onlookers are prepared to spend our last shillings and give all our lives now rather than see germany unbeaten i know that the same thing is felt in america and that given half a chance given just one extra shake of that foolish mailed fist in the face of america and america also will be in this war by our side italy will come in she is bound to come in france will fight like one man im quite prepared to believe that the germans have countless rifles and guns have got the most perfect maps spies plans you can imagine im quite prepared to hear that they have got a thousand tremendous surprises in equipment up their sleeves im quite prepared for sweeping victories for them and appalling disasters for us those are the first things what i do know is that the germans understand nothing of the spirit of man that they do not dream for a moment of the devil of resentment this war will arouse didnt we all trust them not to let off their guns wasnt that the essence of our liberal and pacific faith and here they are in the heart of europe letting off their guns  and such a lot of guns said manning  then you think it will be a long war mr britling said lady meade  long or short it will end in the downfall of germany but i do not believe it will be long i do not agree with manning even now i cannot believe that a whole great people can be possessed by war madness i think the war is the work of the german armaments party and of the court party they have forced this war on germany wellthey must win and go on winning so long as they win germany will hold together so long as their armies are not clearly defeated nor their navy destroyed but once check them and stay them and beat them then i believe that suddenly the spirit of germany will change even as it changed after jena  willie nixon said one of the visitors who came back from hamburg yesterday says they are convinced they will have taken paris and st petersburg and one or two other little places and practically settled everything for us by about christmas  and london  i forgot if he said london but i suppose a london more or less hardly matters they dont think we shall dare come in but if we do they will zeppelin the fleet and walk through our armyif you can call it an army  manning nodded confirmation  they do not understand said mr britling  sir george padish told me the same sort of thing said lady homartyn he was in berlin in june  of course the efficiency of their preparations is almost incredible said another of lady meades party  they have thought out and got ready for everythingliterally everything   section 13  mr britling had been a little surprised by the speech he had made he hadnt realised before he began to talk how angry and scornful he was at this final coming into action of the teutonic militarism that had so long menaced his world he had always said it would never really fightand here it was fighting he was furious with the indignation of an apologist betrayed he had only realised the strength and passion of his own belligerent opinions as he had heard them and as he walked back with his wife through the village to the dower house he was still in the swirl of this selfdiscovery he was darkly silent devising fiercely denunciatory phrases against krupp and kaiser krupp and kaiser he grasped that obvious convenient alliteration it is all that is bad in mediævalism allied to all that is bad in modernity he told himself  the world he said startling mrs britling with his sudden speech will be intolerable to live in it will be unendurable for a decent human being unless we win this war  we must smash or be smashed  his brain was so busy with such stuff that for a time he stared at mrs harrowdeans belated telegram without grasping the meaning of a word of it he realised slowly that it was incumbent upon him to go over to her but he postponed his departure very readily in order to play hockey besides which it would be a full moon and he felt that summer moonlight was far better than sunset and dinner time for the declarations he was expected to make and then he went on phrasemaking again about germany until he had actually bullied off at hockey  suddenly in the midst of the game he had an amazing thought it came to him like a physical twinge  what the devil are we doing at this hockey he asked abruptly of teddy who was coming up to bully after a goal we ought to be drilling or shooting against those infernal germans  teddy looked at him questioningly  oh come on said mr britling with a gust of impatience and snapped the sticks together   section 14  mr britling started for his moonlight ride about halfpast nine that night he announced that he could neither rest nor work the war had thrown him into a fever the driving of the automobile was just the distraction he needed he might not he added casually return for a day or so when he felt he could work again he would come back he filled up his petrol tank by the light of an electric torch and sat in his car in the garage and studied his map of the district his thoughts wandered from the road to pyecrafts to the coast and to the possible route of a raider suppose the enemy anticipated a declaration of war here he might come and here  he roused himself from these speculations to the business in hand  the evening seemed as light as day a cool moonshine filled the world the road was silver that flushed to pink at the approach of mr britlings headlight the dark turf at the wayside and the bushes on the bank became for a moment an acid green as the glare passed the full moon was climbing up the sky and so bright that scarcely a star was visible in the blue grey of the heavens houses gleamed white a mile away and ever and again a moth would flutter and hang in the light of the lamps and then vanish again in the night  gladys was in excellent condition for a run and so was mr britling he went neither fast nor slow and with a quite unfamiliar confidence life which had seemed all day a congested confusion darkened by threats became cool mysterious and aloof and with a quality of dignified reassurance  he steered along the narrow road by the black dogrose hedge and so into the high road towards the village the village was alight at several windows but almost deserted out beyond a coruscation of lights burnt like a group of topaz and rubies set in the silver shield of the night the festivities of the flower show were still in full progress and the reduction of the entrance fee after seven had drawn in every lingering outsider the roundabouts churned out their relentless music and the bottleshooting galleries popped and crashed the wellpatronised ostriches and motorcars flickered round in a pulsing rhythm black black black before the naphtha flares  mr britling pulled up at the side of the road and sat for a little while watching the silhouettes move hither and thither from shadow to shadow across the bright spaces  on the very brink of waron the brink of armageddon he whispered at last do they understand do any of us understand  he slipped in his gear to starting and was presently running quietly with his engine purring almost inaudibly along the level road to hartleytree the sounds behind him grew smaller and smaller and died away leaving an immense unruffled quiet under the moon there seemed no motion but his own no sound but the neat subdued mechanical rhythm in front of his feet presently he ran out into the main road and heedless of the lane that turned away towards pyecrafts drove on smoothly towards the east and the sea never before had he driven by night he had expected a fumbling and tedious journey he found he had come into an undreamtof silvery splendour of motion for it seemed as though even the automobile was running on moonlight that night pyecrafts could wait indeed the later he got to pyecrafts the more moving and romantic the little comedy of reconciliation would be and he was in no hurry for that comedy he felt he wanted to apprehend this vast summer calm about him that alone of all the things of the day seemed to convey anything whatever of the majestic tragedy that was happening to mankind as one slipped through this still vigil one could imagine for the first time the millions away there marching the wide river valleys villages cities mountainranges ports and seas inaudibly busy  even now he said the battleships may be fighting  he listened but the sound was only the low intermittent drumming of his cylinders as he ran with his throttle nearly closed down a stretch of gentle hill  he felt that he must see the sea he would follow the road beyond the rodwell villages and then turn up to the crest of eastonbury hill and thither he went and saw in the gap of the low hills beyond a vshaped level of moonlit water that glittered and yet lay still he stopped his car by the roadside and sat for a long time looking at this and musing and once it seemed to him three little shapes like short black needles passed in line ahead across the molten silver  but that may have been just the straining of the eyes  all sorts of talk had come to mr britlings ears about the navies of england and france and germany there had been public disputes of experts much whispering and discussion in private we had the heavier vessels the bigger guns but it was not certain that we had the preeminence in science and invention were they relying as we were relying on dreadnoughts or had they their secrets and surprises for us tonight perhaps the great ships were steaming to conflict  tonight all over the world ships must be in flight and ships pursuing ten thousand towns must be ringing with the immediate excitement of war  only a year ago mr britling had been lunching on a battleship and looking over its intricate machinery it had seemed to him then that there could be no better human stuff in the world than the quiet sunburnt disciplined men and officers he had met and our little army too must be gathering tonight the little army that had been chastened and reborn in south africa that he was convinced was individually more gallant and selfreliant and capable than any other army in the world he would have sneered or protested if he had heard another englishman say that but in his heart he held the dear belief  and what other aviators in the world could fly as the frenchmen and englishmen he had met once or twice at eastchurch and salisbury could fly these are things of race and national quality let the german cling to his gasbags we shall beat them in the air he whispered we shall beat them on the seas surely we shall beat them on the seas if we have men enough and guns enough we shall beat them on land yetfor years they have been preparing  there was little room in the heart of mr britling that night for any love but the love of england he loved england now as a nation of men there could be no easy victory good for us with our too easy natures that there could be no easy victory but victory we must have nowor perish  he roused himself with a sigh restarted his engine and went on to find some turning place he still had a colourless impression that the journeys end was pyecrafts  we must all do the thing we can he thought and for a time the course of his automobile along a winding downhill road held his attention so that he could not get beyond it he turned about and ran up over the hill again and down long slopes inland running very softly and smoothly with his lights devouring the road ahead and sweeping the banks and hedges beside him and as he came down a little hill through a village he heard a confused clatter and jingle of traffic ahead and saw the danger triangle that warns of crossroads he slowed down and then pulled up abruptly  riding across the gap between the cottages was a string of horsemen and then a grey cart and then a team drawing a heavy objecta gun and then more horsemen and then a second gun it was all a dim brown procession in the moonlight a mounted officer came up beside him and looked at him and then went back to the crossroads but as yet england was not troubling about spies four more guns passed and then a string of carts and more mounted men sitting stiffly nobody was singing or shouting scarcely a word was audible and through all the column there was an effect of quiet efficient haste and so they passed and rumbled and jingled and clattered out of the scene leaving mr britling in his car in the dreaming village he restarted his engine once more and went his way thoughtfully  he went so thoughtfully that presently he missed the road to pyecraftsif ever he had been on the road to pyecrafts at allaltogether he found himself upon a highway running across a flattish plain and presently discovered by the sight of the great bear faint but traceable in the blue overhead that he was going due north well presently he would turn south and west that in good time now he wanted to feel he wanted to think how could he best help england in the vast struggle for which the empty silence and beauty of this night seemed to be waiting but indeed he was not thinking at all but feeling feeling wonder as he had never felt it since his youth had passed from him this war might end nearly everything in the world as he had known the world that idea struggled slowly through the moonlight into consciousness and won its way to dominance in his mind  the character of the road changed the hedges fell away the pine trees and pine woods took the place of the black squat shapes of the hawthorn and oak and apple the houses grew rarer and the world emptier and emptier until he could have believed that he was the only man awake and outofdoors in all the slumbering land  for a time a little thing caught hold of his dreaming mind continually as he ran on black silent birds rose startled out of the dust of the road before him and fluttered noiselessly beyond his double wedge of light what sort of bird could they be were they nightjars were they different kinds of birds snatching at the quiet of the night for a dust bath in the sand this little independent thread of inquiry ran through the texture of his mind and died away  and at one place there was a great bolting of rabbits across the road almost under his wheels  the phrases he had used that afternoon at claverings came back presently into his head they were he felt assured the phrases that had to be said now this war could be seen as the noblest of wars as the crowning struggle of mankind against national dominance and national aggression or else it was a mere struggle of nationalities and pure destruction and catastrophe its enormous significances he felt must not be lost in any petty bickering about the minor issues of the conflict but were these enormous significances being stated clearly enough were they being understood by the mass of liberal and pacific thinkers he drove more and more slowly as these questions crowded upon his attention until at last he came to a stop altogether certain things must be said clearly he whispered certain thingsthe meaning of england the deep and longunspoken desire for kindliness and fairness now is the time for speaking it must be put as straight now as her gunfire as honestly as the steering of her ships  phrases and paragraphs began to shape themselves in his mind as he sat with one arm on his steeringwheel  suddenly he roused himself turned over the map in the mapcase beside him and tried to find his position  so far as he could judge he had strayed right into suffolk  about one oclock in the morning he found himself in newmarket newmarket too was a moonlit emptiness but as he hesitated at the crossroads he became aware of a policeman standing quite stiff and still at the corner by the church  matchings easy he cried  that road sir until you come to market saffron and then to the left  mr britling had a definite purpose now in his mind and he drove faster but still very carefully and surely he was already within a mile or so of market saffron before he remembered that he had made a kind of appointment with himself at pyecrafts he stared at two conflicting purposes he turned over certain possibilities  at the market saffron crossroads he slowed down and for a moment he hung undecided  oliver he said and as he spoke he threw over his steeringwheel towards the homeward way he finished his sentence when he had negotiated the corner safely oliver must have her  and then perhaps fifty yards farther along and this time almost indignantly she ought to have married him long ago  he put his automobile in the garage and then went round under the black shadow of his cedars to the front door he had no key and for a long time he failed to rouse his wife by flinging pebbles and gravel at her halfopen window but at last he heard her stirring and called out to her  he explained he had returned because he wanted to write he wanted indeed to write quite urgently he went straight up to his room lit his readinglamp made himself some tea and changed into his nocturnal suit daylight found him still writing very earnestly at his pamphlet the title he had chosen was and now war ends   section 15  in this fashion it was that the great war began in europe and came to one man in matchings easy as it came to countless intelligent men in countless pleasant homes that had scarcely heeded its coming through all the years of its relentless preparation the familiar scenery of life was drawn aside and war stood unveiled i am the fact said war and i stand astride the path of life i am the threat of death and extinction that has always walked beside life since life began there can be nothing else and nothing more in human life until you have reckoned with me       book ii  matchings easy at war     chapter the first  onlookers   section 1  on that eventful night of the first shots and the first deaths mr britling did not sleep until daylight had come he sat writing at this pamphlet of his which was to hail the last explosion and the ending of war for a couple of hours he wrote with energy and then his energy flagged there came intervals when he sat still and did not write he yawned and yawned again and rubbed his eyes the day had come and the birds were noisy when he undressed slowly dropping his clothes anyhow upon the floor and got into bed  he woke to find his morning tea beside him and the housemaid going out of the room he knew that something stupendous had happened to the world but for a few moments he could not remember what it was then he remembered that france was invaded by germany and germany by russia and that almost certainly england was going to war it seemed a harsh and terrible fact in the morning light a demand for stresses a certainty of destruction it appeared now robbed of all the dark and dignified beauty of the night he remembered just the same feeling of unpleasant anxious expectation as he now felt when the boer war had begun fifteen years ago before the first news came the first news of the boer war had been the wrecking of a british armoured train near kimberley what similar story might not the overdue paper tell when presently it came  suppose for instance that some important division of our fleet had been surprised and overwhelmed  suppose the germans were already crumpling up the french armies between verdun and belfort very swiftly and dreadfully  suppose after all that the cabinet was hesitating and that there would be no war for some weeks but only a wrangle about belgian neutrality while the germans smashed france  or on the other hand there might be some amazing prompt success on our part our army and navy people were narrow but in their narrow way he believed they were extraordinarily good  what would the irish do  his thoughts were no more than a thorny jungle of unanswerable questions through which he struggled in unprogressive circles  he got out of bed and dressed in a slow distraught manner when he reached his braces he discontinued dressing for a time he opened the atlas at northern france and stood musing over the belgian border then he turned to whitakers almanack to browse upon the statistics of the great european armies he was roused from this by the breakfast gong  at breakfast there was no talk of anything but war hugh was as excited as a cat in thundery weather and the small boys wanted information about flags the russian and the serbian flag were in dispute and the flag page of websters dictionary had to be consulted newspapers and letters were both abnormally late and mr britling tiring of supplying trivial information to his offspring smoked cigarettes in the garden he had an idea of intercepting the postman his eyes and ears informed him of the approach of mrs fabers automobile it was an old resolutelooking machine painted red and driven by a trusted gardener there was no mistaking it  mrs faber was in it and she stopped it outside the gate and made signals mrs britling attracted by the catastrophic sounds of mrs fabers vehicle came out by the front door and she and her husband both converged upon the caller   section 2  i wont come in cried mrs faber but i thought id tell you ive been getting food  food  provisions theres going to be a run on provisions look at my flitch of bacon  but  faber says we have to lay in what we can this warits going to stop everything we cant tell what will happen ive got the children to consider so here i am i was at hicksons before nine  the little lady was very flushed and brighteyed her fair hair was disordered her hat a trifle askew she had an air of enjoying unwonted excitements all the golds being hoarded too she said with a crow of delight in her voice faber says that probably our cheques wont be worth that in a few days he rushed off to london to get gold at his clubswhile he can i had to insist on hickson taking a cheque never i said will i deal with you againneverunless you do even then he looked at me almost as if he thought he wouldnt  its famine she said turning to mr britling ive laid hands on all i can ive got the children to consider  but why is it famine asked mr britling  oh it is she said  but why  faber understands she said of course its famine  and would you believe me she went on going back to mrs britling that man hickson stood behind his counterwhere ive dealt with him for years and refused absolutely to let me have more than a dozen tins of sardines refused point blank  i was there before nine and even then hicksons shop was crowdedcrowded my dear  what have you got said mr britling with an inquiring movement towards the automobile  she had got quite a lot she had two sides of bacon a case of sugar bags of rice eggs a lot of flour  what are all these little packets said mr britling  mrs faber looked slightly abashed  cerebos salt she said one gets carried away a little i just got hold of it and carried it out to the car i thought we might have to salt things later  and the jars are pickles said mr britling  yes but look at all my flour thats what will go first  the lady was a little flurried by mr britlings too detailed examination of her haul what good is blacking he asked she would not hear him she felt he was trying to spoil her morning she declared she must get on back to her home dont say i didnt warn you she said ive got no end of things to do theres peas i want to show cook how to bottle our peas for this yearits lucky weve got no end of peas i came by here just for the sake of telling you and with that she presently departedobviously ruffled by mrs britlings lethargy and mr britlings scepticism  mr britling watched her go off with a slowly rising indignation  and that he said is how england is going to war scrambling for foodat the very beginning  i suppose she is anxious for the children said mrs britling  blacking  after all said mr britling if other people are doing that sort of thing  thats the idea of all panics weve got not to do it the country hasnt even declared war yet hallo here we are better late than never  the head of the postman bearing newspapers and letters appeared gliding along the top of the hedge as he cycled down the road towards the dower house corner   section 3  england was not yet at war but all the stars were marching to that end it was as if an event so vast must needs take its time to happen no doubt was left upon mr britlings mind though a wholepage advertisement in the daily news in enormous type and of mysterious origin implored great britain not to play into the hands of russia russia the terrible that bugbear of the sentimental radicals the news was wide and sweeping and rather inaccurate the germans were said to be in belgium and holland and they had seized english ships in the kiel canal a moratorium had been proclaimed and the reports of a food panic showed mrs faber to be merely one example of a large class of excitable people  mr britling found the food panic disconcerting it did not harmonise with his leading motif of the free people of the world rising against the intolerable burthen of militarism it spoilt his picture  mrs britling shared the paper with mr britling they stood by the bed of begonias near the cedar tree and read and the air was full of the cheerful activities of the lawnmower that was being drawn by a carefully booted horse across the hockey field  presently hugh came flitting out of the house to hear what had happened one cant work somehow with all these big things going on he apologised he secured the daily news while his father and mother read the times the voices of the younger boys came from the shade of the trees they had brought all their toy soldiers out of doors and were making entrenched camps in the garden  the financial situation is an extraordinary one said mr britling concentrating his attention all sorts of staggering things may happen in a social and economic system that has grown just anyhow never been planned in a world full of mrs fabers  moratorium said hugh over his daily news in relation to debts and so on modern side you sent me to daddy i live at hand to mouth in etymology mors and crematoriumdo we burn our bills instead of paying them  moratorium reflected mr britling moratorium what nonsense you talk its something that delays of course nothing to do with death just a temporary stoppage of payments of course theres bound to be a tremendous change in values   section 4  theres bound to be a tremendous change in values  on that text mr britlings mind enlarged very rapidly it produced a wonderful crop of possibilities before he got back to his study he sat down to his desk but he did not immediately take up his work he had discovered something so revolutionary in his personal affairs that even the war issue remained for a time in suspense  tucked away in the back of mr britlings consciousness was something that had not always been there something warm and comforting that made life and his general thoughts about life much easier and pleasanter than they would otherwise have been the sense of a neatly arranged investment list a shrewdly and geographically distributed system of holdings in national loans municipal investments railway debentures that had amounted altogether to rather over fiveandtwenty thousand pounds his and mrs britlings a joint accumulation this was so to speak his economic viscera it sustained him and kept him going and comfortable when all was well he did not feel its existence he had merely a pleasant sense of general wellbeing when here or there a security got a little disarranged he felt a vague discomfort now he became aware of grave disorders it was as if he discovered he had been accidentally eating toadstools and didnt quite know whether they werent a highly poisonous sort but an analogy may be carried too far  at any rate when mr britling got back to his writingdesk he was much too disturbed to resume and now war ends  theres bound to be a tremendous change in values  he had never felt quite so sure as most people about the stability of the modern financial system he did not he felt understand the working of this moratorium or the peculiar advantage of prolonging the bank holidays it meant he supposed a stoppage of payment all round and a cutting off of the supply of ready money and hickson the grocer according to mrs faber was already looking askance at cheques  even if the bank did reopen mr britling was aware that his current balance was low at the utmost it amounted to twenty or thirty pounds he had been expecting cheques from his english and american publishers and the usual times cheque suppose these payments were intercepted  all these people might so far as he could understand stop payment under this moratorium that hadnt at first occurred to him but of course quite probably they might refuse to pay his account when it fell due  and suppose the times felt his peculiar vein of thoughtfulness unnecessary in these stirring days  and then if the bank really did lock up his deposit account and his securities became unsaleable  mr britling felt like an oyster that is invited to leave its shell  he sat back from his desk contemplating these things his imagination made a weak attempt to picture a world in which credit has vanished and money is of doubtful value he supposed a large number of people would just go on buying and selling at or near the old prices by force of habit  his mind and conscience made a valiant attempt to pick up and now war ends and go on with it but before five minutes were out he was back at the thoughts of food panic and bankruptcy   section 5  the conflict of interests at mr britlings desk became unendurable he felt he must settle the personal question first he wandered out upon the lawn and smoked cigarettes  his first conception of a great convergent movement of the nations to make a world peace and an end to militant germany was being obscured by this second entirely incompatible vision of a world confused and disorganised mrs fabers in great multitudes hoarding provisions riotous crowds attacking shops moratorium shut banks and waiting queues was it possible for the whole system to break down through a shock to its confidence without any sense of incongruity the dignified pacification of the planet had given place in his mind to these more intimate possibilities he heard a rustle behind him and turned to face his wife  do you think she asked that there is any chance of a shortage of food  if all the mrs fabers in the world run and grab  then every one must grab i havent much in the way of stores in the house  hm said mr britling and reflected i dont think we must buy stores now  but if we are short  its the chances of war said mr britling  he reflected those who join a panic make a panic after all there is just as much food in the world as there was last month and short of burning it the only way of getting rid of it is to eat it and the harvests are good why begin a scramble at a groaning board  but people are scrambling it would be awkwardwith the children and everythingif we ran short  we shant and anyhow you mustnt begin hoarding even if it means hardship  yes but you wont like it if suddenly theres no sugar for your tea  mr britling ignored this personal application  what is far more serious than a food shortage is the possibility of a money panic  he paced the lawn with her and talked he said that even now very few people realised the flimsiness of the credit system by which the modern world was sustained it was a huge growth of confidence due very largely to the uninquiring indolence ofeverybody it was sound so long as mankind did on the whole believe in it give only a sufficient loss of faith and it might suffer any sort of collapse it might vanish altogetheras the credit system vanished at the breaking up of italy by the gothsand leave us nothing but tangible things real property possession nine points of the law and that sort of thing did she remember that last novel of gissingsveranilda it was called it was a picture of the world when there was no wealth at all except what one could carry hidden or guarded about with one that sort of thing came to the roman empire slowly in the course of lifetimes but nowadays we lived in a rapider worldwith flimsier institutions nobody knew the strength or the weakness of credit nobody knew whether even the present shock might not send it smashing down and then all the little life we had lived so far would roll away  mrs britling he noted glanced ever and again at her sunlit housethere were new sunblinds and she had been happy in her choice of a colourand listened with a sceptical expression to this disquisition  a few days ago said mr britling trying to make things concrete for her you and i together were worth fiveandtwenty thousand pounds now we dont know what we are worth whether we have lost a thousand or ten thousand  he examined his sovereign purse and announced he had six pounds what have you  she had about eighteen pounds in the house  we may have to get along with that for an indefinite time  but the bank will open again presently she said and people about here trust us  suppose they dont  she did not trouble about the hypothesis and our investments will recover they always do recover  everything may recover he admitted but also nothing may recover all this life of ours which has seemed so settled and secureisnt secure i have felt that we were fixed here and rootedfor all our lives suppose presently things sweep us out of it its a possibility we may have to face i feel this morning as if two enormous gates had opened in our lives like the gates that give upon an arena gates giving on a darknessthrough which anything might come even death suppose suddenly we were to see one of those great zeppelins in the air or hear the thunder of guns away towards the coast and if a messenger came upon a bicycle telling us to leave everything and go inland  i see no reason why one should go out to meet things like that  but there is no reason why one should not envisage them  the curious thing said mr britling pursuing his examination of the matter is that looking at these things as one does now as things quite possible they are not nearly so terrifying and devastating to the mind as they would have seemedlast week i believe i should load you all into gladys and start off westward with a kind of exhilaration  she looked at him as if she would speak and said nothing she suspected him of hating his home and affecting to care for it out of politeness to her  perhaps mankind tries too much to settle down perhaps these stirrings up have to occur to save us from our disposition to stuffy comfort theres the magic call of the unknown experience of dangers and hardships one wants to go but unless some push comes one does not go there is a spell that keeps one to the lair and the old familiar ways now i am afraidand at the same time i feel that the spell is broken the magic prison is suddenly all doors you may call this ruin bankruptcy invasion flight they are doors out of habit and routine i have been doing nothing for so long except idle things and discursive things  i thought that you managed to be happy here you have done a lot of work  writing is recording not living but now i feel suddenly that we are living intensely it is as if the whole quality of life was changing there are such times there are times when the spirit of life changes altogether the old world knew that better than we do it made a distinction between weekdays and sabbaths and between feasts and fasts and days of devotion that is just what has happened now weekday rules must be put aside beforeoh three days ago competition was fair it was fair and tolerable to get the best food one could and hold on to ones own but that isnt right now war makes a sabbath and we shut the shops the banks are shut and the world still feels as though sunday was keeping on  he saw his own way clear  the scale has altered it does not matter now in the least if we are ruined it does not matter in the least if we have to live upon potatoes and run into debt for our rent these now are the most incidental of things a week ago they would have been of the first importance here we are face to face with the greatest catastrophe and the greatest opportunity in history we have to plunge through catastrophe to opportunity there is nothing to be done now in the whole world except to get the best out of this tremendous fusing up of all the settled things of life he had got what he wanted he left her standing upon the lawn and hurried back to his desk   section 6  when mr britling after a strenuous morning among high ideals descended for lunch he found mr lawrence carmine had come over to join him at that meal mr carmine was standing in the hall with his legs very wide apart reading the times for the fourth time i can do no work he said turning round i cant fix my mind i suppose we are going to war id got so used to the war with germany that i never imagined it would happen gods what a bore it will be and maxse and all those scaremongers cockahoop and i told you so damn these germans  he looked despondent and worried he followed mr britling towards the diningroom with his hands deep in his pockets  its going to be a tremendous thing he said after he had greeted mrs britling and hugh and aunt wilshire and teddy and seated himself at mr britlings hospitable board its going to upset everything we dont begin to imagine all the mischief it is going to do  mr britling was full of the heady draught of liberal optimism he had been brewing upstairs i am not sorry i have lived to see this war he said it may be a tremendous catastrophe in one sense but in another it is a huge step forward in human life it is the end of forty years of evil suspense it is crisis and solution  i wish i could see it like that said mr carmine  it is like a thaweverything has been in a frozen confusion since that jewgerman treaty of berlin and since 1871  why not since schleswigholstein said mr carmine  why not or since the treaty of vienna  or sinceone might go back  to the roman empire said hugh  to the first conquest of all said teddy  i couldnt work this morning said hugh i have been reading in the encyclopædia about races and religions in the balkans its very mixed  so long as it could only be dealt with piecemeal said mr britling and that is just where the tremendous opportunity of this war comes in now everything becomes fluid we can redraw the map of the world a week ago we were all quarrelling bitterly about things too little for human impatience now suddenly we face an epoch this is an epoch the world is plastic for men to do what they will with it this is the end and the beginning of an age this is something far greater than the french revolution or the reformation and we live in it  he paused impressively  i wonder what will happen to albania said hugh but his comment was disregarded  war makes men bitter and narrow said mr carmine  war narrowly conceived said mr britling but this is an indignant and generous war  they speculated about the possible intervention of the united states mr britling thought that the attack on belgium demanded the intervention of every civilised power that all the best instincts of america would be for intervention the more he said the quicker  it would be strange if the last power left out to mediate were to be china said mr carmine the one people in the world who really believe in peace i wish i had your confidence britling  for a time they contemplated a sort of grand inquest on germany and militarism presided over by the wisdom of the east militarism was as it were to be buried as a suicide at four crossroads with a stake through its body to prevent any untimely resuscitation   section 7  mr britling was in a phase of imaginative release such a release was one of the first effects of the war upon many educated minds things that had seemed solid forever were visibly in flux things that had seemed stone were alive every boundary every government was seen for the provisional thing it was he talked of his world congress meeting year by year until it ceased to be a speculation and became a mere intelligent anticipation he talked of the manifest necessity of a supreme court for the world he beheld that vision at the hague but mr carmine preferred delhi or samarkand or alexandria or nankin let us get away from the delusion of europe anyhow said mr carmine  as mr britling had sat at his desk that morning and surveyed the stupendous vistas of possibility that war was opening the catastrophe had taken on a more and more beneficial quality i suppose that it is only through such crises as these that the world can reconstruct itself i said and on the whole that afternoon he was disposed to hope that the great military machine would not smash itself too easily we want the nations to feel the need of one another he said too brief a campaign might lead to a squabble for plunder the englishman has to learn his dependence on the irishman the russian has to be taught the value of education and the friendship of the pole europe will now have to look to asia and recognise that indians and chinamem are also white but these lessons require time and stresses if they are to be learnt properly  they discussed the possible duration of the war  mr carmine thought it would be a long struggle mr britling thought that the russians would be in berlin by the next may he was afraid they might get there before the end of the year he thought that the germans would beat out their strength upon the french and belgian lines and never be free to turn upon the russian at all he was sure they had underrated the strength and energy of the french and of ourselves the russians meanwhile he said will come on slowly steadily inevitably   section 8  that day of vast anticipations drew out into the afternoon it was a dayobsessed it was the precursor of a relentless series of doomed and fettered days there was a sense of enormous occurrences going on just out of sound and sightbehind the mask of essex peacefulness from this there was no escape it made all other interests fitful games of badminton were begun and abruptly truncated by the arrival of the evening papers conversations started upon any topic whatever returned to the war by the third and fourth remark  after lunch mr britling and mr carmine went on talking nothing else was possible they repeated things they had already said they went into things more thoroughly they sat still for a time and then suddenly broke out with some new consideration  it had been their custom to play skat with herr heinrich who had shown them the game very explicitly and thoroughly but there was no longer any herr heinrichand somehow german games were already out of fashion the two philosophers admitted that they had already considered skat to be complicated without subtlety and that its chief delight for them had been the pink earnestness of herr heinrich his inability to grasp their complete but tacit comprehension of its innocent strategy and his invariable illsuccess to bring off the coups that flashed before his imagination  he would survey the destructive counterstroke with unconcealed surprise he would verify his first impression by craning towards it and adjusting his glasses on his nose he had a characteristic way of doing this with one stiff finger on either side of his sturdy nose  it is very fortunate for you that you have played that card he would say growing pinker and pinker with hasty cerebration or elseyesa glance at his own cardsit would have been altogether bad for you i had taken only a very small risk now i must  he would reconsider his hand  zo he would say dashing down a card  well he had gone and skat had gone a countless multitude of such links were snapping that day between hundreds of thousands of english and german homes   section 9  the imminence of war produced a peculiar exaltation in aunt wilshire she developed a point of view that was entirely her own  it was mr britlings habit a habit he had set himself to acquire after much irritating experience to disregard aunt wilshire she was not strictly speaking his aunt she was one of those distant cousins we find already woven into our lives when we attain to years of responsibility she had been a presence in his fathers household when mr britling was a boy then she had been called jane or cousin jane or your cousin wilshire it had been a kindly freak of mr britlings to promote her to aunty rank  she eked out a small inheritance by staying with relatives mr britlings earlier memories presented her as a slender young woman of thirty with a nose upon which small boys were forbidden to comment yet she commented upon it herself and called his attention to its marked resemblance to that of the great duke of wellington he was i am told said cousin wilshire to the attentive youth a great friend of your greatgrandmothers at any rate they were contemporaries since then this nose has been in the family he would have been the last to draw a veil over it but other times other manners publish he said and be damned  she had a knack of exasperating mr britlings father a knack which to a less marked degree she also possessed in relation to the son but mr britling senior never acquired the art of disregarding her her methodif one may call the natural expression of a personality a methodwas an invincibly superior knowledge a firm and illconcealed belief that all statements made in her hearing were wrong and most of them absurd and a manner calm assured restrained she may have been born with it it is on record that at the age of ten she was pronounced a singularly trying child she may have been born with the air of thinking the doctor a muff and knowing how to manage all this business better mr britling had known her only in her ripeness as a boy he had enjoyed her confidencesabout other people and the general neglect of her advice he grew up rather to like hermost people rather liked herand to attach a certain importance to her unattainable approval she was sometimes kind she was frequently absurd  with very little children she was quite wise and jolly  so she circulated about a number of houses which at any rate always welcomed her coming in the opening days of each visit she performed marvels of tact and set a watch upon her lips then the demons of controversy and dignity would get the better of her she would begin to correct quietly but firmly she would begin to disapprove of the tone and quality of her treatment it was quite common for her visit to terminate in speechless rage both on the side of host and of visitor the remarkable thing was that this speechless rage never endured though she could exasperate she could never offend always after an interval during which she was never mentioned people began to wonder how cousin jane was getting on a tentative correspondence would begin leading slowly up to a fresh invitation  she spent more time in mr britlings house than in any other there was a legend that she had drawn out his mind and that she had stood up for him against his father she had certainly contradicted quite a number of those unfavourable comments that fathers are wont to make about their sons though certainly she contradicted everything and mr britling hated to think of her knocking about alone in boardinghouses and hydropathic establishments with only the most casual chances for contradiction  moreover he liked to see her casting her eye over the morning paper she did it with a manner as though she thought the terrestrial globe a great fool and quite beyond the reach of advice and as though she understood and was rather amused at the way in which the newspaper people tried to keep back the real facts of the case from her  and now she was scornfully entertained at the behaviour of everybody in the war crisis  she confided various secrets of state to the elder of the younger britlingspreferably when his father was within earshot  none of these things they are saying about the war she said really matter in the slightest degree it is all about a spoilt carpet and nothing else in the worlda madman and a spoilt carpet if people had paid the slightest attention to common sense none of this war would have happened the thing was perfectly well known he was a delicate child difficult to rear and given to screaming fits consequently he was never crossed allowed to do everything nobody but his grandmother had the slightest influence with him and she prevented him spoiling this carpet as completely as he wished to do the story is perfectly well known it was at windsorat the age of eight after that he had but one thought war with england  everybody seemed surprised she said suddenly at tea to mr carmine i at least am not surprised i am only surprised it did not come sooner if any one had asked me i could have told them three years five years ago  the day was one of flying rumours germany was said to have declared war on italy and to have invaded holland as well as belgium  theyll declare war against the moon next said aunt wilshire  and send a lot of zeppelins said the smallest boy herr heinrich told us they can fly thousands of miles  he will go on declaring war until there is nothing left to declare war against that is exactly what he has always done once started he cannot desist often he has had to be removed from the dinnertable for fear of injury now it is ultimatums  she was much pleased by a headline in the daily express that streamed right across the page the mad dog of europe nothing else she said had come so near her feelings about the war  mark my words said aunt wilshire in her most impressive tones he is insane it will be proved to be so he will end his days in an asylumas a lunatic i have felt it myself for years and said so in private knowing what i did to such friends as i could trust not to misunderstand me now at least i can speak out  with his moustaches turned up exclaimed aunt wilshire after an interval of accumulation they say he has completely lost the use of the joint in his left arm he carries it stiff like a punch and judyand he wants to conquer europe while his grandmother lived there was some one to keep him in order he stood in awe of her he hated her but he did not dare defy her even his uncle had some influence now nothing restrains him  a doubleheaded mad dog said aunt wilshire him and his eagles a man like that ought never to have been allowed to make a war not even a little war if he had been put under restraint when i said so none of these things would have happened but of course i am nobody it was not considered worth attending to   section 10  one remarkable aspect of the english attitude towards the war was the disposition to treat it as a monstrous joke it is a disposition traceable in a vast proportion of the british literature of the time in spite of violence cruelty injustice and the vast destruction and still vaster dangers of the struggles that disposition held the english mind refused flatly to see anything magnificent or terrible in the german attack or to regard the german emperor or the crown prince as anything more than figures of fun from first to last their conception of the enemy was an overstrenuous foolish man red with effort with protruding eyes and a forced frightfulness of demeanour that he might be tremendously lethal did not in the least obscure the fact that he was essentially ridiculous and if as the war went on the joke grew grimmer still it remained a joke the german might make a desert of the world that could not alter the british conviction that he was making a fool of himself  and this disposition kept coming to the surface throughout the afternoon now in a casual allusion now in some deliberate jest the small boys had discovered the goose step and it filled their little souls with amazement and delight that human beings should consent to those ridiculous paces seemed to them almost incredibly funny they tried it themselves and then set out upon a goosestep propaganda letty and cissie had come up to the dower house for tea and news and they were enrolled with teddy and hugh the six of them chuckling and swaying marched in vast scissor strides across the lawn left cried hugh left  toes out more said mr lawrence carmine  keep stiffer said the youngest britling  watch the zeppelins and look proud said hugh with the chest out zo  mrs britling was so much amused that she went in for her camera and took a snapshot of the detachment it was a very successful snapshot and a year later mr britling was to find a print of it among his papers and recall the sunshine and the merriment   section 11  that night brought the british declaration of war against germany to nearly every englishman that came as a matter of course and it is one of the most wonderful facts in history that the germans were surprised by it when mr britling as a sample englishman had said that there would never be war between germany and england he had always meant that it was inconceivable to him that germany should ever attack belgium or france if germany had been content to fight a merely defensive war upon her western frontier and let belgium alone there would scarcely have been such a thing as a war party in great britain but the attack upon belgium the westward thrust made the whole nation flame unanimously into war it settled a question that was in open debate up to the very outbreak of the conflict up to the last the english had cherished the idea that in germany just as in england the mass of people were kindly pacific and detached that had been the english mistake germany was really and truly what germany had been professing to be for forty years a war state with a sighand a longforgotten thrillengland roused herself to fight even now she still roused herself sluggishly it was going to be an immense thing but just how immense it was going to be no one in england had yet imagined  countless men that day whom fate had marked for death and wounds stared openmouthed at the news and smiled with the excitement of the headlines not dreaming that any of these things would come within three hundred miles of them what was war to matchings easyto all the matchings easies great and small that make up england the last home that was ever burnt by an enemy within a hundred miles of matchings easy was burnt by the danes rather more than a thousand years ago and the last trace of those particular danes in england were certain horny scraps of indurated skin under the heads of the nails in the door of st clement danes in london  now again england was to fight in a war which was to light fires in england and bring death to english people on english soil there were inconceivable ideas in august 1914 such things must happen before they can be comprehended as possible   section 12  this story is essentially the history of the opening and of the realisation of the great war as it happened to one small group of people in essex and more particularly as it happened to one human brain it came at first to all these people in a spectacular manner as a thing happening dramatically and internationally as a show as something in the newspapers something in the character of an historical epoch rather than a personal experience only by slow degrees did it and its consequences invade the common texture of english life if this story could be represented by sketches or pictures the central figure would be mr britling now sitting at his desk by day or by night and writing first at his tract and now war ends and then at other things now walking about his garden or in claverings park or going to and fro in london in his club reading the ticker or in his hall reading the newspaper with ideas and impressions continually clustering expanding developing more and more abundantly in his mind arranging themselves reacting upon one another building themselves into generalisations and conclusions  all mr britlings mental existence was soon threaded on the war his more or less weekly times leader became dissertations upon the german point of view his reviews of books and literary supplement articles were all oriented more and more exactly to that one supreme fact  it was rare that he really seemed to be seeing the war few people saw it for most of the world it came as an illimitable multitude of incoherent loud and confusing impressions but all the time he was at least doing his utmost to see the war to simplify it and extract the essence of it until it could be apprehended as something epic and explicable as a stateable issue  most typical picture of all would be mr britling writing in a little circle of orange lamplight with the blinds of his room open for the sake of the moonlight but the window shut to keep out the moths that beat against it outside would be the moon and the high summer sky and the old church tower dim above the black trees half a mile away with its clockwhich mr britling heard at night but never noted by daybeating its way round the slow semicircle of the nocturnal hours he had always hated conflict and destruction and felt that war between civilised states was the quintessential expression of human failure it was a stupidity that stopped progress and all the free variation of humanity a thousand times he had declared it impossible but even now with his country fighting he was still far from realising that this was a thing that could possibly touch him more than intellectually he did not really believe with his eyes and fingertips and backbone that murder destruction and agony on a scale monstrous beyond precedent was going on in the same world as that which slumbered outside the black ivy and silver shining windowsill that framed his peaceful view  war had not been a reality of the daily life of england for more than a thousand years the mental habit of the nation for fifty generations was against its emotional recognition the english were the spoilt children of peace they had never been wholly at war for three hundred years and for over eight hundred years they had not fought for life against a foreign power spain and france had threatened in turn but never even crossed the seas it is true that england had had her civil dissensions and had made wars and conquests in every part of the globe and established an immense empire but that last as mr britling had told mr direck was an excursion she had just sent out younger sons and surplus people emigrants and expeditionary forces her own soil had never seen any successful foreign invasion her homeland the bulk of her households her general life had gone on untouched by these things nineteen people out of twenty the middle class and most of the lower class knew no more of the empire than they did of the argentine republic or the italian renaissance it did not concern them war that calls upon every man and threatens every life in the land war of the whole national being was a thing altogether outside english experience and the scope of the british imagination it was still incredible it was still outside the range of mr britlings thoughts all through the tremendous onrush and check of the german attack in the west that opened the great war through those two months he was as it were a more and more excited spectator at a show a show like a baseball match a spectator with money on the event rather than a really participating citizen of a nation thoroughly at war   section 13  after the jolt of the food panic and a brief financial scare the vast inertia of everyday life in england asserted itself when the public went to the banks for the new paper money the banks tendered goldapologetically the supply of the new notes was very insufficient and there was plenty of gold after the first impression that a universal catastrophe had happened there was an effect as if nothing had happened  shops reopened after the bank holiday in a tentative spirit that speedily became assurance people went about their business again and the war so far as the mass of british folk were concerned was for some weeks a fever of the mind and intelligence rather than a physical and personal actuality there was a keen demand for news and for a time there was very little news the press did its best to cope with this immense occasion led by the daily express all the halfpenny newspapers adopted a new and more resonant sort of headline the streamer a band of emphatic type that ran clean across the page and announced victories or disconcerting happenings they did this every day whether there was a great battle or the loss of a trawler to announce and the public mind speedily adapted itself to the new pitch  there was no invitation from the government and no organisation for any general participation in war people talked unrestrictedly every one seemed to be talking they waved flags and displayed much vague willingness to do something any opportunity of service was taken very eagerly lord kitchener was understood to have demanded five hundred thousand men the war office arrangements for recruiting arrangements conceived on a scale altogether too small were speedily overwhelmed by a rush of willing young men the flow had to be checked by raising the physical standard far above the national average and recruiting died down to manageable proportions there was a quite genuine belief that the war might easily be too exclusively considered that for the great mass of people it was a disturbing and distracting rather than a vital interest the phase business as usual ran about the world and the papers abounded in articles in which going on as though there was no war at all was demonstrated to be the truest form of patriotism leave things to kitchener was another watchword with a strong appeal to the national quality business as usual during alterations to the map of europe was the advertisement of one cheerful barber widely quoted  hugh was at home all through august he had thrown up his rooms in london with his artistic ambitions and his father was making all the necessary arrangements for him to follow cardinal to cambridge meanwhile hugh was taking up his scientific work where he had laid it down he gave a reluctant couple of hours in the afternoon to the mysteries of littlego greek and for the rest of his time he was either working at mathematics and mathematical physics or experimenting in a little upstairs room that had been carved out of the general space of the barn it was only at the very end of august that it dawned upon him or mr britling that the war might have more than a spectacular and sympathetic appeal for him hitherto contemporary history had happened without his personal intervention he did not see why it should not continue to happen with the same detachment the last electionsand a general election is really the only point at which the life of the reasonable englishman becomes in any way publichad happened four years ago when he was thirteen   section 14  for a time it was believed in matchings easy that the german armies had been defeated and very largely destroyed at liège it was a mistake not confined to matchings easy  the first raiding attack was certainly repulsed with heavy losses and so were the more systematic assaults on august the sixth and seventh after that the news from liège became uncertain but it was believed in england that some or all of the forts were still holding out right up to the german entry into brussels meanwhile the french were pushing into their lost provinces occupying altkirch mulhausen and saarburg the russians were invading bukovina and east prussia the goeben the breslau and the panther had been sunk by the newspapers in an imaginary battle in the mediterranean and togoland was captured by the french and british neither the force nor the magnitude of the german attack through belgium was appreciated by the general mind and it was possible for mr britling to reiterate his fear that the war would be over too soon long before the full measure of its possible benefits could be secured but these apprehensions were unfounded the lessons the war had in store for mr britling were far more drastic than anything he was yet able to imagine even in his most exalted moods  he resisted the intimations of the fall of brussels and the appearance of the germans at dinant the first real check to his excessive anticipations of victory for the allies came with the sudden reappearance of mr direck in a state of astonishment and dismay at matchings easy he wired from the strand office coming to tell you about things and arrived on the heels of his telegram  he professed to be calling upon mr and mrs britling and to a certain extent he was but he had a quick eye for the door or windows his glance roved irrelevantly as he talked a faint expectation of cissie came in with him and hovered about him as the scent of violets follows the flower  he was however able to say quite a number of things before mr britlings natural tendency to do the telling asserted itself  my word said mr direck but this is some war it is going on regardless of every decent consideration as an american citizen i naturally expected to be treated with some respect war or no war that expectation has not been realised europe is dislocated you have no idea here yet how completely europe is dislocated  i came to europe in a perfectly friendly spiritand i must say i am surprised practically i have been thrown out neck and crop all my luggage is lost away at some onehorse junction near the dutch frontier that i cant even learn the name of theres joy in some german home i guess over my shirts they were real good shirts this tweed suit i have is all the wardrobe ive got in the world all my moneygood american noteswell they laughed at them and when i produced english gold they suspected me of being english and put me under arrest i can assure you that the english are most unpopular in germany at the present time thoroughly unpopular considering that they are getting exactly what they were asking for these germans are really remarkably annoyed well i had to get the american consul to advance me money and ive done more waiting about and irregular fasting and travelling on an empty stomach and viewing the world so far as it was permitted from railway sidingsfor usually they made us pull the blinds down when anything important was on the trackthan any cow that ever came to chicago i was handed as freightlow grade freight it doesnt bear recalling  mr direck assumed as grave and gloomy an expression as the facial habits of years would permit  i tell you i never knew there was such a thing as war until this happened to me in america we dont know there is such a thing its like pestilence and famine something in the story books weve forgotten it for anything real theres just a few grandfathers go around talking about it judge holmes and sage old fellows like him otherwise its just a game the kids play at and then suddenly heres everybody running about in the streetshating and threateningand nice old gentlemen with white moustaches and fathers of families scheming and planning to burn houses and kill and hurt and terrify and nice young women too looking for an englishman to spit at i tell you ive been within range and very uncomfortable several times and what one cant believe is that they are really doing these things theres a little village called visé near the dutch frontier some old chap got fooling there with a fowlingpiece and theyve wiped it out shot the people by the dozen put them out in rows three deep and shot them and burnt the place short of scalping red indians couldnt have done worse respectable german soldiers  no one in england really seems to have any suspicion what is going on in belgium you hear storiespeople tell them in holland it takes your breath away they have set out just to cow those belgians they have started in to be deliberately frightful you do not begin to understand well outrages the sort of outrages americans have never heard of that one doesnt speak of well rape they have been raping women for disciplinary purposes on tables in the marketplace of liège yes sir its a fact i was told it by a man who had just come out of belgium knew the people knew the place knew everything people over here do not seem to realise that those women are the same sort of women that you might find in chester or yarmouth or in matchings easy for the matter of that they still seem to think that continental women are a different sort of womenmore amenable to that sort of treatment they seem to think there is some special providential law against such things happening to english people and its within two hundred miles of youeven now and as far as i can see theres precious little to prevent it coming nearer  mr britling thought there were a few little obstacles  ive seen the new british army drilling in london mr britling i dont know if you have i saw a whole battalion and they hadnt got halfadozen uniforms and not a single rifle to the whole battalion  you dont begin to realise in england what you are up against you have no idea what it means to be in a country where everybody the women the elderly people the steady middleaged men are taking war as seriously as business they havent the slightest compunction i dont know what germany was like before the war i had hardly gotten out of my train before the war began but germany today is one big armed camp its all crawling with soldiers and every soldier has his uniform and his boots and his arms and his kit  and theyre as sure of winning as if they had got london now they mean to get london theyre cocksure they are going to walk through belgium cocksure they will get to paris by sedan day and then they are going to destroy your fleet with zeppelins and submarines and make a dash across the channel they say its england they are after in this invasion of belgium theyll just down france by the way they say theyve got guns to bombard dover from calais they make a boast of it they know for certain you cant arm your troops they know you cant turn out ten thousand rifles a week they come and talk to any one in the trains and explain just how your defeat is going to be managed its just as though they were talking of rounding up cattle  mr britling said they would soon be disillusioned  mr direck with the confidence of his authentic observations remarked after a perceptible interval i wonder how  he reverted to the fact that had most struck upon his imagination  grownup people ordinary intelligent experienced people taking war seriously talking of punishing england its a revelation a sort of solemn enthusiasm high and low  and the trainloads of men and the trainloads of guns  liège said mr britling  liège was just a scratch on the paint said mr direck a few thousand dead a few score thousand dead doesnt matternot a red cent to them theres a man arrived at the cecil who saw them marching into brussels he sat at table with me at lunch yesterday all day it went on a vast unending river of men in grey endless waggons endless guns the whole manhood of a nation and all its stuff marching  i thought war said mr direck was a thing when most people stood about and did the shouting and a sort of special team did the fighting well germany isnt fighting like that i confess it im scared its the very biggest thing on record its the very limit in wars i dreamt last night of a grey flood washing everything in front of it you and meand miss cornercurious thing isnt it that she came into itwere scrambling up a hill higher and higher with that flood pouring after us sort of splashing into a foam of faces and helmets and bayonetsand clutching handsand red stuff well mr britling i admit im a little bit overwrought about it but i can assure you you dont begin to realise in england what it is youve butted against   section 15  cissie did not come up to the dower house that afternoon and so mr direck after some vague and transparent excuses made his way to the cottage  here his report become even more impressive teddy sat on the writing desk beside the typewriter and swung his legs slowly letty brooded in the armchair cissie presided over certain limited crawling operations of the young heir  they could have the equal of the whole british army killed three times over and scarcely know it had happened theyre all in it its a whole country in arms  teddy nodded thoughtfully  theres our fleet said letty  well that wont save paris will it  mr direck didnt he declared want to make disagreeable talk but this was a thing people in england had to face he felt like one of them himselfnaturally hed sort of hurried home to themit was just like hurrying hometo tell them of the tremendous thing that was going to hit them he felt like a man in front of a flood a great grey flood he couldnt hide what he had been thinking wheres our army asked letty suddenly  lost somewhere in france said teddy like a needle in a bottle of hay  what i keep on worrying at is this mr direck resumed suppose they did come suppose somehow they scrambled over sixty or seventy thousand men perhaps  every man would turn out and take a shot at them said letty  but theres no rifles  theres shot guns  thats exactly what im afraid of said mr direck theyd massacre  you may be the bravest people on earth said mr direck but if you havent got arms and the other chaps haveyoure just as if you were sheep  he became gloomily pensive  he roused himself to describe his experiences at some length and the extraordinary disturbance of his mind he related more particularly his attempts to see the sights of cologne during the stir of mobilisation after a time his narrative flow lost force and there was a general feeling that he ought to be left alone with cissie teddy had a letter that must be posted letty took the infant to crawl on the mossy stones under the pear tree mr direck leant against the windowsill and became silent for some moments after the door had closed on letty  as for you cissie he began at last im anxious im real anxious i wish youd let me throw the mantle of old glory over you  he looked at her earnestly  old glory asked cissie  wellthe stars and stripes i want you to be able to claim american citizenshipin certain eventualities it wouldnt be so very difficult all the world over cissie americans are respected nobody dares touch an american citizen we arean inviolate people  he paused but how asked cissie  it would be perfectly easyperfectly  how  just marry an american citizen said mr direck with his face beaming with ingenuous selfapproval then youd be safe and id not have to worry  because were in for a stiff war cried cissie and direck perceived he had blundered  because we may be invaded she said and mr direcks sense of error deepened  i vow she began  no cried mr direck and held out a hand  there was a moment of crisis  never will i desert my countrywhile she is at war said cissie reducing her first fierce intention and adding as though she regretted her concession anyhow  then its up to me to end the war cissie said mr direck trying to get her back to a less spirited attitude  but cissie wasnt to be got back so easily the war was already beckoning to them in the cottage and drawing them down from the auditorium into the arena  this is the rightest war in history she said if i was an american i should be sorry to be one now and to have to stand out of it i wish i was a man now so that i could do something for all the decency and civilisation the germans have outraged i cant understand how any man can be content to keep out of this and watch belgium being destroyed it is like looking on at a murder it is like watching a dog killing a kitten  mr direcks expression was that of a man who is suddenly shown strange lights upon the world   section 16  mr britling found mr direcks talk very indigestible  he was parting very reluctantly from his dream of a disastrous collapse of german imperialism of a tremendous decisive demonstration of the inherent unsoundness of militarist monarchy to be followed by a world conference of chastened but hopeful nations andthe millennium he tried now to think that mr direck had observed badly and misconceived what he saw an american unused to any sort of military occurrences might easily mistake tens of thousands for millions and the excitement of a few commercial travellers for the enthusiasm of a united people but the newspapers now with a kindred reluctance were beginning to qualify bit by bit their first representation of the german attack through belgium as a vast and already partly thwarted parade of incompetence the germans he gathered were being continually beaten in belgium but just as continually they advanced each fresh newspaper name he looked up on the map marked an oncoming tide alostcharleroi farther east the french were retreating from the saales pass surely the british who had now been in france for a fortnight would presently be manifest stemming the onrush somewhere perhaps in brabant or east flanders it gave mr britling an unpleasant night to hear at claverings that the french were very illequipped had no good modern guns either at lille or maubeuge were short of boots and equipment generally and rather depressed already at the trend of things mr britling dismissed this as pessimistic talk and built his hopes on the still invisible british army hovering somewhere  he would sit over the map of belgium choosing where he would prefer to have the british hover  namur fell the place names continued to shift southward and westward the british army or a part of it came to light abruptly at mons it had been fighting for thirtyeight hours and defeating enormously superior forces of the enemy that was reassuring until a day or so later the cambrayle cateau line made mr britling realise that the victorious british had recoiled five and twenty miles  and then came the sunday of the times telegram which spoke of a retreating and a broken army mr britling did not see this but mr manning brought over the report of it in a state of profound consternation things he said seemed to be about as bad as they could be the english were retreating towards the coast and in much disorder they were in the air and already separated from the trench they had narrowly escaped a sedan under the fortifications of maubeuge mr britling was stunned he went to his study and stared helplessly at maps it was as if david had flung his pebbleand missed  but in the afternoon mr manning telephoned to comfort his friend a reassuring despatch from general french had been published andall was wellpracticallyand the british had been splendid they had been fighting continuously for several days round and about mons they had been attacked at odds of six to one and they had repulsed and inflicted enormous losses on the enemy they had established an incontestable personal superiority over the germans the germans had been mown down in heaps the british had charged through their cavalry like charging through paper so at last and very gloriously for the british british and german had met in battle after the hard fighting of the 26th about landrecies the british had been comparatively unmolested reinforcements covering double the losses had joined them and the german advance was definitely checked  mr britlings mind swung back to elation he took down the entire despatch from mr mannings dictation and ran out with it into the garden where mrs britling with an unwonted expression of anxiety was presiding over the teas of the usual casual sunday gathering the despatch was read aloud twice over after that there was hockey and high spirits and then mr britling went up to his study to answer a letter from mrs harrowdean the first letter that had come from her since their breach at the outbreak of the war and which he was now in a better mood to answer than he had been hitherto  she had written ignoring his silence and absence or rather treating it as if it were an incident of no particular importance apparently she had not called upon the patient and devoted oliver as she had threatened at any rate there were no signs of oliver in her communication but she reproached mr britling for deserting her and she clamoured for his presence and for kind and strengthening words she was she said scared by this war she was only a little thing and it was all too dreadful and there was not a soul in the world to hold her hand at least no one who understood in the slightest degree how she felt but why was not oliver holding her hand she was like a child left alone in the dark it was perfectly horrible the way that people were being kept in the dark the stories one heard often from quite trustworthy sources were enough to depress and terrify any one battleship after battleship had been sunk by german torpedoes a thing kept secret from us for no earthly reason and prince louis of battenberg had been discovered to be a spy and had been sent to the tower haldane too was a spy our army in france had been practically sold by the french almost all the french generals were in german pay the censorship and the press were keeping all this back but what good was it to keep it back it was folly not to trust people but it was all too dreadful for a poor little soul whose only desire was to live happily why didnt he come along to her and make her feel she had protecting arms round her she couldnt think in the daytime she couldnt sleep at night  then she broke away into the praises of serenity never had she thought so much of his beautiful silent places as she did now how she longed to take refuge in some such dreamland from violence and treachery and foolish rumours she was weary of every reality she wanted to fly away into some secret hidingplace and cultivate her simple garden thereas voltaire had done sometimes at night she was afraid to undress she imagined the sound of guns she imagined landings and frightful scouts in masks rushing inland on motor bicycles  it was an illtimed letter the nonsense about prince louis of battenberg and lord haldane and the torpedoed battleships annoyed him extravagantly he had just sufficient disposition to believe such tales as to find their importunity exasperating the idea of going over to pyecrafts to spend his days in comforting a timid little dear obsessed by such fears attracted him not at all he had already heard enough adverse rumours at claverings to make him thoroughly uncomfortable he had been doubting whether after all his examination of war was really much less of a futility than and now war ends his mind was full of a sense of incomplete statements and unsubstantial arguments he was indeed in a state of extreme intellectual worry he was moreover extraordinarily out of love with mrs harrowdean never had any affection in the whole history of mr britlings heart collapsed so swiftly and completely he was left incredulous of ever having cared for her at all probably he hadnt probably the whole business had been deliberate illusion from first to last the dear little thing business he felt was all very well as a game of petting but times were serious now and a woman of her intelligence should do something better than wallow in fears and elaborate a winsome feebleness a very unnecessary and tiresome feebleness he came almost to the pitch of writing that to her  the despatch from general french put him into a kindlier frame of mind he wrote instead briefly but affectionately as a gentleman should how could you doubt our fleet or our army was the gist of his letter he ignored completely every suggestion of a visit to pyecrafts that her letter had conveyed he pretended that it had contained nothing of the sort and with that she passed out of his mind again under the stress of more commanding interests  mr britlings mood of relief did not last through the week the defeated germans continued to advance through a week of deepening disillusionment the main tide of battle rolled back steadily towards paris lille was lost without a struggle it was lost with mysterious ease the next name to startle mr britling as he sat with newspaper and atlas following these great events was compiègne here manifestly the british were still in retreat then the germans were in possession of laon and rheims and still pressing south maubeuge surrounded and cut off for some days had apparently fallen  it was on sunday september the sixth that the final capitulation of mr britlings facile optimism occurred  he stood in the sunshine reading the observer which the gardeners boy had just brought from the may tree he had spread it open on a garden table under the blue cedar and father and son were both reading it each as much as the other would let him there was fresh news from france a story of further german advances fighting at senlisbut that is quite close to parisand the appearance of german forces at nogentsurseine sur seine cried mr britling but where can that be south of the marne or below paris perhaps  it was not marked upon the observers map and hugh ran into the house for the atlas  when he returned mr manning was with his father and they both looked grave  hugh opened the map of northern france here it is he said  mr britling considered the position  manning says they are at rouen he told hugh our base is to be moved round to la rochelle  he paused before the last distasteful conclusion  practically he admitted taking his dose they have got paris it is almost surrounded now  he sat down to the map mr manning and hugh stood regarding him he made a last effort to imagine some tremendous strategic reversal some stone from an unexpected sling that should fell this goliath in the midst of his triumph  russia he said without any genuine hope   section 17  and then it was that mr britling accepted the truth  one talks he said and then weeks and months later one learns the meaning of the things one has been saying i was saying a month ago that this is the biggest thing that has happened in history i said that this was the supreme call upon the will and resources of england i said there was not a life in all our empire that would not be vitally changed by this war i said all these things they came through my mouth i suppose there was a sort of thought behind them only at this moment do i understand what it is that i said nowlet me say it over as if i had never said it before this is the biggest thing in history that we are all called upon to do our utmost to resist this tremendous attack upon the peace and freedom of the world well doing our utmost does not mean standing about in pleasant gardens waiting for the newspaper it means the abandonment of ease and security  how lazy we english are nowadays how readily we grasp the comforting delusion that excuses us from exertion for the last three weeks i have been deliberately believing that a little british armythey say it is scarcely a hundred thousand menwould somehow break this rush of millions but it has been driven back as any one not in love with easy dreams might have known it would be driven backhere and then here and then here it has been fighting night and day it has made the most splendid fightand the most ineffectual fight you see the vast swing of the german flail through belgium and meanwhile we have been standing about talking of the use we would make of our victory  we have been asleep he said this country has been asleep  at the back of our minds he went on bitterly i suppose we thought the french would do the heavy work on landwhile we stood by at sea so far as we thought at all were so temperateminded were so full of qualifications and discretions and so leisurely well france is down weve got to fight for france now over the ruins of paris because you and i manning didnt grasp the scale of it because we indulged in generalisations when we ought to have been drilling and working because weve been doing business as usual and all the rest of that sort of thing while western civilisation has been in its death agony if this is to be another 71 on a larger scale and against not merely france but all europe if prussianism is to walk roughshod over civilisation if france is to be crushed and belgium murdered then life is not worth having compared with such an issue as that no other issue no other interest matters yet what are we doing to decide ityou and i how can it end in anything but a german triumph if you and i by the million stand by  he paused despairfully and stared at the map  what ought we to be doing asked mr manning  every man ought to be in training said mr britling every one ought to be participating in some way at any rate we ought not to be taking our ease at matchings easy any more   section 18  it interrupts everything said hugh suddenly these prussians are the biggest nuisance the world has ever seen  he considered its like every one having to run out because the house catches fire but of course we have to beat them it has to be done and every one has to take a share  then we can get on with our work again  mr britling turned his eyes to his eldest son with a startled expression he had been speakinggenerally for the moment he had forgotten hugh     chapter the second  taking part   section 1  there were now two chief things in the mind of mr britling one was a large and valiant thing a thing of heroic and processional quality the idea of taking up ones share in the great conflict of leaving the dower house and its circle of habits and activities and going out from that point he wasnt quite sure where he was to go nor exactly what he meant to do his imagination inclined to the figure of a volunteer in an improvised uniform inflicting great damage upon a raiding invader from behind a hedge the uniform one presumes would have been something in the vein of the costume in which he met mr direck with a brassard or he thought of himself as working at a telephone or in an office engaged upon any useful quasiadministrative work that called for intelligence rather than training still of course with a brassard a month ago he would have had doubts about the meaning of brassard now it seemed to be the very keyword for national organisation he had started for london by the early train on monday morning with the intention of immediate enrolment in any such service that offered of getting in fact into his brassard at once the morning papers he bought at the station dashed his conviction of the inevitable fall of paris into hopeful doubts but did not shake his resolution the effect of rout and pursuit and retreat and retreat and retreat had disappeared from the news the german right was being counterattacked and seemed in danger of getting pinched between paris and verdun with the british on its flank this relieved his mind but it did nothing to modify his new realisation of the tremendous gravity of the war even if the enemy were held and repulsed a little there was still work for every man in the task of forcing them back upon their own country this war was an immense thing it would touch everybody that meant that every man must give himself that he had to give himself he must let nothing stand between him and that clear understanding it was utterly shameful now to hold back and not to do ones utmost for civilisation for england for all the ease and safety one had been givenagainst these drilled commanded obsessed millions  mr britling was a flame of exalted voluntaryism of patriotic devotion that day  but behind all this bravery was the other thing the second thing in the mind of mr britling a fear he was prepared now to spread himself like some valiant turkeygobbler every feather at its utmost against the aggressor he was prepared to go out and flourish bayonets march and dig to the limit of his power shoot die in a ditch if needful rather than permit german militarism to dominate the world he had no fear for himself he was prepared to perish upon the battlefield or cut a valiant figure in the military hospital but what he perceived very clearly and did his utmost not to perceive was this qualifying and discouraging fact that the war monster was not nearly so disposed to meet him as he was to meet the war and that its eyes were fixed on something beside and behind him that it was already only too evidently stretching out a long and shadowy arm past him towards teddyand towards hugh  the young are the food of war  teddy wasnt mr britlings business anyhow teddy must do as he thought proper mr britling would not even advise upon that and as for hugh  mr britling did his best to brazen it out  my eldest boy is barely seventeen he said hes keen to go and id be sorry if he wasnt hell get into some cadet corps of coursehes already done something of that kind at school or theyll take him into the territorials but before hes nineteen everything will be over one way or another im afraid poor chap hell feel sold  and having thrust hugh safely into the background of his mind asjuvenile doing a juvenile share no sort of man yetmr britling could give a free rein to his generous imaginations of a national uprising from the idea of a universal participation in the struggle he passed by an easy transition to an anticipation of all britain armed and gravely embattled across gulfs of obstinate reality he himself was prepared to say and accordingly he felt that the great mass of the british must be prepared to say to the government here we are at your disposal this is not a diplomatists war nor a war office war this is a war of the whole people we are all willing and ready to lay aside our usual occupations and offer our property and ourselves whim and individual action are for peace times take us and use us as you think fit take all we possess when he thought of the government in this way he forgot the governing class he knew the slacktrousered raeburn the prim attentive philbert lady frensham at the top of her voice stern preposterous carson boozy bandershoot and artful taper wily asquith the eloquent yet unsubstantial george and the immobile grey vanished out of his mind all those representative exponents of the way things are done in great britain faded in the glow of his imaginative effort he forgot the dreary debates the floundering newspapers the bluffs the intrigues the sly bargains of the weekend party the schoolboy honour of grown men the universal weak dishonesty in thinking he thought simply of a simplified and ideal government that governed he thought vaguely of something behind and beyond them england the ruling genius of the land something with a dignified assurance and a stable will he imagined this shadowy ruler miraculously provided with schemes and statistics against this supreme occasion which had for so many years been the most conspicuous probability before the country his mind leaping forwards to the conception of a great nation reluctantly turning its vast resources to the prosecution of a righteous defensive war filled in the obvious corollaries of plan and calculation he thought that somewhere up there there must be people who could count and who had counted everything that we might need for such a struggle and organisers who had schemed and estimated down to practicable and manageable details  such lapses from knowledge to faith are perhaps necessary that human heroism may be possible  his conception of his own share in the great national uprising was a very modest one he was a writer a footnote to reality he had no trick of command over men his rôle was observation rather than organisation and he saw himself only as an insignificant individual dropping from his individuality into his place in a great machine taking a rifle in a trench guarding a bridge filling a cartridgejust with a brassard or something like that onuntil the great task was done sunday night was full of imaginations of order of the countryside standing up to its task of roads cleared and resources marshalled of the petty interests of the private life altogether set aside and mingling with that it was still possible for mr britling he was still young enough to produce such dreams of personal service of sudden emergencies swiftly and bravely met of conspicuous daring and exceptional rewards such dreams as hover in the brains of every imaginative recruit  the detailed story of mr britlings two days search for some easy and convenient ladder into the service of his threatened country would be a voluminous one it would begin with the figure of a neatly brushed patriot with an intent expression upon his intelligent face seated in the londonward train reading the war newsthe first comforting war news for many daysand trying not to look as though his life was torn up by the roots and all his being aflame with devotion and it would conclude after fortyeight hours of fuss inquiry talk waiting telephoning with the same gentleman a little fagged and with a kind of weary apathy in his eyes returning by the short cut from the station across claverings park to resume his connection with his abandoned roots the essential process of the interval had been the correction of mr britlings temporary delusion that the government of the british empire is either intelligent instructed or wise  the great business as usual phase was already passing away and london was in the full tide of recruiting enthusiasm that tide was breaking against the most miserable arrangements for enlistment it is possible to imagine overtaxed and not very competent officers whose one idea of being very efficient was to refuse civilian help and be very very slow and circumspect and very dignified and overbearing sat in dirty little rooms and snarled at this unheardof england that pressed at door and window for enrolment outside every recruiting office crowds of men and youths waited leaning against walls sitting upon the pavements waited for long hours waiting to the end of the day and returning next morning without shelter without food many sick with hunger men who had hurried up from the country men who had thrown up jobs of every kind clerks shopmen anxious only to serve england and teach those damned germans a lesson between them and this object they had discovered a perplexing barrier an inattention as mr britling made his way by st martins church and across trafalgar square and marked the weary accumulation of this magnificently patriotic stuff he had his first inkling of the imaginative insufficiency of the war office that had been so suddenly called upon to organise victory he was to be more fully informed when he reached his club  his impression of the streets through which he passed was an impression of great unrest there were noticeably fewer omnibuses and less road traffic generally but there was a quite unusual number of drifting pedestrians the current on the pavements was irritatingly sluggish there were more people standing about and fewer going upon their business this was particularly the case with the women he saw many of them seemed to have drifted in from the suburbs and outskirts of london in a state of vague expectation unable to stay in their homes  everywhere there were the flags of the allies in shop windows over doors on the bonnets of automobiles on peoples breasts and there was a great quantity of recruiting posters on the hoardings and in windows your king and country need you was the chief text and they still called for a hundred thousand men although the demand of lord kitchener had risen to half a million there were also placards calling for men on nearly all the taxicabs the big windows of the offices of the norddeutscher lloyd in cockspur street were boarded up and plastered thickly with recruiting appeals  at his club mr britling found much talk and belligerent stir in the hall wilkins the author was displaying a dummy rifle of bent iron rod to several interested members it was to be used for drilling until rifles could be got and it could be made for eighteen pence this was the first intimation mr britling got that the want of foresight of the war office only began with its unpreparedness for recruits men were talking very freely in the club one of the temporary effects of the war in its earlier stages was to produce a partial thaw in the constitutional british shyness and men who had glowered at mr britling over their lunches and had been glowered at by mr britling in silence for years now started conversations with him  what is a man of my sort to do asked a cleanshaven barrister  exactly what i have been asking said mr britling they are fixing the upward age for recruits at thirty its absurdly low a man well over forty like myself is quite fit to line a trench or guard a bridge im not so bad a shot  weve been discussing home defence volunteers said the barrister anyhow we ought to be drilling but the war office sets its face as sternly against our doing anything of the sort as though we were going to join the germans its absurd even if we older men arent fit to go abroad we could at least release troops who could  if you had the rifles said a sharpfeatured man in grey to the right of mr britling  i suppose they are to be got said mr britling  the sharpfeatured man indicated by appropriate facial action and headshaking that this was by no means the case  every dead man many wounded men most prisoners he said mean each one a rifle lost we have lost fiveandtwenty thousand rifles alone since the war began quite apart from arming new troops we have to replace those rifles with the drafts we send out do you know what is the maximum weekly output of rifles at the present time in this country  mr britling did not know  nine thousand  mr britling suddenly understood the significance of wilkins and his dummy gun  the sharpfeatured man added with an air of concluding the matter its the barrels are the trouble complicated machinery we havent got it and we cant make it in a hurry and there you are  the sharpfeatured man had a way of speaking almost as if he was throwing bombs he threw one now zinc he said  were not short of zinc said the lawyer  the sharpfeatured man nodded and then became explicit  zinc was necessary for cartridges it had to be refined zinc and very pure or the shooting went wrong well we had let the refining business drift away from england to belgium and germany there were just one or two british firms still left unless we bucked up tremendously we should get caught short of cartridges at any rate of cartridges so made as to ensure good shooting and there you are said the sharpfeatured man  but the sharpfeatured man did not at that time represent any considerable section of public thought i suppose after all we can get rifles from america said the lawyer and as for zinc if the shortage is known the shortage will be provided for  the prevailing topic in the smokingroom upstairs was the inability of the war office to deal with the flood of recruits that was pouring in and its hostility to any such volunteering as mr britling had in mind quite a number of members wanted to volunteer there was much talk of their fitness im fiftyfour said one and i could do my twentyfive miles in marching kit far better than half those boys of nineteen another was thirtyeight i must hold the business together he said but why anyhow shouldnt i learn to shoot and use a bayonet the personal pique of the rejected lent force to their criticisms of the recruiting and general organisation the war office has one incurable system said a big mineowner during peace time it runs all its home administration with men who will certainly be wanted at the front directly there is a war directly war comes therefore there is a shift all round and a new untried manusually a dugout in an advanced state of decayis stuck into the job chaos follows automatically the war office always has done this and so far as one can see it always will it seems incapable of realising that another man will be wanted until the first is taken away its imagination doesnt even run to that  mr britling found a kindred spirit in wilkins  wilkins was expounding his tremendous scheme for universal volunteering everybody was to be accepted everybody was to be assigned and registered andbadged  a brassard said mr britling  it doesnt matter whether we really produce a fighting force or not said wilkins everybody now is enthusiasticand serious everybody is willing to put on some kind of uniform and submit to some sort of orders and the thing to do is to catch them in the willing stage now is the time to get the country lined up and organised ready to meet the internal stresses that are bound to come later but theres no disposition whatever to welcome this universal offering its just as though this war was a treat to which only the very select friends of the war office were to be admitted and i dont admit that the national volunteers would be ineffectiveeven from a military point of view there are plenty of fit men of our age and men of proper age who are better employed at homearmament workers for example and there are all the boys under the age they may not be under the age before things are over  he was even prepared to plan uniforms  a brassard repeated mr britling and perhaps coloured strips on the revers of a coat  colours for the counties said wilkins and if there isnt coloured cloth to be got theresred flannel anything is better than leaving the mass of people to mob about  a momentary vision danced before mr britlings eyes of red flannel petticoats being torn up in a rapid improvisation of soldiers to resist a sudden invasion passing washerwomen suddenly requisitioned but one must not let oneself be laughed out of good intentions because of ridiculous accessories the idea at any rate was the sound one  the vision of what ought to be done shone brightly while mr britling and mr wilkins maintained it but presently under discouraging reminders that there were no rifles no instructors and above all the open hostility of the established authorities it faded again  afterwards in other conversations mr britling reverted to more modest ambitions  is there no clerical work no minor administrative work a man might be used for he asked  any old dugout said the man with the thin face any old doddering colonel newcome is preferred to you in that matter  mr britling emerged from his club about halfpast three with his mind rather dishevelled and with his private determination to do something promptly for his countrys needs blunted by a perplexing how his search for doors and ways where no doors and ways existed went on with a gathering sense of futility  he had a ridiculous sense of pique at being left out like a child shut out from a room in which a vitally interesting game is being played  after all it is our war he said  he caught the phrase as it dropped from his lips with a feeling that it said more than he intended he turned it over and examined it and the more he did so the more he was convinced of its truth and soundness   section 2  by night there was a new strangeness about london the authorities were trying to suppress the more brilliant illumination of the chief thoroughfares on account of the possibility of an air raid shopkeepers were being compelled to pull down their blinds and many of the big standard lights were unlit mr britling thought these precautions were very fussy and unnecessary and likely to lead to accidents amidst the traffic but it gave a rembrandtesque quality to the london scene turned it into mysterious arrangements of brown shadows and cones and bars of light at first many people were recalcitrant and here and there a restaurant or a drapers window still blazed out and broke the gloom there were also a number of insubordinate automobiles with big headlights but the police were being unusually firm  it will all glitter again in a little time he told himself  he heard an old lady who was projecting from an offending automobile at piccadilly circus in hot dispute with a police officer zeppelins indeed she said what nonsense as if they would dare to come here who would let them i should like to know  probably a friend of lady frenshams he thought stillthe idea of zeppelins over london did seem rather ridiculous to mr britling he would not have liked to have been caught talking of it himself there never had been zeppelins over london they were gas bags   section 3  on wednesday morning mr britling returned to the dower house and he was still a civilian unassigned  in the hall he found a tall figure in khaki standing and reading the times that usually lay upon the hall table the figure turned at mr britlings entry and revealed the aquiline features of mr lawrence carmine it was as if his friend had stolen a march on him  but carmines face showed nothing of the excitement and patriotic satisfaction that would have seemed natural to mr britling he was white and jaded as if he had not slept for many nights you see he explained almost apologetically of the three stars upon his sleeve i used to be a captain of volunteers he had been put in charge of a volunteer force which had been reembodied and entrusted with the care of the bridges gasworks factories and railway tunnels and with a number of other minor but necessary duties round about easinghampton ive just got to shut up my house said captain carmine and go into lodgings i confess i hate it but anyhow it cant last six months but its beastly ugh  he seemed disposed to expand that ugh and then thought better of it and presently mr britling took control of the conversation  his two days in london had filled him with matter and he was glad to have something more than hugh and teddy and mrs britling to talk it upon what was happening now in great britain he declared was adjustment it was an attempt on the part of a great unorganised nation an attempt instinctive at present rather than intelligent to readjust its government and particularly its military organisation to the new scale of warfare that germany had imposed upon the world for two strenuous decades the british navy had been growing enormously under the pressure of german naval preparations but the british military establishment had experienced no corresponding expansion it was true there had been a futile rather foolishly conducted agitation for universal military service but there had been no accumulation of material no preparation of armamentmaking machinery no planning and no foundations for any sort of organisation that would have facilitated the rapid expansion of the fighting forces of a country in a time of crisis such an idea was absolutely antagonistic to the mental habits of the british military caste the german method of incorporating all the strength and resources of the country into one national fighting machine was quite strange to the british military mindstill even after a month of war war had become the comprehensive business of the german nation to the british it was an incidental adventure in germany the nation was militarised in england the army was specialised the nation for nearly every practical purpose got along without it just as political life had also become specialised now suddenly we wanted a government to speak for every one and an army of the whole people how were we to find it  mr britling dwelt upon this idea of the specialised character of the british army and navy and government it seemed to him to be the clue to everything that was jarring in the london spectacle the army had been a thing aloof for a special end it had developed all the characteristics of a caste it had very high standards along the lines of its specialisation but it was inadaptable and conservative its exclusiveness was not so much a deliberate culture as a consequence of its detached function it touched the ordinary social body chiefly through three other specialised bodies the court the church and the stage apart from that it saw the great unofficial civilian world as something vague something unsympathetic something possibly antagonistic which it comforted itself by snubbing when it dared and tricking when it could something that projected members of parliament towards it and was stingy about money directly one grasped how apart the army lived from the ordinary life of the community from industrialism or from economic necessities directly one understood that the great mass of englishmen were simply outsiders to the war office mind just as they were outsiders to the political clique one began to realise the complete unfitness of either government or war office for the conduct of so great a national effort as was now needed these people up there did not know anything of the broad mass of english life at all they did not know how or where things were made when they wanted things they just went to a shop somewhere and got them this was the necessary psychology of a small army under a clique government nothing else was to be expected but nowsomehowthe nation had to take hold of the government that it had neglected so long  you see said mr britling repeating a phrase that was becoming more and more essential to his thoughts this is our war  of course said mr britling these things are not going to be done without a conflict we arent going to take hold of our country which we have neglected so long without a lot of internal friction but in england we can make these readjustments without revolution it is our strength  at present england is confusedbut its a healthy confusion its astir we have more things to defeat than just germany  these hosts of recruitsweary uncared for besieging the recruiting stations its symbolical our tremendous reserves of will and manhood our almost incredible insufficiency of direction  those people up there have no idea of the will that surges up in england they are timid little manoeuvring people afraid of property afraid of newspapers afraid of tradeunions they arent leading us against the germans they are just being shoved against the germans by necessity  from this mr britling broke away into a fresh addition to his already large collection of contrasts between england and germany germany was a nation which has been swallowed up and incorporated by an army and an administration the prussian military system had assimilated to itself the whole german life it was a state in a state of repletion a state that had swallowed all its people britain was not a state it was an unincorporated people the british army the british war office and the british administration had assimilated nothing they were little old partial things the british nation lay outside them beyond their understanding and tradition a formless new thing but a great thing and now this british nation this real nation the outsiders had to take up arms suddenly all the underlying ideas of that outer greater english life beyond politics beyond the services were challenged its tolerant good humour its freedom and its irresponsibility it was not simply english life that was threatened it was all the latitudes of democracy it was every liberal idea and every liberty it was civilisation in danger the uncharted liberal system had been taken by the throat it had to make good or perish  i went up to london expecting to be told what to do there is no one to tell any one what to do much less is there any one to compel us what to do  theres a war office like a college during a riot with its doors and windows barred theres a government like a cockle boat in an atlantic gale  one feels the thing ought to have come upon us like the sound of a trumpet instead until now it has been like a great noise that we just listened to in the next house and now slowly the nation awakes london is just like a dazed sleeper waking up out of a deep sleep to fire and danger tumult and cries for help near at hand the streets give you exactly that effect people are looking about and listening one feels that at any moment in a pause in a silence there may come from far away over the houses faint and little the boom of guns or the small outcries of little french or belgian villages in agony  such was the gist of mr britlings discourse  he did most of the table talk and all that mattered teddy was an assenting voice hugh was silent and apparently a little inattentive mrs britling was thinking of the courses and the servants and the boys and giving her husband only half an ear captain carmine said little and seemed to be troubled by some disagreeable preoccupation now and then he would endorse or supplement the things mr britling was saying thrice he remarked people still do not begin to understand   section 4 it was only when they sat together in the barn court out of the way of mrs britling and the children that captain carmine was able to explain his listless bearing and jaded appearance he was suffering from a bad nervous shock he had hardly taken over his command before one of his men had been killedand killed in a manner that had left a scar upon his mind  the man had been guarding a tunnel and he had been knocked down by one train when crossing the line behind another so it was that the bomb of sarajevo killed its first victim in essex captain carmine had found the body he had found the body in a cloudy moonlight he had almost fallen over it and his sensations and emotions had been eminently disagreeable he had had to drag the bodyit was very dreadfully mangledoff the permanent way the damaged almost severed head had twisted about very horribly in the uncertain light and afterwards he had found his sleeves saturated with blood he had not noted this at the time and when he had discovered it he had been sick he had thought the whole thing more horrible and hateful than any nightmare but he had succeeded in behaving with a sufficient practicality to set an example to his men since this had happened he had not had an hour of dreamless sleep  one doesnt expect to be called upon like that said captain carmine suddenly here in england when one is smoking after supper  mr britling listened to this experience with distressed brows all his talking and thinking became to him like the open page of a monthly magazine across it this bloody smear this thing of red and black was dragged   section 5  the smear was still bright red in mr britlings thoughts when teddy came to him  i must go said teddy i cant stop here any longer  go where  into khaki ive been thinking of it ever since the war began do you remember what you said when we were bullying off at hockey on bank holidaythe day before war was declared  mr britling had forgotten completely he made an effort what did i say  you said what the devil are we doing at this hockey we ought to be drilling or shooting against those confounded germans  ive never forgotten it i ought to have done it before ive been a scoutmaster in a little while they will want officers in london im told there are a lot of officers training corps putting men through the work as quickly as possible if i could go  what does letty think said mr britling after a pause this was right of coursethe only right thingand yet he was surprised  she says if youd let her try to do my work for a time  she wants you to go  of course she does said teddy she wouldnt like me to be a shirker but i cant unless you help  im quite ready to do that said mr britling but somehow i didnt think it of you i hadnt somehow thought of you  what did you think of me asked teddy  its bringing the war home to us of course you ought to goif you want to go  he reflected it was odd to find teddy in this mood strung up and serious and businesslike he felt that in the past he had done teddy injustice this young man wasnt as trivial as he had thought him  they fell to discussing ways and means there might have to be a loan for teddys outfit if he did presently secure a commission and there were one or two other little matters mr britling dismissed a ridiculous fancy that he was paying to send teddy away to something that neither that young man nor letty understood properly  the next day teddy vanished londonward on his bicycle he was going to lodge in london in order to be near his training he was zealous never before had teddy been zealous mrs teddy came to the dower house for the correspondence trying not to look selfconscious and important  two mondays later a very brighteyed excited little boy came running to mr britling who was smoking after lunch in the rose garden daddy squealed the small boy teddy in khaki  the other junior britling danced in front of the hero who was walking beside mrs britling and trying not to be too aggressively a soldierly figure he looked a very man in khaki and more of a boy than ever mrs teddy came behind quietly elated  mr britling had a recurrence of that same disagreeable fancy that these young people didnt know exactly what they were going into he wished he was in khaki himself then he fancied this compunction wouldnt trouble him quite so much  the afternoon with them deepened his conviction that they really didnt in the slightest degree understand life had been so good to them hitherto that even the idea of teddys going off to the war seemed a sort of fun to them it was just a thing he was doing a serious seriously amusing and very creditable thing it involved his dressing up in these unusual clothes and receiving salutes in the street they discussed every possible aspect of his military outlook with the zest of children who recount the merits of a new game they were putting teddy through his stages at a tremendous pace in quite a little time he thought he would be given the chance of a commission  they want subalterns badly already theyve taken nearly a third of our people he said and added with the wistfulness of one who glances at inaccessible delights one or two may get out to the front quite soon  he spoke as a young actor might speak of a star part and with a touch of the quality of one who longs to travel in strange lands one must be patient things come at last  if im killed she gets eighty pounds a year teddy explained among many other particulars  he smiledthe smile of a confident immortal at this amusing idea  hes my little annuity said letty also smiling dead or alive  well miss teddy in all sorts of ways said mr britling  its only for the duration of the war said teddy and lettys very intelligent ive done my best to chasten the evil in her  if you think youre going to get back your job after the war said letty youre very much mistaken im going to raise the standard  you said teddy regarding her coldly and proceeded ostentatiously to talk of other things   section 6  hughs going to be in khaki too the elder junior told teddy hes too young to go out in kitcheners army but hes joined the territorials he went off on thursday i wish gilbert and me was older  mr britling had known his sons purpose since the evening of teddys announcement  hugh had come to his fathers study as he was sitting musing at his writingdesk over the important question whether he should continue his examination of war uninterruptedly or whether he should not put that on one side for a time and set himself to state as clearly as possible the not too generally recognised misfit between the will and strength of britain on the one hand and her administrative and military organisation on the other he felt that an enormous amount of human enthusiasm and energy was being refused and wasted that if things went on as they were going there would continue to be a quite disastrous shortage of gear and that some broadening change was needed immediately if the swift exemplary victory over germany that his soul demanded was to be ensured suppose he were to write some noisy articles at once an article for instance to be called the war of the mechanics or the war of gear and another on without civil strength there is no victory if he wrote such things would they be noted or would they just vanish indistinguishably into the general mental tumult would they be audible and helpful shouts or just waste of shouting that at least was what he supposed himself to be thinking it was at any rate the main current of his thinking but all the same just outside the circle of his attention a number of other things were dimly apprehended bobbing up and down in the flood and ready at the slightest chance to swirl into the centre of his thoughts there was for instance captain carmine in the moonlight lugging up a railway embankment something horrible something loose and wet and warm that had very recently been a man there was teddy serious and patrioticfilling a futile penman with incredulous respect there was the thinfaced man at the club and a curious satisfaction he had betrayed in the public disarrangement and there was hugh particularly there was hugh silent but watchful the boy never babbled he had his mothers gift of deep dark silences out of which she was wont to flash a black princess waving a sword he wandered for a little while among memories but hugh didnt come out like that though it always seemed possible he mightperhaps he didnt come out because he was a son revelation to his father wasnt his business what was he thinking of it all what was he going to do mr britling was acutely anxious that his son should volunteer he was almost certain that he would volunteer but there was just a little shadow of doubt whether some extraordinary subtlety of mind mightnt have carried the boy into a pacifist attitude no that was impossible in the face of belgium but as greatlyand far more deeply in the warm flesh of his beingdid mr britling desire that no harm no evil should happen to hugh  the door opened and hugh came in  mr britling glanced over his shoulder with an affectation of indifference hallo he said what do you want  hugh walked awkwardly to the hearthrug  oh he said in an offhand tone i suppose ive got to go soldiering for a bit i just thoughtid rather like to go off with a man i know tomorrow  mr britlings manner remained casual  its the only thing to do now im afraid he said  he turned in his chair and regarded his son what do you mean to do otc  i dont think i should make much of an officer i hate giving orders to other people we thought wed just go together into the essex regiment as privates  there was a little pause both father and son had rehearsed this scene in their minds several times and now they found that they had no use for a number of sentences that had been most effective in these rehearsals mr britling scratched his cheek with the end of his pen im glad you want to go hugh he said  i dont want to go said hugh with his hands deep in his pockets i want to go and work with cardinal but this job has to be done by every one havent you been saying as much all day its like turning out to chase a burglar or suppress a mad dog its like necessary sanitation  you arent attracted by soldiering  not a bit i wont pretend it daddy i think the whole business is a bore germany seems to me now just like some heavy horrible dirty mass that has fallen across belgium and france weve got to shove the stuff back again thats all  he volunteered some further remarks to his fathers silence  you know i cant get up a bit of tootle about this business he said i think killing people or getting killed is a thoroughly nasty habit i expect my share will be just drilling and fatigue duties and route marches and loafing here in england  you cant possibly go out for two years said mr britling as if he regretted it  a slight hesitation appeared in hughs eyes i suppose not he said  things ought to be over by thenanyhow mr britling added betraying his real feelings  so its really just helping at the furthest end of the shove hugh endorsed but still with that touch of reservation in his manner  the pause had the effect of closing the theoretical side of the question where do you propose to enlist said mr britling coming down to practical details   section 7  the battle of the marne passed into the battle of the aisne and then the long lines of the struggle streamed northwestward until the british were back in belgium failing to clutch menin and then defending ypres the elation of september followed the bedazzlement and dismay of august into the chapter of forgotten moods and mr britlings sense of the magnitude the weight and duration of this war beyond all wars increased steadily the feel of it was less and less a feeling of crisis and more and more a feeling of new conditions it wasnt as it had seemed at first the end of one human phase and the beginning of another it was in itself a phase it was a new way of living and still he could find no real point of contact for himself with it all except the point of his pen only at his writingdesk and more particularly at night were the great presences of the conflict his yet he was always desiring some more personal and physical participation  hugh came along one day in october in an illfitting uniform looking already coarser in fibre and with a nose scorched red by the autumnal sun he said the life was rough but it made him feel extraordinarily well perhaps man was made to toil until he dropped asleep from exhaustion to fast for ten or twelve hours and then eat like a wolf he was acquiring a taste for woodbine cigarettes and a heady variety of mineral waters called monsters he feared promotion he felt he could never take the high line with other human beings demanded of a corporal he was still trying to read a little chemistry and crystallography but it didnt go with the life in the scanty leisure of a recruit in training it was more agreeable to lie about and write doggerel verses and draw caricatures of the men in ones platoon invited to choose what he liked by his family he demanded a large tuckbox such as he used to have at school only much larger and a big tin of insect powder it must be able to kill ticks  when he had gone the craving for a personal share in the nations physical exertions became overpowering in mr britling he wanted he felt to get his skin into it he had decided that the volunteer movement was a hopeless one the war office after a stout resistance to any volunteer movement at all decided to recognise it in such a manner as to make it ridiculous the volunteers were to have no officers and no uniforms that could be remotely mistaken for those of the regulars so that in the event of an invasion the germans would be able to tell what they had to deal with miles away wilkins found his conception of a whole nation all enrolled all listed and badged according to capacity his dream of every one falling into place in one great voluntary national effort treated as the childish dreaming of that most ignorant of all human types a novelist punch was delicately funny about him he was represented as wearing a preposterous cocked hat of his own design designing cocked hats for every one wilkins was told to shut up in a multitude of anonymous letters and publicly and privately to leave things to kitchener to bellow in loud clear tones leave things to kitchener and to depart for the theatre or the river or an automobile tour was felt very generally at that time to be the proper conduct for a patriot there was a very general persuasion that to become a volunteer when one ought to be just modestly doing nothing at all was in some obscure way a form of disloyalty  so mr britling was out of conceit with volunteering and instead he went and was duly sworn and entrusted with the badge of a special constable the duties of a special constable were chiefly not to understand what was going on in the military sphere and to do what he was told in the way of watching and warding conceivably vulnerable points he had also to be available in the event of civil disorder mr britling was provided with a truncheon and sent out to guard various culverts bridges and fords in the hilly country to the northwestward of matchings easy it was never very clear to him what he would do if he found a motorcar full of armed enemies engaged in undermining a culvert or treacherously deepening some strategic ford he supposed he would either engage them in conversation or hit them with his truncheon or perhaps do both things simultaneously but as he really did not believe for a moment that any human being was likely to tamper with the telegraphs telephones ways and appliances committed to his care his uncertainty did not trouble him very much he prowled the lonely lanes and paths in the darkness and became better acquainted with a multitude of intriguing little cries and noises that came from the hedges and coverts at night one night he rescued a young leveret from a stoat who seemed more than half inclined to give him battle for its prey until he cowed and defeated it with the glare of his electric torch  as he prowled the countryside under the great hemisphere of essex sky or leant against fences or sat drowsily upon gates or sheltered from wind and rain under ricks or sheds he had much time for meditation and his thoughts went down and down below his first surface impressions of the war he thought no longer of the rights and wrongs of this particular conflict but of the underlying forces in mankind that made war possible he planned no more ingenious treaties and conventions between the nations and instead he faced the deeper riddles of essential evil and of conceivable changes in the heart of man and the rain assailed him and thorns tore him and the soaked soft meadows bogged and betrayed his wandering feet and the little underworld of the hedges and ditches hissed and squealed in the darkness and pursued and fled and devoured or were slain  and one night in april he was perplexed by a commotion among the pheasants and a barking of distant dogs and then to his great astonishment he heard noises like a distant firework display and saw something like a phantom yellowish fountainpen in the sky far away to the east lit intermittently by a quivering searchlight and going very swiftly and after he had rubbed his eyes and looked again he realised that he was looking at a zeppelina zeppelin flying londonward over essex  and all that night was wonder   section 8  while mr britling was trying to find his duty in the routine of a special constable mrs britling set to work with great energy to attend various classes and qualify herself for red cross work and early in october came the great drive of the germans towards antwerp and the sea the great drive that was apparently designed to reach calais and which swept before it multitudes of flemish refugees there was an exodus of all classes from antwerp into holland and england and then a huge process of depopulation in flanders and the pas de calais this flood came to the eastern and southern parts of england and particularly to london and there hastily improvised organisations distributed it to a number of local committees each of which took a share of the refugees hired and furnished unoccupied houses for the use of the penniless and assisted those who had means into comfortable quarters the matchings easy committee found itself with accommodation for sixty people and with a miscellaneous bag of thirty individuals entrusted to its care who had been part of the load of a little pirate steamboat from ostend there were two flemish peasant families and the rest were more or less middleclass refugees from antwerp they were brought from the station to the tithe barn at claverings and there distributed under the personal supervision of lady homartyn and her agent among those who were prepared for their entertainment there was something like competition among the wouldbe hosts everybody was glad of the chance of doing something and anxious to show these belgians what england thought of their plucky little country mr britling was proud to lead off a mr van der pant a neat little bearded man in a black tailcoat a black bowler hat and a knitted muffler with a large rucksack and a conspicuously foreignlooking bicycle to the hospitalities of dower house mr van der pant had escaped from antwerp at the eleventh hour he had caught a severe cold and it would seem lost his wife and family in the process he had much to tell mr britling and in his zeal to tell it he did not at once discover that though mr britling knew french quite well he did not know it very rapidly  the dinner that night at the dower house marked a distinct fresh step in the approach of the great war to the old habits and securities of matchings easy the war had indeed filled every ones mind to the exclusion of all other topics since its very beginning it had carried off herr heinrich to germany teddy to london and hugh to colchester it had put a special brassard round mr britlings arm and carried him out into the night given mrs britling several certificates and interrupted the frequent visits and gossip of mr lawrence carmine but so far it had not established a direct contact between the life of matchings easy and the grim business of shot shell and bayonet at the front but now here was the dower house accomplishing wonderful idioms in anglofrench and an animated guest telling themsometimes one understood clearly and sometimes the meaning was cloudedof men blown to pieces under his eyes of fragments of human beings lying about in the streets there was trouble over the expression omoplate dune femme until one of the youngsters got the dictionary and found out it was the shoulderblade of a woman of pools of bloodeverywhereand of flight in the darkness  mr van der pant had been in charge of the dynamos at the antwerp power station he had been keeping the electrified wires in the entanglements alive and he had stuck to his post until the german high explosives had shattered his wires and rendered his dynamos useless he gave vivid little pictures of the noises of the bombardment of the dead lying casually in the open spaces of the failure of the german guns to hit the bridge of boats across which the bulk of the defenders and refugees escaped he produced a little tourists map of the city of antwerp and dotted at it with a pencilcase thewhat do you callobus ah shells fell so and so and so across here he had fled on his bécane and along here and here he had carried off his rifle and hid it with the rifles of various other belgians between floor and ceiling of a house in zeebrugge he had found the pirate steamer in the harbour its captain resolved to extract the uttermost fare out of every refugee he took to london when they were all aboard and started they found there was no food except the hard ration biscuits of some belgian soldiers they had portioned this out like shipwrecked people on a raft the mer had been calme thank heaven all night they had been pumping he had helped with the pumps but mr van der pant hoped still to get a reckoning with the captain of that ship  mr van der pant had had shots at various zeppelins when the zeppelins came to antwerp everybody turned out on the roofs and shot at them he was contemptuous of zeppelins he made derisive gestures to express his opinion of them they could do nothing unless they came low and if they came low you could hit them one which ventured down had been riddled it had had to drop all its bombsluckily they fell in an open fieldin order to make its lame escape it was all nonsense to say as the english papers did that they took part in the final bombardment not a zeppelin so he talked and the britling family listened and understood as much as they could and replied and questioned in anglofrench here was a man who but a few days ago had been steering his bicycle in the streets of antwerp to avoid shell craters pools of blood and the tornoff arms and shoulderblades of women he had seen houses flaring set afire by incendiary bombs and once at a corner he had been knocked off his bicycle by the pouff of a bursting shell not only were these things in the same world with us they were sitting at our table  he told one grim story of an invalid woman unable to move lying in bed in her appartement and of how her husband went out on the balcony to look at the zeppelin there was a great noise of shooting ever and again he would put his head back into the room and tell her things and then after a time he was silent and looked in no more she called to him and called again becoming frightened she raised herself by a great effort and peered through the glass at first she was too puzzled to understand what had happened he was hanging over the front of the balcony with his head twisted oddly twisted and shattered he had been killed by shrapnel fired from the outer fortifications  these are the things that happen in histories and stories they do not happen at matchings easy  mr van der pant did not seem to be angry with the germans but he manifestly regarded them as people to be killed he denounced nothing that they had done he related they were just an evil accident that had happened to belgium and mankind they had to be destroyed he gave mr britling an extraordinary persuasion that knives were being sharpened in every cellar in brussels and antwerp against the day of inevitable retreat of a resolution to exterminate the invader that was far too deep to be vindictive and the man was most amazingly unconquered mr britling perceived the label on his habitual dinner wine with a slight embarrassment do you care he asked to drink a german wine this is berncasteler from the moselle mr van der pant reflected but it is a good wine he said after the peace it will be belgian yes if we are to be safe in the future from such a war as this we must have our boundaries right up to the rhine  so he sat and talked flushed and as it were elated by the vividness of all that he had undergone he had no trace of tragic quality no hint of subjugation but for his costume and his trimmed beard and his language he might have been a dubliner or a cockney  he was astonishingly cut off from all his belongings his house in antwerp was abandoned to the invader valuables and cherished objects very skilfully buried in the garden he had no change of clothing except what the rucksack held his only footwear were the boots he came in he could not get on any of the slippers in the house they were all too small for him until suddenly mrs britling bethought herself of herr heinrichs pair still left unpacked upstairs she produced them and they fitted exactly it seemed only poetical justice a foretaste of national compensations to annex them to belgium forthwith  also it became manifest that mr van der pant was cut off from all his family and suddenly he became briskly critical of the english way of doing things his wife and child had preceded him to england crossing by ostend and folkestone a fortnight ago her parents had come in august both groups had been seized upon by improvised british organisations and very thoroughly and completely lost he had written to the belgian embassy and they had referred him to a committee in london and the committee had begun its services by discovering a madame van der pant hitherto unknown to him at camberwell and displaying a certain suspicion and hostility when he said she would not do there had been some futile telegrams what asked mr van der pant ought one to do  mr britling temporised by saying he would make inquiries and put mr van der pant off for two days then he decided to go up to london with him and make inquiries on the spot mr van der pant did not discover his family but mr britling discovered the profound truth of a comment of herr heinrichs which he had hitherto considered utterly trivial but which had nevertheless stuck in his memory the english herr heinrich had said do not understanding indexing it is the root of all good organisation  finally mr van der pant adopted the irregular course of asking every belgian he met if they had seen any one from his district in antwerp if they had heard of the name of van der pant if they had encountered soandso or soandso and by obstinacy and good fortune he really got on to the track of madame van der pant she had been carried off into kent and a day later the dower house was the scene of a happy reunion madame was a slender lady dressed well and plainly with a belgian common sense and a catholic reserve and andré was like a child of wax delicate and charming and unsubstantial it seemed incredible that he could ever grow into anything so buoyant and incessant as his father the britling boys had to be warned not to damage him a sittingroom was handed over to the belgians for their private use and for a time the two families settled into the dower house side by side anglofrench became the table language of the household it hampered mr britling very considerably and both families set themselves to much unrecorded observation much unspoken mutual criticism and the exercise of great patience it was tiresome for the english to be tied to a language that crippled all spontaneous talk these linguistic gymnastics were fun to begin with but soon they became very troublesome and the belgians suspected sensibilities in their hosts and a vast unwritten code of etiquette that did not exist at first they were always waiting as it were to be invited or told or included they seemed always deferentially backing out from intrusions moreover they would not at first reveal what food they liked or what they didnt like or whether they wanted more or less but these difficulties were soon smoothed away they anglicised quickly and cleverly andré grew bold and cheerful and lost his first distrust of his rather older english playmates every day at lunch he produced a new carefully prepared piece of english though for some time he retained a marked preference for good morning saire and thank you very mush over all other locutions and fell back upon them on all possible and many impossible occasions and he could do some sleightofhand tricks with remarkable skill and humour and fold paper with quite astonishing results meanwhile mr van der pant sought temporary employment in england went for long rides upon his bicycle exchanged views with mr britling upon a variety of subjects and became a wonderful player of hockey  he played hockey with an extraordinary zest and nimbleness always he played in the tail coat and the knitted muffler was never relinquished he treated the game entirely as an occasion for quick tricks and personal agility he bounded about the field like a kitten he pirouetted suddenly he leapt into the air and came down in new directions his freshcoloured face was alive with delight the coat tails and the muffler trailed and swished about breathlessly behind his agility he never passed to other players he never realised his appointed place in the game he sought simply to make himself a leaping screen about the ball as he drove it towards the goal but andré he would not permit to play at all and madame played like a lady like a madonna like a saint carrying the instrument of her martyrdom the game and its enthusiasms flowed round her and receded from her she remained quite valiant but tolerant restrained doing her best to do the extraordinary things required of her but essentially a being of passive dignities living chiefly for them letty careering by her keen and swift was like a creature of a different species  mr britling cerebrated abundantly about these contrasts  what has been blown in among us by these german shells he said is essentially a catholic family blown clean out of its setting we who are reallyneoeuropeans  at first you imagine there is nothing separating us but language presently you find that language is the least of our separations these people are people living upon fundamentally different ideas from ours ideas far more definite and complete than ours you imagine that home in antwerp as something much more rounded off much more closed in a cell a real social unit a different thing altogether from this place of meeting our boys play cheerfully with all comers little andré hasnt learnt to play with any outside children at all we must seem incredibly open to these van der pants a house without sides last sunday i could not find out the names of the two girls who came on bicycles and played so well they came with kitty westropp and van der pant wanted to know how they were related to us or how was it they came  look at madame shes built on a fundamentally different plan from any of our womenkind here tennis the bicycle coeducation the twostep the higher education of women say these things over to yourself and think of her its like talking of a nun in riding breeches shes a specialised woman specialising in womanhood her sphere is the home soft trailing draping skirts slow movements a veiled face for no oriental veil could be more effectual than her beautiful catholic quiet catholicism invented the invisible purdah she is far more akin to that sweet little indian lady with the wonderful robes whom carmine brought over with her tall husband last summer than she is to letty or cissie she too undertook to play hockey and played it very much as madame van der pant played it  the more i see of our hockey said mr britling the more wonderful it seems to me as a touchstone of character and culture and breeding  mr manning to whom he was delivering this discourse switched him on to a new track by asking what he meant by neoeuropean  its a bad phrase said mr britling ill withdraw it let me try and state exactly what i have in mind i mean something that is coming up in america and here and the scandinavian countries and russia a new culture an escape from the levantine religion and the catholic culture that came to us from the mediterranean let me drop neoeuropean let me say northern we are northerners the key the heart the nucleus and essence of every culture is its conception of the relations of men and women and this new culture tends to diminish the specialisation of women as women to let them out from the cell of the home into common citizenship with men its a new culture still in process of development which will make men more social and cooperative and women bolder swifter more responsible and less cloistered it minimises instead of exaggerating the importance of sex  and said mr britling in very much the tones in which a preacher might say sixthly it is just all this northern tendency that this world struggle is going to release this war is pounding through europe smashing up homes dispersing and mixing homes setting madame van der pant playing hockey and andré climbing trees with my young ruffians it is killing young men by the million altering the proportions of the sexes for a generation bringing women into business and office and industry destroying the accumulated wealth that kept so many of them in refined idleness flooding the world with strange doubts and novel ideas   section 9  but the conflict of manners and customs that followed the invasion of the english villages by french and belgian refugees did not always present the immigrants as catholics and the hosts as neoeuropean in the case of mr dimple it was the other way round he met mr britling in claverings park and told him his troubles  of course he said we have to do our utmost for brave little belgium i would be the last to complain of any little inconvenience one may experience in doing that still i must confess i think you and dear mrs britling are fortunate exceptionally fortunate in the belgians you have got my guestsits unfortunatethe man is some sort of journalist and quiteoh much too muchan atheist an open positive one not simply honest doubt im quite prepared for honest doubt nowadays you and i have no quarrel over that but he is aggressive he makes remarks about miracles quite derogatory remarks and not always in french sometimes he almost speaks english and in front of my sister and he goes out he says looking for a café he never finds a café but he certainly finds every public house within a radius of miles and he comes back smelling dreadfully of beer when i drop a little hint he blames the beer he says it is not good beerour good essex beer he doesnt understand any of our simple ways hes sophisticated the girls about here wear belgian flagsand air their little bits of french and he takes it as an encouragement only yesterday there was a scene it seems he tried to kiss the hickson girl at the innmaudie and his wife a great big slow womanin every way she isample its dreadful even to seem to criticise but i do so wish she would not see fit to sit down and nourish her baby in my poor old bachelor drawingroomoften at the most unseasonable times andso lavishly  mr britling attempted consolations  but anyhow said mr dimple im better off than poor dear mrs bynne she secured two milliners she insisted upon them and their clothes were certainly beautifully madeeven my poor old unworldly eye could tell that and she thought two milliners would be so useful with a large family like hers they certainly said they were milliners but it seemsi dont know what we shall do about them my dear mr britling those young women are anything but millinersanything but milliners  a faint gleam of amusement was only too perceptible through the good mans horror  sirens my dear mr britling sirens by profession   section 10  october passed into november and day by day mr britling was forced to apprehend new aspects of the war to think and rethink the war to have his first conclusions checked and tested twisted askew replaced his thoughts went far and wide and deeperuntil all his earlier writing seemed painfully shallow to him seemed a mere automatic response of obvious comments to the stimulus of the wars surprise as his ideas became subtler and profounder they became more difficult to express he talked less he became abstracted and irritable at table to two people in particular mr britling found his real ideas inexpressible to mr direck and to mr van der pant  each of these gentlemen brought with him the implication or the intimation of a critical attitude towards england it was all very well for mr britling himself to be critical of england that is an englishmans privilege to hear mr van der pant questioning british efficiency or to suspect mr direck of high thin american superiorities to war was almost worse than to hear mrs harrowdean saying hostile things about edith it roused an even acuter protective emotion  in the case of mr van der pant matters were complicated by the difficulty of the language which made anything but the crudest statements subject to incalculable misconception  mr van der pant had not the extreme tactfulness of his so typically catholic wife he made it only too plain that he thought the british postal and telegraph service slow and slack and the management of the great eastern branch lines wasteful and inefficient he said the workmen in the fields and the workmen he saw upon some cottages near the junction worked slowlier and with less interest than he had ever seen any workman display in all his life before he marvelled that mr britling lit his house with acetylene and not electric light he thought fresh eggs were insanely dear and his opinion of matchings easy pigkeeping was uncomplimentary the roads he said were not a means of getting from place to place they were a dédale he drew derisive maps with his finger on the tablecloth of the lane system about the dower house he was astonished that there was no café in matchings easy he declared that the public house to which he went with considerable expectation was no public house at all it was just a sly place for drinking beer all these were things mr britling might have remarked himself from a belgian refugee he found them intolerable  he set himself to explain to mr van der pant firstly that these things did not matter in the slightest degree the national attention the national interest ran in other directions and secondly that they were as a matter of fact and on the whole merits slightly disguised he produced a pleasant theory that england is really not the englishmans field it is his breeding place his resting place a place not for efficiency but good humour if mr van der pant were to make inquiries he would find there was scarcely a home in matchings easy that had not sent some energetic representative out of england to become one of the english of the world england was the last place in which english energy was spent these hedges these dilatory roads were full of associations there was a road that turned aside near market saffron to avoid turks wood it had been called turks wood first in the fourteenth century after a man of that name he quoted chestertons happy verses to justify these winding lanes   the road turned first towards the left   where perkins quarry made the cleft   the path turned next towards the right   because the mastiff used to bite  and again   and i should say they wound about   to find the town of roundabout   the merry town of roundabout   that makes the world go round  if our easygoing ways hampered a hard efficiency they did at least develop humour and humanity our diplomacy at any rate had not failed us  he did not believe a word of this stuff his deep irrational love for england made him say these things for years he had been getting himself into hot water because he had been writing and hinting just such criticisms as mr van der pant expressed so bluntly but he wasnt going to accept foreign help in dissecting his mother  and another curious effect that mr van der pant had upon mr britling was to produce an obstinate confidence about the war and the nearness of the german collapse he would promise mr van der pant that he should be back in antwerp before may that the germans would be over the rhine by july he knew perfectly well that his ignorance of all the military conditions was unqualified but still he could not restrain himself from this kind of thing so soon as he began to speak entente cordialeanglofrench that is to say something in his relationship to mr van der pant obliged him to be acutely and absurdly the protecting british at times he felt like a conscious bankrupt talking off the hour of disclosure but indeed all that mr britling was trying to say against the difficulties of a strange language and an alien temperament was that the honour of england would never be cleared until belgium was restored and avenged  while mr britling was patrolling unimportant roads and entertaining mr van der pant with discourses upon the nearness of victory and the subtle estimableness of all that was indolent wasteful and evasive in english life the war was passing from its first swift phases into a slower grimmer struggle the german retreat ended at the aisne and the long outflanking manoeuvres of both hosts towards the channel began the english attempts to assist belgium in october came too late for the preservation of antwerp and after a long and complicated struggle in flanders the british failed to outflank the german right lost ghent menin and the belgian coast but held ypres and beat back every attempt of the enemy to reach dunkirk and calais meanwhile the smaller german colonies and islands were falling to the navy the australian battleship sydney smashed the emden at cocos island and the british naval disaster of coronel was wiped out by the battle of the falklands the russians were victorious upon their left and took lemberg and after some vicissitudes of fortune advanced to przemysl occupying the larger part of galicia but the disaster of tannenberg had broken their progress in east prussia and the germans were pressing towards warsaw turkey had joined the war and suffered enormous losses in the caucasus the dardanelles had been shelled for the first time and the british were at basra on the euphrates   section 11  the christmas of 1914 found england whose landscape had hitherto been almost as peaceful and soldierless as massachusetts already far gone along the path of transformation into a country full of soldiers and munition makers and military supplies the soldiers came first on the wellknown and greatly admired british principle of first catch your hare and then build your kitchen always before christmas had been a time of much gaiety and dressing up and prancing and twostepping at the dower house but this year everything was too uncertain to allow of any gathering of guests hugh got leave for the day after christmas but teddy was tied and cissie and letty went off with the small boy to take lodgings near him the van der pants had hoped to see an english christmas at matchings easy but within three weeks of christmas day mr van der pant found a job that he could do in nottingham and carried off his family the two small boys cheered their hearts with paper decorations but the christmas tree was condemned as too german and it was discovered that santa claus had suddenly become old father christmas again the small boys discovered that the price of lead soldiers had risen and were unable to buy electric torches on which they had set their hearts there was to have been a christmas party at claverings but at the last moment lady homartyn had to hurry off to an orphan nephew who had been seriously wounded near ypres and the light of claverings was darkened  soon after christmas there were rumours of an impending descent of the headquarters staff of the southeastern army upon claverings then mr britling found lady homartyn back from france and very indignant because after all the headquarters were to go to lady wensleydale at ladyholt it was she felt a reflection upon claverings lady homartyn became still more indignant when presently the new armies which were gathering now all over england like floods in a lowlying meadow came pouring into the parishes about claverings to the extent of a battalion and a territorial battery mr britling heard of their advent only a day or two before they arrived there came a bright young officer with an orderly billeting he was much exercised to get as he expressed it several times a quart into a pint bottle he was greatly pleased with the barn he asked the size of it and did calculations he could stick twentyfive men into iteasy it would go far to solve his problems he could manage without coming into the house at all it was a ripping place no end  but beds said mr britling  lord they dont want beds said the young officer  the whole britling family who were lamenting the loss of their belgians welcomed the coming of the twentyfive with great enthusiasm it made them feel that they were doing something useful once more for three days mrs britling had to feed her new lodgersthe kitchen motors had as usual gone astrayand she did so in a style that made their boastings about their billet almost insufferable to the rest of their battery the billeting allowance at that time was ninepence a head and mr britling ashamed of making a profit out of his country supplied not only generous firing and lighting but unlimited cigarettes cards and games illustrated newspapers a cocoa supper with such little surprises as sprats and jam rolypoly and a number of more incidental comforts the men arrived fasting under the command of two very sage middleaged corporals and responded to mrs britlings hospitalities by a number of good resolutions many of which they kept they never made noises after halfpast ten or at least only now and then when a singsong broke out with unusual violence they got up and went out at five or six in the morning without a sound they were almost inconveniently helpful with washingup and tidying round  in quite a little time mrs britlings mind had adapted itself to the spectacle of halfadozen young men in khaki breeches and shirts performing their toilets in and about her scullery or improvising an unsanctioned game of football between the hockey goals these men were not the miscellaneous men of the new armies they were the earlier territorial type with no heroics about them they came from the midlands and their two middleaged corporals kept them well in hand and ruled them like a band of brothers but they had an illegal side that developed in directions that set mr britling theorising they seemed for example to poach by nature as children play and sing they possessed a promiscuous white dog they began to add rabbits to their supper menu unaccountable rabbits one night there was a mighty smell of frying fish from the kitchen and the cook reported trout trout said mr britling to one of the corporals now where did you chaps get trout  the fisherman they said had got them with a hair noose they produced the fisherman of whom they were manifestly proud it was he explained a method of fishing he had learnt when in new york harbour he had been a stoker he displayed a confidence in mr britling that made that gentleman an accessory after his offence his very serious offence against prewar laws and customs it was plain that the trout were the trout that mr pumshock the stockbroker and amateur gentleman had preserved so carefully in the easy hitherto the countryside had been forced to regard mr pumshocks trout with an almost superstitious respect a year ago young snooker had done a month for one of those very trout but now things were different  but i dont really fancy freshwater fish said the fisherman its just the ketchin of em i like  and a few weeks later the trumpeter an angelfaced freckled child with deepblue eyes brought in a dozen partridge eggs which he wanted mary to cook for him  the domesticity of the sacred birds it was clear was no longer safe in england  then again the big guns would go swinging down the road and into claverings park and perform various exercises with commendable smartness and a profound disregard for lady homartyns known objection to any departure from the public footpath  and one afternoon as mr britling took his constitutional walk a reverie was set going in his mind by the sight of a neglectedlooking pheasant with a white collar the world of matchings easy was getting full now of such elderly birds would that go on again after the war he imagined his son hugh as a grandfather telling the little ones about parks and preserves and game laws and footmen and butlers and the marvellous game of golf and how suddenly mars came tramping through the land in khaki and all these things faded and vanished so that presently it was discovered they were gone     chapter the third  malignity   section 1  and while the countryside of england changed steadily from its lax pacific amenity to the likeness of a rather slovenly armed camp while longfixed boundaries shifted and dissolved and a great irreparable wasting of the worlds resources gathered way mr britling did his duty as a special constable gave his eldest son to the territorials entertained belgians petted his soldiers in the barn helped teddy to his commission contributed to war charities sold out securities at a loss and subscribed to the war loan and thought thought endlessly about the war  he could think continuously day by day of nothing else his mind was as caught as a galley slave as unable to escape from tugging at this oar all his universe was a magnetic field which oriented everything whether he would have it so or not to this one polar question  his thoughts grew firmer and clearer they went deeper and wider his first superficial judgments were endorsed and deepened or replaced by others he thought along the lonely lanes at night he thought at his desk he thought in bed he thought in his bath he tried over his thoughts in essays and leading articles and reviewed them and corrected them now and then came relaxation and lassitude but never release the war towered over him like a vigilant teacher day after day week after week regardless of fatigue and impatience holding a rod in its hand   section 2  certain things had to be forced upon mr britling because they jarred so greatly with his habits of mind that he would never have accepted them if he could have avoided doing so  notably he would not recognise at first the extreme bitterness of this war he would not believe that the attack upon britain and western europe generally expressed the concentrated emotion of a whole nation he thought that the allies were in conflict with a system and not with a national will he fought against the persuasion that the whole mass of a great civilised nation could be inspired by a genuine and sustained hatred hostility was an uncongenial thing to him he would not recognise that the greater proportion of human beings are more readily hostile than friendly he did his best to believein his and now war ends he did his best to make other people believethat this war was the perverse exploit of a small group of people of limited but powerful influences an outrage upon the general geniality of mankind the cruelty mischief and futility of war were so obvious to him that he was almost apologetic in asserting them he believed that war had but to begin and demonstrate its quality among the western nations in order to unify them all against its repetition they would exclaim but we cant do things like this to one another he saw the aggressive imperialism of germany called to account even by its own people a struggle a collapse a liberalminded conference of world powers and a universal resumption of amiability upon a more assured basis of security he believedand many people in england believed with himthat a great section of the germans would welcome triumphant allies as their liberators from intolerable political obsessions  the english because of their insularity had been political amateurs for endless generations it was their supreme vice it was their supreme virtue to be easygoing they had lived in an atmosphere of comedy and denied in the whole tenor of their lives that life is tragic not even the americans had been more isolated the americans had had their indians their negroes their war of secession until the great war the channel was as broad as the atlantic for holding off every vital challenge even ireland was awaya fourhour crossing and so the english had developed to the fullest extent the virtues and vices of safety and comfort they had a hatred of science and dramatic behaviour they could see no reason for exactness or intensity they disliked proceeding to extremes ultimately everything would turn out all right but they knew what it is to be carried into conflicts by energetic minorities and the trick of circumstances and they were ready to understand the case of any other country which has suffered that fate all their habits inclined them to fight goodtemperedly and comfortably to quarrel with a government and not with a people it took mr britling at least a couple of months of warfare to understand that the germans were fighting in an altogether different spirit  the first intimations of this that struck upon his mind were the news of the behaviour of the kaiser and the berlin crowd upon the declaration of war and the violent treatment of the british subjects seeking to return to their homes everywhere such people had been insulted and illtreated it was the spontaneous expression of a longgathered bitterness while the british ambassador was being howled out of berlin the german ambassador to england was taking a farewell stroll quite unmolested in st jamess park one item that struck particularly upon mr britlings imagination was the story of the chorus of young women who assembled on the railway platform of the station through which the british ambassador was passing to singto his drawn blindsdeutschland deutschland über alles mr britling could imagine those young people probably dressed more or less uniformly in white with flushed faces and shining eyes letting their voices go full throated in the modern german way  and then came stories of atrocities stories of the shooting of old men and the butchery of children by the wayside stories of wounded men bayoneted or burnt alive of massacres of harmless citizens of looting and filthy outrages  mr britling did his utmost not to believe these things they contradicted his habitual world they produced horrible strains in his mind they might he hoped be misreported so as to seem more violent or less justifiable than they were they might be the acts of stray criminals and quite disconnected from the normal operations of the war here and there some weakminded officer may have sought to make himself terrible and as for the bombardment of cathedrals and the crime of louvain well mr britling was prepared to argue that gothic architecture is not sacrosanct if military necessity cuts through it it was only after the war had been going on some months that mr britlings fluttering unwilling mind was pinned down by official reports and a cloud of witnesses to a definite belief in the grim reality of systematic rape and murder destruction dirtiness and abominable compulsions that blackened the first rush of the prussians into belgium and champagne  they came hating and threatening the lands they outraged they sought occasion to do frightful deeds when they could not be frightful in the houses they occupied then to the best of their ability they were destructive and filthy the facts took mr britling by the throat  the first thing that really pierced mr britling with the conviction that there was something essentially different in the english and the german attitude towards the war was the sight of a bale of german comic papers in the study of a friend in london they were filled with caricatures of the allies and more particularly of the english and they displayed a force and quality of passionan incredible force and quality of passion their amazing hate and their amazing filthiness alike overwhelmed mr britling there was no appearance of national pride or national dignity but a bellowing patriotism and a limitless desire to hurt and humiliate they spat they were red in the face and they spat he sat with these violent sheets in his handsashamed  but i say he said feebly its the sort of thing that might come out of a lunatic asylum  one incredible craving was manifest in every one of them the german caricaturist seemed unable to represent his enemies except in extremely tight trousers or in none he was equally unable to represent them without thrusting a sword or bayonet spluttering blood into the more indelicate parts of their persons this was the leitmotif of the war as the german humorists presented it but said mr britling these things cant represent anything like the general state of mind in germany  they do said his friend  but its blind furyat the dirtthrowing stage  the whole of germany is in that blind fury said his friend while we are going about astonished and rather incredulous about this war and still rather inclined to laugh thats the state of mind of germany theres a sort of deliberation in it they think it gives them strength they want to foam at the mouth they do their utmost to foam more they write themselves up have you heard of the hymn of hate  mr britling had not  there was a translation of it in last weeks spectator this is the sort of thing we are trying to fight in good temper and without extravagance listen britling   you will we hate with a lasting hate   we will never forgo our hate   hate by water and hate by land   hate of the head and hate of the hand   hate of the hammer and hate of the crown   hate of seventy millions choking down   we love as one we hate as one   we have one foe and one alone   england  he read on to the end  well he said when he had finished reading what do you think of it  i want to feel his bumps said mr britling after a pause its incomprehensible  theyre singing that up and down germany lissauer i hear has been decorated  itsstark malignity said mr britling what have we done  its colossal what is to happen to the world if these people prevail  i cant believe iteven with this evidence before me no i want to feel their bumps   section 3  you see said mr britling trying to get it into focus i have known quite decent germans there must be some sort of misunderstanding i wonder what makes them hate us there seems to me no reason in it  i think it is just thoroughness said his friend they are at war to be at war is to hate  that isnt at all my idea  were not a thorough people when we think of anything we also think of its opposite when we adopt an opinion we also take in a provisional idea that it is probably nearly as wrong as it is right we areatmospheric they are concrete all this filthy vile unjust and cruel stuff is honest genuine war we pretend war does not hurt they know better the germans are a simple honest people it is their virtue possibly it is their only virtue   section 4  mr britling was only one of a multitude who wanted to feel the bumps of germany at that time the effort to understand a people who had suddenly become incredible was indeed one of the most remarkable facts in english intellectual life during the opening phases of the war the english state of mind was unlimited astonishment there was an enormous sale of any german books that seemed likely to illuminate the mystery of this amazing concentration of hostility the works of bernhardi treitschke nietzsche houston stewart chamberlain became the material of countless articles and interminable discussions one saw little clerks on the way to the office and workmen going home after their work earnestly reading these remarkable writers they were asking just as mr britling was asking what it was the british empire had struck against they were trying to account for this wild storm of hostility that was coming at them out of central europe  it was a natural next stage to this when after all it became manifest that instead of there being a liberal and reluctant germany at the back of imperialism and junkerdom there was apparently one solid and enthusiastic people to suppose that the germans were in some distinctive way evil that they were racially more envious arrogant and aggressive than the rest of mankind upon that supposition a great number of english people settled they concluded that the germans had a peculiar devil of their ownand had to be treated accordingly that was the second stage in the process of national apprehension and it was marked by the first beginnings of a spy hunt by the first denunciation of naturalised aliens and by some antigerman rioting among the mixed alien population in the east end most of the bakers in the east end of london were germans and for some months after the war began they went on with their trade unmolested now many of these shops were wrecked it was only in october that the british gave these first signs of a sense that they were fighting not merely political germany but the germans  but the idea of a peculiar malignity in the german quality as a key to the broad issue of the war was even less satisfactory and less permanent in mr britlings mind than his first crude opposition of militarism and a peaceful humanity as embodied respectively in the central powers and the russowestern alliance it led logically to the conclusion that the extermination of the german peoples was the only security for the general amiability of the world a conclusion that appealed but weakly to his essential kindliness after all the germans he had met and seen were neither cruel nor hateinspired he came back to that obstinately from the harshness and vileness of the printed word and the unclean picture he fell back upon the flesh and blood the humanity and sterling worth ofas a sampleyoung heinrich  who was moreover a thoroughly german young germana thoroughly prussian young prussian  at times young heinrich alone stood between mr britling and the belief that germany and the whole german race was essentially wicked essentially a canting robber nation young heinrich became a sort of advocate for his people before the tribunal of mr britlings mind and on his shoulder sat an absurdly pampered squirrel s fresh pink sedulous face very earnest adjusting his glasses saying please intervened and insisted upon an arrest of judgment  since the young mans departure he had sent two postcards of greeting directly to the familie britling and one letter through the friendly intervention of mr britlings american publisher once also he sent a message through a friend in norway the postcards simply recorded stages in the passage of a distraught pacifist across holland to his enrolment the letter by way of america came two months later he had been converted into a combatant with extreme rapidity he had been trained for three weeks had spent a fortnight in hospital with a severe cold and had then gone to belgium as a transport driverhis father had been a horsedealer and he was familiar with horses if anything happens to me he wrote please send my violin at least very carefully to my mother it was characteristic that he reported himself as very comfortably quartered in courtrai with very nice people the niceness involved restraints only never he added do we talk about the war it is better not to do so he mentioned the violin also in the later communication through norway therein he lamented the lost fleshpots of courtrai he had been in posen and now he was in the carpathians up to his knees in snow and very uncomfortable  and then abruptly all news from him ceased  month followed month and no further letter came  something has happened to him perhaps he is a prisoner  i hope our little heinrich hasnt got seriously damaged he may be wounded  or perhaps they stop his letters very probably they stop his letters   section 5  mr britling would sit in his armchair and stare at his fire and recall conflicting memories of germanyof a pleasant land of friendly people he had spent many a jolly holiday there so recently as 1911 all the britling family had gone up the rhine from rotterdam had visited a string of great cities and stayed for a cheerful month of sunshine at neunkirchen in the odenwald  the little village perches high among the hills and woods and at its very centre is the inn and the linden tree andadam meyer or at least adam meyer was there whether he is there now only the spirit of change can tell if he live to be a hundred no friendly english will ever again come tramping along by the track of the blaue breiecke or the weisse streiche to enjoy his hospitality there are rivers of blood between and a thousand memories of hate  it was a village distended with hospitalities not only the inn but all the houses about the place of the linden tree the shoemakers the postmistresss the white house beyond every house indeed except the pastors house were full of adam meyers summer guests and about it and over it went and soared adam meyer seeing they ate well seeing they rested well seeing they had music and did not miss the moonlighta host who forgot profit in hospitality an innkeeper with the passion of an artist for his inn  music moonlight the simple german sentiment the hearty german voices the great picnic in a stuhl wagen the orderly round games the boys played with the german children and the tramps and confidences hugh had with kurt and karl and at last a crowning jollification a dance with some gipsy musicians whom mr britling discovered when the germans taught the english various entertaining sports with baskets and potatoes and forfeits and the english introduced the germans to the licence of the twostep and everybody sang britannia rule the waves and deutschland deutschland über alles and adam meyer got on a chair and made a tremendous speech more in dialect than ever and there was much drinking of beer and sirops in the moonlight under the linden  afterwards there had been a periodic sending of postcards and greetings which indeed only the war had ended  right pleasant people those germans had been sun and greenleaf lovers for whom frisch auf seemed the most natural of national cries mr britling thought of the individual germans who had made up the assembly of the mens amusingly fierce little hats of green and blue with an inevitable feather thrust perkily into the hatband behind of the kindly plumpnesses behind their turnedup moustaches of the blonde sedentary women very wise about the comforts of life and very kind to the children of their earnest pleasure in landscape and art and great writers of their general frequent desire to sing of their plasticity under the directing hands of adam meyer he thought of the mellow south german landscape rolling away broad and fair of the little clean redroofed townships the old castles the big prosperous farms the neatly marked pedestrian routes the hospitable inns and the artless abundant aussichtthurms  he saw all those memories now through a veil of indescribable sadnessas of a world lost gone down like the cities of lyonesse beneath deep seas  right pleasant people in a sunny land yet here pressing relentlessly upon his mind were the murders of visé the massacres of dinant the massacres of louvain murder redhanded and horrible upon an inoffensive people foully invaded foully treated murder done with a sickening cant of righteousness and racial pretension  the two pictures would not stay steadily in his mind together when he thought of the broken faith that had poured those slaughtering hosts into the decent peace of belgium that had smashed her cities burnt her villages and filled the pretty gorges of the ardennes with blood and smoke and terror he was flooded with selfrighteous indignation a selfrighteous indignation that was indeed entirely teutonic in its quality that for a time drowned out his former friendship and every kindly disposition towards germany that inspired him with destructive impulses and obsessed him with a desire to hear of death and more death and yet death in every german town and home   section 6  it will be an incredible thing to the happier reader of a coming ageif ever this poor record of experience reaches a reader in the days to cometo learn how much of the mental life of mr britling was occupied at this time with the mere horror and atrocity of warfare it is idle and hopeless to speculate now how that future reader will envisage this war it may take on broad dramatic outlines it may seem a thing just logical necessary the burning of many barriers the destruction of many obstacles mr britling was too near to the dirt and pain and heat for any such broad landscape consolations every day some new detail of evil beat into his mind now it would be the artless story of some belgian refugee there was a girl from alost in the village for example who had heard the fusillade that meant the shooting of citizens the shooting of people she had known she had seen the still bloodstained wall against which two murdered cousins had died the streaked sand along which their bodies had been dragged three german soldiers had been quartered in her house with her and her invalid mother and had talked freely of the massacres in which they had been employed one of them was in civil life a young schoolmaster and he had had he said to kill a woman and a baby the girl had been incredulous yes he had done so of course he had done so his officer had made him do it had stood over him he could do nothing but obey but since then he had been unable to sleep unable to forget  we had to punish the people he said they had fired on us  and besides his officer had been drunk it had been impossible to argue his officer had an unrelenting character at all times  over and over again mr britling would try to imagine that young schoolmaster soldier at alost he imagined with a weak staring face and watery blue eyes behind his glasses and that memory of murder  then again it would be some incident of death and mutilation in antwerp that van der pant described to him the germans in belgium were shooting women frequently not simply for grave spying but for trivial offences then came the battleship raid on whitby and scarborough and the killing among other victims of a number of children on their way to school this shocked mr britling absurdly much more than the belgian crimes had done they were english children at home the drowning of a great number of people on a torpedoed ship full of refugees from flanders filled his mind with pitiful imaginings for days the zeppelin raids with their slow crescendo of bloodstained futility began before the end of 1914 it was small consolation for mr britling to reflect that english homes and women and children were after all undergoing only the same kind of experience that our ships have inflicted scores of times in the past upon innocent people in the villages of africa and polynesia  each month the war grew bitterer and more cruel early in 1915 the germans began their submarine war and for a time mr britlings concern was chiefly for the sailors and passengers of the ships destroyed he noted with horror the increasing indisposition of the german submarines to give any notice to their victims he did not understand the grim reasons that were turning every submarine attack into a desperate challenge of death for the germans under the seas had pitted themselves against a sea power far more resourceful more steadfast and skilful sterner and more silent than their own it was not for many months that mr britling learnt the realities of the submarine blockade submarine after submarine went out of the german harbours into the north sea never to return no prisoners were reported no boasting was published by the british fishers of men u boat after u boat vanished into a chilling mystery only later did mr britling begin to hear whispers and form ideas of the noiseless suffocating grip that sought through the waters for its prey  the falaba crime in which the german sailors were reported to have jeered at the drowning victims in the water was followed by the sinking of the lusitania at that a wave of real anger swept through the empire hate was begetting hate at last there were violent riots in great britain and in south africa wretched little german hairdressers and bakers and so forth fled for their lives to pay for the momentary satisfaction of the kaiser and herr ballin scores of german homes in england were wrecked and looted hundreds of germans maltreated war is war hard upon the lusitania storm came the publication of the bryce report with its relentless array of witnesses its particulars of countless acts of cruelty and arrogant unreason and uncleanness in belgium and the occupied territory of france came also the gasping torture of gas the use of flame jets and a new exacerbation of the savagery of the actual fighting for a time it seemed as though the taking of prisoners along the western front would cease tales of torture and mutilation tales of the kind that arise nowhere and out of nothing and poison mens minds to the most pitiless retaliations drifted along the opposing fronts  the realities were evil enough without any rumours over various dinnertables mr britling heard this and that firsthand testimony of harshness and spite one story that stuck in his memory was of british prisoners on the journey into germany being put apart at a station from their french companions in misfortune and forced to run the gauntlet back to their train between the fists and bayonets of files of german soldiers and there were convincing stories of the same prisoners robbed of overcoats in bitter weather baited with dogs separated from their countrymen and thrust among russians and poles with whom they could hold no speech so lissauers hate song bore its fruit in a thousand cruelties to wounded and defenceless men the english had cheated great germany of another easy victory like that of 71 they had to be punished that was all too plainly the psychological process at one german station a woman had got out of a train and crossed a platform to spit on the face of a wounded englishman and there was no monopoly of such things on either side at some journalistic gathering mr britling met a little whitefaced resolute lady who had recently been nursing in the north of france she told of wounded men lying among the coal of coalsheds of a shortage of nurses and every sort of material of an absolute refusal to permit any share in such things to reach the german swine  why have they come here let our own boys have it first why couldnt they stay in their own country let the filth die  two soldiers impressed to carry a wounded german officer on a stretcher had given him a joy ride pitching him up and down as one tosses a man in a blanket he was lucky to get off with that  all our men arent angels said a cheerful young captain back from the front if you had heard a little group of our east london boys talking of what they meant to do when they got into germany youd feel anxious  but that was just talk said mr britling weakly after a pause  there were times when mr britlings mind was imprisoned beyond any hope of escape amidst such monstrous realities  he was ashamed of his one secret consolation for nearly two years yet hugh could not go out to it there would surely be peace before that   section 7  tormenting the thought of mr britling almost more acutely than this growing tale of stupidly inflicted suffering and waste and sheer destruction was the collapse of the british mind from its first fine phase of bracedup effort into a state of bickering futility  too long had british life been corrupted by the fictions of loyalty to an uninspiring and alien court of national piety in an official church of freedom in a politicianrigged state of justice in an economic system where the advertiser the sweater and usurer had a hundred advantages over the producer and artisan to maintain itself now steadily at any high pitch of heroic endeavour it had bought its comfort with the demoralisation of its servants it had no completely honest organs its spirit was clogged by its accumulated insincerities brought at last face to face with a bitter hostility and a powerful and unscrupulous enemy an enemy socialistic scientific and efficient to an unexampled degree it seemed indeed to be inspired for a time by an unwonted energy and unanimity youth and the common people shone the sons of every class went out to fight and die full of a splendid dream of this war easygoing vanished from the foreground of the picture but only to creep back again as the first inspiration passed presently the older men the seasoned politicians the owners and hucksters the charming women and the habitual consumers began to recover from this blaze of moral exaltation old habits of mind and procedure reasserted themselves the war which had begun so dramatically missed its climax there was neither heroic swift defeat nor heroic swift victory there was indecision the most trying test of all for an undisciplined people there were great spaces of uneventful fatigue before the battle of the yser had fully developed the dramatic quality had gone out of the war it had ceased to be either a tragedy or a triumph for both sides it became a monstrous strain and wasting it had become a wearisome thrusting against a pressure of evils  under that strain the dignity of england broke and revealed a malignity less focussed and intense than the german but perhaps even more distressing no paternal government had organised the british spirit for patriotic ends it became now peevish and impatient like some illtrained man who is sick it directed itself no longer against the enemy alone but fitfully against imagined traitors and shirkers it wasted its energies in a deepening and spreading net of internal squabbles and accusations now it was the wily indolence of the prime minister now it was the german culture of the lord chancellor now the imaginative enterprise of the first lord of the admiralty that focussed a vindictive campaign there began a hunt for spies and of suspects of german origin in every quarter except the highest a denunciation now of traitors now of people with imaginations now of scientific men now of the personal friend of the commanderinchief now of this group and then of that group every day mr britling read his three or four newspapers with a deepening disappointment  when he turned from the newspaper to his post he would find the anonymous letterwriter had been busy  perhaps mr britling had remarked that germans were after all human beings or that if england had listened to matthew arnold in the eighties our officers by this time might have added efficiency to their courage and good temper perhaps he had himself put a touch of irritant acid into his comment back flared the hate who are you sir what are you sir what right have you sir what claim have you sir   section 8  life had a wrangling birth on the head of every one of us rests the ancestral curse of fifty million murders  so mr britlings thoughts shaped themselves in words as he prowled one night in march chill and melancholy across a rushy meadow under an overcast sky the death squeal of some little beast caught suddenly in a distant copse had set loose this train of thought life struggling under a birth curse he thought how nearly i come back at times to the christian theology and then redemption by the shedding of blood  life like a rebellious child struggling out of the control of the hate which made it what it is  but that was mr britlings idea of gnosticism not of orthodox christianity he went off for a time into faded reminiscences of theological reading what had been the gnostic idea that the god of the old testament was the devil of the new but that had been the idea of the manichæans  mr britling between the black hedges came back presently from his attempts to recall his youthful inquiries into mans ancient speculations to the enduring riddles that have outlasted a thousand speculations has hate been necessary and is it still necessary and will it always be necessary is all life a war forever the rabbit is nimble lives keenly is prevented from degenerating into a diseased crawling eater of herbs by the incessant ferret without the ferret of war what would life become war is murder truly but is not peace decay  it was during these prowling nights in the first winter of the war that mr britling planned a new writing that was to go whole abysses beneath the facile superficiality of and now war ends it was to be called the anatomy of hate it was to deal very faithfully with the function of hate as a corrective to inefficiency so long as men were slack men must be fierce this conviction pressed upon him  in spite of his detestation of war mr britling found it impossible to maintain that any sort of peace state was better than a state of war if wars produced destructions and cruelties peace could produce indolence perversity greedy accumulation and selfish indulgences war is discipline for evil but peace may be relaxation from good the poor man may be as wretched in peace time as in war time the gathering forces of an evil peace the malignity and waste of war are but obverse and reverse of the medal of illadjusted human relationships was there no greater peace possible not a mere recuperative pause in killing and destruction but a phase of noble and creative living a phase of building of discovery of beauty and research he remembered as one remembers the dead dreams he had once dreamt of the great cities the splendid freedoms of a coming age of marvellous enlargements of human faculty of a coming science that would be light and of art that could be power  but would that former peace have ever risen to that  after all had such visions ever been more than idle dreams had the war done more than unmask reality  he came to a gate and leant over it  the darkness drizzled about him he turned up his collar and watched the dim shapes of trees and hedges gather out of the night to meet the dismal dawn he was cold and hungry and weary  he may have drowsed at least he had a vision very real and plain a vision very different from any dream of utopia  it seemed to him that suddenly a mine burst under a great ship at sea that men shouted and women sobbed and cowered and flares played upon the rainpitted black waves and then the picture changed and showed a battle upon land and searchlights were flickering through the rain and shells flashed luridly and men darkly seen in silhouette against red flames ran with fixed bayonets and slipped and floundered over the mud and at last shouting thinly through the wind leapt down into the enemy trenches  and then he was alone again staring over a wet black field towards a dim crest of shapeless trees   section 9  abruptly and shockingly this malignity of warfare which had been so far only a festering cluster of reports and stories and rumours and suspicions stretched out its arm into essex and struck a barb of grotesque cruelty into the very heart of mr britling late one afternoon came a telegram from filmingtononsea where aunt wilshire had been recovering her temper in a boardinghouse after a round of visits in yorkshire and the moorlands and she had been very seriously injured by an overnight german air raid it was a raid that had not been even mentioned in the mornings papers she had asked to see him  it was ran the compressed telegraphic phrase advisable to come at once  mrs britling helped him pack a bag and came with him to the station in order to drive the car back to the dower house for the gardeners boy who had hitherto attended to these small duties had now gone off as an unskilled labourer to some munition works at chelmsford mr britling sat in the slow train that carried him across country to the junction for filmington and failed altogether to realise what had happened to the old lady he had an absurd feeling that it was characteristic of her to intervene in affairs in this manner she had always been so tough and unbent an old lady that until he saw her he could not imagine her as being really seriously and pitifully hurt  but he found her in the hospital very much hurt indeed she had been smashed in some complicated manner that left the upper part of her body intact and lying slantingly upon pillows over the horror of bandaged broken limbs and tormented flesh below sheets and a counterpane were drawn morphia had been injected he understood to save her from pain but presently it might be necessary for her to suffer she lay up in her bed with an effect of being enthroned very white and still her strong profile with its big nose and her straggling hair and a certain dignity gave her the appearance of some very important very old man of an aged pope for instance rather than of an old woman she had made no remark after they had set her and dressed her and put her to bed except send for hughie britling the dower house matchings easy he is the best of the bunch she had repeated the address and this commendation firmly over and over again in large print as it were even after they had assured her that a telegram had been despatched  in the night they said she had talked of him  he was not sure at first that she knew of his presence  here i am aunt wilshire he said  she gave no sign  your nephew hugh  mean and preposterous she said very distinctly  but she was not thinking of mr britling she was talking of something else  she was saying it should not have been known i was here there are spies everywhere everywhere there is a spy nowor a lump very like a spy they pretend it is a hotwater bottle pretext oh yes i admitabsurd but i have been pursued by spies endless spies endless endless spies their devices are almost incredible he has never forgiven me  all this on account of a carpet a palace carpet over which i had no control i spoke my mind he knew i knew of it i never concealed it so i was hunted for years he had meditated revenge now he has it but at what a cost and they call him emperor emperor  his arm is withered his sonimbecile he will diewithout dignity  her voice weakened but it was evident she wanted to say something more  im here said mr britling your nephew hughie  she listened  can you understand me he asked  she became suddenly an earnest tender human being my dear she said and seemed to search for something in her mind and failed to find it  you have always understood me she tried  you have always been a good boy to me hughie she said rather vacantly and added after some moments of still reflection au fond  after that she was silent for some minutes and took no notice of his whispers  then she recollected what had been in her mind she put out a hand that sought for mr britlings sleeve  hughie  im here auntie said mr britling im here  dont let him get at your hughie too good for it dear oh muchmuch too good people let these wars and excitements run away with them they put too much into them they arentthey arent worth it dont let him get at your hughie  no  you understand me hughie  perfectly auntie  then dont forget it ever  she had said what she wanted to say she had made her testament she closed her eyes he was amazed to find this grotesque old creature had suddenly become beautiful in that silvery vein of beauty one sometimes finds in very old men she was exalted as great artists will sometimes exalt the portraits of the aged he was moved to kiss her forehead  there came a little tug at his sleeve  i think that is enough said the nurse who had stood forgotten at his elbow  but i can come again  perhaps  she indicated departure by a movement of her hand   section 10  the next day aunt wilshire was unconscious of her visitor  they had altered her position so that she lay now horizontally staring inflexibly at the ceiling and muttering queer old disconnected things  the windsor castle carpet story was still running through her mind but mixed up with it now were scraps of the current newspaper controversies about the conduct of the war and she was still thinking of the dynastic aspects of the war and of spies she had something upon her mind about the kings more german aunts  as a precaution she said as a precaution watch them all the princess christian laying foundation stones cement guns or else why should they always be laying foundation stones always why hushed up  none of these things she said in the newspapers they ought to be  and then after an interval very distinctly the duke of wellington my ancestorin reality publish and be damned  after that she lay still  the doctors and nurses could hold out only very faint hopes to mr britlings inquiries they said indeed it was astonishing that she was still alive  and about seven oclock that evening she died   section 11  mr britling after he had looked at his dead cousin for the last time wandered for an hour or so about the silent little wateringplace before he returned to his hotel there was no one to talk to and nothing else to do but to think of her death  the night was cold and bleak but full of stars he had already mastered the local topography and he knew now exactly where all the bombs that had been showered upon the place had fallen here was the corner of blackened walls and roasted beams where three wounded horses had been burnt alive in a barn here the row of houses some smashed some almost intact where a mutilated child had screamed for two hours before she could be rescued from the debris that had pinned her down and taken to the hospital everywhere by the dim light of the shaded street lamps he could see the black holes and gaps of broken windows sometimes abundant sometimes rare and exceptional among otherwise uninjured dwellings many of the victims he had visited in the little cottage hospital where aunt wilshire had just died she was the eleventh dead altogether fiftyseven people had been killed or injured in this brilliant german action they were all civilians and only twelve were men  two zeppelins had come in from over the sea and had been fired at by an antiaircraft gun coming on an automobile from ipswich the first intimation the people of the town had had of the raid was the report of this gun many had run out to see what was happening it was doubtful if any one had really seen the zeppelins though every one testified to the sound of their engines then suddenly the bombs had come streaming down only six had made hits upon houses or people the rest had fallen ruinously and very close together on the local golf links and at least half had not exploded at all and did not seem to have been released to explode  a third at least of the injured people had been in bed when destruction came upon them  the story was like a page from some fantastic romance of jules vernes the peace of the little old town the people going to bed the quiet streets the quiet starry sky and then for ten minutes an uproar of guns and shells a clatter of breaking glass and then a fire here a fire there a childs voice pitched high by pain and terror scared people going to and fro with lanterns and the sky empty again the raiders gone  five minutes before aunt wilshire had been sitting in the boardinghouse drawingroom playing a great stern patience the emperor patience napoleon my dearnot that potsdam creature that took hours to do five minutes later she was a thing of elemental terror and agony bleeding wounds and shattered bones plunging about in the darkness amidst a heap of wreckage and already the german airmen were buzzing away to sea again proud of themselves pleased no doubtlike boys who have thrown a stone through a window beating their way back to thanks and rewards to iron crosses and the proud embraces of delighted fraus and fräuleins  for the first time it seemed to mr britling he really saw the immediate horror of war the dense cruel stupidity of the business plain and close it was as if he had never perceived anything of the sort before as if he had been dealing with stories pictures shows and representations that he knew to be shams but that this dear absurd old creature this thing of home this being of familiar humours and familiar irritations should be torn to pieces left in torment like a smashed mouse over which an automobile has passed brought the whole business to a raw and quivering focus not a soul among all those who had been rent and torn and tortured in this agony of millions but was to any one who understood and had been near to it in some way lovable in some way laughable in some way worthy of respect and care poor aunt wilshire was but the sample thrust in his face of all this mangled multitude whose greenwhite lips had sweated in anguish whose broken bones had thrust raggedly through red dripping flesh the detested features of the german crown prince jerked into the centre of mr britlings picture the young man stood in his dapper uniform and grinned under his long nose carrying himself jauntily proud of his extreme importance to so many lives  and for a while mr britling could do nothing but rage  devils they are he cried to the stars  devils devilish fools rather cruel blockheads apes with all science in their hands my god but we will teach them a lesson yet  that was the key of his mood for an hour of aimless wandering wandering that was only checked at last by a sentinel who turned him back towards the town  he wandered muttering he found great comfort in scheming vindictive destruction for countless germans he dreamt of swift armoured aeroplanes swooping down upon the flying airship and sending it reeling earthward the men screaming he imagined a shattered zeppelin staggering earthward in the fields behind the dower house and how he would himself run out with a spade and smite the germans down quarter indeed kamerad take that you foul murderer  in the dim light the sentinel saw the retreating figure of mr britling make an extravagant gesture and wondered what it might mean signalling what ought an intelligent sentry to do let fly at him arrest him take no notice  mr britling was at that moment killing count zeppelin and beating out his brains count zeppelin was killed that night and the german emperor was assassinated a score of lesser victims were offered up to the manes of aunt wilshire there were memorable cruelties before the wrath and bitterness of mr britling was appeased and then suddenly he had had enough of these thoughts they were thrust aside they vanished out of his mind   section 12  all the while that mr britling had been indulging in these imaginative slaughterings and spending the tears and hate that had gathered in his heart his reason had been sitting apart and above the storm like the sun waiting above thunder like a wise nurse watching and patient above the wild passions of a child and all the time his reason had been maintaining silently and firmly without shouting without speech that the men who had made this hour were indeed not devils were no more devils than mr britling was a devil but sinful men of like nature with himself hard stupid caught in the same web of circumstance kill them in your passion if you will said reason but understand this thing was done neither by devils nor fools but by a conspiracy of foolish motives by the weak acquiescences of the clever by a crime that was no mans crime but the natural necessary outcome of the ineffectiveness the blind motives and muddleheadedness of all mankind  so reason maintained her thesis like a light above the head of mr britling at which he would not look while he hewed airmen to quivering rags with a spade that he had sharpened and stifled german princes with their own poison gas given slowly and as painfully as possible and what of the towns our ships have bombarded asked reason unheeded what of those tasmanians our people utterly swept away  what of french machineguns in the atlas reason pressed the case of himalayan villages burning of the things we did in china especially of the things we did in china  mr britling gave no heed to that  the germans in china were worse than we were he threw out  he was maddened by the thought of the zeppelin making off high and far in the sky a thing dwindling to nothing among the stars and the thought of those murderers escaping him time after time he stood still and shook his fist at boötes slowly sweeping up the sky  and at last sick and wretched he sat down on a seat upon the deserted parade under the stars close to the soughing of the invisible sea below  his mind drifted back once more to those ancient heresies of the gnostics and the manichæans which saw the god of the world as altogether evil which sought only to escape by the utmost abstinences and evasions and perversions from the black wickedness of being for a while his soul sank down into the uncongenial darknesses of these creeds of despair i who have loved life he murmured and could have believed for a time that he wished he had never had a son  is the whole scheme of nature evil is life in its essence cruel is man stretched quivering upon the table of the eternal vivisector for no endand without pity  these were thoughts that mr britling had never faced before the war they came to him now and they came only to be rejected by the inherent quality of his mind for weeks consciously and subconsciously his mind had been grappling with this riddle he had thought of it during his lonely prowlings as a special constable it had flung itself in monstrous symbols across the dark canvas of his dreams is there indeed a devil of pure cruelty does any creature even the very cruellest of creatures really apprehend the pain it causes or inflict it for the sake of the infliction he summoned a score of memories a score of imaginations to bear their witness before the tribunal of his mind he forgot cold and loneliness in this speculation he sat trying all being on this score under the cold indifferent stars  he thought of certain instances of boyish cruelty that had horrified him in his own boyhood and it was clear to him that indeed it was not cruelty it was curiosity dense textured thick skinned so that it could not feel even the anguish of a blinded cat those boys who had wrung his childish soul to nigh intolerable misery had not indeed been tormenting so much as observing torment testing life as wantonly as one breaks thin ice in the early days of winter in very much cruelty the real motive is surely no worse than that obtuse curiosity a mere step of understanding a mere quickening of the nerves and mind makes it impossible but that is not true of all or most cruelty most cruelty has something else in it something more than the clumsy plunging into experience of the hobbledehoy it is vindictive or indignant it is never tranquil and sensuous it draws its incentive however crippled and monstrous the justification may be from something punitive in mans instinct something therefore that implies a sense however misguided of righteousness and vindication that factor is present even in spite when some vile or atrocious thing is done out of envy or malice that envy and malice has in it alwaysalways yes alwaysa genuine condemnation of the hated thing as an unrighteous thing as an unjust usurpation as an inexcusable privilege as a sinful overconfidence those men in the airshiphe was coming to that he found himself asking himself whether it was possible for a human being to do any cruel act without an excuseor at least without the feeling of excusability and in the case of these germans and the outrages they had committed and the retaliations they had provoked he perceived that always there was the element of a perceptible if inadequate justification just as there would be if presently he were to maltreat a fallen german airman there was anger in their vileness these germans were an unsubtle people a people in the worst and best sense of the words plain and honest they were prone to moral indignation and moral indignation is the mother of most of the cruelty in the world they perceived the indolence of the english and russians they perceived their disregard of science and system they could not perceive the longer reach of these greater races and it seemed to them that the mission of germany was to chastise and correct this laxity surely they had argued god was not on the side of those who kept an untilled field so they had butchered these old ladies and slaughtered these children just to show us the consequences   all along of dirtiness all along of mess   all along of doing things rather more or less  the very justification our english poet has found for a thousand overbearing actions in the east forget not order and the real that was the underlying message of bomb and gas and submarine after all what right had we english not to have a gun or an aeroplane fit to bring down that zeppelin ignominiously and conclusively had we not undertaken empire were we not the leaders of great nations had we indeed much right to complain if our imperial pose was flouted there at least said mr britlings reason is one of the lines of thought that brought that unseen cruelty out of the night high over the houses of filmingtononsea that in a sense is the cause of this killing cruel it is and abominable yes but is it altogether cruel hasnt it after all a sort of stupid rightnessisnt it a stupid reaction to an indolence at least equally stupid  what was this rightness that lurked below cruelty what was the inspiration of this pressure of spite this anger that was aroused by ineffective gentleness and kindliness was it indeed an altogether evil thing was it not rather an impulse blind as yet but in its ultimate quality as good as mercy greater perhaps in its ultimate values than mercy  this idea had been gathering in mr britlings mind for many weeks it had been growing and taking shape as he wrote making experimental beginnings for his essay the anatomy of hate is there not he now asked himself plainly a creative and corrective impulse behind all hate is not this malignity indeed only the apelike precursor of the great disciplines of a creative state  the invincible hopefulness of his sanguine temperament had now got mr britling well out of the pessimistic pit again already he had been on the verge of his phrase while wandering across the rushy fields towards market saffron now it came to him again like a legitimate monarch returning from exile  when hate shall have become creative energy  hate which passes into creative power gentleness which is indolence and the herald of euthanasia  pity is but a passing grace for mankind will not always be pitiful  but meanwhile meanwhile how long were men so to mingle wrong with right to be energetic without mercy and kindly without energy  for a time mr britling sat on the lonely parade under the stars and in the sound of the sea brooding upon these ideas  his mind could make no further steps it had worked for its spell his rage had ebbed away now altogether his despair was no longer infinite but the world was dark and dreadful still it seemed none the less dark because at the end there was a gleam of light it was a gleam of light far beyond the limits of his own life far beyond the life of his son it had no balm for these sufferings between it and himself stretched the weary generations still to come generations of bickering and accusation greed and faintheartedness and half truth and the hasty blow and all those years would be full of pitiful things such pitiful things as the blackened ruins in the town behind the little greyfaced corpses the lives torn and wasted the hopes extinguished and the gladness gone  he was no longer thinking of the germans as diabolical they were human they had a case it was a stupid case but our case too was a stupid case how stupid were all our cases what was it we missed something he felt very close to us and very elusive something that would resolve a hundred tangled oppositions  his mind hung at that back upon his consciousness came crowding the horrors and desolations that had been his daily food now for three quarters of a year he groaned aloud he struggled against that renewed envelopment of his spirit oh bloodstained fools he cried oh pitiful tormented fools  even that vile airship was a ship of fools  we are all fools still striving apes irritated beyond measure by our own striving easily moved to anger  some train of subconscious suggestion brought a longforgotten speech back into mr britlings mind a speech that is full of that light which still seeks so mysteriously and indefatigably to break through the darkness and thickness of the human mind  he whispered the words no unfamiliar words could have had the same effect of comfort and conviction  he whispered it of those men whom he still imagined flying far away there eastward through the clear freezing air beneath the stars those muffled sailors and engineers who had caused so much pain and agony in this little town  father forgive them for they know not what they do     chapter the fourth  in the web of the ineffective   section 1  hughs letters were becoming a very important influence upon mr britlings thought hugh had always been something of a letterwriter and now what was perhaps an inherited desire to set things down was manifest he had been accustomed to decorate his letters from school with absurd little sketchessometimes his letters had been all sketchesand now he broke from drawing to writing and back to drawing in a way that pleased his father mightily the father loved this queer trick of caricature he did not possess it himself and so it seemed to him the most wonderful of all hughs little equipment of gifts mr britling used to carry these letters about until their edges got grimy he would show them to any one he felt capable of appreciating their youthful freshness he would quote them as final and conclusive evidence to establish this or that he did not dream how many thousands of mothers and fathers were treasuring such documents he thought other sons were dull young men by comparison with hugh  the earlier letters told much of the charms of discipline and the open air all the bother about what one has to do with oneself is over wrote hugh one has disposed of oneself that has the effect of a great relief instead of telling oneself that one ought to get up in the morning a bugle tells you that and theres no nonsense about it no chance of lying and arguing about it with oneself i begin to see the sense of men going into monasteries and putting themselves under rules one is carried along in a sort of moral automobile instead of trudging the road  and he was also sounding new physical experiences  never before he declared have i known what fatigue is its a miraculous thing one drops down in ones clothes on any hard old thing and sleeps  and in his early letters he was greatly exercised by the elementary science of drill and discipline and the discussion of whether these things were necessary he began by assuming that their importance was overrated he went on to discover that they constituted the very essentials of all good soldiering in a crisis he concluded there is no telling what will get hold of a man his higher instincts or his lower he may show courage of a very splendid sortor a hasty discretion a habit is much more trustworthy than an instinct so discipline sets up a habit of steady and courageous bearing if you keep your head you are at liberty to be splendid if you lose it the habit will carry you through  the young man was also very profound upon the effects of the suggestion of various exercises upon the mind  it is surprising how bloodthirsty one feels in a bayonet charge we have to shout we are encouraged to shout the effect is to paralyse ones higher centres one ceases to questionanything one becomes a bayoneteer as i go bounding forward i imagine fat men succulent men ahead and i am filled with the desire to do them in neatly this sort of thing  a sketch of slaughter followed with a large and valiant hugh leaving a train of fallen behind him  not like this this is how i used to draw it in my innocent childhood but it is incorrect more than one german on the bayonet at a time is an incumbrance and it would be swanka thing we detest in the army  the second sketch showed the same brave hero with half a dozen of the enemy skewered like catsmeat  as for the widows and children i disregard em   section 2  but presently hugh began to be bored  route marching again he wrote for no earthly reason than that they can do nothing else with us we are getting no decent musketry training because there are no rifles we are wasting half our time if you multiply half a week by the number of men in the army you will see we waste centuries weekly if most of these men here had just been enrolled and left to go about their business while we trained officers and instructors and got equipment for them and if they had then been put through their paces as rapidly as possible it would have been infinitely better for the country in a sort of way we are keeping raw in a sort of way we are getting stale i get irritated by this i feel we are not being properly done by  half our men are educated men reasonably educated but we are always being treated as though we were too stupid for words  no good grousing i suppose but after statesminster and a glimpse of old cardinals way of doing things one gets a kind of toothache in the mind at the sight of everything being done twice as slowly and half as well as it need be  he went off at a tangent to describe the men in his platoon the best man in our lot is an exgrocers assistant but in order to save us from vain generalisations it happens that the worst mana moonfaced creature almost incapable of lacing up his boots without help and objurgationis also an exgrocers assistant our most offensive member is a little cad with a snub nose who has read kipling and imagines he is the nearest thing that ever has been to private ortheris he goes about looking for the other two of the soldiers three it is rather like an unpopular politician trying to form a ministry and he is conscientiously foulmouthed he feels losing a chance of saying bloody as acutely as a snob feels dropping an h he goes back sometimes and says the sentence over again and puts the bloody in i used to swear a little out of the range of your parental ear but ortheris has cured me when he is about i am mincing in my speech i perceive now that cursing is a way of chewing ones own dirt in a platoon there is no elbowroom for indifference you must either love or hate i have a feeling that my first taste of battle will not be with germans but with private ortheris  and one letter was just a picture a parody of the wellknown picture of the bivouac below and the soldiers dream of return to his beloved above but master hugh in the dream was embracing an enormous retort while a convenient galvanometer registered his emotion and little tripods danced around him   section 3  then came a letter which plunged abruptly into criticism  my dear parent this is a swearing letter i must let go to somebody and somehow none of the other chaps are convenient i dont know if i ought to be put against a wall and shot for it but i hereby declare that all the officers of this battalion over and above the rank of captain are a constellation of incapablesand several of the captains are herewith included some of them are men of a pleasant disposition and carefully aborted mental powers and some are men of an unpleasant disposition and no mental powers at all and i believea little enlightened by your recent letter to the timesthat they are a fair sample of the entire army class which has got to win this war usually they are indolent but when they are thoroughly roused they are fussy the time they should spend in enlarging their minds and increasing their military efficiency they devote to keeping fit they are roughly speaking fitfor nothing they cannot move us thirty miles without getting half of us left about without losing touch with food and shelter and starving us for thirtysix hours or so in the process and they cannot count beyond the fingers of one hand not having learnt to use the nose for arithmetical operations i conclude this war is going to be a sort of battle of inkerman on a large scale we chaps in the ranks will have to do the job leading is off  all of this my dear parent is just a blow off i have been needlessly starved and fagged to death and exasperated we have moved fiveandtwenty miles across countryin fiftyseven hours and without food for about eighteen hours i have been with my captain who has been billeting us here in cheasingholt oh he is a muff oh god oh god of heaven what a muff he is afraid of printed matter but he controls himself heroically he prides himself upon having no sense of locality confound it prides himself he went about this village which is a little dispersed at a slight trot and wouldnt avail himself of the oneinch map i happened to have he judged the capacity of each room with his eye and wouldnt let me measure even with gods own paces not with the legs i inherit well put five fellahs hea he said what dyou want to measure the room for we havent come to lay down carpets then having assigned men by coup doeil so as to congest half the village miserably he found the other half unoccupied and had to begin all over again if you measured the floor space first sir i said and made a list of the houses that isnt the way im going to do it he said fixing me with a pitiless eye  that isnt the way they are going to do it daddy the sort of thing that is done over here in the green army will be done over there in the dry they wont be in time theyll lose their guns where now they lose our kitchens im a mute soldier ive got to do what im told still i begin to understand the battle of neuve chapelle  they say the relations of men and officers in the new army are beautiful some day i may learn to love my officerbut not just yet not till ive forgotten the operations leading up to the occupation of cheasingholt he muffs his real job without a blush and yet he would rather be shot than do his bootlaces up crisscross what i say about officers applies only and solely to him really how well i understand now the shooting of officers by their men but indeed fatigue and exasperation apart this shift has been done atrociously  the young man returned to these criticisms in a later letter  you will think i am always carping but it does seem to me that nearly everything is being done here in the most wasteful way possible we waste time we waste labour we waste material oh lord how we waste our countrys money these arent i can assure you the opinions of a conceited young man its nothing to be conceited about were bored to death by standing about this infernal little village there is nothing to doexcept trail after a small number of slatternly young women we despise and hate i dont daddy and i dont drink why have i inherited no vices we had a fight here yesterdaysheer boredom ortheris has a swollen lip and another private has a bad black eye there is to be a return match i perceive the chief horror of warfare is boredom  our feeding here is typical of the whole system it is a system invented not with any idea of getting the best resultsthat does not enter into the war office philosophybut to have a rule for everything and avoid arguments there is rather too generous an allowance of bread and stuff per man and there is a very fierce but not very efficient system of weighing and checking a rather too generous allowance is of course a direct incentive to waste or stealingas any one but our silly old duffer of a war office would know the checking is for quantity which any fool can understand rather than for quality the test for the quality of army meat is the smell if it doesnt smell bad it is good  then the raw material is handed over to a cook he is a common soldier who has been made into a cook by a simple ceremony he is told you are a cook he does his best to be usually he roasts or bakes to begin with guessing when the joint is done afterwards he hacks up what is left of his joints and makes a stew for next day a stew is hacked meat boiled up in a big pot it has much fat floating on the top after you have eaten your fill you want to sit about quiet the men are fed usually in a large tent or barn we have a barn it is not a clean barn and just to make it more like a picnic there are insufficient plates knives and forks i tell you no army people can count beyond eight or ten the corporals after their mornings work have to carve when they have done carving they tell me they feel they have had enough dinner they sit about looking pale and wander off afterwards to the village pub i shall probably become a corporal soon in these islands before the war began there was a surplus of women over men of about a million see the publications of the fabian society now so popular among the young none of these women have been trusted by the government with the difficult task of cooking and giving out food to our soldiers no man of the ordinary soldier class ever cooks anything until he is a soldier all food left over after the stew or otherwise rendered uneatable by the cook is thrown away we throw away pailloads we bury meat  also we get three pairs of socks we work pretty hard we dont know how to darn socks when the heels wear through come blisters bad blisters disable a man of the million of surplus women see above the government has not had the intelligence to get any to darn our socks so a certain percentage of us go lame and so on and so on  you will think all this is awful grousing but the point i want to makei hereby to ease my feelings make it now in a fair round handis that all this business could be done far better and far cheaper if it wasnt left to these absolutely inexperienced and extremely exclusive military gentlemen they think they are leading england and showing us all how instead of which they are just keeping us back why in thunder are they doing everything not one of them when he is at home is allowed to order the dinner or poke his nose into his own kitchen or check the household books the ordinary british colonel is a helpless old gentleman he ought to have a nurse this is not merely the trivial grievance of my insulted stomach it is a serious matter for the country sooner or later the country may want the food that is being wasted in all these capers in the aggregate it must amount to a daily destruction of tons of stuff of all sorts tons suppose the war lasts longer than we reckon  from this point hughs letter jumped to a general discussion of the military mind  our officers are beastly good chaps nearly all of them thats where the perplexity of the whole thing comes in if only they werent such good chaps if only they were like the prussian officers to their men then wed just take on a revolution as well as the war and make everything tidy at once but they are decent they are charming only they do not think hard and they do not understand that doing a job properly means doing it as directly and thoughtoutly as you possibly can they wont worry about things if their tempers were worse perhaps their work might be better they wont use maps or timetables or books of reference when we move to a new place they pick up what they can about it by hearsay not one of our lot has the gumption to possess a contoured map or a michelin guide they have hearsay minds they are fussy and petty and wastefuland in the way of getting things done pretentious by their code theyre paragons of honour couragetheyre all right about that no end of it honesty truthfulness and so onhigh they have a kind of horsey standard of smartness and pluck too that isnt bad and they have a fine horror of whiskers and being unbuttoned but the mistake they make is to class thinking with whiskers as a sort of fussy sidegrowth instead of classing it with unbuttonedupness they hate economy and preparation  they wont see that inefficiency is a sort of dishonesty if a man doesnt steal sixpence they think it a light matter if he wastes half a crown here follows wisdom from the point of view of a nation at war sixpence is just a fifth part of half a crown  when i began this letter i was boiling with indignation complicated i suspect by this mornings stew now i have written thus far i feel im an ungenerous grumbler it is remarkable my dear parent that i let off these things to you i like writing to you i couldnt possibly say the things i can write heinrich had a confidential friend at breslau to whom he used to write about his soul i never had one of those teutonic friendships and i havent got a soul but i have to write one must write to some oneand in this place there is nothing else to do and now the old lady downstairs is turning down the gas she always does at halfpast ten she didnt ought she getsninepence each excuse the pencil  that letter ended abruptly the next two were brief and cheerful then suddenly came a new note  weve got rifles were real armed soldiers at last every blessed man has got a rifle and they come from japan they are of a sort of light wood that is like new oak and art furniture and makes one feel that one belongs to the first garden suburb regiment but i believe much can be done with linseed oil and they are real rifles they go bang we are a little lightheaded about them only our training and discipline prevent our letting fly at incautious spectators on the skyline i saw a man yesterday about half a mile off i was possessed by the idea that i could get himright in the middle ortheris the little beast has got a motorbicycle which he calls his by otono one knows whyand only death or dishonourable conduct will save me i gather from becoming a corporal in the course of the next month   section 4  a subsequent letter threw fresh light on the career of the young man with the oto before the rifle and the oto and in spite of his fights with some person or persons unknown ortheris found trouble hugh told the story with the unblushing savoirfaire of the very young  by the by ortheris following the indications of his creator and succumbing to the universal boredom before the rifles came forgot lord kitcheners advice and attempted seduktion with painful results which he insists upon confiding to the entire platoon he has been severely smacked and scratched by the proposed victim and warned off the premises licensed premises by her father and motherboth formidable persons they did more than warn him off the premises they had displayed neither a proper horror of don juan nor a proper respect for the kings uniform mother we realise got hold of him and cuffed him severely what the ells a chap to do cried ortheris you cant go itting a woman back father had set a dog on him a less ingenuous character would be silent about such passagesi should be too egotistical and humiliated altogetherbut that is not his quality he tells us in tones of naïve wonder he talks about it and talks about it i dont care what the old woman did he says notreely what urts me about it is that i jest made a sort of mistake ow shed tike it you see i sort of feel ive urt and insulted er and reely i didnt mean to swap me i didnt mean to gawd elp me i wouldnt ave ad it appened as it as appened not for worlds and now i cant get round to er or anyfing not to explain you chaps may laugh but you dont know what there is in it i tell you it worries me something frightful you think im just a little cad who took liberties he didnt ought to note of anger drowning uncharitable grunts of assent ow the ell is e to know when e didnt ought to  i swear she liked me  this kind of thing goes on for hoursin the darkness  id got regular sort of fond of er  and the extraordinary thing is it makes me begin to get regular fond of ortheris  i think it is because the affair has surprised him right out of acting ortheris and tommy atkins for a bit into his proper self hes frightfully like some sort of mongrel with a lot of wiryhaired terrier and a touch of airedale in it a mongrel you like in spite of the flavour of all the horrid things hes been nosing into and hes as hard as nails and my dear daddy he cant box for nuts   section 5  mr britling with an understanding much quickened by hughs letters went about essex in his automobile and on one or two journeys into berkshire and buckinghamshire and marked the steady conversion of the old pacific countryside into an armed camp he was disposed to minimise hughs criticisms he found in them something of the harshness of youth which is far too keenedged to be tolerant with half performance and our poor human evasion of perfections overstrain our poor human evasion of perfections overstrain this phrase was mr britlings to mr britling looking less closely and more broadly the new army was a pride and a marvel  he liked to come into some quiet village and note the clusters of sturdy khakiclad youngsters going about their business the tethered horses the air of subdued bustle the occasional glimpses of guns and ammunition trains wherever one went now there were soldiers and still more soldiers there was a steady flow of men into flanders and presently to gallipoli but it seemed to have no effect upon the multitude in training at home he was pleasantly excited by the evident increase in the proportion of military material upon the railways he liked the promise and mystery of the long lines of trucks bearing tarpaulincovered wagons and carts and guns that he would pass on his way to liverpool street station he could apprehend defeat in the silence of the night but when he saw the men when he went about the land then it was impossible to believe in any end but victory  but through the spring and summer there was no victory the great offensive of may was checked and abandoned after a series of ineffective and very costly attacks between ypres and soissons the germans had developed a highly scientific defensive in which machineguns replaced rifles and a maximum of punishment was inflicted upon an assaulting force with a minimum of human loss the war office had never thought much of machineguns before but now it thought a good deal moreover the energies of britain were being turned more and more towards the dardanelles  the idea of an attack upon the dardanelles had a traditional attractiveness for the british mind old men had been brought up from childhood with forcing the dardanelles as a familiar phrase it had none of the flighty novelty and vulgarity about it that made an aerial offensive seem so unwarrantable a proceeding forcing the dardanelles was historically british it made no break with tradition soon after turkey entered the war british submarines appeared in the sea of marmora and in february a systematic bombardment of the dardanelles began this was continued intermittently for a month the defenders profiting by their experiences and by spells of bad weather to strengthen their works this first phase of the attack culminated in the loss of the irresistible ocean and bouvet when on the 17th of march the attacking fleet closed in upon the narrows after an interlude of six weeks to allow of further preparations on the part of the defenders who were now thoroughly alive to what was coming the allied armies gathered upon the scene and a difficult and costly landing was achieved at two points upon the peninsula of gallipoli with that began a slow and bloody siege of the defences of the dardanelles clambering up to the surprise landing of a fresh british army in suvla bay in august and its failure in the battle of anafarta through incompetent commanders and a general sloppiness of leading to cut off and capture maidos and the narrows defences meanwhile the russian hosts which had reached their highwater mark in the capture of przemysl were being forced back first in the south and then in the north the germans recaptured lemberg entered warsaw and pressed on to take brest litowsk the russian lines rolled back with an impressive effect of defeat and the germans thrust towards riga and petrograd reaching vilna about the middle of september  day after day mr britling traced the swaying fortunes of the conflict with impatience with perplexity but with no loss of confidence in the ultimate success of britain the country was still swarming with troops and still under summer sunshine a second hay harvest redeemed the scantiness of the first the wheat crops were wonderful and the great fig tree at the corner of the dower house had never borne so bountifully nor such excellent juicy figs  and one day in early june while those figs were still only a hope teddy appeared at the dower house with letty to say goodbye before going to the front he was going out in a draft to fill up various gaps and losses he did not know where essex was doing well but bloodily over there mrs britling had tea set out upon the lawn under the blue cedar and mr britling found himself at a loss for appropriate sayings and talked in his confusion almost as though teddys departure was of no significance at all he was still haunted by that odd sense of responsibility for teddy teddy was not nearly so animated as he had been in his prekhaki days there was a quiet exaltation in his manner rather than a lively excitement he knew now what he was in for he knew now that war was not a lark that for him it was to be the gravest experience he had ever had or was likely to have there were no more jokes about lettys pension and a general avoidance of the topics of high explosives and asphyxiating gas  mr and mrs britling took the young people to the gate  good luck cried mr britling as they receded  teddy replied with a wave of the hand  mr britling stood watching them for some moments as they walked towards the little cottage which was to be the scene of their private parting  i dont like his going he said i hope it will be all right with him teddys so grave nowadays its a mean thing i know it has none of the roman touch but i am glad that this cant happen with hugh he computed not for a year and three months even if they march him into it upon his very birthday  it may all he over by then   section 6  in that computation he reckoned without hugh  within a month hugh was also saying goodbye  but hows this protested mr britling who had already guessed the answer youre not nineteen  im nineteen enough for this job said hugh in fact i enlisted as nineteen  mr britling said nothing for a little while then he spoke with a catch in his breath i dont blame you he said it wasthe right spirit  drill and responsibilities of noncommissioned rank had imposed a novel manliness upon the bearing of corporal britling i always classified a little above my age at statesminster he said as though that cleared up everything  he looked at a rosebud as though it interested him then he remarked rather casually  i thought he said that if i was to go to war id better do the thing properly it seemedsort of half and halfnot to be eligible for the trenches i ought to have told you  yes mr britling decided  i was shy about it at first i thought perhaps the war would be over before it was necessary to discuss anything didnt want to go into it  exactly said mr britling as though that was a complete explanation  its been a good year for your roses said hugh   section 7  hugh was to stop the night he spent what seemed to him and every one a long shy inexpressive evening only the small boys were really natural and animated they were much impressed and excited by his departure and wanted to ask a hundred questions about the life in the trenches many of them hugh had to promise to answer when he got there then he would see just exactly how things were mrs britling was motherly and intelligent about his outfit will you want winter things she asked  but when he was alone with his father after every one had gone to bed they found themselves able to talk  this sort of thing seems more to us than it would be to a french family hugh remarked standing on the hearthrug  yes agreed mr britling their minds would be better prepared theyd have their appropriate things to say they have been educated by the tradition of serviceand 71  then he spokealmost resentfully  the older men ought to go before you boys who is to carry on if a lot of you get killed  hugh reflected in the stiffest battle that ever can be the odds are against getting killed he said  i suppose they are  one in three or four in the very hottest corners  mr britling expressed no satisfaction  every one is going through something of this sort  all the decent people at any rate said mr britling  it will be an extraordinary experience somehow it seems out of proportion  with what  with life generally as one has known it  it isnt in proportion mr britling admitted  incommensurables said hugh  he considered his phrasing its not he said as though one was going into another part of the same world or turning up another side of the world one was used to it is just as if one had been living in a room and one had been asked to step outside it makes me think of a queer little thing that happened when i was in london last winter i got into queer company i dont think i told you i went to have supper with some students in chelsea i hadnt been to the place before but they seemed all rightjust people like meand everybody and after supper they took me on to some people they didnt know very well people who had to do with some school of dramatic art there were two or three young actresses there and a singer and people of that sort sitting about smoking cigarettes and we began talking plays and books and picture shows and all that stuff and suddenly there was a knocking at the door and some one went out and found a policeman with a warrant on the landing they took off our hosts son it had to do with a murder  hugh paused it was the bedford mansions mystery i dont suppose you remember about it or read about it at the time hed killed a man it doesnt matter about the particulars anyhow but what i mean is the effect the effect of a comfortable welllit orderly room and the sense of harmless peopleand then the door opening and the policeman and the cold draught flowing in murder a girl who seemed to know the people well explained to me in whispers what was happening it was like the opening of a trapdoor going down into some pit you have always known was there but never really believed in  i know said mr britling i know  thats just how i feel about this war business theres no real death over here its laid out and boxed up and accidents are all padded about if one got a toss from a horse here youd be in bed and comfortable in no time and there its like another planet its outside im going outside instead of there being no death anywhere it is death everywhere outside there we shall be using our utmost wits to kill each other a kind of reverse to this world  mr britling nodded  ive never seen a dead body yet in dowerhouse land there arent dead bodies  weve kept things from youhorrid things of that sort  im not complaining said hugh butmaster hughthe master hugh you kept things fromwill never come back  he went on quickly as his father raised distressed eyes to him i mean that anyhow this hugh will never come back another one may but i shall have been outside and it will all be different  he paused never had mr britling been so little disposed to take up the discourse  like a man he said seeking an image and doing no more than imitate his sons who goes out of a busy lighted room through a trapdoor into a blizzard to mend the roof  for some moments neither father nor son said anything more they had a queer sense of insurmountable insufficiency neither was saying what he had wanted to say to the other but it was not clear to them now what they had to say to one another  its wonderful said mr britling  hugh could only manage the world has turned right over  the job has to be done said mr britling  the job has to be done said hugh  the pause lengthened  youll be getting up early tomorrow said mr britling   section 8  when mr britling was alone in his own room all the thoughts and feelings that had been held up downstairs began to run more and more rapidly and abundantly through his mind  he had a feelingevery now and again in the last few years he had had the same feelingas though he was only just beginning to discover hugh this perpetual rediscovery of ones children is the experience of every observant parent he had always considered hugh as a youth and now a man stood over him and talked as one man to another and this man this very new man mint new and clean and clear filled mr britling with surprise and admiration  it was as if he perceived the beauty of youth for the first time in hughs slender well balanced khakiclad body there was infinite delicacy in his clear complexion his clear eyes the delicately pencilled eyebrow that was so exactly like his mothers and this thing of brightness and bravery talked as gravely and as wisely as any weatherworn shopsoiled old fellow  the boy was wise  hugh thought for himself he thought round and through his position not egotistically but with a quality of responsibility he wasnt just heroworshipping and imitating just spinning some selfcentred romance if he was a fair sample of his generation then it was a better generation than mr britlings had been  at that mr britlings mind went off at a tangent to the grievance of the rejected volunteer it was acutely shameful to him that all these fine lads should be going off to death and wounds while the men of forty and over lay snug at home how stupid it was to fix things like that here were the fathers who had done their work shot their bolts returned some value for the costs of their education unable to get training unable to be of any service shamefully safe doing april fool work as special constables while their young innocents untried all their gathering possibilities of service unbroached went down into the deadly trenches the war would leave the world a world of cripples and old men and children  he felt himself as a cowardly brute fat wheezy out of training sheltering behind this dear one branch of marys life  he writhed with impotent humiliation  how stupidly the world is managed  he began to fret and rage he could not lie in peace in his bed he got up and prowled about his room blundering against chairs and tables in the darkness we were too stupid to do the most obvious things we were sending all these boys into hardship and pitiless danger we were sending them illequipped insufficiently supported we were sending our children through the fires to moloch because essentially we english were a world of indolent pampered sham goodhumoured old and middleaged men so he distributed the intolerable load of selfaccusation why was he doing nothing to change things to get them better what was the good of an assumed modesty an effort at tolerance for and confidence in these boozy old lawyers these ranting platform men these stiffwitted officers and hidebound officials they were butchering the youth of england old men sat out of danger contriving death for the lads in the trenches that was the reality of the thing my son he cried sharply in the darkness his sense of our national deficiencies became tormentingly fantastically acute it was as if all his cherished delusions had fallen from the scheme of things what was the good of making believe that up there they were planning some great counterstroke that would end in victory it was as plain as daylight that they had neither the power of imagination nor the collective intelligence even to conceive of a counterstroke any dull mass may resist but only imagination can strike imagination to the end we should not strike we might strike through the air we might strike across the sea we might strike hard at gallipoli instead of dribbling inadequate armies thither as our fathers dribbled men at the redan but the old men would sit at their tables replete and sleepy and shake their cunning old heads the press would chatter and make odd ambiguous sounds like a shipload of monkeys in a storm the political harridans would get the wrong men appointed would attack every possible leader with scandal and abuse and falsehood  the spirit and honour and drama had gone out of this war  our only hope now was exhaustion our only strategy was to barter blood for bloodtrusting that our tank would prove the deeper  while into this tank stepped hugh young and smiling  the war became a nightmare vision   section 9  in the morning mr britlings face was white from his overnight brain storm and hughs was fresh from wholesome sleep they walked about the lawn and mr britling talked hopefully of the general outlook until it was time for them to start to the station  the little old stationmaster grasped the situation at once and presided over their last handclasp  good luck hugh cried mr britling  good luck cried the little old stationmaster  its not easy aparting he said to mr britling as the train slipped down the line theres been many a parting hea since this here old war began many and some as wont come back again neether   section 10  for some days mr britling could think of nothing but hugh and always with a dull pain at his heart he felt as he had felt long ago while he had waited downstairs and hugh upstairs had been under the knife of a surgeon but this time the operation went on and still went on at the worst his boy had but one chance in five of death or serious injury but for a time he could think of nothing but that one chance he felt it pressing upon his mind pressing him down  then instead of breaking under that pressure he was released by the trick of the sanguine temperament his mind turned over abruptly to the four chances out of five it was like a dislocated joint slipping back into place it was as sudden as that he found he had adapted himself to the prospect of hugh in mortal danger it had become a fact established a usual thing he could bear with it and go about his affairs  he went up to london and met other men at the club in the same emotional predicament he realised that it was neither very wonderful nor exceptionally tragic now to have a son at the front  my boy is in gallipoli said one its tough work there  my lads in flanders said mr britling nothing would satisfy him but the front hes three months short of eighteen he misstated his age  and they went on to talk newspaper just as if the world was where it had always been  but until a post card came from hugh mr britling watched the postman like a lovesick girl  hugh wrote more frequently than his father had dared to hope pencilled letters for the most part it was as if he was beginning to feel an inherited need for talk and was a little at a loss for a sympathetic ear park his schoolmate who had enlisted with him wasnt it seemed a theoriser park becomes a martinet hugh wrote also he is a sergeant now and this makes rather a gulf between us mr britling had the greatest difficulty in writing back there were many grave deep things he wanted to say and never did instead he gave elaborate details of the small affairs of the dower house once or twice with a halfunconscious imitation of his boys style he took a shot at the theological and philosophical hares that hugh had started but the exemplary letters that he composed of nights from a father to a son at war were never written down it was just as well for there are many things of that sort that are good to think and bad to say  hugh was not very explicit about his position or daily duties what he wrote now had to pass through the hands of a censor and any sort of definite information might cause the suppression of his letter mr britling conceived him for the most part as quartered some way behind the front but in a flat desolated country and within hearing of great guns he assisted his imagination with the illustrated papers sometimes he put him farther back into pleasant old towns after the fashion of beauvais and imagined loitering groups in the front of cafés sometimes he filled in the obvious suggestions of the phrase that all the pas de calais was now one vast british camp then he crowded the picture with tethered horses and tents and greypainted wagons and hugh in the foregroundbarearmed with a bucket  hughs letters divided themselves pretty fairly between two main topics the first was the interest of the art of war the second the reaction against warfare after one has got over the emotion of it he wrote and when ones mind has just accepted and forgotten as it does the horrors and waste of it all then i begin to perceive that war is absolutely the best game in the world that is the real strength of war i submit not as you put it in that early pamphlet of yours ambition cruelty and all those things those things give an excuse for war they rush timid and base people into war but the essential matter is the hold of the thing itself upon an active imagination its such a big game instead of being fenced into a field and tied down to one set of tools as you are in almost every other game you have all the world to play and you may use whatever you can use you can use every scrap of imagination and invention that is in you and its wonderful but real soldiers arent cruel and war isnt cruel in its essence only in its consequences over here one gets hold of scraps of talk that light up things most of the barbarities were doneit is quite clearby an excited civilian sort of men men in a kind of inflamed state the great part of the german army in the early stage of the war was really an army of demented civilians trained civilians no doubt but civilians in soul they were nice orderly clean lawabiding men suddenly torn up by the roots and flung into quite shocking conditions they felt they were rushing at death and that decency was at an end they thought every belgian had a gun behind the hedge and a knife in his trouser leg they saw villages burning and dead people and men smashed to bits they lived in a kind of nightmare they didnt know what they were doing they did horrible things just as one does them sometimes in dreams  he flung out his conclusion with just his mothers leaping consecutiveness conscript soldiers are the ruin of war half the germans and a lot of the french ought never to have been brought within ten miles of a battlefield  what makes all this so plain are the diaries the french and english have been finding on the dead you know at the early state of the war every german soldier was expected to keep a diary he was ordered to do it the idea was to keep him interested in the war consequently from the dead and wounded our people have got thousands it helps one to realise that the germans arent really soldiers at all not as our men are they are obedient lawabiding intelligent people who have been shoved into this they have to see the war as something romantic and melodramatic or as something moral or as tragic fate they have to bellow songs about deutschland or drag in gott they dont take to the game as our men take to the game  i confess im taking to the game i wish at times i had gone into the otc with teddy and got a better hold of it i was too highbrowed about this war business i dream now of getting a commission  that diaryhunting strategy is just the sort of thing that makes this war intellectually fascinating everything is being thought out and then tried over that can possibly make victory the germans go in for psychology much more than we do just as they go in for war more than we do but they dont seem to be really clever about it so they set out to make all their men understand the war while our chaps are singing tipperary but what the men put down arent the beautiful things they ought to put down most of them shove down lists of their meals some of the diaries are all just lists of things eaten and a lot of them have written the most damning stuff about outrages and looting which the french are translating and publishing the germans would give anything now to get back these silly diaries and now they have made an order that no one shall go into battle with any written papers at all our people got so keen on documenting and the value of chance writings that one of the principal things to do after a german attack had failed had been to hook in the documentary dead and find out what they had on them its a curious sport this body fishing you have a sort of triple hook on a rope and you throw it and drag they do the same the other day one body near hooghe was hooked by both sides and they had a tugofwar with a sharpshooter or so cutting in whenever our men got too excited several men were hit the irishit was an irish regimentgot himor at least they got the better part of him  now that i am a sergeant park talks to me again about all these things and we have a first lieutenant too keen to resist such technical details they are purely technical details you must take them as that one does not think of the dead body as a man recently deceased who had perhaps a wife and business connections and a weakness for oysters or pale brandy or as something that laughed and cried and didnt like getting hurt that would spoil everything one thinks of him merely as a uniform with marks upon it that will tell us what kind of stuff we have against us and possibly with papers that will give us a hint of how far he and his lot are getting sick of the whole affair  theres a kind of hardening not only of the body but of the mind through all this life out here one is living on a different level you knowjust before i came awayyou talked of dowerhouselandand outside this is outside its different our men here are kind enough still to little thingskittens or birds or flowers behind the front for example everywhere there are tommy gardens some are quite bright little patches but its just nonsense to suppose we are tender to the wounded up hereand putting it plainly there isnt a scrap of pity left for the enemy not a scrap not a trace of such feeling they were tender about the wounded in the early daysmen tell meand reverent about the dead its all gone now there have been atrocities gas unforgettable things everything is harder our people are inclined now to laugh at a man who gets hit and to be annoyed at a man with a troublesome wound the other day they say there was a big dead german outside the essex trenches he became a nuisance and he was dragged in and taken behind the line and buried after he was buried a kindly soul was putting a board over him with somebodys fritz on it when a shell burst close by it blew the man with the board a dozen yards and wounded him and it restored fritz to the open air he was lifted clean out he flew head over heels like a windmill this was regarded as a tremendous joke against the men who had been at the pains of burying him for a time nobody else would touch fritz who was now some yards behind his original grave then as he got worse and worse he was buried again by some devoted sanitarians and this time the inscription was somebodys fritz rip and as luck would have it he was spun up again in pieces the trench howled with laughter and cries of good old fritz this isnt the resurrection fritz  another thing that appeals to the sunny humour of the trenches as a really delicious practical joke is the trick of the fuses we have two kinds of fuse a slowburning fuse such as is used for handgrenades and suchlike things a sort of yardaminute fuse and a rapid fuse that goes a hundred yards a secondfor firing mines and so on the latter is carefully distinguished from the former by a conspicuous red thread also as you know it is the habit of the enemy and ourselves when the trenches are near enough to enliven each other by the casting of homely but effective handgrenades made out of tins when a grenade drops in a british trench somebody seizes it instantly and throws it back to hoist the german with his own petard is particularly sweet to the british mind when a grenade drops into a german trench everybody runs at least that is what i am told happens by the men from our trenches though possibly each side has its exceptions if the bomb explodes it explodes if it doesnt hans and fritz presently come creeping back to see what has happened sometimes the fuse hasnt caught properly it has been thrown by a nervous man or it hasnt burnt properly then hans or fritz puts in a new fuse and sends it back with loving care to hoist the briton with his own petard is particularly sweet to the german mind but here it is that military genius comes in some gifted spirit on our side procured probably by larceny a length of mine fuse the rapid sort and spent a laborious day removing the red thread and making it into the likeness of its slow brother then bits of it were attached to tinbombs and shiedunlit of courseinto the german trenches a long but happy pause followed i can see the chaps holding themselves in hans and fritz were understood to be creeping back to be examining the unlit fuse to be applying a light thereunto in order to restore it to its maker after their custom  a loud bang in the german trenches indicated the moment of lighting and the exit of hans and fritz to worlds less humorous  the genius in the british trenches went on with the preparation of the next surprise bombagainst the arrival of kurt and karl  hans fritz kurt karl michael and wilhelm it went for quite a long time before they grew suspicious  you once wrote that all fighting ought to be done nowadays by metal soldiers i perceive my dear daddy that all real fighting is   section 11  not all hughs letters were concerned with these grim technicalities it was not always that news and gossip came along it was rare that a young man with a commission would condescend to talk shop to two young men without one there were few newspapers and fewer maps and even in france and within sound of guns hugh could presently find warfare almost as much a bore as it had been at times in england but his criticism of military methods died away things are done better out here he remarked and were nearer reality here i begin to respect my captain who is developing a sense of locality happily for our prospects and in another place he speculated in an oddly characteristic manner whether he was getting used to the army way whether he was beginning to see the sense of the army way or whether it really was that the army way braced up nearer and nearer to efficiency as it got nearer to the enemy and here one hasnt the haunting feeling that war is after all an hallucination its already common sense and the business of life  in england i always had a sneaking idea that i had dressed up in my uniform  i never dreamt before i came here how much war is a business of waiting about and going through duties and exercises that were only too obviously a means of preventing our discovering just how much waiting about we were doing i suppose there is no great harm in describing the place i am in here its a kind of scenery that is somehow all of a piece with the life we lead day by day it is a village that has been only partly smashed up it has never been fought through indeed the germans were never within two miles of it but it was shelled intermittently for months before we made our advance almost all the houses are still standing but there is not a window left with a square foot of glass in the place one or two houses have been burnt out and one or two are just as though they had been kicked to pieces by a lunatic giant we sleep in batches of four or five on the floors of the rooms there are very few inhabitants about but the village inn still goes on it has one poor weary billiardtable very small with very big balls and the cues are without tops it is the amusement of the place ortheris does miracles at it when he leaves the army he says hes going to be a marker a by marker the country about us is flatfeaturelessdesolate how i long for hills even for essex mud hills then the road runs on towards the front a brick road frightfully worn lined with poplars just at the end of the village mechanical transport ends and there is a kind of depot from which all the stuff goes up by mules or men or bicycles to the trenches it is the only movement in the place and i have spent hours watching men shift grub or ammunition or lending them a hand all day one hears guns a kind of thud at the stomach and now and then one sees an aeroplane very high and small just beyond this point there is a group of poplars which have been punished by a german shell they are broken off and splintered in the most astonishing way all split and ravelled out like the end of a cane that has been broken and twisted to get the ends apart the choice of ones leisure is to watch the asc or play football twenty a side or sit about indoors or stand in the doorway or walk down to the estaminet and wait five or six deep for the billiardtable ultimately one sits and so you get these unconscionable letters  unconscionable said mr britling of coursehe will grow out of that sort of thing  and hell write some day sure enough hell write  he went on reading the letter  we read of course but there never could be a library here big enough to keep us going we can do with all sorts of books but i dont think the ordinary sensational novel is quite the catch it was for a lot of them in peace time some break towards serious reading in the oddest fashion old park for example says he wants books you can chew he is reading a cheap edition of the origin of species he used to regard florence warden and william le queux as the supreme delights of print i wish you could send him metchnikoffs nature of man or pearsons ethics of freethought i feel i am building up his tender mind not for me though daddy nothing of that sort for me these things take people differently what i want here is literary opium i want something about fauns and nymphs in broad low glades i would like to read spensers faerie queen i dont think i have read it and yet i have a very distinct impression of knights and dragons and sorcerers and wicked magic ladies moving through a sort of preraphaelite tapestry sceneryonly with a light on them i could do with some hewlett of the forest lovers kind or with joseph conrad in his kew palmhouse mood and there is a book i once looked into it at a mans room in london i dont know the title but it was by richard garnett and it was all about gods who were in reduced circumstances but amidst sunny picturesque scenery scenery without steel or poles or wire a thing after the manner of heines florentine nights any book about greek gods would be welcome anything about temples of ivorycoloured stone and purple seas red caps chests of jewels and lizards in the sun i wish there was another thais the men here are getting a kind of newspaper sheet of literature scraps called the times broadsheets snippets but mostly from good stuff theyre small enough to stir the appetite but not to satisfy it rather an irritantand one wants no irritant i used to imagine reading was meant to be a stimulant out here it has to be an anodyne  have you heard of a book called tom cringles log  war is an exciting gamethat i never wanted to play it excites once in a couple of months and the rest of it is dirt and muddle and boredom and smashed houses and spoilt roads and muddy scenery and boredom and the lumbering along of supplies and the lumbering back of the wounded and wearyand boredom and continual vague guessing of how it will end and boredom and boredom and boredom and thinking of the work you were going to do and the travel you were going to have and the waste of life and the waste of days and boredom and splintered poplars and stink everywhere stink and dirt and boredom and all because these accursed prussians were too stupid to understand what a boredom they were getting ready when they pranced and stuck their chests out and earnt the praises of mr thomas carlyle gott strafe deutschland so send me some books books of dreams books about china and the willowpattern plate and the golden age and fairyland and send them soon and address them very carefully   section 12  teddys misadventure happened while figs were still ripening on mr britlings big tree it was cissie brought the news to mr britling she came up to the dower house with a white scared face  ive come up for the letters she said theres bad news of teddy and lettys rather in a state  hes not mr britling left the word unsaid  hes wounded and missing said cissie  a prisoner said mr britling  and wounded how we dont know  she added letty has gone to telegraph  telegraph to whom  to the war office to know what sort of wound he has they tell nothing its disgraceful  it doesnt say severely  it says just nothing wounded and missing surely they ought to give us particulars  mr britling thought his first thought was that now news might come at any time that hugh was wounded and missing then he set himself to persuade cissie that the absence of seriously meant that teddy was only quite bearably wounded and that if he was also missing it might be difficult for the war office to ascertain at once just exactly what she wanted to know but cissie said merely that letty was in an awful state and after mr britling had given her a few instructions for his typing he went down to the cottage to repeat these mitigatory considerations to letty he found her much whiter than her sister and in a state of cold indignation with the war office it was clear she thought that organisation ought to have taken better care of teddy she had a curious effect of feeling that something was being kept back from her it was manifest too that she was disposed to regard mr britling as biased in favour of the authorities  at any rate she said they could have answered my telegram promptly i sent it at eight two hours of scornful silence  this fierce strained unjust letty was a new aspect to mr britling her treatment of his proffered consolations made him feel slightly henpecked  and just fancy she said they have no means of knowing if he has arrived safely on the german side how can they know he is a prisoner without knowing that  but the word is missing  that means a prisoner said letty uncivilly   section 13  mr britling returned to the dower house perplexed and profoundly disturbed he had a distressful sense that things were far more serious with teddy than he had tried to persuade letty they were that wounded and missing meant indeed a man abandoned to very sinister probabilities he was distressed for teddy and still more acutely distressed for mrs teddy whose every note and gesture betrayed suppositions even more sinister than his own and that preposterous sense of liability because he had helped teddy to get his commission was more distressful than it had ever been he was surprised that letty had not assailed him with railing accusations  and this event had wiped off at one sweep all the protective scab of habituation that had gathered over the wound of hughs departure he was back face to face with the one evil chance in five  in the hall there was lying a letter from hugh that had come by the second post it was a relief even to see it  hugh had had his first spell in the trenches  before his departure he had promised his half brothers a long and circumstantial account of what the trenches were really like here he redeemed his promise he had evidently written with the idea that the letter would be handed over to them  tell the bruddykinses im glad theyre going to brinsmead school later on i suppose they will go on to statesminster i suppose that you dont care to send them so far in these troubled times  and now about those trenchesas i promised the great thing to grasp is that they are narrow they are a sort of negative wall they are more like giant cracks in the ground than anything else but perhaps i had better begin by telling how we got there we started about one in the morning ladened up with everything you can possibly imagine on a soldier and in addition i had a kettlefilled with watermost of the chaps had bundles of firewood and some had extra bread we marched out of our quarters along the road for a mile or more and then we took the fields and presently came to a crest and dropped into a sort of maze of zigzag trenches going up to the front trench these trenches you know are much deeper than ones height you dont see anything its like walking along a mudwalled passage you just trudge along them in single file every now and then some one stumbles into a soakaway for rainwater or swears at a soft place or somebody blunders into the man in front of him this seems to go on for hours and hours it certainly went on for an hour so i suppose we did two or three miles of it at one place we crossed a dip in the ground and a ditch and the trench was built up with sandbags up to the ditch and there was a plank overhead there were stars and now and then a sort of blaze thing they send up lit up the edges of the trench and gave one a glimpse of a treetop or a factory roof far away then for a time it was more difficult to go on because you were blinded suddenly just when you were believing that this sort of trudge was going on forever we were in the support trenches behind the firing line and found the men we were relieving ready to come back  and the firing line itself just the same sort of ditch with a parapet of sandbags but with dugouts queer big holes helped out with sleepers from a nearby railway track opening into it from behind dugouts vary a good deal many are rather like the cubbyhouse we made at the end of the orchard last summer only the walls are thick enough to stand a high explosive shell the best dugout in our companys bit of front was quite a dressy affair with some woodwork and a door got from the ruins of a house twenty or thirty yards behind us it had a stove in it too and a chimbley and pans to keep water in it was the best dugout for miles this house had a well and there was a special trench ran back to that and all day long there was a coming and going for water there had once been a pump over the well but a shell had smashed that  and now you expect me to tell of germans and the fight and shelling and all sorts of things i havent seen a live german i havent been within two hundred yards of a shell burst there has been no attack and i havent got the vc i have made myself muddy beyond describing ive been working all the time but ive not fired a shot or fought a haporth we were busy all the timejust at work repairing the parapet which had to be done gingerly because of snipers bringing our food in from the rear in big carriers getting water pushing our trench out from an angle slantingways forward getting meals clearing up and so on takes a lot of time we make tea in big kettles in the big dugout which two whole companies use for their cooking and carry them with a pole through the handles to our platoons we wash up and wash and shave dinner preparation and consumption takes two or three hours tea too uses up time its like camping out and picnicking in the park this first time and next too we have been mixed with some sussex men who have been here longer and know the business it works out that we do most of the fatigue afterwards we shall go up alone to a pitch of our own  but all the time you want to know about the germans they are a quarter of a mile away at this part or nearly a quarter of a mile when you snatch a peep at them it is like a low particoloured stone wallonly the stones are sandbags the germans have them black and white so that you cannot tell which are loopholes and which are black bags our people havent been so cleverand the war office love of uniformity has given us only white bags no doubt it looks neater but it makes our loopholes plain for a time black sandbags were refused the germans sniped at us but not very much only one of our lot was hit by a chance shot that came through the sandbag at the top of the parapet he just had a cut in the neck which didnt prevent his walking back they shelled the trenches half a mile to the left of us though and it looked pretty hot the sandbags flew about but the men lie low and it looks worse than it is the weather was fine and pleasant as general french always says and after three days and nights of cramped existence and petty chores one in the foremost trench and two a little way back and then two days in support we came backand here we are again waiting for our second go  the night time is perhaps a little more nervy than the day you get your head up and look about and see the flat dim country with its ruined houses and its lumps of stuff that are dead bodies and its long vague lines of sandbags and the searchlights going like white windmill arms and an occasional flare or star shell and you have a nasty feeling of people creeping and creeping all night between the trenches  some of us went out to strengthen a place in the parapet that was only one sandbag thick where a man had been hit during the day we made it four bags thick right up to the top all the while you were doing it you dreaded to find yourself in the white glare of a searchlight and you had a feeling that something would hit you suddenly from behind i had to make up my mind not to look round or i should have kept on looking round also our chaps kept shooting over us within a foot of ones head just to persuade the germans that we were not out of the trench  nothing happened to us we got back all right it was silly to have left that parapet only one bag thick theres the truth and all of my first time in the trenches  and the germans  i tell you there was no actual fighting at all i never saw the head of one  but now see what a good bruddykins i am i have seen a fight a real exciting fight and i have kept it to the last to tell you about it was a fight in the air and the british won it began with a german machine appearing very minute and high sailing towards our lines a long way to the left we could tell it was a german because of the black cross they decorate every aeroplane with a black iron cross on its wings and tail that our officer could see with his glasses he let me look suddenly whack whack whack came a line of little puffs of smoke behind it and then one in front of it which meant that our antiaircraft guns were having a go at it then as suddenly archibald stopped and we could see the british machine buzzing across the path of the german it was just like two birds circling in the air or wasps they buzzed like wasps there was a little cracklinglike brushing your hair in frosty weather they were shooting at each other then our lieutenant called out hit by jove and handed the glasses to park and instantly wanted them back he says he saw bits of the machine flying off  when he said that you could fancy you saw it too up there in the blue  anyhow the little machine cocked itself up on end rather slowly then down it came like dropping a knife  it made you say ooooo to see that dive it came down seemed to get a little bit under control and then dive down again you could hear the engine roar louder and louder as it came down i never saw anything fall so fast we saw it hit the ground among a lot of smashedup buildings on the crest behind us it went right over and flew to pieces all to smithereens  it hurt your nose to see it hit the ground  somehowi was sort of overcome by the thought of the men in that dive i was trying to imagine how they felt it from the moment when they realised they were going  what on earth must it have seemed like at last  they fell seven thousand feet the men say some say nine thousand feet a mile and a half  but all the chaps were cheering and there was our machine hanging in the sky you wanted to reach up and pat it on the back it went up higher and away towards the german lines as though it was looking for another german it seemed to go now quite slowly it was an english machine though for a time we werent sure our machines are done in tricolour just as though they were french but everybody says it was english it was one of our crack fighting machines and from first to last it has put down seven germans and thats really all the fighting there was there has been fighting here a month ago there are perhaps a dozen dead germans lying out still in front of the lines little twisted figures like overthrown scarecrows about a hundred yards away but that is all  no the trenches have disappointed me they are a scene of tiresome domesticity they arent a patch on our quarters in the rear there isnt the traffic ive not found a single excuse for firing my rifle i dont believe i shall ever fire my rifle at an enemyever  youve seen rendezvous fresh promotion i suppose hes one of the men the young officers talk about everybody believes in him do you remember how manning used to hide from him   section 14  mr britling read this through and then his thoughts went back to teddys disappearance and then returned to hugh the youngster was right in the front now and one had to steel oneself to the possibilities of the case somehow mr britling had not expected to find hugh so speedily in the firing line though he would have been puzzled to find a reason why this should not have happened but he found he had to begin the lesson of stoicism all over again  he read the letter twice and then he searched for some indication of its date he suspected that letters were sometimes held back  four days later this suspicion was confirmed by the arrival of another letter from hugh in which he told of his second spell in the trenches this time things had been much more lively they had been heavily shelled and there had been a german attack and this time he was writing to his father and wrote more freely he had scribbled in pencil  things are much livelier here than they were our guns are getting to work they are firing in spells of an hour or so three or four times a day and just when they seem to be leaving off they begin again the germans suddenly got the range of our trenches the day before yesterday and begun to pound us with high explosive well its trying you never seem quite to know when the next bang is coming and that keeps your nerves hung up it seems to tighten your muscles and tire you weve done nothing but lie low all day and i feel as weary as if i had marched twenty miles then whop ones near you and there is a flash and everything flies its a mad sort of smashabout one came much too close to be pleasant as near as the old oil jars are from the barn court door it bowled me clean over and sent a lot of gravel over me when i got up there was twenty yards of trench smashed into a mere hole and men lying about and some of them groaning and one threequarters buried we had to turn to and get them out as well as we could  i felt stunned and insensitive it was well to have something to do  our guns behind felt for the german guns it was the damnest racket like giant lunatics smashing about amidst colossal pots and pans they fired different sorts of shells stink shells as well as jack johnsons and though we didnt get much of that at our corner there was a sting of chlorine in the air all through the afternoon most of the stink shells fell short we hadnt masks but we rigged up a sort of protection with our handkerchiefs and it didnt amount to very much it was rather like the chemistry room after heinrich and the kids had been mixing things most of the time i was busy helping with the men who had got hurt suddenly there came a lull then some one said the germans were coming and i had a glimpse of them  you dont look at anything steadily while the guns are going when a big gun goes off or a shell bursts anywhere near you you seem neither to see nor hear for a moment you keep on being intermittently stunned one sees in a kind of flicker in between the impacts  well there they were this time i saw them they were coming out and running a little way and dropping and our shell was bursting among them and behind them a lot of it was going too far i watched what our men were doing and poured out a lot of cartridges ready to my hand and began to blaze away half the german attack never came out of their trench if they really intended business against us which i doubt they were halfhearted in carrying it out they didnt show for five minutes and they left two or three score men on the ground whenever we saw a man wriggle we were told to fire at him it might be an unwounded man trying to crawl back for a time our guns gave them beans then it was practically over but about sunset their guns got back at us again and the artillery fight went on until it was moonlight the chaps in our third company caught it rather badly and then our guns seemed to find something and get the upper hand  in the night some of our men went out to repair the wire entanglements and one man crawled halfway to the enemy trenches to listen but i had done my bit for the day and i was supposed to sleep in the dugout i was far too excited to sleep all my nerves were jumping about and my mind was like a lot of flying fragments flying about very fast  they shelled us again next day and our tea dixy was hit so that we didnt get any tea  i slept thirty hours after i got back here and now i am slowly digesting these experiences most of our fellows are my mind and nerves have been rather bumped and bruised by the shelling but not so much as you might think i feel as though id presently not think very much of it some of our men have got the stun of it a lot more than i have it gets at the older men more everybody says that the men of over thirtyfive dont recover from a shelling for weeks they go aboutsort of hesitatingly  life is very primitive herewhich doesnt mean that one is getting down to anything fundamental but only going back to something immediate and simple its fetching and carrying and getting water and getting food and going up to the firing line and coming back one goes on for weeks and then one day one finds oneself crying out what is all this for when is it to end i seemed to have something ahead of me before this war began education science work discoveries all sorts of things but it is hard to feel that there is anything ahead of us here  somehow the last spell in the fire trench has shaken up my mind a lot i was getting used to the war before but now ive got back to my original amazement at the whole business i find myself wondering what we are really up to why the war began why we were caught into this amazing routine it looks it feels orderly methodical purposeful our officers give us orders and get their orders and the men back there get their orders everybody is getting orders back i suppose to lord kitchener it goes on for weeks with the effect of being quite sane and intended and the right thing and then then suddenly it comes whacking into ones head but thisthis is utterly mad this going to and fro and to and fro and to and fro this monotony which breaks ever and again into violenceviolence that never gets anywhereis exactly the life that a lunatic leads melancholia and mania its just a collective obsessionby war the world is really quite mad i happen to be having just one gleam of sanity that wont last after i have finished this letter i suppose when an individual man goes mad and gets out of the window because he imagines the door is magically impossible and dances about in the street without his trousers jabbing at passersby with a toastingfork he has just the same sombre sense of unavoidable necessity that we have all of us when we go off with our packs into the trenches  its only by an effort that i can recall how life felt in the spring of 1914 do you remember heinrich and his attempt to make a table chart of the roses so that we could sit outside the barn and read the names of all the roses in the barn court like the mountain charts they have on tables in switzerland what an inconceivable thing that is now for all i know i shot heinrich the other night for all i know he is one of the lumps that we counted after the attack went back  its a queer thing daddy but i have a sort of seditious feeling in writing things like this one gets to feel that it is wrong to think its the effect of discipline of being part of a machine still i doubt if i ought to think if one really looks into things in this spirit where is it going to take us ortherishis real name by the by is arthur jewellhasnt any of these troubles the by germans butted into belgium he says weve got to oof em out again thats all abart it leastways its all i know i dont know nothing about serbia i dont know nothing about anything except that the germans got to stop this sort of gime for everlasting amen  sometimes i think hes righter than i am sometimes i think he is only madder   section 15  these letters weighed heavily upon mr britlings mind he perceived that this precociously wise subtle youngster of his was now close up to the line of injury and death going to and fro from it in a perpetual fluctuating danger at any time now in the day or night the evil thing might wing its way to him if mr britling could have prayed he would have prayed for hugh he began and never finished some ineffectual prayers  he tried to persuade himself of a roman stoicism that he would be sternly proud sternly satisfied if this last sacrifice for his country was demanded from him he perceived he was merely humbugging himself  this war had no longer the simple greatness that would make any such stern happiness possible  the disaster to teddy and mrs teddy hit him hard he winced at the thought of mrs teddys white face the unspoken accusation in her eyes he felt he could never bring himself to say his one excuse to her i did not keep hugh back if i had done that then you might have the right to blame  if he had overcome every other difficulty in the way to an heroic pose there was still hughs unconquerable lucidity of outlook war was a madness  but what else was to be done what else could be done we could not give in to germany if a lunatic struggles sane men must struggle too  mr britling had ceased to write about the war at all all his later writings about it had been abandoned unfinished he could not imagine them counting affecting any one producing any effect indeed he was writing now very intermittently his contributions to the times had fallen away he was perpetually thinking now about the war about life and death about the religious problems that had seemed so remote in the days of the peace but none of his thinking would become clear and definite enough for writing all the clear stars of his mind were hidden by the stormy clouds of excitement that the daily newspaper perpetually renewed and by the daily developments of life and just as his professional income shrank before his mental confusion and impotence the private income that came from his and his wifes investments became uncertain she had had two thousand pounds in the constantinople loan seven hundred in debentures of the ottoman railway he had held similar sums in two hungarian and one bulgarian loan in a linoleum factory at rouen and in a swiss hotel company all these stopped payments and the dividends from their other investments shrank there seemed no limit set to the possibilities of shrinkage of capital and income income tax had leapt to colossal dimensions the cost of most things had risen and the tangle of life was now increased by the need for retrenchments and economies he decided that gladys the facetiously named automobile was a luxury and sold her for a couple of hundred pounds he lost his gardener who had gone to higher priced work with a miller and he had great trouble to replace him so that the garden became disagreeably unkempt and unsatisfactory he had to give up his frequent trips to london he was obliged to defer statesminster for the boys for a time at any rate they must go as day boys to brinsmead at every point he met this uncongenial consideration of ways and means for years now he had gone easy lived with a certain selfindulgence it was extraordinarily vexatious to have ones greater troubles for ones country and ones son and ones faith crossed and complicated by these little troubles of the extra sixpence and the untimely bill  what worried his mind perhaps more than anything else was his gradual loss of touch with the essential issues of the war at first the militarism the aggression of germany had seemed so bad that he could not see the action of britain and her allies as anything but entirely righteous he had seen the war plainly and simply in the phrase now this militarism must end he had seen germany as a system as imperialism and junkerism as a callous materialist aggression as the spirit that makes war and the allies as the protest of humanity against all these evil things  insensibly in spite of himself this first version of the war was giving place to another the tawdry rhetorical german emperor who had been the great antagonist at the outset the last upholder of cæsarism gods anointed with the withered arm and the mailed fist had receded from the foreground of the picture that truer germany which is thought and system which is the will to do things thoroughly the germany of ostwald and the once rejected hindenburg was coming to the fore it made no apology for the errors and crimes that had been imposed upon it by its hohenzollern leadership but it fought now to save itself from the destruction and division that would be its inevitable lot if it accepted defeat too easily fought to hold out fought for a second chance with discipline with skill and patience with a steadfast will it fought with science it fought with economy with machines and thought against all too human antagonists it necessitated an implacable resistance but also it commanded respect against it fought three great peoples with as fine a will but they had neither the unity the habitual discipline nor the science of germany and it was the latter defect that became more and more the distressful matter of mr britlings thoughts france after her initial experiences after her first reeling month had risen from the very verge of defeat to a steely splendour of resolution but england and russia those twin slack giants still wasted force were careless negligent uncertain everywhere up and down the scale from the stupidity of the uniform sandbags and hughs young officer who would not use a map to the general conception and direction of the war mr britlings inflamed and oversensitised intelligence perceived the same bad qualities for which he had so often railed upon his countrymen in the days of the peace that impatience that indolence that wastefulness and inconclusiveness that failure to grip issues and do obviously necessary things the same lax qualities that had brought england so close to the supreme imbecility of a civil war in ireland in july 1914 were now muddling and prolonging the war and postponing it might be for ever the victory that had seemed so certain only a year ago the politician still intrigued the ineffectives still directed against brains used to the utmost their fight was a stupid thrusting forth of men and men and yet more men men badly trained underequipped stupidly led a press clamour for invention and scientific initiative was stifled under a committee of elderly celebrities and eminent dufferdom from the outset the ministry of munitions seemed under the influence of the business man  it is true that righteousness should triumph over the tyrant and the robber but have carelessness and incapacity any right to triumph over capacity and foresight men were coming now to dark questionings between this intricate choice and indeed was our cause all righteousness  there surely is the worst doubt of all for a man whose son is facing death  were we indeed standing against tyranny for freedom  there came drifting to mr britlings ears a confusion of voices voices that told of reaction of the schemes of employers to best the trade unions of greedy shippers and greedy house landlords reaping their harvest of waste and treason in the very households of the ministry of religious cant and intolerance at large of selfadvertisement written in letters of blood of forestalling and jobbery of irrational and exasperating oppressions in india and egypt it came with a shock to him too that hugh should see so little else than madness in the war and have so pitiless a realisation of its essential futility the boy forced his father to seewhat indeed all along he had been seeing more and more clearly the war even by the standards of adventure and conquest had long since become a monstrous absurdity some way there must be out of this bloody entanglement that was yielding victory to neither side that was yielding nothing but waste and death beyond all precedent the vast majority of people everywhere must be desiring peace willing to buy peace at any reasonable price and in all the world it seemed there was insufficient capacity to end the daily butchery and achieve the peace that was so universally desired the peace that would be anything better than a breathing space for further warfare every day came the papers with the balanced story of battles losses destructions ships sunk towns smashed and never a decision never a sign of decision  one saturday afternoon mr britling found himself with mrs britling at claverings lady homartyn was in mourning for her two nephews the glassington boys who had both been killed one in flanders the other in gallipoli raeburn was there too despondent and tiredlooking there were three young men in khaki one with the red of a staff officer there were two or three women whom mr britling had not met before and miss sharsper the novelist fresh from nursing experience among the convalescents in the south of france but he was disgusted to find that the gathering was dominated by his old antagonist lady frensham unsubdued unaltered rampant over them all arrogant impudent insulting she was in mourning she had the most splendid black furs mr britling had ever seen her large triumphant profile came out of them like the head of a vulture out of its ruff her elder brother was a wounded prisoner in germany her second was dead it would seem that hers were the only sacrifices the war had yet extorted from any one she spoke as though it gave her the sole right to criticise the war or claim compensation for the war  her incurable propensity to split the country to make mischievous accusations against classes and districts and public servants was having full play she did her best to provoke mr britling into a dispute and throw some sort of imputation upon his patriotism as distinguished from her own noisy and intolerant conceptions of loyalty  she tried him first with conscription she threw out insults at the shirkers and the funk classes all the middleclass people clung on to their wretched little businesses made any sort of excuse  mr britling was stung to defend them a business he said acidly isnt like land which waits and grows rich for its owner and these people cant leave ferrety little agents behind them when they go off to serve tens of thousands of middleclass men have ruined themselves and flung away every prospect they had in the world to go to this war  and scores of thousands havent said lady frensham they are the men im thinking of  mr britling ran through a little list of aristocratic stayathomes that began with a duke  and not a soul speaks to them in consequence she said  she shifted her attack to the labour people they would rather see the country defeated than submit to a little discipline  because they have no faith in the house of lawyers or the house of landlords said mr britling who can blame them  she proceeded to tell everybody what she would do with strikers she would give them short shrift she would give them a taste of the prussian wayhomoeopathic treatment but of course old votecatching asquith darenthe darent mr britling opened his mouth and said nothing he was silenced the men in khaki listened respectfully but ambiguously one of the younger ladies it seemed was entirely of lady frenshams way of thinking and anxious to show it the good lady having now got her hands upon the cabinet proceeded to deal faithfully with its twoandtwenty members winston churchill had overridden lord fisher upon the question of gallipoli and incurred terrible responsibilities lord haldaneshe called him tubby haldanewas a convicted traitor the mans a german out and out oh what if he hasnt a drop of german blood in his veins hes a german by choicewhich is worse  i thought he had a certain capacity for organisation said mr britling  we dont want his organisation and we dont want him said lady frensham  mr britling pleaded for particulars of the late lord chancellors treasons there were no particulars it was just an idea the good lady had got into her head that had got into a number of accessible heads there was only one strong man in all the country now lady frensham insisted that was sir edward carson  mr britling jumped in his chair  but has he ever done anything he cried except embitter ireland  lady frensham did not hear that question she pursued her glorious theme lloyd george who had once been worthy only of the gallows was now the sole minister fit to put beside her hero he had won her heart by his condemnation of the working man he was the one man who was not afraid to speak out to tell them they drank to tell them they shirked and loafed to tell them plainly that if defeat came to this country the blame would fall upon them  no cried mr britling  yes said lady frensham upon them and those who have flattered and misled them  and so on  it presently became necessary for lady homartyn to rescue mr britling from the great ladys patriotic tramplings he found himself drifting into the autumnal gardenthe show of dahlias had never been so wonderfulin the company of raeburn and the staff officer and a small woman who was presently discovered to be remarkably wellinformed they were all despondent i think all this promiscuous blaming of people is quite the worstand most ominousthing about us just now said mr britling after the restful pause that followed the departure from the presence of lady frensham  it goes on everywhere said the staff officer  is it reallyhonest said mr britling  raeburn after reflection decided to answer as far as it is stupid yes theres a lot of blame coming theres bound to be a day of reckoning and i suppose weve all got an instinctive disposition to find a scapegoat for our common sins the tory press is pretty rotten and theres a strong element of mere personal spitein the churchill attacks for example personal jealousy probably our old families seem to have got vulgarspirited imperceptiblyin a generation or so they quarrel and shirk and lay blame exactly as bad servants doand things are still far too much in their hands things are getting muffed there can be no doubt about thatnot fatally but still rather seriously and the governmentit was human before the war and weve added no archangels theres muddle theres mutual suspicion you never know what newspaper office lloyd george wont be in touch with next hes honest and patriotic and energetic but hes mortally afraid of old women and class intrigues he doesnt know where to get his backing hes got all a labour members terror of the dagger at his back theres a lack of nerve too in getting rid of prominent officerswho have friends  the staff officer nodded  northcliffe seems to me to have a case said mr britling every one abuses him  id stop his daily mail said raeburn id leave the times but id stop the daily mail on the score of its placards alone it overdoes northcliffe it translates him into the shrieks and yells of underlings the plain fact is that northcliffe is scared out of his wits by german efficiencyand in war time when a man is scared out of his wits whether he is honest or not you put his head in a bag or hold a pistol to it to calm him what is the good of all this clamouring for a change of government we havent a change of government its like telling a tramp to get a change of linen our men all our public men are secondrate men with the habits of advocates there is nothing masterful in their minds how can you expect the system to produce anything else but they are doing as well as they can and there is no way of putting in any one else now and there you are  meanwhile said mr britling our boysget killed  theyd get killed all the more if you hadlet us saycarson and lloyd george and northcliffe and lady frensham with i suppose austin harrison and horatio bottomley thrown inas a strong silent government id rather have northcliffe as dictator than that we cant suddenly go back on the past and alter our type we didnt listen to matthew arnold weve never thoroughly turned out and cleaned up our higher schools weve resisted instruction weve preferred to maintain our national luxuries of a bench of bishops and party politics and compulsory greek and the university sneer and lady frensham and all that sort of thing and here we are well damn it were in for it now weve got to plough through with itwith what we haveas what we are  the young staff officer nodded he thought that was about it  youve got no sons said mr britling  im not even married said raeburn as though he thanked god  the little wellinformed lady remarked abruptly that she had two sons one was just home wounded from suvla bay what her son told her made her feel very grave she said that the public was still quite in the dark about the battle of anafarta it had been a hideous muddle and we had been badly beaten the staff work had been awful nothing joined up nothing was on the spot and in time the water supply for example had gone wrong the men had been mad with thirst one regiment which she named had not been supported by another when at last the first came back the two battalions fought in the trenches regardless of the enemy there had been no leading no correlation no plan some of the guns she declared had been left behind in egypt some of the train was untraceable to this day it was mislaid somewhere in the levant at the beginning sir ian hamilton had not even been present he had failed to get there in time it had been the reckless throwing away of an army and so hopeful an army her son declared it meant the complete failure of the dardanelles project  and when one hears how near we came to victory she cried and left it at that  three times this year said raeburn we have missed victories because of the badness of our staff work its no good picking out scapegoats its a question of national habit its because the sort of man we turn out from our public schools has never learnt how to catch trains get to an office on the minute pack a knapsack properly or do anything smartly and quicklyanything whatever that he can possibly get done for him you cant expect men who are habitually easygoing to keep bucked up to a high pitch of efficiency for any length of time all their training is against it all their tradition they hate being prigs an englishman will be any sort of stupid failure rather than appear a prig thats why weve lost three good fights that we ought to have wonand thousands and thousands of menand material and time precious beyond reckoning weve lost a year weve dashed the spirit of our people  my boy in flanders said mr britling says about the same thing he says our officers have never learnt to count beyond ten and that they are scared at the sight of a map  and the war goes on said the little woman  how long oh lord how long cried mr britling  id give them another year said the staff officer just going as we are going then something must give way there will be no money anywhere therell be no more men i suppose theyll feel that shortage first anyhow russia alone has over twenty millions  thats about the size of it said raeburn  do you think sir therell be civil war asked the young staff officer abruptly after a pause  there was a little interval before any one answered this surprising question  after the peace i mean said the young officer  therell be just the devil to pay said raeburn  one thing after another in the country is being pulled up by its roots reflected mr britling  weve never produced a plan for the war and it isnt likely we shall have one for the peace said raeburn and added and lady frenshams little lot will be doing their level best to sit on the safetyvalve theyll rake up ireland and ulster from the very start but i doubt if ulster will save em  we shall squabble what else do we ever do  no one seemed able to see more than that a silence fell on the little party  well thank heaven for these dahlias said raeburn affecting the philosopher  the young staff officer regarded the dahlias without enthusiasm   section 16  mr britling sat one september afternoon with captain lawrence carmine in the sunshine of the barn court and smoked with him and sometimes talked and sometimes sat still  when it began i did not believe that this war could be like other wars he said i did not dream it i thought that we had grown wiser at last it seemed to me like the dawn of a great clearing up i thought the common sense of mankind would break out like a flame an indignant flame and consume all this obsolete foolery of empires and banners and militarism directly it made its attack upon human happiness a score of things that i see now were preposterous i thought must happennaturally i thought america would declare herself against the belgian outrage that she would not tolerate the smashing of the great sister republicif only for the memory of lafayette welli gather america is chiefly concerned about our making cotton contraband i thought the balkan states were capable of a reasonable give and take of a common care for their common freedom i see now three german royalties trading in peasants and no men in their lands to gainsay them i saw this war as so many frenchmen have seen it as something that might legitimately command a splendid enthusiasm of indignation it was all a dream the dream of a prosperous comfortable man who had never come to the cutting edge of life everywhere cunning everywhere small feuds and hatreds distrusts dishonesties timidities feebleness of purpose dwarfish imaginations swarm over the great and simple issues it is a war now like any other of the mobbing manyaimed cataclysms that have shattered empires and devastated the world it is a war without point a war that has lost its soul it has become mere incoherent fighting and destruction a demonstration in vast and tragic forms of the stupidity and ineffectiveness of our species  he stopped and there was a little interval of silence  captain carmine tossed the fag end of his cigar very neatly into a tub of hydrangeas three thousand years ago in china he said there were men as sad as we are for the same cause  three thousand years ahead perhaps said mr britling there will still be men with the same sadness and yetand yet no just now i have no elasticity it is not in my nature to despair but things are pressing me down i dont recover as i used to recover i tell myself still that though the way is long and hard the spirit of hope the spirit of creation the generosities and gallantries in the heart of man must end in victory but i say that over as one repeats a wornout prayer the light is out of the sky for me sometimes i doubt if it will ever come back let younger men take heart and go on with the world if i could die for the right thing nowinstead of just having to live on in this world of ineffective strugglei would be glad to die now carmine   section 17  in these days also mr direck was very unhappy  for cissie at any rate had not lost touch with the essential issues of the war she was as clear as ever that german militarism and the german attack on belgium and france was the primary subject of the war and she dismissed all secondary issues she continued to demand why america did not fight we fight for belgium wont you fight for the dutch and norwegian ships wont you even fight for your own ships that the germans are sinking  mr direck attempted explanations that were ill received  you were ready enough to fight the spaniards when they blew up the maine but the germans can sink the lusitania thatsas you saya different proposition  his mind was shot by an extraordinary suspicion that she thought the lusitania an american vessel but mr direck was learning his cissie and he did not dare to challenge her on this score  you havent got hold of the american proposition he said were thinking beyond wars  thats what we have been trying to do said cissie do you think we came into it for the fun of the thing  havent i shown in a hundred ways that i sympathise  ohsympathy  he fared little better at mr britlings hands mr britling talked darkly but pointed all the time only too plainly at america theres two sorts of liberalism said mr britling that pretend to be the same thing theres the liberalism of great aims and the liberalism of defective moral energy   section 18  it was not until teddy had been missing for three weeks that hugh wrote about him the two essex battalions on the flanders front were apparently wide apart and it was only from home that hugh learnt what had happened  you cant imagine how things narrow down when one is close up against them one does not know what is happening even within a few miles of us until we get the newspapers then with a little reading between the lines and some bold guessing we fit our little bit of experience with a general shape of course ive wondered at times about teddy but oddly enough ive never thought of him very much as being out here its queer i know but i havent i cant imagine why  i dont know about missing weve had nothing going on here that has led to any missing all our men have been accounted for but every few miles along the front conditions alter his lot may have been closer up to the enemy and there may have been a rush and a fight for a bit of trench either way in some parts the german trenches are not thirty yards away and there is mining bomb throwing and perpetual creeping up and give and take here weve been getting a bit forward but ill tell you about that presently and anyhow i dont understand about missing theres very few prisoners taken now but dont tell letty that i try to imagine old teddy in it  missings a queer thing it isnt tragicor pitiful or partly reassuring like prisoner it just sends one speculating and speculating i cant find any one who knows where the 14th essex are things move about here so mysteriously that for all i know we may find them in the next trench next time we go up but there is a chance for teddy its worth while bucking letty all you can and at the same time theres odds against him there plainly and unfeelingly is how things stand in my mind i think chiefly of letty im glad cissie is with her and im glad shes got the boy keep her busy she was frightfully fond of him ive seen all sorts of things between them and i know that ill try and write to her soon and ill find something hopeful to tell her  meanwhile ive got something to tell you ive been through a fight a big fight and i havent got a scratch ive taken two prisoners with my lily hand men were shot close to me i didnt mind that a bit it was as exciting as one of those bitter fights we used to have round the hockey goal i didnt mind anything till afterwards then when i was in the trench in the evening i trod on something slipperypah and after it was all over one of my chums got itsort of unfairly and i keep on thinking of those two things so much that all the early part is just dreamlike its more like something ive read in a book or seen in the illustrated london news than actually been through one had been thinking so often how will it feel how shall i behave that when it came it had an effect of being flat and ordinary  they say we hadnt got enough guns in the spring or enough ammunition thats all right nowanyhow they started in plastering the germans overnight and right on until it was just daylight i never heard such a row and their trencheswe could stand up and look at them without getting a single shot at uswere flying about like the crater of a volcano we were not in our firing trench we had gone back into some new trenches at the reari think to get out of the way of the counter fire but this morning they werent doing very much for once our guns were on top there was a feeling of anticipationvery like waiting for an examination paper to be given out then we were at it getting out of a trench to attack gives you an odd feeling of being just hatched suddenly the world is big i dont remember our gun fire stopping and then you rush come on come on say the officers everybody gives a sort of howl and rushes when you see men dropping you rush the faster the only thing that checks you at all is the wire twisted about everywhere you dont want to trip over that the frightening thing is the exposure after being in the trenches so long you feel naked you run like a scared child for the german trench ahead i cant understand the iron nerve of a man who can expose his back by turning to run away and theres a thirsty feeling with ones bayonet but they didnt wait they dropped rifles and ran but we ran so fast after them that we caught one or two in the second trench i got down into that heard a voice behind me and found my two prisoners lying artful in a dugout they held up their hands as i turned if they hadnt i doubt if i should have done anything to them i didnt feel like it i felt friendly  not all the germans ran three or four stuck to their machineguns until they got bayoneted both the trenches were frightfully smashed about and in the first one there were little knots and groups of dead we got to work at once shying the sandbags over from the old front of the trench to the parados our guns had never stopped all the time they were now plastering the third line trenches and almost at once the german shells began dropping into us of course they had the range to an inch one didnt have any time to feel and think one just set oneself with all ones energy to turn the trench over  i dont remember that i helped or cared for a wounded man all the time or felt anything about the dead except to step over them and not on them i was just possessed by the idea that we had to get the trench into a sheltering state before they tried to come back and then stick there i just wanted to win and there was nothing else in my mind  they did try to come back but not very much  then when i began to feel sure of having got hold of the trench for good i began to realise just how tired i was and how high the sun had got i began to look about me and found most of the other men working just as hard as i had been doing weve done it i said and that was the first word id spoken since i told my two germans to come out of it and stuck a man with a wounded leg to watch them its a bit of all right said ortheris knocking off also and lighting a halfconsumed cigarette he had been wearing it behind his ear i believe ever since the charge against this occasion hed kept close up to me all the time i realised and then old park turned up very cheerful with a weak bayonet jab in his forearm that he wanted me to rebandage it was good to see him practically all right too  i took two prisoners i said and everybody i spoke to i told that i was fearfully proud of it  i thought that if i could take two prisoners in my first charge i was going to be some soldier  i had stood it all admirably i didnt feel a bit shaken i was as tough as anything id seen death and killing and it was all just hockey  and then that confounded ortheris must needs go and get killed  the shell knocked me over and didnt hurt me a bit i was a little stunned and some dirt was thrown over me and when i got up on my knees i saw jewell lying about six yards offand his legs were all smashed about ugh pulped  he looked amazed bloody he said bloody he fixed his eyes on me and suddenly grinned you know wed once had two fights about his saying bloody i think i told you at the time a fight and a return match he couldnt box for nuts but he stood up like a briton and it appealed now to his sense of humour that i should be standing there too dazed to protest at the old offence i thought you was done in he said im in a messa bloody mess aint i like a stuck pig bloodyright enough bloody i didnt know i ad it in me  he looked at me and grinned with a sort of pale satisfaction in keeping up to the lastdying good ortheris to the finish i just stood up helpless in front of him still rather dazed  he said something about having a thundering thirst on him  i really dont believe he felt any pain he would have done if he had lived  and then while i was fumbling with my waterbottle he collapsed he forgot all about ortheris suddenly he said something that cut me all to ribbons his face puckered up just like the face of a fretful child which refuses to go to bed i didnt want to be aut of it he said petulantly and im done and thenthen he just looked discontented and miserable and diedright off turned his head a little way over as if he was impatient at everything faintedand fluttered out  for a time i kept trying to get him to drink  i couldnt believe he was dead  and suddenly it was all different i began to cry like a baby i kept on with the waterbottle at his teeth long after i was convinced he was dead i didnt want him to be aut of it god knows how i didnt i wanted my dear little cockney cad back oh most frightfully i wanted him back  i shook him i was like a scared child i blubbered and howled things its all different since he died  my dear dear father i am grieving and grievingand its altogether nonsense and its all mixed up in my mind with the mess i trod on and it gets worse and worse so that i dont seem to feel anything really even for teddy  its been just the last straw of all this hellish foolery  if ever there was a bigger lie my dear daddy than any other it is that man is a reasonable creature  war is just foolerylunatic fooleryhells foolery  but anyhow your son is sound and wellif sorrowful and angry we were relieved that night and there are rumours that very soon we are to have a holiday and a refit we lost rather heavily we have been praised but all along essex has done well i cant reckon to get back yet but there are such things as leave for eightandforty hours or so in england  i shall be glad of that sort of turning round  im tired oh im tired  i wanted to write all about jewell to his mother or his sweetheart or some one i wanted to wallow in his praises to say all the things i really find now that i thought about him but i havent even had that satisfaction he was a poor law child he was raised in one of those awful places between sutton and banstead in surrey ive told you of all the sweethearting he had soldiers three was his bible he was always singing tipperary and he never got the tune right nor learnt more than three lines of it he laced all his talk with by it was his jewel his ruby but he had the pluck of a robin or a squirrel i never knew him scared or anything but cheerful misfortunes humiliations only made him chatty and hed starve to have something to give away  well well this is the way of war daddy this is what war is damn the kaiser damn all fools give my love to the mother and the bruddykins and every one   section 19  it was just a day or so over three weeks after this last letter from hugh that mr direck reappeared at matchings easy he had had a trip to hollanda trip that was as much a flight from cissies reproaches as a mission of inquiry he had intended to go on into belgium where he had already been doing useful relief work under mr hoover but the confusion of his own feelings had checked him and brought him back  mr direcks mind was in a perplexity only too common during the stresses of that tragic year he was entangled in a paradox like a large majority of americans at that time his feelings were quite definitely proally and like so many in that majority he had a very clear conviction that it would be wrong and impossible for the united states to take part in the war his sympathies were intensely with the dower house and its dependent cottage he would have wept with generous emotion to see the stars and stripes interwoven with the three other great banners of red white and blue that led the world against german imperialism and militarism but for all that his mind would not march to that tune against all these impulses fought something very fundamental in mr direcks composition a preconception of america that had grown almost insensibly in his mind the idea of america as a polity aloof from the old world system as a fresh start for humanity as something altogether too fine and precious to be dragged into even the noblest of european conflicts america was to be the beginning of the fusion of mankind neither german nor british nor french nor in any way national she was to be the great experiment in peace and reasonableness she had to hold civilisation and social order out of this fray to be a refuge for all those finer things that die under stress and turmoil it was her task to maintain the standards of life and the claims of humanitarianism in the conquered province and the prisoners compound she had to be the healer and arbitrator the remonstrance and not the smiting hand surely there were enough smiting hands  but this idea of an america judicial remonstrating and aloof led him to a conclusion that scandalised him if america will not and should not use force in the ends of justice he argued then america has no right to make and export munitions of war she must not trade in what she disavows he had a quite exaggerated idea of the amount of munitions that america was sending to the allies he was inclined to believe that they were entirely dependent upon their transatlantic supplies and so he found himself persuaded that the victory of the allies and the honour of america were incompatible things andin spite of his ethical aloofnesshe loved the allies he wanted them to win and he wanted america to abandon a course that he believed was vitally necessary to their victory it was an intellectual dilemma he hid this selfcontradiction from matchings easy with much the same feelings that a curate might hide a poisoned dagger at a teaparty  it was entirely against his habits of mind to hide anythingmore particularly an entanglement with a difficult propositionbut he perceived quite clearly that neither cecily nor mr britling were really to be trusted to listen calmly to what under happier circumstances might be a profoundly interesting moral complication yet it was not in his nature to conceal it was in his nature to state  and cecily made things much more difficult she was pitiless with him she kept him aloof how can i let you make love to me she said when our english men are all going to the war when teddy is a prisoner and hugh is in the trenches if i were a man  she couldnt be induced to see any case for america england was fighting for freedom and america ought to be beside her all the world ought to unite against this german wickedness she said  im doing all i can to help in belgium he protested arent i working weve fed four million people  he had backbone and he would not let her he was resolved bully him into a falsehood about his country america was aloof she was right to be aloof at the same time cecilys reproaches were unendurable and he could feel he was drifting apart from her  he couldnt make america go to war  in the quiet of his london hotel he thought it all out he sat at a writingtable making notes of a perfectly lucid statement of the reasonable balanced liberal american opinion an instinct of caution determined him to test it first on mr britling  but mr britling realised his worst expectations he was beyond listening  ive not heard from my boy for more than three weeks said mr britling in the place of any salutation this morning makes threeandtwenty days without a letter  it seemed to mr direck that mr britling had suddenly grown ten years older his face was more deeply lined the colour and texture of his complexion had gone grey he moved restlessly and badly his nerves were manifestly unstrung  its intolerable that one should be subjected to this ghastly suspense the boy isnt three hundred miles away  mr direck made obvious inquiries  always before hes writtengenerally once a fortnight  they talked of hugh for a time but mr britling was fitful and irritable and quite prepared to hold mr direck accountable for the laxity of the war office the treachery of bulgaria the ambiguity of roumania or any other barb that chanced to be sticking into his sensibilities they lunched precariously then they went into the study to smoke  there mr direck was unfortunate enough to notice a copy of that innocent american publication the new republic lying close to two or three numbers of the fatherland a progerman periodical which at that time inflicted itself upon english writers with the utmost determination mr direck remarked that the new republic was an interesting effort on the part of la jeunesse américaine mr britling regarded the interesting effort with a jaded unloving eye  you americans he said are the most extraordinary people in the world  our conditions are exceptional said mr direck  you think they are said mr britling and paused and then began to deliver his soul about america in a discourse of accumulating bitterness at first he reasoned and explained but as he went on he lost selfcontrol he became dogmatic he became denunciatory he became abusive he identified mr direck more and more with his subject he thrust the uncivil you more and more directly at him he let his cigar go out and flung it impatiently into the fire as though america was responsible for its going out  like many britons mr britling had that touch of patriotic feeling towards america which takes the form of impatient criticism no one in britain ever calls an american a foreigner to see faults in germany or spain is to tap boundless fountains of charity but the faults of america rankle in an english mind almost as much as the faults of england mr britling could explain away the faults of england readily enough our hanoverian monarchy our established church and its deadening effect on education our imperial obligations and the strain they made upon our supplies of administrative talent were all very serviceable for that purpose but there in america was the old race without crown or church or international embarrassment and it was still falling short of splendid his speech to mr direck had the rancour of a family quarrel let me only give a few sentences that were to stick in mr direcks memory  you think you are out of it for good and all so did we think we were as smug as you are when france went down in 71 yours is only one further degree of insularity you think this vacuous aloofness of yours is some sort of moral superiority so did we so did we  it wont last you ten years if we go down  do you think that our disaster will leave the atlantic for you do you fancy there is any freedom of the seas possible beyond such freedom as we maintain except the freedom to attack you for forty years the british fleet has guarded all america from european attack your monroe doctrine skulks behind it now  im sick of this high thin talk of yours about the war you are a nation of ungenerous onlookerswatching us throttle or be throttled you gamble on our winning and we shall win we shall win and you will profit and when we have won a victory only one shade less terrible than defeat then you think you will come in and tinker with our peace bleed us a little more to please your hyphenated patriots  he came to his last shaft you talk of your new ideals of peace you say that you are too proud to fight but your business men in new york give the show away theres a little printed card now in half the offices in new york that tells of the real pacificism of america theyre busy you know trades real good and so as not to interrupt it they stick up this card nix on the war think of itnix on the war here is the whole fate of mankind at stake and americas contribution is a little grumbling when the germans sank the lusitania and no end of grumbling when we hold up a ship or two and some fool of a harbourmaster makes an overcharge otherwisenix on the war  well let it be nix on the war dont come here and talk to me you who were searching registers a year ago to find your essex kin let it be nix explanations what do i want with explanations andhe mocked his guests accent and his guests mode of thoughtdifcult prapsitions  he got up and stood irresolute he knew he was being preposterously unfair to america and outrageously uncivil to a trusting guest he knew he had no business now to end the talk in this violent fashion but it was an enormous relief and to mend mattersno he was glad hed said these things  he swung a shoulder to mr direck and walked out of the room  mr direck heard him cross the hall and slam the door of the little parlour  mr direck had been stirred deeply by the tragic indignation of this explosion and the ring of torment in mr britlings voice he had stood up also but he did not follow his host  its his boy said mr direck at last confidentially to the writingdesk how can one argue with him its just hell for him   section 20  mr direck took his leave of mrs britling and went very slowly towards the little cottage but he did not go to the cottage he felt he would only find another soul in torment there  whats the good of hanging round talking said mr direck  he stopped at the stile in the lane and sat thinking deeply only one thing will convince her he said  he held out his fingers first this he whispered and then that yes  he went on as far as the bend from which one sees the cottage and stood for a little time regarding it  he returned still more sorrowfully to the junction and with every step he took it seemed to him that he would rather see cecily angry and insulting than not see her at all  at the post office he stopped and wrote a lettercard  dear cissie he wrote i came down today to see youand thought better of it im going right off to find out about teddy somehow ill get that settled ill fly around and do that somehow if i have to go up to the german front to do it and when ive got that settled ive got something else in my mindwell it will wipe out all this little trouble thats got so big between us about neutrality and i love you dearly cissie  that was all the card would hold   section 21  and then as if it were something that every one in the dower house had been waiting for came the message that hugh had been killed  the telegram was brought up by a girl in a pinafore instead of the boy of the old dispensation for boys now were doing the work of youths and youths the work of the men who had gone to the war  mr britling was standing at the front door he had been surveying the late october foliage touched by the warm light of the afternoon when the messenger appeared he opened the telegram hoping as he had hoped when he opened any telegram since hugh had gone to the front that it would not contain the exact words he read that it would say wounded that at the worst it would say missing that perhaps it might even tell of some pleasant surprise a brief return to home such as the last letter had foreshadowed he read the final unqualified statement the terse regrets he stood quite still for a moment or so staring at the words  it was a mile and a quarter from the post office to the dower house and it was always his custom to give telegraph messengers who came to his house twopence and he wanted very much to get rid of the telegraph girl who stood expectantly before him holding her red bicycle he felt now very sick and strained he had a conviction that if he did not by an effort maintain his bearing cool and dry he would howl aloud he felt in his pocket for money there were some coppers and a shilling he pulled it all out together and stared at it  he had an absurd conviction that this ought to be a sixpenny telegram the thing worried him he wanted to give the brat sixpence and he had only threepence and a shilling and he didnt know what to do and his brain couldnt think it would be a shocking thing to give her a shilling and he couldnt somehow give just coppers for so important a thing as hughs death then all this problem vanished and he handed the child the shilling she stared at him inquiring incredulous is there a reply sir please  no he said thats for you all of it this is a peculiar sort of telegram its news of importance  as he said this he met her eyes and had a sudden persuasion that she knew exactly what it was the telegram had told him and that she was shocked at this galalike treatment of such terrible news he hesitated feeling that he had to say something else that he was socially inadequate and then he decided that at any cost he must get his face away from her staring eyes she made no movement to turn away she seemed to be taking him in recording him for repetition greedily with every fibre of her being  he stepped past her into the garden and instantly forgot about her existence   section 22  he had been thinking of this possibility for the last few weeks almost continuously and yet now that it had come to him he felt that he had never thought about it before that he must go off alone by himself to envisage this monstrous and terrible fact without distraction or interruption  he saw his wife coming down the alley between the roses  he was wrenched by emotions as odd and unaccountable as the emotions of adolescence he had exactly the same feeling now that he had had when in his boyhood some unpleasant admission had to be made to his parents he felt he could not go through a scene with her yet that he could not endure the task of telling her of being observed he turned abruptly to his left he walked away as if he had not seen her across his lawn towards the little summerhouse upon a knoll that commanded the high road she called to him but he did not answer  he would not look towards her but for a time all his senses were alert to hear whether she followed him safe in the summerhouse he could glance back  it was all right she was going into the house  he drew the telegram from his pocket again furtively almost guiltily and reread it he turned it over and read it again  killed  then his own voice hoarse and strange to his ears spoke his thought  my god how unutterably silly why did i let him go why did i let him go   section 23  mrs britling did not learn of the blow that had struck them until after dinner that night she was so accustomed to ignore his incomprehensible moods that she did not perceive that there was anything tragic about him until they sat at table together he seemed heavy and sulky and disposed to avoid her but that sort of moodiness was nothing very strange to her she knew that things that seemed to her utterly trivial the reading of political speeches in the times little comments on life made in the most casual way mere movements could so avert him she had cultivated a certain disregard of such fitful darknesses but at the dinnertable she looked up and was stabbed to the heart to see a haggard white face and eyes of deep despair regarding her ambiguously  hugh she said and then with a chill intimation what is it  they looked at each other his face softened and winced  my hugh he whispered and neither spoke for some seconds  killed he said and suddenly stood up whimpering and fumbled with his pocket  it seemed he would never find what he sought it came at last a crumpled telegram he threw it down before her and then thrust his chair back clumsily and went hastily out of the room she heard him sob she had not dared to look at his face again  oh she cried realising that an impossible task had been thrust upon her  but what can i say to him she said with the telegram in her hand  the parlourmaid came into the room  clear the dinner away said mrs britling standing at her place master hugh is killed and then wailing oh what can i say what can i say   section 24  that night mrs britling made the supreme effort of her life to burst the prison of selfconsciousness and inhibition in which she was confined never before in all her life had she so desired to be spontaneous and unrestrained never before had she so felt herself hampered by her timidity her selfcriticism her deeply ingrained habit of never letting herself go she was rent by reflected distress it seemed to her that she would be ready to give her life and the whole world to be able to comfort her husband now and she could conceive no gesture of comfort she went out of the diningroom into the hall and listened she went very softly upstairs until she came to the door of her husbands room there she stood still she could hear no sound from within she put out her hand and turned the handle of the door a little way and then she was startled by the loudness of the sound it made and at her own boldness she withdrew her hand and then with a gesture of despair with a face of white agony she flitted along the corridor to her own room  her mind was beaten to the ground by this catastrophe of which to this moment she had never allowed herself to think she had never allowed herself to think of it the figure of her husband like some pitiful beast wounded and bleeding filled her mind she gave scarcely a thought to hugh oh what can i do for him she asked herself sitting down before her unlit bedroom fire what can i say or do  she brooded until she shivered and then she lit her fire  it was late that night and after an eternity of resolutions and doubts and indecisions that mrs britling went to her husband he was sitting close up to the fire with his chin upon his hands waiting for her he felt that she would come to him and he was thinking meanwhile of hugh with a slow unprogressive movement of the mind he showed by a movement that he heard her enter the room but he did not turn to look at her he shrank a little from her approach  she came and stood beside him she ventured to touch him very softly and to stroke his head my dear she said my poor dear  it is so dreadful for you she said it is so dreadful for you i know how you loved him  he spread his hands over his face and became very still  my poor dear she said still stroking his hair my poor dear  and then she went on saying poor dear saying it presently because there was nothing more had come into her mind she desired supremely to be his comfort and in a little while she was acting comfort so poorly that she perceived her own failure and that increased her failure and that increased her paralysing sense of failure  and suddenly her stroking hand ceased suddenly the real woman cried out from her  i cant reach you she cried aloud i cant reach you i would do anything you you with your heart half broken  she turned towards the door she moved clumsily she was blinded by her tears  mr britling uncovered his face he stood up astonished and then pity and pitiful understanding came storming across his grief he made a step and took her in his arms my dear he said dont go from me  she turned to him weeping and put her arms about his neck and he too was weeping  my poor wife he said my dear wife if it were not for youi think i could kill myself tonight dont cry my dear dont dont cry you do not know how you comfort me you do not know how you help me  he drew her to him he put her cheek against his own  his heart was so sore and wounded that he could not endure that another human being should go wretched he sat down in his chair and drew her upon his knees and said everything he could think of to console her and reassure her and make her feel that she was of value to him he spoke of every pleasant aspect of their lives of every aspect except that he never named that dear pale youth who waited now he could wait a little longer  at last she went from him  good night said mr britling and took her to the door it was very dear of you to come and comfort me he said   section 25  he closed the door softly behind her  the door had hardly shut upon her before he forgot her instantly he was alone again utterly alone he was alone in an empty world  loneliness struck him like a blow he had dependents he had cares he had never a soul to whom he might weep  for a time he stood beside his open window he looked at the bedbut no sleep he knew would come that nightuntil the sleep of exhaustion came he looked at the bureau at which he had so often written but the writing there was a shrivelled thing  this room was unendurable he must go out he turned to the window and outside was a troublesome noise of nightjars and a distant roaring of stags black trees blacknesses the sky clear and remote with a great company of stars the stars seemed attentive they stirred and yet were still it was as if they were the eyes of watchers he would go out to them  very softly he went towards the passage door and still more softly felt his way across the landing and down the staircase once or twice he paused to listen  he let himself out with elaborate precautions  across the dark he went and suddenly his boy was all about him playing climbing the cedars twisting miraculously about the lawn on a bicycle discoursing gravely upon his future lying on the grass breathing very hard and drawing preposterous caricatures once again they walked side by side up and downit was athwart this very spottalking gravely but rather shyly  and here they had stood a little awkwardly before the boy went in to say goodbye to his stepmother and go off with his father to the station  i will work tomorrow again whispered mr britling but tonighttonight tonight is yours can you hear me can you hear your father  who had counted on you   section 26  he went into the far corner of the hockey paddock and there he moved about for a while and then stood for a long time holding the fence with both hands and staring blankly into the darkness at last he turned away and went stumbling and blundering towards the rose garden a spray of creeper tore his face and distressed him he thrust it aside fretfully and it scratched his hand he made his way to the seat in the arbour and sat down and whispered a little to himself and then became very still with his arm upon the back of the seat and his head upon his arm       book iii  the testament of matchings easy     chapter the first  mrs teddy goes for a walk   section 1  all over england now where the livery of mourning had been a rare thing to see women and children went about in the october sunshine in new black clothes everywhere one met these fresh griefs mothers who had lost their sons women who had lost their men lives shattered and hopes destroyed the dyers had a great time turning coloured garments to black and there was also a growing multitude of crippled and disabled men it was so in england much more was it so in france and russia in all the countries of the allies and in germany and austria away into asia minor and egypt in india and japan and italy there was mourning the world was filled with loss and mourning and impoverishment and distress  and still the mysterious powers that required these things of mankind were unappeased and each day added its quota of heartstabbing messages and called for new mourning and sent home fresh consignments of broken and tormented men  some clung to hopes that became at last almost more terrible than black certainties  mrs teddy went about the village in a coloured dress bearing herself confidently teddy had been listed now as missing since reported killed and she had had two letters from his comrades they said teddy had been left behind in the ruins of a farm with one or two other wounded and that when the canadians retook the place these wounded had all been found butchered none had been found alive afterwards the canadians had had to fall back mr direck had been at great pains to hunt up wounded men from teddys company and also any likely canadians both at the base hospital in france and in london and to get what he could from them he had made it a service to cissie only one of his witnesses was quite clear about teddy but he alas was dreadfully clear there had been only one lieutenant among the men left behind he said and obviously that must have been teddy he had been prodded in halfadozen places his head was nearly severed from his body  direck came down and told the story to cissie shall i tell it to her he asked  cissie thought not yet she said  lettys face changed in those pitiful weeks when she was denying death she lost her pretty colour she became white her mouth grew hard and her eyes had a hard brightness she never wept she never gave a sign of sorrow and she insisted upon talking about teddy in a dry offhand voice constantly she referred to his final return teddy she said will be surprised at this or teddy will feel sold when he sees how i have altered that  presently we shall see his name in a list of prisoners she said he is a wounded prisoner in germany  she adopted that story she had no justification for it but she would hear no doubts upon it she presently began to prepare parcels to send him they want almost everything she told people they are treated abominably he has not been able to write to me yet but i do not think i ought to wait until he asks me  cissie was afraid to interfere with this  after a time letty grew impatient at the delay in getting any address and took her first parcel to the post office  unless you know what prison he is at said the postmistress  pity said letty i dont know that must it wait for that i thought the germans were so systematic that it didnt matter  the postmistress made tedious explanations that letty did not seem to hear she stared straight in front of her at nothing then in a pause in the conversation she picked up her parcel  its tiresome for him to have to wait she said but it cant be long before i know  she took the parcel back to the cottage  after all she said it gives us time to get the better sort of throat lozenges for himthe sort the syndicate shop doesnt keep  she put the parcel conspicuously upon the dresser in the kitchen where it was most in the way and set herself to make a jersey for teddy against the coming of the cold weather  but one night the white mask fell for a moment from her face  cissie and she had been sitting in silence before the fire she had been knittingshe knitted very badlyand cissie had been pretending to read and had been watching her furtively cissie eyed the slow toilsome growth of the slack woolwork for a time and the touch of angry effort in every stroke of the knitting needles then she was stirred to remonstrance  poor letty she said very softly suppose after all he is dead  letty met her with a pitiless stare  he is a prisoner she said isnt that enough why do you jab at me by saying that a wounded prisoner isnt that enough despicable trickery for god even to play on teddyour teddy to the very last moment he shall not be dead until the war is over until six months after the war  i will tell you why cissie  she leant across the table and pointed her remarks with her knitting needles speaking in a tone of reasonable remonstrance you see she said if people like teddy are to be killed then all our ideas that life is meant for honesty and sweetness and happiness are wrong and this world is just a place of devils just a dirty cruel hell getting born would be getting damned and so one must not give way to that idea however much it may seem likely that he is dead  you see if he is dead then cruelty is the law and some one must pay me for his death some one must pay me i shall wait for six months after the war dear and then i shall go off to germany and learn my way about there and i will murder some german not just a common german but a german who belongs to the guilty kind a sacrifice it ought for instance to be comparatively easy to kill some of the children of the crown prince or some of the bavarian princes i shall prefer german children i shall sacrifice them to teddy it ought not to be difficult to find people who can be made directly responsible the people who invented the poison gas for instance and kill them or to kill people who are dear to them or necessary to them women can do that so much more easily than men  that perhaps is the only way in which wars of this kind will ever be brought to an end by women insisting on killing the kind of people who make them rooting them out by a campaign of pursuit and assassination that will go on for years and years after the war itself is over murder is such a little gentle punishment for the crime of war it would be hardly more than a reproach for what has happened falling like snow death after death flake by flake this prince that statesman the count who writes so fiercely for war that is what i am going to do if teddy is really dead we women were ready enough a year or so ago to starve and die for the vote and that was quite a little thing in comparison with this business dont you see what i mean its so plain and sensible cissie whenever a man sits and thinks whether he will make a war or not then he will think too of women women with daggers bombs of a vengeance that will never tire nor rest of consecrated patient women ready to start out upon a pilgrimage that will only end with his death i wouldnt hurt these war makers no in spite of the poison gas in spite of trench feet and the men who have been made blind and the wounded who have lain for days dying slowly in the wet women ought not to hurt but i would kill like killing dangerous vermin it would go on year by year balkan kings german princes chancellors they would have schemed for so muchand come to just a rattle in the throat and if presently other kings and emperors began to prance about and review armies they too would go  until all the world understood that women would not stand war any more forever  of course i shall do something of the sort what else is there to do now for me  lettys eyes were bright and intense but her voice was soft and subdued she went on after a pause in the same casual voice you see now cissie why i cling to the idea that teddy is alive if teddy is alive then even if he is wounded he will get some happiness out of itand all this wont bejust rot if he is dead then everything is so desperately silly and cruel from top to bottom  she smiled wanly to finish her sentence  but letty said cissie there is the boy  i shall leave the boy to you compared with teddy i dont care that for the boy i never did what is the good of pretending some women are made like that  she surveyed her knitting poor stitches she said  im hard stuff cissie i take after mother more than father teddy is my darling all the tenderness of my life is teddy if it goes it goes i wont crawl about the world like all these other snivelling widows if theyve killed my man i shall kill blood for blood and loss for loss i shall get just as close to the particular germans who made this war as i can and i shall kill them and theirs  the womens association for the extirpation of the whole breed of war lords she threw out if i do happen to hurtdoes it matter  she looked at her sisters shocked face and smiled again  you think i go about staring at nothing she remarked not a bit of it i have been planning all sorts of things i have been thinking how i could get to germany or one might catch them in switzerland ive had all sorts of plans they cant go guarded for ever  oh it makes me despise humanity to see how many soldiers and how few assassins there are in the world after the things we have seen if people did their duty by the dagger there wouldnt be such a thing as a war lord in the world not one the kaiser and his sons and his sons sons would know nothing but fear now for all their lives fear would only cease to pursue as the coffin went down into the grave fear by sea fear by land for the vessel he sailed in the train he travelled in fear when he slept for the death in his dreams fear when he waked for the death in every shadow fear in every crowd fear whenever he was alone fear would stalk him through the trees hide in the corner of the staircase make all his food taste perplexingly so that he would want to spit it out  she sat very still brooding on that idea for a time and then stood up  what nonsense one talks she cried and yawned i wonder why poor teddy doesnt send me a post card or something to tell me his address i tell you what i am afraid of sometimes about him cissie  yes said cissie  loss of memory suppose a beastly lump of shell or something whacked him on the head i had a dream of him looking strange about the eyes and not knowing me that you know really may have happened it would be beastly of course  cissies eyes were critical but she had nothing ready to say  there were some moments of silence  oh bed said letty though i shall just lie scheming   section 2  cissie lay awake that night thinking about her sister as if she had never thought about her before  she began to weigh the concentrated impressions of a thousand memories she and her sister were near in age they knew each other with an extreme intimacy and yet it seemed to cissie that night as though she did not know letty at all a year ago she would have been certain she knew everything about her but the old familiar letty with the bright complexion and the wicked eye with her rebellious schoolgirl insistence upon the beautifulness of boofl young men and her frank and glowing passion for teddy with her delight in humorous mystifications and openair exercise and all the sunshine and laughter of life this sister letty who had been so satisfactory and complete and final had been thrust aside like a mask cissie no longer knew her sisters eyes lettys hand had become thin and unfamiliar and a little wrinkled she was sharpfeatured and thinlipped her acts which had once been predictable were incomprehensible and cissie was thrown back upon speculations in their schooldays letty had had a streak of intense sensibility she had been easily moved to tears but never once had she wept or given any sign of weeping since teddys name had appeared in the casualty list what was the strength of this tragic tension how far would it carry her was letty really capable of becoming a charlotte corday of carrying out a scheme of farseeing vengeance of making her way through long months and years nearer and nearer to revenge  were such revenges possible  would people presently begin to murder the makers of the great war what a strange thing it would be in history if so there came a punishment and end to the folly of kings  only a little while ago cissies imagination might have been captured by so romantic a dream she was still but a year or so out of the stage of melodrama but she was out of it she was growing up now to a subtler wisdom people she was beginning to realise do not do these simple things they make vows of devotion and they are not real vows of devotion they lovequite honestlyand qualify there are no great revenges but only little mean ones no lifelong vindications except the unrelenting vengeance of the law there is no real concentration of peoples lives anywhere such as romance demands there is change there is forgetfulness everywhere there is dispersal even to the tragic story of teddy would come the modifications of time even to the wickedness of the german princes would presently be added some conflicting aspects could letty keep things for years in her mind hard and terrible as they were now surely they would soften other things would overlay them  there came a rush of memories of letty in a dozen schoolgirl adventures times when she had ventured and times when she had failed letty frightened letty vexed letty launching out to great enterprises going high and hard and well for a time and then failing she had seen letty snivelling and dirty letty shamed and humiliated she knew her letty to the soul poor letty poor dear letty with a sudden clearness of vision cissie realised what was happening in her sisters mind all this tense scheming of revenges was the imaginative play with which letty warded off the black alternative to her hope it was not strength it was weakness it was a form of giving way she could not face starkly the simple fact of teddys death that was too much for her so she was building up this dream of a mission of judgment against the day when she could resist the facts no longer she was already persuaded only she would not be persuaded until her dream was ready if this state of suspense went on she might establish her dream so firmly that it would at last take complete possession of her mind and by that time also she would have squared her existence at matchings easy with the elaboration of her reverie  she would go about the place then fancying herself preparing for this tremendous task she would never really do she would study german maps she would read the papers about german statesmen and rulers perhaps she would even make weak attempts to obtain a situation in switzerland or in germany perhaps she would buy a knife or a revolver perhaps presently she would begin to hover about windsor or sandringham when peace was made and the german cousins came visiting again  into cissies mind came the image of the thing that might be letty shabby draggled with her sharp bright prettiness become haggard an assassin dreamer still dependent on mr britling doing his work rather badly in a distraught unpunctual fashion  she must be told she must be convinced soon or assuredly she would become an eccentric a strange character a matchings easy miss flite   section 3  cissie could think more clearly of lettys mind than of her own  she herself was in a tangle she had grown to be very fond of mr direck and to have a profound trust and confidence in him and her fondness seemed able to find no expression at all except a constant girding at his and americas avoidance of war she had fallen in love with him when he was wearing fancy dress she was a young woman with a stronger taste for body and colour than she supposed what indeed she resented about him though she did not know it was that he seemed never disposed to carry the spirit of fancy dress into everyday life to begin with he had touched both her imagination and senses and she wanted him to go on doing that instead of which he seemed lapsing more and more into reiterated assurances of devotion and the flat competent discharge of humanitarian duties always nowadays he was trying to persuade her that what he was doing was the right and honourable thing for him to do what he did not realise what indeed she did not realise was the exasperation his rightness and reasonableness produced in her when he saw he exasperated her he sought very earnestly to be righter and reasonabler and more plainly and demonstrably right and reasonable than ever  withal as she felt and perceived he was such a good thing such a very good thing so kind so trustworthy with a sort of slow strength with a careful honesty a big good childishness a passion for fairness and so helpless in her hands she could lash him and distress him yet she could not shake his slowly formed convictions  when cissie had dreamt of the lover that fate had in store for her in her old romantic days he was to be perfect always he and she were always to be absolutely in the right and if the story needed it the world in the wrong she had never expected to find herself tied by her affections to a man with whom she disagreed and who went contrary to her standards very much as if she was lashed on the back of a very nice elephant that would wince to but not obey the goad  so she nagged him and taunted him and would hear no word of his case and he wanted dreadfully to discuss his case he felt that the point of conscience about the munitions was particularly fine and difficult he wished she would listen and enter into it more but she thought with that more rapid english flash which is not so much thinking as feeling he loved that flash in her in spite of his persuasion of its injustice  her thought that he ought to go to the war made him feel like a renegade but her claim that he was somehow still english held him in spite of his reason in the midst of such perplexities he was glad to find one neutral task wherein he could find himself wholeheartedly with and for cissie  he hunted up the evidence of teddys fate with a devoted pertinacity  and in the meanwhile the other riddle resolved itself he had had a certain idea in his mind for some time he discovered one day that it was an inspiration he could keep his conscientious objection about america and still take a line that would satisfy cissie he took it  when he came down to matchings easy at her summons to bear his convincing witness of teddys fate he came in an unwonted costume it was a costume so wonderful in his imagination that it seemed to cry aloud to sound like a trumpet as he went through london to liverpool street station it was a costume like an international event it was a costume that he felt would blare right away to berlin and yet it was a costume so commonplace so much the usual wear now that cissie meeting him at the station and full of the thought of lettys trouble did not remark it felt indeed rather than observed that he was looking more strong and handsome than he had ever done since he struck upon her imagination in the fantastic wrap that teddy had found for him in the merry days when there was no death in the world and letty too resistant incalculable found no wonder in the wonderful suit  he bore his testimony it was the queer halting telling of a patchedtogether tale  i suppose said letty if i tell you now that i dont believe that that officer was teddy you will think i am cracked but i dont  she sat staring straight before her for a time after saying this then suddenly she got up and began taking down her hat and coat from the peg behind the kitchen door the hanging strap of the coat was twisted and she struggled with it petulantly until she tore it  where are you going cried cissie  lettys voice over her shoulder was the harsh voice of a scolding woman  im going outanywhere she turned coat in hand cant i go out if i like she asked its a beautiful day mustnt i go out i suppose you think i ought to take in what you have told me in a moment just smile and say indeed  abandonedwhile his men retreated how jolly and then not think of it any more besides i must go out you two want to be left together you want to canoodle do it while you can  then she put on coat and hat jamming her hat down on her head and said something that cissie did not immediately understand  hell have his turn in the trenches soon enough now that hes made up his mind he might have done it sooner  she turned her back as though she had forgotten them she stood for a moment as though her feet were wooden not putting her feet as she usually put her feet she took slow wide unsure steps she went outlike something that is mortally injured and still walksinto the autumnal sunshine she left the door wide open behind her   section 4  and cissie with eyes full of distress for her sister had still to grasp the fact that direck was wearing a canadian uniform  he stood behind her ashamed that in such a moment this fact and its neglect by every one could be so vivid in his mind   section 5  cissies estimate of her sisters psychology had been just the reverie of revenge had not yet taken a grip upon lettys mind sufficiently strong to meet the challenge of this conclusive evidence of teddys death she walked out into a world of sunshine now almost completely convinced that teddy was dead and she knew quite well that her dream of some dramatic and terrible vindication had gone from her she knew that in truth she could do nothing of that sort  she walked out with a set face and eyes that seemed unseeing and yet it was as if some heavy weight had been lifted from her shoulders it was over there was no more to hope for and there was nothing more to fear she would have been shocked to realise that her mind was relieved  she wanted to be alone she wanted to be away from every eye she was like some creature that after a long nightmare incubation is at last born into a clear bleak day she had to feel herself she had to stretch her mind in this cheerless sunshine this new world where there was to be no more teddy and no real revenge nor compensation for teddy teddy was past  hitherto she had had an angry sense of being deprived of teddyalmost as though he were keeping away from her now there was no more teddy to be deprived of  she went through the straggling village and across the fields to the hillside that looks away towards mertonsome and its steeple and where the hill begins to fall away she threw herself down under the hedge by the path near by the stile into the lane and lay still she did not so much think as remain blank waiting for the beginning of impressions  it was as it were a blank stare at the world  she did not know if it was five minutes or half an hour later that she became aware that some one was looking at her she turned with a start and discovered the reverend dimple with one foot on the stile and an expression of perplexity and consternation upon his chubby visage  instantly she understood already on four different occasions since teddys disappearance she had seen the good man coming towards her always with a manifest decision always with the same faltering doubt as now often in their happy days had she and teddy discussed him and derided him and rejoiced over him they had agreed he was as good as jane austens mr collins he really was very like mr collins except that he was plumper and now it was as if he was transparent to her hard defensive scrutiny she knew he was impelled by his tradition by his sense of fitness by his respect for his calling to offer her his ministrations and consolations to say his large flat amiabilities over her and pat her kindly with his hands and she knew too that he dreaded her she knew that the dear old humbug knew at the bottom of his heart quite certainly that he was a poor old humbug and that she was in his secret and at the bottom of his heart he found himself too honest to force his poor platitudes upon any who would not be glad of them if she could have been glad of them he would have had no compunction he was a man divided against himself failing to carry through his rich pretences dismayed  he had been taking his afternoon constitutional he had discovered her beyond the stile just in time to pull up then had come a fatal a preposterous hesitation she stared at him now with hard expressionless eyes  he stared back at her until his plump pink face was all consternation he was extraordinarily distressed it was as if a thousand unspoken things had been said between them  no wish he said intrude  if he had had the certain balm how gladly would he have given it  he broke the spell by stepping back into the lane he made a gesture with his hands as if he would have wrung them and then he had fled down the lanealmost at a run  po girl he shouted po girl and left her staring  staringand then she laughed  this was good this was the sort of thing one could tell teddy when at last he came back and she could tell him anything and then she realised again there was no more teddy there would be no telling and suddenly she fell weeping  oh teddy teddy she cried through her streaming tears how could you leave me how can i bear it  never a tear had she shed since the news first came and now she could weep she could weep her grief out she abandoned herself unreservedly to this blessed relief   section 6  there comes an end to weeping at last and letty lay still in the red light of the sinking sun  she lay so still that presently a little foraging robin came dirting down to the grass not ten yards away and stopped and looked at her and then it came a hop or so nearer  she had been lying in a state of passive abandonment her swollen wet eyes open regardless of everything but those quick movements caught her back to attention she began to watch the robin and to note how it glanced sidelong at her and appeared to meditate further approaches she made an almost imperceptible movement and straightway the little creature was in a projecting spray of berried hawthorn overhead  her tearwashed mind became vaguely friendly with an unconscious comfort it focussed down to the robin she rolled over sat up and imitated his friendly cheep   section 7  presently she became aware of footsteps rustling through the grass towards her  she looked over her shoulder and discovered mr britling approaching by the field path he looked white and tired and listless even his bristling hair and moustache conveyed his depression he was dressed in an old tweed knickerbocker suit and carrying a big atlas and some papers he had an effect of hesitation in his approach it was as if he wanted to talk to her and doubted her reception for him  he spoke without any preface direck has told you he said standing over her  she answered with a sob  i was afraid it was so and yet i did not believe it said mr britling until now  he hesitated as if he would go on and then he knelt down on the grass a little way from her and seated himself there was an interval of silence  at first it hurts like the devil he said at last looking away at mertonsome spire and speaking as if he spoke to no one in particular and then it hurts it goes on hurting and one cant say much to any one  he said no more for a time but the two of them comforted one another and knew that they comforted each other they had a common feeling of fellowship and ease they had been stricken by the same thing they understood how it was with each other it was not like the attempted comfort they got from those who had not loved and dreaded  she took up a little broken twig and dug small holes in the ground with it  its strange she said but im glad i know for sure  i can understand that said mr britling  it stops the nightmares it isnt hopes ive had so much as fears i wouldnt admit he was dead or hurt becausei couldnt think it without thinking ithorrible now  its final said mr britling  its definite she said after a pause its like thinking hes asleepfor good  but that did not satisfy her there was more than this in her mind it does away with the half and half she said hes dead or he is alive  she looked up at mr britling as if she measured his understanding  you dont still doubt he said  im content now in my mindin a way he wasnt anyhow thereunless he was dead but if i saw teddy coming over the hedge there to meit would be just natural no dont stare at me i know really he is dead and it is a comfort it is peace all the thoughts of him being crushed dreadfully or being mutilated or lying and screamingor things like thattheyve gone hes out of his spoilt body hes my unbroken teddy again out of sight somewhere unbroken sleeping  she resumed her excavation with the little stick with the tears running down her face  mr britling presently went on with the talk for me it came all at once without a doubt or a hope i hoped until the last that nothing would touch hugh and then it was like a black shutter fallingin an instant  he considered hugh too seems just round the corner at times but at times its a blank place  at times said mr britling i feel nothing but astonishment the whole thing becomes incredible just as for weeks after the war began i couldnt believe that a big modern nation could really go to warseriouslywith its whole heart and they have killed teddy and hugh  they have killed millions millionswho had fathers and mothers and wives and sweethearts   section 8  somehow i cant talk about this to edith it is ridiculous i know but in some way i cant it isnt fair to her if i could i would quite soon after we were married i ceased to talk to her i mean talking really and simplyas i do to you and its never come back i dont know why and particularly i cant talk to her of hugh little things little shadows of criticism but enough to make it impossible and i go about thinking about hugh and what has happened to him sometimes as though i was stifling  letty compared her case  i dont want to talk about teddynot a word  thats queer but perhapsa son is different now i come to think of itive never talked of mary not to any one ever ive never thought of that before but i havent i couldnt no losing a lover thats a thing for oneself ive been through that you see but a sons more outside you altogether and more your own making its not losing a thing in you its losing a hope and a pride once when i was a little boy i did a drawing very carefully it took me a long time and a big boy tore it up for no particular reason just out of cruelty thatthat was exactly like losing hugh  letty reflected  no she confessed im more selfish than that  it isnt selfish said mr britling but its a different thing its less intimate and more personally important  i have just thought hes gone hes gone sometimes do you know i have felt quite angry with him why need he have goneso soon  mr britling nodded understandingly  im not angry im not depressed im just bitterly hurt by the ending of something i had hoped to watchalwaysall my life he said i dont know how it is between most fathers and sons but i admired hugh i found exquisite things in him i doubt if other people saw them he was quiet he seemed clumsy but he had an extraordinary fineness he was a creature of the most delicate and rapid responses these arent my fond delusions it was so you know when he was only a few days old he would start suddenly at any strange sound he was alive like an Æolian harp from the very beginning and his hair when he was bornhe had a lot of hairwas like the down on the breast of a bird i remember that now very vividlyand how i used to like to pass my hand over it it was silk spun silk before he was two he could talkwhole sentences he had the subtlest ear he loved long words and then he said with tears in his voice all this beautiful fine structure this brain this fresh life as nimble as wateras elastic as a steel spring it is destroyed  i dont make out he wasnt human often and often i have been angry with him and disappointed in him there were all sorts of weaknesses in him we all knew them and we didnt mind them we loved him the better and his odd queer cleverness and his profound wisdom and then all this beautiful and delicate fabric all those clear memories in his dear brain all his whims his sudden inventions  you know i have had a letter from his chum park he was shot through a loophole the bullet went through his eye and brow think of it  an amazement  a blow  a splattering of blood rags of tormented skin and brain stuff in a moment what had taken eighteen yearslove and care  he sat thinking for an interval and then went on the reading and writing alone i taught him to read myselfbecause his first governess you see wasnt very clever she was a very good methodical sort but she had no inspiration so i got up all sorts of methods for teaching him to read but it wasnt necessary he seemed to leap all sorts of difficulties he leapt to what one was trying to teach him it was as quick as the movement of some wild animal  he came into life as bright and quick as this robin looking for food  and hes broken up and thrown away like a cartridge case by the side of a covert  he choked and stopped speaking his elbows were on his knees and he put his face between his hands and shuddered and became still his hair was troubled the end of his stumpy moustache and a little roll of flesh stood out at the side of his hand and made him somehow twice as pitiful his big atlas from which papers projected seemed forgotten by his side so he sat for a long time and neither he nor letty moved or spoke but they were in the same shadow they found great comfort in one another they had not been so comforted before since their losses came upon them   section 9  it was mr britling who broke silence and when he drew his hands down from his face and spoke he said one of the most amazing and unexpected things she had ever heard in her life  the only possible government in albania he said looking steadfastly before him down the hillside is a group of republican cantons after the swiss pattern i can see no other solution that is not offensive to god it does not matter in the least what we owe to serbia or what we owe to italy we have got to set this world on a different footing we have got to set up the world at laston justice and reason  then after a pause the treaty of bucharest was an evil treaty it must be undone whatever this german king of bulgaria does that treaty must be undone and the bulgarians united again into one people they must have themselves whatever punishment they deserve they must have nothing more whatever reward they win  she could not believe her ears  after this precious blood after this precious blood if we leave one plot of wickedness or cruelty in the world  and therewith he began to lecture letty on the importance of international politicsto every one how he and she and every one must understand however hard it was to understand  no life is safe no happiness is safe there is no chance of bettering life until we have made an end to all that causes war  we have to put an end to the folly and vanity of kings and to any people ruling any people but themselves there is no convenience there is no justice in any people ruling any people but themselves the ruling of men by others who have not their creeds and their languages and their ignorances and prejudices that is the fundamental folly that has killed teddy and hughand these millions to end that folly is as much our duty and business as telling the truth or earning a living  but how can you alter it  he held out a finger at her men may alter anything if they have motive enough and faith enough  he indicated the atlas beside him  here i am planning the real map of the world he said every sort of district that has a character of its own must have its own rule and the great republic of the united states of the world must keep the federal peace between them all thats the plain sense of life the federal worldrepublic why do we bother ourselves with loyalties to any other government but that it needs only that sufficient men should say it and that republic would be here now why have we loitered so longuntil these tragic punishments come we have to map the world out into its states and plan its government and the way of its tolerations  and you think it will come  it will come  and you believe that men will listen to such schemes said letty  mr britling with his eyes far away over the hills seemed to think yes he said not perhaps todaynot steadily but kings and empires die great ideas once they are born can never die again in the end this worldrepublic this sane government of the world is as certain as the sunset only  he sighed and turned over a page of his atlas blindly  only we want it soon the world is weary of this bloodshed weary of all this weeping of this wasting of substance and this killing of sons and lovers we want it soon and to have it soon we must work to bring it about we must give our lives what is left of our lives  that is what you and i must do letty what else is there left for us to do i will write of nothing else i will think of nothing else now but of safety and order so that all these dear deadnot one of them but will have brought the great days of peace and mans real beginning nearer and these cruel things that make men whimper like children that break down bright lives into despair and kill youth at the very moment when it puts out its clean hands to take hold of lifethese cruelties these abominations of confusion shall cease from the earth forever   section 10  letty regarded him frowning and with her chin between her fists  but do you really believe said letty that things can be better than they are  butyes said mr britling  i dont said letty the world is cruel it is just cruel so it will always be  it need not be cruel said mr britling  it is just a place of cruel things it is all set with knives it is full of diseases and accidents as for godeither there is no god or he is an idiot he is a slobbering idiot he is like some idiot who pulls off the wings of flies  no said mr britling  there is no progress nothing gets better how can you believe in god after hugh do you believe in god  yes said mr britling after a long pause i do believe in god  who lets these things happen she raised herself on her arm and thrust her argument at him with her hand who kills my teddy and your hughand millions  no said mr britling  but he must let these things happen or why do they happen  no said mr britling it is the theologians who must answer that they have been extravagant about god they have had silly absolute ideasthat he is all powerful that hes omnieverything but the common sense of men knows better every real religious thought denies it after all the real god of the christians is christ not god almighty a poor mocked and wounded god nailed on a cross of matter some day he will triumph but it is not fair to say that he causes all things now it is not fair to make out a case against him you have been misled it is a theologians folly god is not absolute god is finite a finite god who struggles in his great and comprehensive way as we struggle in our weak and silly waywho is with usthat is the essence of all real religion i agree with you sowhy if i thought there was an omnipotent god who looked down on battles and deaths and all the waste and horror of this warable to prevent these thingsdoing them to amuse himselfi would spit in his empty face  any one would  but its your teachers and catechisms have set you against god they want to make out he owns all nature and all sorts of silly claims like the heralds in the middle ages who insisted that christ was certainly a great gentleman entitled to bear arms but god is within nature and necessity necessity is a thing beyond godbeyond good and ill beyond space and time a mystery everlastingly impenetrable god is nearer than that necessity is the uttermost thing but god is the innermost thing closer he is than breathing and nearer than hands and feet he is the other thing than this world greater than nature or necessity for he is a spirit and they are blind but not controlling them not yet  they always told me he was the maker of heaven and earth  thats the jew god the christians took over its a quack god a panacea its not my god  letty considered these strange ideas  i never thought of him like that she said at last it makes it all seem different  nor did i but i do now i have suddenly found it and seen it plain i see it so plain that i am amazed that i have not always seen it it is you see so easy to understand that there is a god and how complex and wonderful and brotherly he is when one thinks of those dear boys who by the thousand by the hundred thousand have laid down their lives ay and there were german boys too who did the same the cruelties the injustice the brute aggressionthey saw it differently they laid down their livesthey laid down their lives those dear lives those lives of hope and sunshine  dont you see that it must be like that letty dont you see that it must be like that  no she said ive seen things differently from that  but its so plain to me said mr britling if there was nothing else in all the world but our kindness for each other or the love that made you weep in this kind october sunshine or the love i bear hughif there was nothing else at allif everything else was cruelty and mockery and filthiness and bitterness it would still be certain that there was a god of love and righteousness if there were no signs of god in all the world but the godliness we have seen in those two boys of ours if we had no other light but the love we have between us  you dont mind if i talk like this said mr britling its all i can think of nowthis god this god who struggles who was in hugh and teddy clear and plain and how he must become the ruler of the world  this god who struggles she repeated i have never thought of him like that  of course he must be like that said mr britling how can god be a person how can he be anything that matters to man unless he is limited and defined andhuman like ourselves with things outside him and beyond him   section 11  letty walked back slowly through the fields of stubble to her cottage  she had been talking to mr britling for an hour and her mind was full of the thought of this changed and simplified man who talked of god as he might have done of a bird he had seen or of a tree he had sheltered under and all mixed up with this thought of mr britling was this strange idea of god who was also a limited person who could come as close as teddy whispering love in the darkness she had a ridiculous feeling that god really struggled like mr britling and that with only some indefinable inferiority of outlook mr britling loved like god she loved him for his maps and his dreams and the bareness of his talk to her it was strange how the straining thought of the dead teddy had passed now out of her mind she was possessed by a sense of ending and beginning as though a page had turned over in her life and everything was new she had never given religion any thought but contemptuous thought for some years since indeed her growing intelligence had dismissed it as a scheme of inexcusable restraints and empty pretences a thing of discords where there were no discords except of its making she had been a happy atheist she had played in the sunshine a natural creature with the completest confidence in the essential goodness of the world in which she found herself she had refused all thought of painful and disagreeable things until the bloody paw of war had wiped out all her assurance teddy the playmate was over the love game was ended for ever the fresh happy acceptance of life as life and in the place of teddy was the sorrow of life the pity of life and this coming of god out of utter remoteness into a conceivable relation to her own existence  she had left mr britling to his atlas he lay prone under the hedge with it spread before him his occupation would have seemed to her only a little while ago the absurdest imaginable he was drawing boundaries on his maps very carefully in red ink with a fountain pen but now she understood  she knew that those red ink lines of mr britlings might in the end prove wiser and stronger than the bargains of the diplomats  in the last hour he had come very near to her she found herself full of an unwonted affection for him she had never troubled her head about her relations with any one except teddy before now suddenly she seemed to be opening out to all the world for kindness this new idea of a friendly god who had a struggle of his own who could be thought of as kindred to mr britling as kindred to teddyhad gripped her imagination he was behind the autumnal sunshine he was in the little bird that had seemed so confident and friendly whatever was kind whatever was tender there was god and a thousand old phrases she had read and heard and given little heed to that had lain like dry bones in her memory suddenly were clothed in flesh and became alive this godif this was godthen indeed it was not nonsense to say that god was love that he was a friend and companion with him it might be possible to face a world in which teddy and she would never walk side by side again nor plan any more happiness for ever after all she had been very happy she had had wonderful happiness she had had far more happiness far more love in her short years or so than most people had in their whole lives and so in the reaction of her emotions letty who had gone out with her head full of murder and revenge came back through the sunset thinking of pity of the thousand kindnesses and tendernesses of teddy that were after all perhaps only an intimation of the limitless kindnesses and tendernesses of god what right had she to a white and bitter grief selfcentred and vindictive while old britling could still plan an age of mercy in the earth and a redgold sunlight that was warm as a smile from teddy lay on all the world  she must go into the cottage and kiss cissie and put away that parcel out of sight until she could find some poor soldier to whom she could send it she had been pitiless towards cissie in her grief she had in the egotism of her sorrow treated cissie as she might have treated a chair or a table with no thought that cissie might be weary might dream of happiness still to come cissie had still to play the lover and her man was already in khaki there would be no such year as letty had had in the days before the war darkened the world before cissies marrying the peace must come and the peace was still far away and direck too would have to take his chances  letty came through the little wood and over the stile that brought her into sight of the cottage the windows of the cottage as she saw it under the bough of the big walnut tree were afire from the sun the crimson rambler over the porch that she and teddy had planted was still bearing roses the door was open and people were moving in the porch  some one was coming out of the cottage a stranger in an unfamiliar costume and behind him was a man in khakibut that was mr direck and behind him again was cissie  but the stranger  he came out of the frame of the porch towards the garden gate  whowho was this stranger  it was a man in queerlooking foreign clothes baggy trousers of some softlooking blue stuff and a blouse and he had a whitebandaged left arm he had a hat stuck at the back of his head and a beard  he was entirely a stranger a foreigner was she going insane of course he was a stranger  and then he moved a step he made a queer sideways pace a caper on the path and instantly he ceased to be strange and foreign he became amazingly incredibly familiar by virtue of that step  no  her breath stopped all lettys being seemed to stop and this stranger who was also incredibly familiar after he had stared at her motionless form for a moment waved his hat with a gesturea gesture that crowned and scaled the effect of familiarity she gave no sign in reply  no that familiarity was just a mad freakishness in things  this strange man came from belgium perhaps to tell something about teddy  and then she surprised herself by making a groaning noise an absurd silly noise just like the noise when one imitates a cow to a child she said mooooo  and she began to run forward with legs that seemed misfits waving her hands about and as she ran she saw more and more certainly that this wounded man in strange clothing was teddy she ran faster and still faster stumbling and nearly falling if she did not get to him speedily the world would burst  to hold him to hold close to him  letty letty just one arm  she was clinging to him and he was holding her  it was all right she had always known it was all right hold close to him except just for a little while but that had been foolishness hadnt she always known he was alive and here he was alive hold close to him only it was so good to be sureafter all her torment to hold him to hang about him to feel the solid man kissing her weeping too weeping together with her teddy my love   section 12  letty was in the cottage struggling to hear and understand things too complicated for her emotioncrowded mind there was something that mr direck was trying to explain about a delayed telegram that had come soon after she had gone out there was much indeed that mr direck was trying to explain what did any explanation really matter when you had teddy with nothing but a strange beard and a bandaged arm between him and yourself she had an absurd persuasion at first that those two strangenesses would also presently be set aside so that teddy would become just exactly what teddy had always been  teddy had been shot through the upper arm  my hand has gone dear little letty its my left hand luckily i shall have to wear a hook like some old pirate  there was something about his being taken prisoner that other officerthat was mr direcks officerhad been lying there for days teddy had been shot through the upper arm and stunned by a falling beam when he came to he was disarmed with a german standing over him  then afterwards he had escaped in quite a little time he had escaped he had been in a railway station somewhere in belgium locked in a waitingroom with three or four french prisoners and the junction had been bombed by french and british aeroplanes their guard and two of the prisoners had been killed in the confusion the others had got away into the town there were trucks of hay on fire and a store of petrol was in danger after that one was bound to escape one would have been shot if one had been found wandering about  the bomb had driven some splinters of glass and corrugated iron into teddys wrist it seemed a small place at first it didnt trouble him for weeks but then some dirt got into it  in the narrow cobbled street beyond the station he had happened upon a woman who knew no english but who took him to a priest and the priest had hidden him  letty did not piece together the whole story at first she did not want the story very much she wanted to know about this hand and arm  there would be queer things in the story when it came to be told there was an old peasant who had made teddy work in his fields in spite of his smashed and aching arm and who had pointed to a passing german when teddy demurred there were the people called they who had at that time organised the escape of stragglers into holland there was the night watch those long nights in succession before the dash for liberty but lettys concern was all with the hand inside the sling there was something that hurt the imagination something bandaged a stump she could not think of it she could not get away from the thought of it  but why did you lose your hand  it was only a little place at first and then it got painful  but i didnt go into a hospital because i was afraid they would intern me and so i wouldnt be able to come home and i was dying to come home i washomesick no one was ever so homesick ive thought of this place and the garden and how one looked out of the window at the passersby a thousand times i seemed always to be seeing them old dimple with his benevolent smile and mrs wolker at the end cottage and how she used to fetch her beer and wink when she caught us looking at her and little charlie slobberface sniffing on his way to the pigs and all the rest of them and you letty particularly you and how we used to lean on the windowsill with our shoulders touching and your cheek just in front of my eyes and nothing aching at all in one  how i thought of that and longed for that  and so you see i didnt go to the hospital i kept hoping to get to england first and i left it too long  lifes come back to me with you said letty until just today ive believed youd come back and todayi doubted i thought it was all overall the real life love and the dear fun of things and that there was nothing before me nothing before me but just holding outand keeping your memory poor arm poor arm and being kind to people and pretending you were alive somewhere ill not care about the arm in a little while im glad youve gone but im gladder youre back and can never go again and i will be your right hand dear and your left hand and all your hands both my hands for your dear lost left one you shall have three hands instead of two   section 13  letty stood by the window as close as she could to teddy in a world that seemed wholly made up of unexpected things she could not heed the others it was only when teddy spoke to the others or when they spoke to teddy that they existed for her  for instance teddy was presently talking to mr direck  they had spoken about the canadians who had come up and relieved the essex men after the fight in which teddy had been captured and then it was manifest that mr direck was talking of his regiment im not the only american who has gone canadianfor the duration of the war  he had got to his explanation at last  ive told a lie he said triumphantly ive shifted my birthplace six hundred miles  mind you i dont admit a thing that cissie has ever said about americanot one thing you dont understand the sort of proposition america is up against america is the new world where there are no races and nations any more she is the melting pot from which we will cast the better state ive believed that alwaysin spite of a thousand little things i believe it now i go back on nothing im not fighting as an american either im fighting simply as myself im not going fighting for england mind you dont you fancy that i dont know im so particularly in love with a lot of english ways as to do that i dont see how any one can be very much in love with your empire with its deadalive court its artful politicians its lords and ladies and snobs its way with the irish and its way with india and everybody shifting responsibility and telling lies about your common people im not going fighting for england im going fighting for cissieand justice and belgium and all thatbut more particularly for cissie and anyhow i cant look pa britling in the face any more and i want to see those trenchesclose i reckon theyre a thing it will be interesting to talk about some day so im going said mr direck but chieflyits cissie see  cissie had come and stood by the side of him  she looked from poor broken teddy to him and back again  up to now she said ive wanted you to go  tears came into her eyes  i suppose i must let you go she said oh id hate you not to go   section 14  good god how old the master looks cried teddy suddenly  he was standing at the window and as mr direck came forward inquiringly he pointed to the figure of mr britling passing along the road towards the dower house  he does look old i hadnt noticed said mr direck  why hes gone grey cried teddy peering he wasnt grey when i left  they watched the knickerbockered figure of mr britling receding up the hill atlas and papers in his hands behind his back  i must go out to him said teddy disengaging himself from letty  no she said arresting him with her hand  but he will be glad  she stood in her husbands way she had a vision of mr britling suddenly called out of his dreams of god ruling the united states of the world to rejoice at teddys restoration  no she said it will only make him think again of hughand how he died dont go out teddy not now what does he care for you let him rest from such things leave him to dream over his atlas he isnt so desolateif you knew i will tell you teddywhen i can  but just nowno he will think of hugh again let him go he has god and his atlas there theyre more than you think     chapter the second  mr britling writes until sunrise   section 1  it was some weeks later it was now the middle of november and mr britling very warmly wrapped in his thick dressinggown and his thick llama wool pyjamas was sitting at his night desk and working ever and again at an essay an essay of preposterous ambitions for the title of it was the better government of the world  latterly he had had much sleepless misery in the day life was tolerable but in the nightunless he defended himself by working the losses and cruelties of the war came and grimaced at him insufferably now he would be haunted by long processions of refugees now he would think of the dead lying stiff and twisted in a thousand dreadful attitudes then again he would be overwhelmed with anticipations of the frightful economic and social dissolution that might lie ahead at other times he thought of wounds and the deformities of body and spirit produced by injuries and sometimes he would think of the triumph of evil stupid and triumphant persons went about a world that stupidity had desolated with swaggering gestures with a smiling consciousness of enhanced importance with their scornful hatred of all measured and temperate and kindly things turned now to scornful contempt and mingling with the soil they walked on lay the dead body of hugh face downward at the back of the boys head rimmed by bloodstiffened hairthe hair that had once been as soft as the down of a birdwas a big red hole that hole was always pitilessly distinct they stepped on himheedlessly they heeled the scattered stuff of his exquisite brain into the clay  from all such moods of horror mr britlings circle of lamplight was his sole refuge his work could conjure up visions like opium visions of a world of order and justice amidst the gloom of world bankruptcy he stuck to the prospectus of a braver enterprisereckless of his chances of subscribers   section 2  but this night even this circle of lamplight would not hold his mind doubt had crept into this last fastness he pulled the papers towards him and turned over the portion he had planned  his purpose in the book he was beginning to write was to reason out the possible methods of government that would give a stabler saner control to the world he believed still in democracy but he was realising more and more that democracy had yet to discover its method it had to take hold of the consciences of men it had to equip itself with still unformed organisations endless years of patient thinking of experimenting of discussion lay before mankind ere this great idea could become reality and right the proven right thing could rule the earth  meanwhile the world must still remain a scene of bloodstained melodrama of deafening noise contagious follies vast irrational destructions one fine life after another went down from study and university and laboratory to be slain and silenced  was it conceivable that this mad monster of mankind would ever be caught and held in the thinspun webs of thought  was it after all anything but pretension and folly for a man to work out plans for the better government of the worldwas it any better than the ambitious scheming of some fly upon the wheel of the romantic gods  man has come floundering and wounding and suffering out of the breeding darknesses of time that will presently crush and consume him again why not flounder with the rest why not eat drink fight scream weep and pray forget hugh stop brooding upon hugh banish all these priggish dreams of the better government of the world and turn to the brighter aspects the funny and adventurous aspects of the war the chestertonian jolliness punch side of things think you because your sons are dead that there will be no more cakes and ale let mankind blunder out of the mud and blood as mankind has blundered in  let us at any rate keep our precious sense of humour  he pulled his manuscript towards him for a time he sat decorating the lettering of his title the better government of the world with little grinning gnomes heads and waggish tails   section 3  on the top of mr britlings desk beside the clock lay a letter written in clumsy english and with its envelope resealed by a label which testified that it had been opened by censor  the friendly gobetween in norway had written to tell mr britling that herr heinrich also was dead he had died a wounded prisoner in russia some months ago he had been wounded and captured after undergoing great hardships during the great russian attack upon the passes of the carpathians in the early spring and his wound had mortified he had recovered partially for a time and then he had been beaten and injured again in some struggle between german and croatian prisoners and he had sickened and died before he died he had written to his parents and once again he had asked that the fiddle he had left in mr britlings care should if possible be returned to them it was manifest that both for him and them now it had become a symbol with many associations  the substance of this letter invaded the orange circle of the lamp it would have to be answered and the potentialities of the answer were running through mr britlings brain to the exclusion of any impersonal composition he thought of the old parents away there in pomeraniahe believed but he was not quite sure that heinrich had been an only sonand of the pleasant spectacled figure that had now become a broken and decaying thing in a prisoners shallow grave  another son had goneall the world was losing its sons  he found himself thinking of young heinrich in the very manner if with a lesser intensity in which he thought about his own son as of hopes senselessly destroyed his mind took no note of the fact that heinrich was an enemy that by the reckoning of a war of attrition his death was balance and compensation for the death of hugh he went straight to the root fact that they had been gallant and kindly beings and that the same thing had killed them both  by no conceivable mental gymnastics could he think of the two as antagonists between them there was no imaginable issue they had both very much the same scientific disposition with perhaps more dash and inspiration in the quality of hugh more docility and method in the case of karl until war had smashed them one against the other  he recalled his first sight of heinrich at the junction and how he had laughed at the sight of his excessive teutonism the closecropped shining fair head surmounted by a yellowishwhite corps cap had appeared dodging about among the people upon the platform and manifestly asking questions the face had been very pink with the effort of an unaccustomed tongue the young man had been clad in a suit of white flannel refined by a purple line his boots were of that greenish yellow leather that only a german student could esteem chic his rucksack was upon his back and the precious fiddle in its case was carried very carefully in one hand this same dead fiddle the other hand held a stick with a carved knob and a pointed end he had been too german for belief herr heinrich mr britling had said and straightway the heels had clashed together for a bow a bow from the waist a bow that a heedless old lady much burthened with garden produce had greatly disarranged from first to last amidst our offhand english ways herr heinrich had kept his bowand always it had been getting disarranged  that had been his constant effect a little stiff a little absurd and always clean and pink and methodical the boys had liked him without reserve mrs britling had liked him everybody had found him a likeable creature he never complained of anything except picnics but he did object to picnics to the sudden departure of the family to wild surroundings for the consumption of cold knifeless and forkless meals in the serious middle hours of the day he protested to mr britling respectfully but very firmly it was he held implicit in their understanding that he should have a cooked meal in the middle of the day otherwise his magen was perplexed and disordered in the evening he could not eat with any gravity or profit  their disposition towards underfeeding and a certain lack of fine sentiment were the only flaws in the english scheme that herr heinrich admitted he certainly found the english unfeeling his heart went even less satisfied than his magen he was a being of expressive affections he wanted great friendships mysterious relationships love he tried very bravely to revere and to understand and be occultly understood by mr britling he sought long walks and deep talks with hugh and the small boys he tried to fill his heart with cissie he found at last marvels of innocence and sweetness in the hickson girl she wore her hair in a pigtail when first he met her and it made her almost marguerite this young man had cried aloud for love warm and filling like the mittagsessen that was implicit in their understanding and all these essex people failed to satisfy him they were silent they were subtle they slipped through the fat yet eager fingers of his heart so that he fell back at last upon himself and his german correspondents and the idealisation of maud hickson and the moral education of billy billy mr britlings memories came back at last to the figure of young heinrich with the squirrel on his shoulder that had so often stood in the way of the utter condemnation of germany that seen closely was the stuff of one brutal prussian what quarrel had we with him  other memories of heinrich flitted across mr britlings reverie heinrich at hockey running with extreme swiftness and little skill tricked and baffled by letty dodged by hugh going headlong forward and headlong back and then with a cry flinging himself flat on the ground exhausted or again heinrich very grave and very pink peering through his glasses at his cards at skat or heinrich in the boats upon the great pond or heinrich swimming or heinrich hiding very very artfully from the boys about the garden on a theory of his own or heinrich in strange postures stalking the deer in claverings park for a time he had had a great ambition to creep quite close to a deer and touch it or heinrich indexing he had a passion for listing and indexing books music any loose classifiable thing his favourite amusement was devising schemes for the indentation of dictionary leaves so that one could turn instantly to the needed word he had bought and cut the edges of three dictionaries each in succession improved upon the other he had had great hopes of patents and wealth arising therefrom and his room had been a source of strange sounds his search for music upon the violin he had hoped when he came to matchings easy to join some string quartette but matchings easy produced no string quartette he had to fall back upon the pianola and try to play duets with that only the pianola did all the duet itself and in the hands of a small britling was apt to betray a facetious moodiness sudden alternations between extreme haste and extreme lassitude  then there came a memory of heinrich talking very seriously his glasses magnifying his round blue eyes talking of his ideas about life of his beliefs and disbeliefs of his ambitions and prospects in life  he confessed two principal ambitions they varied perhaps in their absolute dimensions but they were of equal importance in his mind the first of these was so soon as he had taken his doctorate in philology to give himself to the perfecting of an international language it was to combine all the virtues of esperanto and ido and then said herr heinrich i do not think there will be any more warsever the second ambition which was important first because herr heinrich found much delight in working at it and secondly because he thought it would give him great wealth and opportunity for propagating the perfect speech was the elaboration of his system of marginal indentations for dictionaries and alphabetical books of reference of all sorts it was to be so complete that one would just stand over the book to be consulted run hand and eye over its edges and open the bookat the very exact spot he proposed to follow this business up with a quite germanic thoroughness presently he said i must study the machinery by which the edges of books are cut it is possible i may have to invent these also this was the doublebarrelled scheme of herr heinrichs career and along it he was to go and incidentally develop his large vague heart that was at present so manifestly unsatisfied  such was the brief story of herr heinrich  that story was overjust as hughs story was over that first volume would never now have a second and a third it ended in some hasty grave in russia the great scheme for marginal indices would never be patented the duets with the pianola would never be played again  imagination glimpsed a little figure toiling manfully through the slush and snow of the carpathians saw it staggering under its first experience of shell fire set it amidst attacks and flights and fatigue and hunger and a rush perhaps in the darkness guessed at the wounding blow then came the pitiful pilgrimage of the prisoners into captivity captivity in a land desolated impoverished and embittered came wounds wrapped in filthy rags pain and want of occupation and a poor little bent and broken heinrich sitting aloof in a crowded compound nursing a mortifying wound  he used always to sit in a peculiar attitude with his arms crossed on his crossed legs looking slantingly through his glasses  so he must have sat and presently he lay on some rough bedding and suffered untended in infinite discomfort lay motionless and thought at times it may be of matchings easy and wondered what hugh and teddy were doing then he became fevered and the world grew brightcoloured and fantastic and ugly for him until one day an infinite weakness laid hold of him and his pain grew faint and all his thoughts and memories grew faintand still fainter  the violin had been brought into mr britlings study that afternoon and lay upon the further windowseat poor little broken sherd poor little fragment of a shattered life it looked in its case like a baby in a coffin  i must write a letter to the old father and mother mr britling thought i cant just send the poor little fiddlewithout a word in all this pitiful storm of witless hatesurely there may be one greetingnot hateful  from my blackness to yours said mr britling aloud he would have to write it in english but even if they knew no english some one would be found to translate it to them he would have to write very plainly   section 4  he pushed aside the manuscript of the better government of the world and began to write rather slowly shaping his letters roundly and distinctly       dear sir      i am writing this letter to you to tell you i am sending back the     few little things i had kept for your son at his request when the     war broke out i am sending them  mr britling left that blank for the time until he could arrange the method of sending to the norwegian intermediary      especially i am sending his violin which he had asked me thrice to     convey to you either it is a gift from you or it symbolised many     things for him that he connected with home and you i will have it     packed with particular care and i will do all in my power to ensure     its safe arrival      i want to tell you that all the stress and passion of this war has     not made us here in matchings easy forget our friend your son he     was one of us he had our affection he had friends here who are     still his friends we found him honourable and companionable and we     share something of your loss i have got together for you a few     snapshots i chance to possess in which you will see him in the     sunshine and which will enable you perhaps to picture a little more     definitely than you would otherwise do the life he led here there     is one particularly that i have marked our family is lunching     outofdoors and you will see that next to your son is a youngster     a year or so his junior who is touching glasses with him i have     put a cross over his head he is my eldest son he was very dear to     me and he too has been killed in this war they are you see     smiling very pleasantly at each other  while writing this mr britling had been struck by the thought of the photographs and he had taken them out of the little drawer into which he was accustomed to thrust them he picked out the ones that showed the young german but there were others bright with sunshine that were now charged with acquired significances there were two showing the children and teddy and hugh and cissie and letty doing the goose step and there was one of mr van der pant smiling at the front door in heinrichs abandoned slippers there were endless pictures of teddy also it is the happy instinct of the kodak to refuse those days that are overcast and the photographic record of a life is a chain of all its kindlier aspects in the drawer above these snapshots there were hughs letters and a miscellany of trivial documents touching on his life  mr britling discontinued writing and turned these papers over and mused heinrichs letters and postcards had got in among them and so had a letter of teddys  the letters reinforced the photographs in their reminder how kind and pleasant a race mankind can be until the wild asses of nationalism came kicking and slaying amidst them until suspicion and jostling greed and malignity poison their minds until the fools with the high explosives blow that elemental goodness into shrieks of hate and splashes of blood how kindly men areup to the very instant of their cruelties his mind teemed suddenly with little anecdotes and histories of the goodwill of men breaking through the illwill of war of the mutual help of sorely wounded germans and english lying together in the mud and darkness between the trenches of the fellowship of captors and prisoners of the saxons at christmas fraternising with the english of that he had seen photographs in one of the daily papers  his mind came back presently from these wanderings to the task before him  he tried to picture these heinrich parents he supposed they were kindly civilised people it was manifest the youngster had come to him from a wellordered and gentlespirited home but he imagined themhe could not tell whyas people much older than himself perhaps young heinrich had on some occasion said they were old peoplehe could not remember and he had a curious impulse too to write to them in phrases of consolation as if their loss was more pitiable than his own he doubted whether they had the consolation of his sanguine temperament whether they could resort as readily as he could to his faith whether in pomerania there was the same consoling possibility of an essay on the better government of the world he did not think this very clearly but that was what was at the back of his mind he went on writing      if you think that these two boys have both perished not in some     noble common cause but one against the other in a struggle of     dynasties and boundaries and trade routes and tyrannous     ascendancies then it seems to me that you must feel as i feel that     this war is the most tragic and dreadful thing that has ever     happened to mankind  he sat thinking for some minutes after he had written that and when presently he resumed his writing a fresh strain of thought was traceable even in his opening sentence      if you count dead and wounds this is the most dreadful war in     history for you as for me it has been almost the extremity of     personal tragedy black sorrow but is it the most dreadful     war      i do not think it is i can write to you and tell you that i do     indeed believe that our two sons have died not altogether in vain     our pain and anguish may not be wastedmay be necessary indeed     they may be necessary here am i bereaved and wretchedand i hope     never was the fabric of war so black that i admit but never was     the black fabric of war so threadbare at a thousand points the     light is shining through  mr britlings pen stopped  there was perfect stillness in the study bedroom  the tinpot style said mr britling at last in a voice of extreme bitterness  he fell into an extraordinary quarrel with his style he forgot about those pomeranian parents altogether in his exasperation at his own inexpressiveness at his incomplete control of these rebel words and phrases that came trailing each its own associations and suggestions to hamper his purpose with it he read over the offending sentence  the point is that it is true he whispered it is exactly what i want to say  exactly  his mind stuck on that exactly when one has much to say style is troublesome it is as if one fussed with ones uniform before a battle but that is just what one ought to do before a battle one ought to have everything in order  he took a fresh sheet and made three trial beginnings      war is like a black fabric      war is a curtain of black fabric across the pathway      war is a curtain of dense black fabric across all the hopes and     kindliness of mankind yet always it has let through some gleams of     light and nowi am not dreamingit grows threadbare and here and     there and at a thousand points the light is breaking through we owe     it to all these dear youths  his pen stopped again  i must work on a rough draft said mr britling   section 5  three hours later mr britling was working by daylight though his study lamp was still burning and his letter to old heinrich was still no better than a collection of material for a letter but the material was falling roughly into shape and mr britlings intentions were finding themselves it was clear to him now that he was no longer writing as his limited personal self to those two personal selves grieving in the old large highwalled steeproofed household amidst pine woods of which heinrich had once shown him a picture he knew them too little for any such personal address he was writing he perceived not as mr britling but as an englishmanthat was all he could be to themand he was writing to them as germans he could apprehend them as nothing more he was just england bereaved to germany bereaved  he was no longer writing to the particular parents of one particular boy but to all that mass of suffering regret bitterness and fatigue that lay behind the veil of the front slowly steadily the manhood of germany was being wiped out as he sat there in the stillness he could think that at least two million men of the central powers were dead and an equal number maimed and disabled compared with that our british losses immense and universal as they were by the standard of any previous experience were still slight our larger armies had still to suffer and we had lost irrevocably not very much more than a quarter of a million but the tragedy gathered against us we knew enough already to know what must be the reality of the german homes to which those dead men would nevermore return  if england had still the longer account to pay the french had paid already nearly to the limits of endurance they must have lost well over a million of their mankind and still they bled and bled russia too in the east had paid far more than man for man in this vast swapping off of lives in a little while no censorship would hold the voice of the peoples there would be no more talk of honour and annexations hegemonies and trade routes but only europe lamenting for her dead  the germany to which he wrote would be a nation of widows and children rather pinched boys and girls crippled men old men deprived men men who had lost brothers and cousins and friends and ambitions no triumph now on land or sea could save germany from becoming that france too would be that russia and lastly britain each in their degree before the war there had been no germany to which an englishman could appeal germany had been a threat a menace a terrible trampling of armed men it was as little possible then to think of talking to germany as it would have been to have stopped the kaiser in mid career in his hooting car down the unter den linden and demand a quiet talk with him but the germany that had watched those rushes with a slightly doubting pride had her eyes now full of tears and blood she had believed she had obeyed and no real victory had come still she fought on bleeding agonising wasting her substance and the substance of the whole world to no conceivable end but exhaustion so capable she was so devoted so proud and utterly foolish and the mind of germany whatever it was before the war would now be something residual something left over and sitting beside a readinglamp as he was sitting beside a readinglamp thinking sorrowing counting the cost looking into the dark future  and to that he wrote to that dimly apprehended figure outside a circle of the light like his own circle of lightwhich was the father of heinrich which was great germany germany which lived before and which will yet outlive the flapping of the eagles      our boys he wrote have died fighting one against the other     they have been fighting upon an issue so obscure that your german     press is still busy discussing what it was for us it was that     belgium was invaded and france in danger of destruction nothing     else could have brought the english into the field against you but     why you invaded belgium and france and whether that might have been     averted we do not know to this day and still this war goes on and     still more boys die and these men who do not fight these men in     the newspaper offices and in the ministries plan campaigns and     strokes and counterstrokes that belong to no conceivable plan at     all except that now for them there is something more terrible than     war and that is the day of reckoning with their own people      what have we been fighting for what are we fighting for do you     know does any one know why am i spending what is left of my     substance and you what is left of yours to keep on this war against     each other what have we to gain from hurting one another still     further why should we be puppets any longer in the hands of crowned     fools and witless diplomatists even if we were dumb and acquiescent     before does not the blood of our sons now cry out to us that this     foolery should cease we have let these people send our sons to     death      it is you and i who must stop these wars these massacres of boys      massacres of boys that indeed is the essence of modern war the     killing off of the young it is the destruction of the human     inheritance it is the spending of all the life and material of the     future upon presentday hate and greed fools and knaves     politicians tricksters and those who trade on the suspicions and     thoughtless generous angers of men make wars the indolence and     modesty of the mass of men permit them are you and i to suffer such     things until the whole fabric of our civilisation that has been so     slowly and so laboriously built up is altogether destroyed      when i sat down to write to you i had meant only to write to you of     your son and mine but i feel that what can be said in particular of     our loss need not be said it can be understood without saying     what needs to be said and written about is this that war must be     put an end to and that nobody else but you and me and all of us can     do it we have to do that for the love of our sons and our race and     all that is human war is no longer human the chemist and the     metallurgist have changed all that my boy was shot through the eye     his brain was blown to pieces by some man who never knew what he had     done think what that means it is plain to me surely it is     plain to you and all the world that war is now a mere putting of     the torch to explosives that flare out to universal ruin there is     nothing for one sane man to write to another about in these days but     the salvation of mankind from war      now i want you to be patient with me and hear me out there was a     time in the earlier part of this war when it was hard to be patient     because there hung over us the dread of losses and disaster now we     need dread no longer the dreaded thing has happened sitting     together as we do in spirit beside the mangled bodies of our dead     surely we can be as patient as the hills      i want to tell you quite plainly and simply that i think that     germany which is chief and central in this war is most to blame for     this war writing to you as an englishman to a german and with war     still being waged there must be no mistake between us upon this     point i am persuaded that in the decade that ended with your     overthrow of france in 1871 germany turned her face towards evil     and that her refusal to treat france generously and to make friends     with any other great power in the world is the essential cause of     this war germany triumphedand she trampled on the loser she     inflicted intolerable indignities she set herself to prepare for     further aggressions long before this killing began she was making     war upon land and sea launching warships building strategic     railways setting up a vast establishment of war material     threatening straining all the world to keep pace with her     threats at last there was no choice before any european nation     but submission to the german will or war and it was no will to     which righteous men could possibly submit it came as an illiberal     and ungracious will it was the will of zabern it is not as if you     had set yourselves to be an imperial people and embrace and unify     the world you did not want to unify the world you wanted to set     the foot of an intensely national germany a sentimental and     illiberal germany a germany that treasured the portraits of your     ridiculous kaiser and his litter of sons a germany wearing uniform     reading black letter and despising every kultur but her own upon     the neck of a divided and humiliated mankind it was an intolerable     prospect i had rather the whole world died      forgive me for writing you you are as little responsible for     that germany as i am forsir edward grey but this happened over     you you did not do your utmost to prevent iteven as england has     happened and i have let it happen over me  it is so dry so general whispered mr britling and yetit is this that has killed our sons  he sat still for a time and then went on reading a fresh sheet of his manuscript      when i bring these charges against germany i have little     disposition to claim any righteousness for britain there has been     small splendour in this war for either germany or britain or russia     we three have chanced to be the biggest of the combatants but the     glory lies with invincible france it is france and belgium and     serbia who shine as the heroic lands they have fought defensively     and beyond all expectation for dear land and freedom this war for     them has been a war of simple definite issues to which they have     risen with an entire nobility englishman and german alike may well     envy them that simplicity i look to you as an honest man schooled     by the fierce lessons of this war to meet me in my passionate     desire to see france belgium and serbia emerge restored from all     this blood and struggle enlarged to the limits of their     nationality vindicated and secure russia i will not write about     here let me go on at once to tell you about my own country     remarking only that between england and russia there are endless     parallelisms we have similar complexities kindred difficulties we     have for instance an imported dynasty we have a souldestroying     state church which cramps and poisons the education of our ruling     class we have a people out of touch with a secretive government     and the same traditional contempt for science we have our irelands     and polands even our kings bear a curious likeness  at this point there was a break in the writing and mr britling made as it were a fresh beginning      politically the british empire is a clumsy collection of strange     accidents it is a thing as little to be proud of as the outline of     a flint or the shape of a potato for the mass of english people     india and egypt and all that side of our system mean less than     nothing our trade is something they do not understand our imperial     wealth something they do not share britain has been a group of     four democracies caught in the net of a vast yet casual imperialism     the common man here is in a state of political perplexity from the     cradle to the grave none the less there is a great people here even     as there is a great people in russia a people with a soul and     character of its own a people of unconquerable kindliness and with     a peculiar genius which still struggle towards will and expression     we have been beginning that same great experiment that france and     america and switzerland and china are making the experiment of     democracy it is the newest form of human association and we are     still but half awake to its needs and necessary conditions for it     is idle to pretend that the little city democracies of ancient times     were comparable to the great essays in practical republicanism that     mankind is making today this age of the democratic republics that     dawn is a new age it has not yet lasted for a century not for a     paltry hundred years all new things are weak things a rat can     kill a manchild with ease the greater the destiny the weaker the     immediate selfprotection may be and to me it seems that your     complete and perfect imperialism ruled by germans for germans is     in its scope and outlook a more antiquated and smaller and less     noble thing than these sprawling emergent giant democracies of the     west that struggle so confusedly against it      but that we do struggle confusedly with pitiful leaders and     infinite waste and endless delay that it is to our indisciplines     and to the dishonesties and tricks our incompleteness provokes that     the prolongation of this war is to be ascribed i readily admit at     the outbreak of this war i had hoped to see militarism felled within     a year   section 6  from this point onward mr britlings notes became more fragmentary they had a consecutiveness but they were discontinuous his thought had leapt across gaps that his pen had had no time to fill and he had begun to realise that his letter to the old people in pomerania was becoming impossible it had broken away into dissertation  yet there must be dissertations he said unless such men as we are take these things in hand always we shall be misgoverned always the sons will die   section 7      i do not think you germans realise how steadily you were conquering     the world before this war began had you given half the energy and     intelligence you have spent upon this war to the peaceful conquest     of mens minds and spirits i believe that you would have taken the     leadership of the world tranquillyno man disputing your science     was five years your social and economic organisation was a quarter     of a century in front of ours never has it so lain in the power     of a great people to lead and direct mankind towards the world     republic and universal peace it needed but a certain generosity of     the imagination      but your junkers your imperial court your foolish vicious     princes what were such dreams to them with an envious     satisfaction they hurled all the accomplishment of germany into the     fires of war   section 8      your boy as no doubt you know dreamt constantly of such a world     peace as this that i foreshadow he was more generous than his     country he could envisage war and hostility only as     misunderstanding he thought that a world that could explain itself     clearly would surely be at peace he was scheming always therefore     for the perfection and propagation of esperanto or ido or some such     universal link my youngster too was full of a kindred and yet     larger dream the dream of human science which knows neither king     nor country nor race      these boys these hopes this war has killed  that fragment ended so mr britling ceased to read for a time but has it killed them he whispered  if you had lived my dear you and your england would have talked with a younger germanybetter than i can ever do  he turned the pages back and read here and there with an accumulating discontent   section 9  dissertations said mr britling  never had it been so plain to mr britling that he was a weak silly illinformed and hastyminded writer and never had he felt so invincible a conviction that the spirit of god was in him and that it fell to him to take some part in the establishment of a new order of living upon the earth it might be the most trivial part by the scale of the task but for him it was to be now his supreme concern and it was an almost intolerable grief to him that his services should be for all his desire so poor in quality so weak in conception always he seemed to be on the verge of some illuminating and beautiful statement of his cause always he was finding his writing inadequate a thin treachery to the impulse of his heart always he was finding his effort weak and ineffective in this instance at the outset he seemed to see with a golden clearness the message of brotherhood or forgiveness of a common call to whom could such a message be better addressed than to those sorrowing parents from whom could it come with a better effect than from himself and now he read what he had made of this message it seemed to his jaded mind a pitifully jaded effort it had no light it had no depth it was like the disquisition of a debating society  he was distressed by a fancy of an old german couple spectacled and peering puzzled by his letter perhaps they would be obscurely hurt by his perplexing generalisations why they would ask should this englishman preach to them  he sat back in his chair wearily with his chin sunk upon his chest for a time he did not think and then he read again the sentence in front of his eyes      these boys these hopes this war has killed  the words hung for a time in his mind  no said mr britling stoutly they live  and suddenly it was borne in upon his mind that he was not alone there were thousands and tens of thousands of men and women like himself desiring with all their hearts to say as he desired to say the reconciling word it was not only his hand that thrust against the obstacles frenchmen and russians sat in the same stillness facing the same perplexities there were germans seeking a way through to him even as he sat and wrote and for the first time clearly he felt a presence of which he had thought very many times in the last few weeks a presence so close to him that it was behind his eyes and in his brain and hands it was no trick of his vision it was a feeling of immediate reality and it was hugh hugh that he had thought was dead it was young heinrich living also it was himself it was those others that sought it was all these and it was more it was the master the captain of mankind it was god there present with him and he knew that it was god it was as if he had been groping all this time in the darkness thinking himself alone amidst rocks and pitfalls and pitiless things and suddenly a hand a firm strong hand had touched his own and a voice within him bade him be of good courage there was no magic trickery in that moment he was still weak and weary a discouraged rhetorician a good intention illequipped but he was no longer lonely and wretched no longer in the same world with despair god was beside him and within him and about him it was the crucial moment of mr britlings life it was a thing as light as the passing of a cloud on an april morning it was a thing as great as the first day of creation for some moments he still sat back with his chin upon his chest and his hands dropping from the arms of his chair then he sat up and drew a deep breath  this had come almost as a matter of course  for weeks his mind had been playing about this idea he had talked to letty of this finite god who is the king of mans adventure in space and time but hitherto god had been for him a thing of the intelligence a theory a report something told about but not realised mr britlings thinking about god hitherto had been like some one who has found an empty house very beautiful and pleasant full of the promise of a fine personality and then as the discoverer makes his lonely curious explorations he hears downstairs dear and friendly the voice of the master coming in  there was no need to despair because he himself was one of the feeble folk god was with him indeed and he was with god the king was coming to his own amidst the darknesses and confusions the nightmare cruelties and the hideous stupidities of the great war god the captain of the world republic fought his way to empire so long as one did ones best and utmost in a cause so mighty did it matter though the thing one did was little and poor  i have thought too much of myself said mr britling and of what i would do by myself i have forgotten that which was with me   section 10  he turned over the rest of the nights writing presently and read it now as though it was the work of another man  these later notes were fragmentary and written in a sprawling hand      let us make ourselves watchers and guardians of the order of the     world      if only for love of our dead      let us pledge ourselves to service let us set ourselves with all     our minds and all our hearts to the perfecting and working out of     the methods of democracy and the ending for ever of the kings and     emperors and priestcrafts and the bands of adventurers the traders     and owners and forestallers who have betrayed mankind into this     morass of hate and bloodin which our sons are lostin which we     flounder still  how feeble was this squeak of exhortation it broke into a scolding note  who have betrayed read mr britling and judged the phrase  who have fallen with us he amended  one gets so angry and bitterbecause one feels alone i suppose because one feels that for them ones reason is no reason one is enraged by the sense of their silent and regardless contradiction and one forgets the power of which one is a part  the sheet that bore the sentence he criticised was otherwise blank except that written across it obliquely in a very careful hand were the words hugh and hugh philip britling  on the next sheet he had written let us set up the peace of the world republic amidst these ruins let it be our religion our calling  there he had stopped  the last sheet of mr britlings manuscript may be more conveniently given in facsimile than described  handwritten    hugh   hugh   my dear hugh    lawyers princes   dealers in contention    honesty    blood blood     transcribers note illegible an end to them     section 11  he sighed  he looked at the scattered papers and thought of the letter they were to have made  his fatigue spoke first  perhaps after all id better just send the fiddle  he rested his cheeks between his hands and remained so for a long time his eyes stared unseeingly his thoughts wandered and spread and faded at length he recalled his mind to that last idea just send the fiddlewithout a word  no i must write to them plainly  about god as i have found him  as he has found me  he forgot the pomeranians for a time he murmured to himself he turned over the conviction that had suddenly become clear and absolute in his mind  religion is the first thing and the last thing and until a man has found god and been found by god he begins at no beginning he works to no end he may have his friendships his partial loyalties his scraps of honour but all these things fall into place and life falls into place only with god only with god god who fights through men against blind force and night and nonexistence who is the end who is the meaning he is the only king of course i must write about him i must tell all my world of him and before the coming of the true king the inevitable king the king who is present whenever just men foregather this bloodstained rubbish of the ancient world these puny kings and tawdry emperors these wily politicians and artful lawyers these men who claim and grab and trick and compel these war makers and oppressors will presently shrivel and passlike paper thrust into a flame  then after a time he said  our sons who have shown us god   section 12  he rubbed his open hands over his eyes and forehead  the night of effort had tired his brain and he was no longer thinking actively he had a little interval of blankness sitting at his desk with his hands pressed over his eyes  he got up presently and stood quite motionless at the window looking out  his lamp was still burning but for some time he had not been writing by the light of his lamp insensibly the day had come and abolished his need for that individual circle of yellow light colour had returned to the world clean pearly colour clear and definite like the glance of a child or the voice of a girl and a golden wisp of cloud hung in the sky over the tower of the church there was a mist upon the pond a soft grey mist not a yard high a covey of partridges ran and halted and ran again in the dewy grass outside his garden railings the partridges were very numerous this year because there had been so little shooting beyond in the meadow a hare sat up as still as a stone a horse neighed wave after wave of warmth and light came sweeping before the sunrise across the world of matchings easy it was as if there was nothing but morning and sunrise in the world  from away towards the church came the sound of some early worker whetting a scythe     the end
