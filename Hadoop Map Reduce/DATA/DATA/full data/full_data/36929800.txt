dorward journalist known to fame in every englishspeaking country stood before the double window of their spacious sittingroom looking down upon the thoroughfare beneath both men were laboring under a bitter sense of failure  bellamys face was dark with forebodings dorward was irritated and nervous failure was a new thing to hima thing which those behind the great journals which he represented understood less even than he bellamy loved his country and fear was gnawing at his heart  below the crowds which had been waiting patiently for many hours broke into a tumult of welcoming voices  down their thicklypacked lines the volume of sound arose and grew a faint murmur at first swelling and growing to a thunderous roar  myriads of hats were suddenly torn from the heads of the excited multitude handkerchiefs waved from every window  it was a wonderful greeting this  the czar on his way to the railway station bellamy remarked  the broad avenue was suddenly thronged with a mass of soldieryguardsmen of the most famous of austrian regiments brilliant in their white uniforms their flashing helmets  the small brougham with its great black horses was almost hidden within a ring of naked steel dorward an american to the backbone and a bitter democrat thrust out his underlip  the anointed of the lord he muttered  far away from some other quarter came the same roar of voices muffled yet insistent charged with that faint exciting timbre which seems always to live in the cry of the multitude  the emperor declared bellamy  he goes to the west station  the commotion had passed  the crowds in the street below were on the move melting away now with a muffled trampling of feet and a murmur of voices  the two men turned from their window back into the room  dorward commenced to roll a cigarette with yellowstained nervous fingers while bellamy threw himself into an easychair with a gesture of depression  so it is over this longtalkedof meeting he said half to himself half to dorward  it is over and europe is left to wonder  they were together for scarcely more than an hour dorward murmured  long enough bellamy answered  that little room in the palace my friend may yet become famous  if you and i could buy its secrets dorward remarked finally shaping a cigarette and lighting it we should be big bidders i think  id give fifty thousand dollars myself to be able to cable even a hundred words of their conversation  for the truth bellamy said the whole truth there could be no price sufficient  we made our effort in different directions both of us  with infinite pains i plantedi may tell you this now that the thing is overseven spies in the palace  they have been of as much use as rabbits  i dont believe that a single one of them got any further than the kitchens  dorward nodded gloomily  i guess they werent taking any chances up there he remarked there wasnt a secretary in the room  carstairs was nearly thrown out and he had a permit to enter the palace  the great staircase was held with soldiers and dick swore that there were maxims in the corridors  bellamy sighed  we shall hear the roar of bigger guns before we are many months older dorward he declared  the journalist glanced at his friend keenly  you believe that  bellamy shrugged his shoulders  do you suppose that this meeting is for nothing he asked  when austria germany and russia stand whispering in a corner cant you believe it is across the north sea that they point  things have been shaping that way for years and the time is almost ripe  you english are too nervous to live nowadays dorward declared impatiently  id just like to know what they said about america  bellamy smiled with faint but delicate irony  without a doubt the prince will tell you he said  he can scarcely do more to show his regard for your country  he is giving you a special interviewyou alone out of about two hundred journalists  very likely he will give you an exact account of everything that transpired  first of all he will assure you that this meeting has been brought about in the interests of peace  he will tell you that the welfare of your dear country is foremost in the thoughts of his master  he will assure you  say youre jealous my friend dorward interrupted calmly  i wonder what youd give me for my ten minutes alone with the chancellor eh  if he told me the truth bellamy asserted id give my life for it  for the sort of stuff youre going to hear id give nothing cant you realize that for yourself dorward  you know the manfalse as hell but with the tongue of a serpent  he will grasp your hand he will declare himself glad to speak through you to the great anglosaxon racesto england and to his dear friends the americans he is only too pleased to have the opportunity of expressing himself candidly and openly  peace is to be the watchword of the future the white doves have hovered over the palace  the rulers of the earth have met that the crash of arms may be stilled and that this terrible unrest which broods over europe shall finally be broken up they have pledged themselves hand in hand to work together for this objectrussia broken and humiliated but with an immense army still available whose only chance of holding her place among the nations is another and a successful war austria on fire for the seaboardaustria to whom war would give the desire of her existence germany with bismarcks last but secret words written in letters of fire on the walls of her palaces in the hearts of her rulers in the brain of her great emperor  colonies  expansion empire  whose colonies i wonder  whose empire  will he tell you that my friend dorward  the journalist shrugged his shoulders and glanced at the clock  i guess hell tell me what he chooses and i shall print it he answered indifferently  its all part of the game of course  i am not exactly chicken enough to expect the truth  all the same my message will come from the lips of the chancellor immediately after this wonderful meeting  he makes use of you bellamy declared to throw dust into our eyes and yours  even so dorward admitted i dont care so long as i get the copy  its goodbye i suppose  bellamy nodded  i shall go on to berlin perhaps tomorrow he said  i can do no more good here  and you  after ive sent my cable im off to belgrade for a week at any rate dorward answered  i hear the women are forming rifle clubs all through servia  bellamy smiled thoughtfully  i know one wholl want a place among the leaders he murmured  mademoiselle idiale i suppose  bellamy assented  its a queer position hers if you like he said  all vienna raves about her  they throng the opera house every night to hear her sing and they pay her the biggest salary which has ever been known here  three parts of it she sends to belgrade to the chief of the committee for national defence  the jewels that are sent her anonymously go to the same place all to buy arms to fight these people who worship her  i tell you dorward he added rising to his feet and walking to the window the patriotism of these people is something we colder races scarcely understand  perhaps it is because we have never dwelt under the shadow of a conqueror  if ever austria is given a free hand it will be no mere war upon which she entersit will be a carnage an extermination  dorward looked once more at the clock and rose slowly to his feet  well he said i mustnt keep his excellency waiting  goodbye and cheer up bellamy  your old country isnt going to turn up her heels yet  out he wentlong lank uncouth with yellowstained fingers and hatchetshaped gray facea strange figure but yet a power bellamy remained  for a while he seemed doubtful how to pass the time  he stood in front of the window watching the dispersal of the crowds and the marching by of a regiment of soldiers whose movements he followed with critical interest for he too had been in the service  he had still a military bearingtall and with complexion inclined to be dusky a small black moustache dark eyes a silent moutha man of many reserves  even his intimates knew little of him  nevertheless his was the reticence which befitted well his profession  after a time he sat down and wrote some letters  he had just finished when there came a sharp tap at the door  before he could open his lips some one had entered  he heard the soft swirl of draperies and turned sharply round then sprang to his feet and held out both his hands  there was expression in his face nowas much as he ever suffered to appear there  louise he exclaimed  what good fortune  she held his fingers for a moment in a manner which betokened a more than common intimacy  then she threw herself into an easychair and raised her thick veil  bellamy looked at her for a moment in sorrowful silence  there were violet lines underneath her beautiful eyes her cheeks were destitute of any color  there was an abandonment of grief about her attitude which moved him she sat as one brokenspirited in whom the power of resistance was dead  it is over then she said softly this meeting  the word has been spoken  he came and stood by her side  as yet he reminded her we do not know what that word may be  she shook her head mournfully  who can doubt she exclaimed  for myself i feel it in the air i can see it in the faces of the people who throng the city  i can hear it in the peals of those awful bells  you know nothing  you have heard nothing  bellamy shook his head  i did all that was humanly possible he said dropping his voice an englishman in vienna today has very little opportunity  i filled the palace with spies but they hadnt a dogs chance  there wasnt even a secretary present  the czar the two emperors and the chancellornot another soul was in the room  if only von behrling had been taken she exclaimed  he was there in reserve i know as stenographer  i have but to lift my hand and it is enough  i would have had the truth from him whatever it cost me  bellamy looked at her thoughtfully  it was not for nothing that the press of every european nation had called her the most beautiful woman in the world  he frowned slightly at her last words for he loved her  von behrling was not even allowed to cross the threshold he said sharply  she moved her head and looked up at him  she was leaning a little forward now her chin resting upon her hands  something about the lines of her long supple body suggested to him the savage animal crouching for a spring  she was quiet but her bosom was heaving and he could guess at the passion within  with purpose he spoke to set it loose  you sing tonight he asked  before god no she answered the anger blazing out of her eyes shaking in her voice  i sing no more in this accursed city  there will be a revolution bellamy remarked  i see that the whole city is placarded with notices  it is to be a gala night at the opera  the royal party is to be present  her body seemed to quiver like a tree shaken by the wind  what do i careiifor their gala night  if i were like samson if i could pull down the pillars of their opera house and bury them all in its ruins i would do it  he took her hand and smoothed it in his  dear louise it is useless this  you do everything that can be done for your country  her eyes were streaming and her fingers sought his  my friend david she said you do not understand  none of you english yet can understand what it is to crouch in the shadow of this black fear to feel a tyrants hand come creeping out to know that your lifeblood and the lifeblood of all your people must be shed and shed in vain  to rob a nation of their liberty ah it is worse this than murdera worse crime than his who stains the soul of a poor innocent girl  it is a sin against nature herself  she was sobbing now and she clutched his hands passionately  forgive me she murmured i am overwrought  i have borne up against this thing so long  i can do no more good here  i come to tell you that i go away till the time comes  i go to your london  they want me to sing for them there  i shall do it  you will break your engagement  she laughed at him scornfully  i am idiale she declared  i keep no engagement if i do not choose  i will sing no more to this people whom i hate  my friend david i have suffered enough  their applause i loathetheir covetous eyes as they watch me move about the stageoh i could strike them all dead  they come to me these young austrian noblemen as though i were already one of a conquered race  i keep their diamonds but i destroy their messages  their jewels go to my chorus girls or to arm my people  but no one of them has had a kind word from me save where there has been something to be gained even von behrling i have fooled with promises  no austrian shall ever touch my lipsi have sworn it  bellamy nodded  yes he assented they call you cold here in the capital  even in the palace  she held out her hand  it is finished she declared  i sing no more  i have sent word to the opera house  i came here to be in hiding for a while  they will search for me everywhere  tonight or tomorrow i leave for england  bellamy stood thoughtfully silent  i am not sure that you are wise he said  you take it too much for granted that the end has come  and do you not yourself believe it she demanded  he hesitated  as yet there is no proof he reminded her  proof  she sat upright in her chair  her hands thrust him from her her bosom heaved a spot of color flared in her cheeks  proof she cried  what do you suppose then that these wolves have plotted for  what else do you suppose could be austrias share of the feast  couldnt you hear our fate in the thunder of their voices when that miserable monarch rode back to his captivity  we are doomedbetrayed  you remember the massacre of st bartholomew a bloodstained page of history for all time  the world would tell you that we have outlived the age of such barbarous doings  it is not true  my friend david it is not true  it is a more terrible thing this which is coming  body and soul we are to perish  he came over to her side once more and laid his hand soothingly on hers  it was heartrending to witness the agony of the woman he loved  dear louise he said after all this is profitless  there may yet be compromises  she suffered her hand to remain in his but the bitterness did not pass out of her face or tone  compromises she repeated  do you believe then that we are like those ancient races who felt the presence of a conqueror because their hosts were scattered in battle and who suffered themselves passively to be led into captivity  my country can be conquered in one way and one way onlynot until her sons ay and her daughters too have perished can these people rule  they will come to an empty and a stricken countrya country red with blood desolate with blackened houses and empty cities  the horror of it  think my friend david the horror of it  bellamy threw his head back with a sudden gesture of impatience  you take too much for granted he declared  england at any rate is not yet a conquered race  and there is franceitaly too if she is wise will never suffer this thing from her ancient enemy  it is the might of the world which threatens she murmured your country may defend herself but here she is powerless already it has been proved  last year you declared yourself our friendyou and even russia  of what avail was it  word came from berlin and you were powerless  then tragedy broke into the room tragedy in the shape of a man demented  for fifteen years bellamy had known arthur dorward but this man was surely a stranger  he was hatless dishevelled wild a dull streak of color had mounted almost to his forehead his eyes were on fire  bellamy he cried  bellamy  words failed him suddenly  he leaned against the table breathless panting heavily  for gods sake man bellamy began  alone dorward interrupted  i must see you alone  i have news  mademoiselle idiale rose  she touched bellamy on the shoulder  you will come to me or telephone she whispered  so  bellamy opened the door and she passed out with a farewell pressure of his fingers  then he closed it firmly and came back     chapter ii  arthur dorwards scoop   whats wrong old man bellamy asked quickly  dorward from a side table had seized the bottle of whiskey and a siphon and was mixing himself a drink with trembling fingers  he tossed it off before he spoke a word  then he turned around and faced his companion  bellamy he ordered lock the door  bellamy obeyed  he had no doubt now but that dorward had lost his head in the chancellors presencehad made some absurd attempt to gain the knowledge which they both craved and had failed  bellamy dorward exclaimed speaking hoarsely and still a little out of breath i guess ive had the biggest slice of luck that was ever dealt out to a human being  if only i can get safe out of this city i tell you ive got the greatest scoop that living man ever handled  you dont mean that  dorward wiped his forehead and interrupted  its the most amazing thing that ever happened he declared but ive got it here in my pocket got it in black and white in the chancellors own handwriting  got what  why what you and i an hour ago would have given a million for dorward replied  bellamys expression was one of blank but wondering incredulity  you cant mean this dorward he exclaimed  you may have somethingjust what the chancellor wants you to print  youre not supposing for an instant that youve got the whole truth  dorwards smile was the smile of certainty his face that of a conqueror  here in my pocket he declared striking his chest in the chancellors own handwriting  i tell you ive got the original verbatim copy of everything that passed and was resolved upon this afternoon between the czar of russia the emperor of austria and the emperor of germany  ive got it word for word as the chancellor took it down  ive got their decision  ive got their several undertakings  bellamy for a moment was stricken dumb  he looked toward the door and back into his friends face aglow with triumph  then his power of speech returned  do you mean to say that you stole it  dorward struck the table with his fist  not i  i tell you that the chancellor gave it to me gave it to me with his own hands willinglypressed it upon me  no dont scoff he went on quickly  listen  this is a genuine thing the chancellors mad  he was lying in a fit when i left the palace it will be in all the evening papers  you will hear the boys shouting it in the streets within a few minutes  dont interrupt and ill tell you the whole truth  you can believe me or not as you like  it makes no odds  i arrived punctually and was shown up into the anteroom  even from there i could hear loud voices in the inner chamber and i knew that something was up  presently a little fellow came out to mea darkbearded chap with goldrimmed glasses he was very polite introduced himself as the chancellors physician regretted exceedingly that the chancellor was unwell and could see no onethe excitement and hard work of the last few days had knocked him out  well i stood there arguing as pleasantly as i could about it and then all of a sudden the door of the inner room was thrown open  the chancellor himself stood on the threshold there was no doubt about his being ill his face was as pale as parchment his eyes were simply wild and his hair was all ruffled as though he had been standing upon his head  he began to talk to the physician in german  i didnt understand him until he began to swearthen it was wonderful  in the end he brushed them all away and taking me by the arm led me right into the inner room for a long time he went on jabbering away half to himself and i was wondering how on earth to bring the conversation round to the things i wanted to know about  then all of a sudden he turned to me and seemed to remember who i was and what i wanted  ah he said you are dorward the american journalist i remember you now lock the door  i obeyed him pretty quick for i had noticed they were mighty uneasy outside and i was afraid theyd be disturbing us every moment  come and sit down he ordered  i did so at once  youre a sensible fellow he declared  today every one is worrying me  they think that i am not well  it is foolish  i am quite well  who would not be well on such a day as this i told him that i had never seen him looking better in my life and he nodded and seemed pleased  you have come to hear the truth about the meeting of my master with the czar and the emperor of germany he asked  thats so i told him  americas more than a little interested in these things and i want to know what to tell her  then he leaned across the table  my young friend he said i like you  you are straightforward  you speak plainly and you do not worry me  it is good  you shall tell your country what it is that we have planned what the things are that are coming  yours is a great and wise country  when they know the truth they will remember that europe is a long way off and that the things which happen there are really no concern of theirs you are right i assured himdead right  treat us openly thats all we ask shall i not do that my young friend he answered  now look i give you this  he fumbled through all his pockets and at last he drew out a long envelope sealed at both ends with black sealing wax on which was printed a coat of arms with two tigers facing each other  he looked toward the door cautiously and there was just that gleam in his eyes which madmen always have here it is he whispered written with my own hand  this will tell you exactly what passed this afternoon  it will tell you our plans  it will tell you of the share which my master and the other two are taking  button it up safely he said and whatever you do do not let them know outside that you have got it  between you and me he went on leaning across the table something seems to have happened to them all today  theres my old doctor there he is worrying all the time but he himself is not well  i can see it whenever he comes near me  i nodded as though i understood and the chancellor tapped his forehead and grinned  then i got up as casually as i could for i was terribly afraid that he wouldnt let me go  we shook hands and i tell you his fingers were like pieces of burning coal  just as i was moving some one knocked at the door  then he began to storm again kicked his chair over threw a paperweight at the window and talked such nonsense that i couldnt follow him  i unlocked the door myself and found the doctor there i contrived to look as frightened as possible  his highness is not well enough to talk to me i whispered  you had better look after him  i heard a shout behind and a heavy fall  then i closed the door and slipped away as quietly as i couldand here i am  bellamy drew a long breath  my god but this is wonderful he muttered  how long is it since you left the palace  about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour dorward answered  theyll find it out at once declared the other  theyll miss the paper  perhaps hell tell them himself that he has given it to you  dont let us run any risks dorward  tear it open  let us know the truth at any rate  if you have to part with the document we can remember its contents  out with it man quick  they may be here at any moment  dorward drew a few steps back  then he shook his head  i guess not he said firmly  bellamy regarded his friend in blank and uncomprehending amazement  what do you mean he exclaimed  youre not going to keep it to yourself  you know what it means to meto england  your old country can look after herself pretty well dorward declared  anyhow shell have to take her chance  i am not here as a philanthropist i am an american journalist and ill part to nobody with the biggest thing thats ever come into any mans bands  bellamy with a tremendous effort maintained his selfcontrol  what are you going to do with it he asked quickly  i tell you im off out of the country tonight dorward declared  i shall head for england  pearce is there himself and i tell you it will be just the greatest day of my life when i put this packet in his hand  well make new york hum i can promise you and europe too  bellamys manner was perfectly quiettoo quiet to be altogether natural  his hand was straying towards his pocket  dorward he said speaking rapidly and keeping his back to the door you dont realize what youre up against this sort of thing is new to you  you havent a dogs chance of leaving vienna alive with that in your pocket  if you trust yourself in the orient express tonight youll never be allowed to cross the frontier by this time they know that the packet is missing they know too that you are the only man who could have it whether the chancellor has told them the truth or not  open it at once so that we get some good out of it  then well go round to the embassy  we can slip out by the back way perhaps  remember i have spent my life in the service and i tell you that theres no other place in the city where your life is worth a snap of the fingers but at your embassy or mine  open the packet man  i think not dorward answered firmly  i am an american citizen i have broken no laws and done no one any harm  if theres any slaughtering about i guess theyll hesitate before they begin with arthur dorward  dont be a fool man  he took a quick step backwardhe was looking into the muzzle of bellamys revolver  dorward the latter exclaimed i cant help it  yours is only a personal ambitioni stand for my country  share the knowledge of that packet with me or i shall shoot  then shoot and be dd to you dorward declared fiercely  this is my show not yours  you and your country can go to  he broke off without finishing his sentence  there was a thunderous knocking at the door  the two men looked at one another for a moment speechless  then bellamy with a smothered oath replaced the revolver in his pocket  youve thrown away our chance he said bitterly  the knocking was repeated  when bellamy with a shrug of the shoulders answered the summons three men in plain clothes entered they saluted bellamy but their eyes were traveling around the room  we are seeking herr dorward the american journalist one exclaimed he was here but a moment ago  bellamy pointed to the inner door  he had had too much experience in such matters to attempt any prevarication  the three men crossed the room quickly and bellamy followed in the rear  he heard a cry of disappointment from the foremost as he opened the door  the inner room was empty     chapter iii  ours is a strange courtship   louise looked up eagerly as he entered  there is news she exclaimed  i can see it in your face  yes bellamy answered there is news  that is why i have come where can we talk  she rose to her feet  before them the open french windows led on to a smooth green lawn  she took his arm  come outside with me she said  i am shut up here because i will not see the doctors whom they send or any one from the opera house  an envoy from the palace has been and i have sent him away  you mean to keep your word then  have i ever broken it  never again will i sing in this city  it is so  bellamy looked around  the garden of the villa was enclosed by high gray stone walls  they were secure here at least from eavesdroppers  she rested her fingers lightly upon his arm holding up the skirts of her loose gown with her other hand  i have spoken to you he said of dorward the american journalist  she nodded  of course she assented  you told me that the chancellor had promised him an interview for today  well he went to the palace and the chancellor saw him  she looked at him with upraised eyebrows  the newspapers are full of lies as usual then i suppose  the latest telegrams say that the chancellor is dangerously ill  it is quite true bellamy declared  what i am going to tell you is surprising but i had it from dorward himself  when he reached the palace the chancellor was practically insane  his doctors were trying to persuade him to go to his room and lie down but he heard dorwards voice and insisted upon seeing him  the man was madon the verge of a collapseand he handed over to dorward his notes and a verbatim report of all that passed at the palace this morning  she looked at him incredulously  my dear david she exclaimed  it is amazing he admitted but it is the truth  i know it for a fact  the man was absolutely beside himself he had no idea what he was doing  where is it she asked quickly  you have seen it  dorward would not give it up he said bitterly  while we argued in our sittingroom at the hotel the police arrived  dorward escaped through the bedroom and down the service stairs  he spoke of trying to catch the orient express tonight but i doubt if they will ever let him leave the city  it is wonderful this she murmured softly  what are you going to do  louise you and i have few secrets from each other  i would have killed dorward to obtain that sealed envelope because i believe that the knowledge of its contents in london today would save us from disaster  to know how far each is pledged and from which direction the first blow is to come would be our salvation  i cannot understand she said why he should have refused to share his knowledge with you  he is an americanit is almost the same thing as being an englishman  and you are friendsi am sure that you have helped him often  it was a matter of vanitysimply cursed vanity bellamy answered it would have been the greatest journalistic success of modern times for him to have printed that document word for word in his paper  he fights for his own hand alone  and you she whispered  he will have to reckon with me bellamy declared  i know that he is going to try and leave vienna tonight and if he does i shall be at his heels  she nodded her head thoughtfully  i too she announced  i come with you my friend  i do no more good here and they worry my life out all the time  i come to sing in london at covent garden  i have agreements there which only await my signature  we will go together is it not so  very well he answered only remember that my movements must depend very largely upon dorwards  the train leaves at eight oclock station time  i have already a coupe reserved  i come with you she murmured  i am very weary of this city  they walked on for a few paces in silence  bellamy looked around the gardens brilliant with flowering shrubs and rose trees with here and there some delicate piece of statuary halfhidden amongst the wealth of foliage  the villa had once belonged to a royal favorite and the grounds had been its chief glory  they reached a sheltered seat and sat down  a few yards away a tiny waterfall came tumbling over the rocks into a deep pool  they were hidden from the windows of the villa by the boughs of a drooping chestnut tree  bellamy stooped and kissed her upon the lips  ours is a strange courtship louise he whispered softly  she took his hand in hers and smoothed it  she had returned his kiss but she drew a little further away from him  ah my dear friend looking at him with sorrow in her eyes courtship is scarcely the word is it  for you and me there is nothing to hope for nothing beyond  he leaned towards her  never believe that he begged  these days are dark enough heaven knows yet the work of every one has its goal  even our turn may come  something flickered for a moment in her face something which seemed to make a different woman of her  bellamy saw it and hardened though he was he felt the slow stirring of his own pulses  he kissed her hand passionately and she shivered  we must not talk of these things she said  we must not think of them  at least our friendship has been wonderful  now i must go in  i must tell my maid and arrange to steal away tonight  they stood up and he held her in his arms for a moment  though her lips met his freely enough he was very conscious of the reserve with which she yielded herself to him conscious of it and thankful too  they walked up the path together and as they went she plucked a red rose and thrust it through his buttonhole  if we had no dreams she said softly life would not be possible perhaps some day even we may pluck roses together  he raised her fingers to his lips  it was not often that they lapsed into sentiment  when she spoke again it was finished  you had better leave she told him by the garden gate  there are the usual crowd in my anteroom and it is well that you and i are not seen too much together  till this evening he whispered as he turned away i shall be at the station early  if dorward is taken i shall still leave vienna if he goes it may be an eventful journey     chapter iv  the night train from vienna   dorwood whistling softly to himself sat in a corner of his coupe rolling innumerable cigarettes  he was a man of unbounded courage and wonderful resource but with a slightly exaggerated idea as to the sanctity of an american citizen  he had served his apprenticeship in his own country and his name had become a household word owing to his brilliant success as war correspondent in the russojapanese war  his experience of european countries however was limited  after the more obvious dangers with which he had grappled and which he had overcome during his adventurous career he was disposed to be a little contemptuous of the subtler perils at which his friend bellamy had plainly hinted  he had made his escape from the hotel without any very serious difficulty and since that time although he had taken no particular precautions he had remained unmolested  from his own point of view therefore it was perhaps only reasonable that he should no longer have any misgiving as to his personal safety  arrest as a thief was the worst which he had feared  even that he seemed now to have evaded  the coupe was exceedingly comfortable and after all he had had a somewhat exciting day  he lit a cigarette and stretched himself out with a murmur of immense satisfaction  he was close upon the great triumph of his life  he was perfectly content to lie there and look out upon the flying landscape upon which the shadows were now fast descending  he was safe absolutely safe he assured himself  nevertheless when the door of his coupe was opened he started almost like a guilty man  the relief in his face as he recognized his visitor was obvious  it was bellamy who entered and dropped into a seat by his side  wasting your time arent you the latter remarked pointing to the growing heap of cigarettes  well i guess not dorward answered  i can smoke this lot before we reach london  bellamy smiled enigmatically  i dont think that you will he said  why not  you are such a sanguine person bellamy sighed  personally i do not think that there is the slightest chance of your reaching london at all  dorward laughed scornfully  and why not he asked  bellamy merely shrugged his shoulders  dorward seemed to find the gesture irritating  youve got espionage on the brain my dear friend he declared dryly  i suppose its the result of your profession  i may not know so much about europe as you do but i am inclined to think that an american citizen traveling with his passport on a train like this is moderately safe especially when hes not above a scrap by way of taking care of himself  youre a plucky fellow remarked bellamy  i dont see any pluck about it  in vienna i must admit i shouldnt have been surprised if theyd tried to fake up some sort of charge against me but anyhow they didnt  guess theyd find it a pretty tall order trying to interfere with an american citizen  bellamy looked at his friend curiously  i suppose youre not bluffing by any chance dorward he said you really believe what you say  why in thunder shouldnt i dorward asked  bellamy sighed  my dear dorward he said it is amazing to me that a man of your experience should talk and behave like a baby  youve taken some notice of your fellowpassengers i suppose  ive seen a few of them dorward answered carelessly  what about them  nothing much bellamy declared except that there are to my certain knowledge three high officials of the secret police of austria in the next coupe but one and at least four or five of their subordinates somewhere on board the train  dorward withdrew his cigarette from his mouth and looked at his friend keenly  i guess youre trying to scare me bellamy he remarked  but bellamy was suddenly grave  there had come into his face an utterly altered expression  his tone when he spoke was almost solemn  dorward he said upon my honor i assure you that what i have told you is the truth  i cannot seem to make you realize the seriousness of your position  when you left the palace with that paper in your pocket you were to all intents and purposes a doomed man  your passport and your american citizenship count for absolutely nothing  i have come in to warn you that if you have any last messages to leave you had better give them to me now  this is a pretty good bluff youre putting up dorward exclaimed contemptuously  the long and short of it is i suppose that you want me to break the seal of this document and let you read it  bellamy shook his head  it is too late for that dorward he said  if the seal were broken theyd very soon guess where i came in and it wouldnt help the work i have in hand for me to be picked up with a bullet in my forehead on the railway track  dorward frowned uneasily  what are you here for anyway then he asked  well frankly not to argue with you bellamy answered  as a matter of fact you are of no use to me any longer  i am sorry old man  you cant say that i didnt give you good advice  i am bound to play for my own hand though in this matter and if i get any benefit at all out of my journey it will be after some regrettable accident has happened to you  say ring the bell for drinks and chuck this dorward exclaimed ive had about enough of it  i am not denying anything you say but if these fellows really are on board theyll think twice before they meddle with me  on the contrary bellamy assured him they will not take the trouble to think at all  their minds are perfectly made up as to what they are going to do  however thats finished  i have nothing more to say  dorward gazed for a minute or two fixedly out of the window  look here bellamy he said turning abruptly round supposing i change my mind supposing i open this precious document and let you read it over with me  bellamy rose hastily to his feet  you must not think of it he exclaimed  you would simply write my deathwarrant  dont allude to that matter again  i have risked enough in coming in here to sit with you  then for heavens sake dont stop any longer  dorward said irritably  you get on my nerves with all this foolish talk  in an hours time i am going to bolt my door and go to sleep  well breakfast together in the morning if you like  bellamy said nothing  the steward had brought them the whiskies and sodas which dorward had ordered  bellamy raised his tumbler to his lips and set it down again  forgive me he said i do not think that i am thirsty  dorward drank his off at a gulp  almost immediately he closed his eyes  bellamy with a little shrug of the shoulders left him alone  as he passed along to his own coupe he met louise in the corridor  you have seen von behrling he whispered  she nodded  he is in that coupe number 7 alone she said  i invited him to come in with me but he seemed embarrassed  it is his companions who watch him all the time  he has promised to talk with me later  in the middle of the night louise opened her eyes to find bellamy bending over her  louise he whispered it is von behrling who will take possession of the packet  they have been discussing whether it will not be safer to go on to london instead of doubling back  see von behrling again  do all you can to persuade him to come to londonall you can louise remember  so she whispered  i shall put on my dressinggown and sit in the corridor  it is hot here  bellamy glided out closing the door softly behind him  the train was rushing on now through the blackness of an unusually dark night for some time he sat in his own compartment listening  the voices whose muttered conversation he had overheard were silent now but once he fancied that he heard shuffling footsteps and a little cry in his heart he knew well that before morning dorward would have disappeared  the man within him was hard to subdue  he longed to make his way to dorwards side to interfere in this terribly unequal struggle yet he made no movement  dorward was a man and a friend but what was a life more or less  it was to a greater cause that he was pledged  towards three oclock he lay down on his bed and slept  the train attendant brought him his coffee soon after daylight  the mans hands were trembling  where are we bellamy asked sleepily  near munich monsieur the man answered  monsieur noticed perhaps that we stopped for some time in the night  bellamy shook his head  i sleep soundly he said  i heard nothing  there has been an accident the man declared  an american gentleman who got in at vienna was drinking whiskey all night and became very drunk  in a tunnel he threw himself out upon the line  bellamy shuddered a little  he had been prepared but none the less it was an awful thing this  you are sure that he is dead he asked  the man was very sure indeed  there is a doctor from vienna upon the train sir he said  he examined him at once but death must have been instantaneous  bellamy drew a long breath and commenced to put on his clothes the next move was for him     chapter v  von behrling has the packet   bellamy stole along the halflit corridors of the train until he came to the coupé which had been reserved for mademoiselle idiale assured that he was not watched he softly turned the handle of the door and entered  louise was sitting up in her dressinggown drinking her coffee  he held up his finger and she greeted him only with a nod  forgive me louise he whispered i dared not knock and i was obliged to see you at once  she smiled  it is of no consequence she said  one is always prepared here the porter the ticketman and at the customsthey all enter is anything wrong  it has happened he answered  she shivered a little and her face became grave  poor fellow she murmured  he simply sat still and asked for it bellamy declared still speaking in a cautious undertone  he would not be warned  i could have saved him if any one could but he would not hear reason  he was what you call pigheaded she remarked  he has paid the penalty bellamy continued  now listen to me louise  i got into that small coupe next to von behrlings and i feel sure from what i overheard that they will go on to london all three of them  who is there on the train she demanded  baron streuss who is head of the secret police von behrling and adolf kahn bellamy answered  then there are four or five secret service men of the rank and file but they are all traveling separately  von behrling has the packet  the others form a sort of cordon around him  but why she asked does he go on to london  why not return to vienna  for one thing bellamy replied with a grim smile they are afraid of me  then you must remember that this affair of dorward will be talked about  they do not want to seem in any way implicated  to return from any one of these stations down the line would create suspicion  she nodded  well  i am going to leave the train at the next stop he continued  i find that i shall just catch the northern express to berlin  from there i shall come on to london as quickly as i can  you know the address of my rooms  she nodded  15 fitzroy street  when i get there let me have a line waiting to tell me where i can see you  while i am on the train you will find von behrling almost inaccessible  directly i have gone it will be different play with him carefully  he should not be difficult  to tell you the truth i am rather surprised that he has been trusted upon a mission like this  he was in disgrace with the chancellor a short while ago and i know that he was hurt at not being allowed to attend the conference  the others will watch him closely but they cannot overhear everything that passes between you two  von behrling is a poor man  you will know how to make him wish he were rich  very slowly her eyebrows rose up  she looked at him doubtfully  it is a slender chance david she remarked  von behrling is a little wild i know and he pretends to be very much in love with me but i do not think that he would sell his country  then too see how he will be watched  i do not suppose that they will leave us alone for a moment  bellamy took her hands in his gripping them with almost unnatural force  louise he declared earnestly you dont quite realize von behrlings special weakness and your extraordinary strength  you know that you are beautiful i suppose but you do not quite know what that means  i have heard men talk about you till one would think that they were children  you have something of that art or guilecall it what you willwhich passes from you through a mans blood to his brain and carries him indeed to heavenbut carries him there mad  louise dont be angry with me for what i say  remember that i know my sex  i know you too and i trust you but you can turn von behrling from a sane honorable man into what you will without suffering even his lips to touch your fingers  von behrling has that packet in his possession  when i come to see you in london i will bring you twenty thousand pounds in bank of england notes  with that von behrling might fancy himself on his way to americawith you  she closed her eyes for a moment  perhaps she wished to keep hidden from him the thoughts which chased one another through her brain he wished to make use of herof her the woman whom he loved then she remembered that it was for her country and his and the anger passed  but i am afraid she said softly that the moment they reach london this document will be taken to the austrian embassy  before then bellamy declared von behrling must not know whether he is in heaven or upon earth  it will not be opened in london he can make up another packet to resemble precisely the one of which he robbed dorward  oh  it is a difficult game i know but it is worth playing  remember louise that we are not petty conspirators it is your countrys very existence that is threatened  it is for her sake as well as for england  i shall do my best she murmured looking into his face  oh you may be sure that i shall do my best  bellamy raised her fingers to his lips and stole away  the electric lamps had been turned out but the morning was cloudy and the light dim  back in his own berth he put his things together ready to leave at munich  then he rang for the porter  i am getting out at the next stop he announced  very good monsieur the man answered  bellamy looked at him closely  you are a frenchman  it is so monsieur  i may be wrong bellamy continued slowly but i believe that if i asked you a question and it concerned some germans and austrians you would tell me the truth  the mans gesture was inimitable  englishmen to him were obviously the salt of the earth  germans and austrianswhy they existed as the cattle in the fieldsnothing more  bellamy gave him a sovereign  there were three austrians who got in at vienna he said  they are in numbers ten and eleven  but yes monsieur the man assented  as yet i think they are fast asleep  not one of them has rung for his coffee  where are they booked for  for london monsieur  you do not happen bellamy continued to have heard them say anything about leaving the train before then  on the contrary sir the porter answered two of the gentlemen have been inquiring about the boat across to dover  they were very anxious to travel by a turbine  bellamy nodded  thank you very much  you will be so discreet as to forget that i have asked you any questions concerning them  as for me if one would know i am on my way to berlin  the bell rang  the man looked outside and put his head once more in bellamys coupe  it is one of the gentleman who has rung he declared  if anything is said about leaving the train i shall report it at once to monsieur  you will do well bellamy answered  the porter returned in a few moments  two of the gentlemen sir he announced are undressed and in their pyjamas  they have ordered their breakfast to be served after we leave munich  bellamy nodded  further sir the man continued coming a little closer one of them asked me whether the english gentlemanmeaning youwas going through to london or not  i told them that you were getting out at the next station and that i thought you were going to berlin  quite right bellamy said  if they ask any more questions let me know  mademoiselle idiale with the aid of one of the two maids who were traveling with her was able to make a sufficiently effective toilette  at a few minutes before the time for luncheon she walked down the corridor and recognized von behrling who was sitting with his companions in one of the compartments  ah it is indeed you then she exclaimed smiling at him  he rose to his feet and came out  tall with a fair moustache and blue eyes he was often taken for an englishman and was inclined to be proud of the fact  you have rested well i trust mademoiselle he asked bowing low over her fingers  excellently replied louise  will you not take me in to luncheon the car is full of men and i am not comfortable alone  it is not pleasant either to eat with ones maids  i am honored he declared  will you permit me for one moment  he turned and spoke to his companions  louise saw at once that they were protesting vigorously  she saw too that von behrling only became more obstinate and that he was very nearly angry  she moved a few steps on down the corridor and stood looking out of the window  he joined her almost immediately  come he said they will be serving luncheon in five minutes we will go and take a good place  your friends i am afraid she remarked did not like your leaving them  they are not very gallant  to me it is indifferent he answered fiercely twirling his moustache  streuss there is an old fool  he has always some fancy in his brain  louise raised her eyebrows slightly  you are your own master i suppose she said  the baron is used to command his policemen and sometimes he forgets  there are many people who find him too autocratic  he means well von behrling asserted  it is his manner only which is against him  they found a comfortable table and she sat smiling at him across the white cloth  if this is not sachers she said it is at least more pleasant than lunching alone  i can assure you mademoiselle he declared with a vigorous twirl of his moustache that i find it so  always gallant she murmured  tell me is it true of youthe news which i heard just before i left vienna  have you really resigned your post with the chancellor  you heard that he asked slowly  she hesitated for a moment  i heard something of the sort she admitted  to be quite candid with you i think it was reported that the chancellor was making a change on his own account  so that is what they say is it  what do they know about itthese gossipers  you were not allowed at the conference yesterday she remarked  no one was allowed there so that goes for nothing  ah  well she said looking meditatively out upon the landscape a year ago the thought of that conference would have driven me wild  i should not have been content until i had learned somehow or other what had transpired  lately i am afraid my interest in my country seems to have grown a trifle cold  perhaps because i have lived in vienna i have learned to look at things from your point of view  then too the world is a selfish place and our own little careers are after all the most important part of it  von behrling eyed her curiously  it seems strange to hear you talk like this he remarked  she looked out of the window for a moment  oh  i still love my country in a way she answered and i still hate all austrians in a way but it is not as it used to be with me i must admit  if we had two lives i would give one to my country and keep one for myself  since we have only one i am afraid after all that i am human and i want to taste some of its pleasures  some of its pleasures von behrling repeated a little gloomily ah that is easy enough for you mademoiselle  not so easy as it may appear she answered  one needs many things to get the best out of life  one needs wealth and one needs love and one needs them while one is young while one can enjoy  it is true von behrling admittedquite true  if one is not careful she continued one lets the years slip by they can never come again  if one does not live while one is young there is no other chance  von behrling assented with renewed gloom  he was twentyfive years old and his income barely paid for his uniforms  of late this fact had materially interfered with his enjoyments  it is strange he said that you should talk like this  you have the world at your feet mademoiselle  you have only to throw the handkerchief  her lips parted in a dazzling smile  the bluest eyes in the world grew softer as they looked into his  von behrling felt his cheeks burn  my friend it is not so easy she murmured  tell me she continued why it is that you have so little selfconfidence  is it because you are poor  i am a beggarbitterly  she shrugged her shoulders  well she said glancing down the menu which the waiter had brought if you are poor and content to remain so one must presume that you have compensations  but i have none he declared  you should know thatyou mademoiselle  life for me means one thing and one thing only  she looked at him for a moment and down upon the tablecloth  von behrling shook like a man in the throes of some great passion  we talk too intimately she whispered as the people began to file in to take their places  after luncheon we will take our coffee in my coupe  then if you like we will speak of these matters  i have a headache  will you order me some champagne  it is a terrible thing i know to drink wine in the morning but when one travels what can one do  here come your bodyguard  they look at me as though i had stolen you away  remember we take our coffee together afterwards  i am bored with so much traveling and i look to you to amuse me  von behrlings journey was after all marked with sharp contrasts the kindness of the woman whom he adored was sufficient in itself to have transported him into a seventh heaven  on the other hand he had trouble with his friends  streuss drew him on one side at ostend and talked to him plainly  von behrling he said i speak to you on behalf of kahn and myself  wine and women and pleasure are good things  we two we love them perhaps as you do but there is a place and a time for them and it is not now  our mission is too serious  well well von behrling exclaimed impatiently what is all this what do i do wrong  what have you to say against me  if i talk with mademoiselle idiale it is because it is the natural thing for me to do  would you have us threeyou and kahn and myselftravel arm in arm and speak never a word to our fellow passengers  would you have us proclaim to all the world that we are on a secret mission carrying a secret document to obtain which we have already committed a crime  these are oldfashioned methods streuss  it is better that we behave like ordinary mortals  you talk foolishly streuss  it is you the older man declared who play the fool and we will not have it  mademoiselle idiale is a servian and a patriot  she is the friend too of bellamy the englishman  she and he were together last night  bellamy is not even on the train von behrling protested  he went north to berlin  that itself is the proof that they know nothing  if he had had the merest suspicion do you not think that he would have stayed with us  bellamy is very clever streuss answered  there are too many of us to deal withhe knew that  mademoiselle idiale is clever too  remember that half the trouble in life has come about through false women  what is it that you want von behrling demanded  that you travel the rest of the way with us and speak no more with mademoiselle  von behrling drew himself up  after all it was he who was noble streuss was little more than a policeman  i refuse he exclaimed  let me remind you streuss that i am in charge of this expedition  it was i who planned it  it was ihe dropped his voice and touched his chestwho struck the first blow for its success  i think that we need talk no more he went on  i welcome your companionship  it makes for strength that we travel together  but for the rest the enterprise has been mine the success so far has been mine and the termination of it shall be mine  watch me if you like  stay with me and see that i am not robbed if you fear that i am not able to take care of myself but do not ask me to behave like an idiot  von behrling stepped away quickly  the siren was already blowing from the steamer     chapter vi  von behrling is tempted   the night was dark but fine and the crossing smooth  louise wrapped in furs abandoned her private cabin directly they had left the harbor and had a chair placed on the upper deck  von behrling found her there but not before they were nearly halfway across she beckoned him to her side  her eyes glowed at him through the darkness  you are not looking after me my friend she declared  by myself i had to find this place  von behrling was ruffled  he was also humbly apologetic  it is those idiots who are with me he said  all the time they worry  she laughed and drew him down so that she could whisper in his ear  i know what it is she said  you have secrets which you are taking to london and they are afraid of me because i am a servian tell me is it not so  perhaps even they think that i am a spy  von behrling hesitated  she drew him closer towards her  sit down on the deck she continued and lean against the rail you are too big to talk to up there  so  now you can come underneath my rug  tell me are they afraid of me your friends  is it without reason he asked  would not any one be afraid of youif indeed they believed that you wished to know our secrets i wonder if there is a man alive whom you could not turn round your little finger  she laughed at him softly  ah no she said  men are not like that nowadays  they talk and they talk but it is not much they would do for a womans sake  you believe that he asked in a low tone  i do indeed  one reads lovestoriesno i do not mean romances but memoirsmemoirs of the french and austrian courtsmemoirs even written by englishmen  men were different a generation ago honor was dear to them then honor and position and wealth and yet there were many very many then who were willing to give all these things for the love of a woman  and do you think there are none now he whispered hoarsely  my friend she answered looking down at him i think that there are very few  she heard his breath come fast between his teeth and she realized his state of excitement  mademoiselle louise he said my love for you has made me a laughingstock in the clubs of vienna  ithe povertystricken who have nothing but a noble name nothing to offer youhave dared to show others what i think have dared to place you in my heart above all the women on earth  it is very nice of you she murmured  why do you tell me this now  why indeed he answered  what have i to hope for  she looked along the deck  not a dozen yards away two cigar ends burned red through the gloom  she knew very well that those cigar ends belonged to streuss and his friend  she laughed softly and once more she bent her head  how they watch you those men she said  listen my friend rudolph  supposing their fears were true supposing i were really a spy supposing i offered you wealth and with it whatever else you might claim from me for the secret which you carry to england  how do you know that i am carrying a secret he asked hoarsely  she laughed  my friend she said with your two absurd companions shadowing you all the time and glowering at me how could one possibly doubt it  the baron streuss is i believe the chief of your secret service department is he not  to me he seems the most obvious policeman i ever saw dressed as a gentleman  you dont mean it he muttered  you cant mean what you said just now  she was silent for a few moments  some one passing struck a match and she caught a glimpse of the white face of the man who sat by her sidestrained now and curiously intense  supposing i did  you must be mad he declared  you must not talk to me like this mademoiselle  i have no secret  it is your humor i know but it is dangerous  there is no danger she murmured for we are alone  i say again rudolph supposing this were true  his hand passed across his forehead  she fancied that he made a motion as though to rise to his feet but she laid her hand upon his  stay here she whispered  no i do not wish to drive you away now you are here you shall listen to me  but you are not in earnest he faltered  dont tell me that you are in earnest  it is treason  i am rudolph von behrling secretary to the chancellor  again she leaned towards him so that he could see into her eyes  rudolph she said you are indeed rudolph von behrling you are indeed the chancellors secretary  what do you gain from it  a pittance  many hours work a day and a pittance  what have you to look forward to  a little official life a stupid official position rudolph here am i and there is the world  do i not represent other things  god knows you do he muttered  i too am weary of singing  i want a long resta long rest and a better name than my own  dont shrink away from me  it isnt so wonderful after all  bellamy the englishman came to me a few hours ago  he was dorwards friend  he knew well what dorward carried  it was not his affair he told me and interposition from him was hopeless but he knew that you and i were friends  you must stop von behrling declared  you must stop  i must not listen to this  he offered me twenty thousand pounds she went on for the packet in your pocket  think of that my friend  it would be a start in life would it not  i am an extravagant woman  even if i would i dared not think of a poor man  but twenty thousand pounds is sufficient  when i reach london i am going to a flat which has been waiting for me for weeks15 dover street  if you bring that packet to me instead of taking it to the austrian embassy there will be twenty thousand pounds and  her fingers suddenly held his  she could almost hear his heart beating  her eyes by now accustomed to the gloom could see the tumult which was passing within the man reflected in his face she whispered a warning under her breath  the two cigar ends had moved nearer  the forms of the two men were now distinct  one was leaning over the side of the ship by von behrlings side  the other stood a few feet away gazing at the lights of dover  von behrling staggered to his feet  he said something in an angry undertone to streuss  louise rose and shook out her furs  my friend she said turning to von behrling if your friends can spare you so long will you fetch one of my maids  you will find them both in my cabin number three  i wish to walk for a few moments before we arrive  von behrling turned away like a man in a dream  mademoiselle idiale followed him slowly and behind her came von behrlings companions   the details of the great singers journey had been most carefully planned by an excited manager who had received the telegram announcing her journey to london  there was an engaged carriage at dover into which she was duly escorted by a representative of the opera syndicate who had been sent down from london to receive her von behrling seemed to be missing  she had seen nothing of him since he had descended to summon her maids  but just as the train was starting she heard the sound of angry voices and a moment later his white face was pressed through the open window of the carriage  louise he muttered i am on fire  i cannot talk to you  i fear that they suspect something  they have told me that if i travel with you they will force their way in  even now streuss comes listen for your telephone tonight or whenever i can  i must thinki must think  he passed on and louise leaning back in her seat closed her eyes     chapter vii  we play for great stakes   bellamy travelstained and weary arrived at his rooms at two oclock on the following afternoon to find amongst a pile of correspondence a penciled message awaiting him in a handwriting he knew well  he tore open the envelope   david deari have just arrived and i am sending you these few lines at once  as to what progress i have made i cannot say for certain but there is a chance  you had better get the money ready and come to me here  if r could only escape from streuss and those who watch him all the time i should be quite sure but they are suspicious  what may happen i cannot tell  i do my best and i have hated it  get the money ready and come to me                                                             louise   bellamy drew a little breath and tore the note into pieces  then he rang for his servant  a bath and some clean clothes quickly he ordered  while i am changing ring up downing street and see if sir james is there  if not find out exactly where he is  i must see him within half an hour  afterwards get me a taxicab  the man obeyed with the swift efficiency of the thoroughly trained servant  in rather less than the time which he had stated bellamy had left his rooms  before four oclock he had arrived at the address which louise had given him  a commissionaire telephoned his name to the first floor and in a very few moments a palefaced french manservant in sombre black livery descended and bowed to bellamy  monsieur will be so good as to come this way he directed  bellamy followed him into the lift which stopped at the first floor  he was ushered into a small boudoir already smothered with roses  mademoiselle will be here immediately the man announced she is engaged with a gentleman from the opera but she will leave him to receive monsieur  bellamy nodded  pray let mademoiselle understand he said that i am entirely at her service  my time is of no consequence  the man bowed and withdrew  louise came to him almost directly from an inner chamber  she was wearing a loose gown but the fatigue of her journey seemed already to have passed away  her eyes were bright and a faint color glowed in her cheeks  david she exclaimed thank heaven that you are here  she took both his hands and held them for a moment  then she walked to the door made sure that it was securely fastened and stood there listening for a moment  i suppose i am foolish she said coming back to him and yet i cannot help fancying that i am being watched on every side since we landed in england  i detest my new manager and i dont trust any of the servants he has engaged for me  you got my note  yes he answered i had your noteand i am here  the restraint of his manner was obvious  he was standing a little away from her  she came suddenly up to him her hands fell upon his shoulders her face was upturned to his  even then he made no motion to embrace her  david she whispered softly what i am doingwhat i have donewas at your suggestion  i do it for you i do it for my country i do it against every natural feeling i possess  i hate and loathe the lies i tell  are you remembering that  is it in your heart at this moment  he stooped and kissed her  forgive me he said it is i who am to blame but i am only human we play for great stakes louise but sometimes one forgets  as i live she murmured the kiss you gave me last is still upon my lips  what i have promised goes for nothing  what he has promised is thisthe papers tonight  unopened  unopened she repeated softly  but how is it to be done bellamy asked  he must have arrived in london when you did last night  how is it they are not already at the embassy  the ambassador was commanded to cowes she explained  he cannot be back until late tonight  no one else has a key to the treaty safe and von behrling declined to give up the document to any one save the ambassador himself  bellamy nodded  what about streuss  streuss and the others are all furious louise said  yet after all behrling has a certain measure of right on his side  his orders were to see with his own eyes this envelope deposited in the safe by the ambassador himself  he returns tonight bellamy exclaimed quickly  she nodded  before he comes she declared i think that the document will be in your hands  how is it to be done  the report is written she explained on five pages of foolscap they are contained in a long envelope scaled with the chancellors crest von behrling being one of the family has the same crest he has prepared another envelope the same size and weight and signed it with his seal  it is this which he will hand over to the ambassador if he should return unexpectedly  the real one he has concealed  is he here bellamy inquired  thank heavens no she answered  my dear david what are you thinking of  he is not here and he dare not come here  you are to go to your rooms she added glancing at the clock and between five and six oclock this evening you will be rung up on the telephone  a rendezvous will be given you for later on tonight you must take the money there and receive the packet  von behrling will be disguised and prepared for flight  bellamys eyes glowed  you believe this he exclaimed  i believe it she replied  he is going to do it  after he has seen you he will make his way to plymouth  i have promiseddont look at me davidi have promised to join him there  bellamy was grave  there will be trouble he said  he will come back  he will want to shoot you  he may be slowwitted in some things but he is passionate  am i a coward she asked with a scornful laugh  have i ever shown fear of my life  no david  it is not that of which i am afraid  it is the memory of the mans touch it is the look which was in your face when you came into the room  these are the things i fearnot death  bellamy drew her into his arms and kissed her  forgive me he begged  at such times a man is a weak thinga weak and selfish thing  i am ashamed of myself  i should have known better than to have doubted you for a moment  i know you so well louise  i know what you are  she smiled  dear she said you have made me happy  and now you must go away remember that these few minutes are only an interlude  over here i am mademoiselle idiale who sings tonight at covent garden  see my roses  there are two rooms full of reporters and photographers in the place now  the leader of the orchestra is in my bedroom and two of the directors are drinking whiskies and sodas with this new manager of mine in the diningroom  between five and six oclock this afternoon you will get the message  it is somewhere i think in the city that you will have to go  there will be no trouble about the money  nothing but notes or gold will be of any use  i have it in my pocket he answered  i have it in notes but he need never fear that they will be traced  the numbers of notes given for secret service purposes are expunged from every ones memory  she drew a little sigh  it is a great sum she said  after all he should be grateful to me  if only he would be sensible and get away to the united states or to south america  he could live there like a prince poor fellow  he would be far happier  i only hope that he will go bellamy agreed  there is one thing to be remembered  if he does not go if he stays for twentyfour hours in this country i do not believe that he will live to do you harm  the men who are with him are not the sort to stop short at trifles  besides streuss and kahn they have a regular army of spies at their bidding here  if they find out that he has tricked them they will hunt him down and before long  louise shivered  oh i hope she exclaimed that he gets away  he is a traitor of course but he is a traitor to a hateful cause and after all i think it is less for the money than for my sake that he does it that sounds very conceited i suppose she added with a faint smile  ah  well you see for five years so many have been trying to turn my head  no wonder if i begin to believe some of their stories  david i must go  i must not keep dr henschell waiting any longer  tomorrow he said tomorrow early i shall come  i am afraid i shall miss your first appearance in england louise  the sound of a violin came floating out from the inner room  that is my signal she declared smiling  de henschell was almost beside himself that i came away  i come doctor she called out  david good fortune she added giving him her hands  now go dear     chapter viii  the hand of misfortune   between the two men seated opposite each other in the large but somewhat barely furnished office the radical differences both in appearance and mannerisms perhaps also in disposition had never been more strongly evident  they were partners in business and face to face with ruin  stephen laverick senior member of the firm although an air of steadfast gloom had settled upon his cleancut powerful countenance retained even in despair something of that dogged composure temperamental and wholly british which had served him well along the road to fortune  arthur morrison the man who sat on the other side of the table a jew to his fingertips notwithstanding his altered name sat like a broken thing with tears in his terrified eyes disordered hair and parchmentpale face  words had flown from his lips in a continual stream  he floundered in his misery sobbed about it like a child  the hand of misfortune had stripped him naked and one man at least saw him as he really was  i cant stand it lavericki couldnt face them all  its too crueltoo horrible  eighteen thousand pounds gone in one week forty thousand in a month  forty thousand pounds  oh my god  he writhed in agony  the man on the other side of the table said nothing  if we could only have held on a little longer  unions must turn they will turn  laverick have you tried all your friends  think have you tried them all  twenty thousand pounds would see us through it  we should get our own money backi am sure of it  theres rendell laverick  hed do anything for you  youre always shooting or playing cricket with him  have you asked him laverick  hed never miss the money  you and i see things differently morrison laverick answered nothing would induce me to borrow money from a friend  but at a time like this morrison pleaded passionately  every one does it sometimes  hed be glad to help you  i know he would have you ever thought what it will be like laverick to be hammered  i have laverick admitted wearily  god knows it seems as terrible a thing to me as it can to you  but if we go down we must go down with clean hands  ive no faith in your infernal market and not one penny will i borrow from a friend  the jews face was almost piteous  he stretched himself across the table  there were genuine tears in his eyes  laverick he said old man youre wrong  i know you think ive been led away  ive taken you out of our depth but the only trouble has been that we havent had enough capital and no backing those who stand up will win  they will make money  unfortunately laverick remarked we cannot stand up  please understand that i will not discuss this matter with you in any way i will not borrow money from rendell or any friend  i have asked the bank and i have asked pages who will be our largest creditors to help us would simply be a business proposition so far as they are concerned  as you know they have refused  if you see any hope in that direction why dont you try some of your own friends  for every one man i know in the house you have seemed to be bosom friends with at least twenty  morrison groaned  those i know are not that sort of friend he answered  they will drink with you and spend a night out or a weekend at brighton but they do not lend money  if they would do you think i would mind asking  why i would go on my knees to any man who would lend us the money  i would even kiss his feet  i cannot bear it laverick i cannot  i cannot  laverick said nothing  words were useless things wasted upon such a creature  he eyed his partner with a contempt which he took no pains to conceal  this then was the smart young fellow recommended to him on all sides a few years ago as one of the shrewdest young men in his own particular department a person bound to succeed a moneymaker if ever there was one  laverick thought of him as he appeared at the office day by day glossy and immaculately dressed with a flower in his buttonhole boots that were a trifle too shiny hat and coat gloves and manner all imitation but all very near the real thing  what a collapse  youre going to stay and see it through he whined across the table  certainly laverick answered  the young man buried his face in his hands  i cant  i cant he moaned  i couldnt bear seeing all the fellows hearing them whisper thingsoh lord  oh lord laverick weve a few hundreds left  give me something and let me out of it  youre a stronger sort of man than i am  you can face iti cant  give me enough to get abroad with and if ever i do any good ill remember it i will indeed  laverick was silent for a moment  his companion watched his face eagerly  after all why not let him go  he was no help no comfort the very sight of him was contemptible  i have paid no money into the bank for several days laverick said slowly  when they refused to help us it was of course obvious that they guessed how things were  quite right quite right the young man interrupted feverishly they would have stuck to it against the overdraft  how much have we got in the safe  this afternoon laverick continued i changed all our cheques you can count the proceeds for yourself  there are i think eleven hundred pounds  you can take two hundred and fifty and you can take them with youto any place you like  the young man was already at the safe  the notes were between them on the table  he counted quickly with the fingers of a born manipulator of money  when he had gathered up two hundred and fifty pounds lavericks hand fell upon his  no more he ordered sternly  but my dear fellow morrison protested half of eleven hundred is five hundred and fifty  why should we not go halves  that is only fair laverick  it is little enough  we ought to have had a great deal more  laverick pushed him contemptuously away and locked up the remainder of the notes  i am letting you take two hundred and fifty pounds of this money he said for various reasons  for one i can bear this thing better alone  as for the rest of the money it remains there for the accountant who liquidates our affairs  i do not propose to touch a penny of it  the young man buttoned up his coat with an hysterical little laugh such ways were not his ways  they were not indeed within the limit of his understanding  but of his partner he had learned one thing at least the word of stephen laverick was the word of truth he shambled toward the door  on the whole he was lucky to have got the two hundred and fifty pounds  so long laverick he said from the door  imim sorry  it was characteristic of him that he did not venture to offer his hand  laverick nodded not unkindly  after all this young man was as he had been made  i wish you good luck morrison he said  try south africa     chapter ix  robbing the dead   the roar of the day was long since over  the rattle of vehicles the tinkling of hansom bells the tooting of horns from motorcars and cabs the ceaseless tramp of footsteps all had died away outside the streets were almost deserted  an occasional wayfarer passed along the flagged pavement with speedy footsteps  here and there a few lights glimmered at the windows of some of the larger blocks of offices  the bustle of the day was finished  there is no place in london so strangely quiet as the narrow thoroughfares of the city proper when the hour approaches midnight  laverick who since his partners departure had been studying with infinite care his private ledger closed it at last with a little snap and leaned back in his chair  after all save that he had got rid of morrison it had been a wasted evening  not even he whose financial astuteness no man had ever questioned could raise from those piles of figures any other answer save the one inevitable one the knowledge of which had been like a black nightmare stalking by his side for the last thirtysix hours  one by one during the evening his clerks had left him and it was a proof not only of his wonderful selfcontrol but also of the confidence which he invariably inspired that not a single one of them had the slightest idea how things were  not a soul knew that the firm of laverick  morrison was already practically derelict that they had on the morrow twentyfive thousand pounds to find neither credit nor balance at their bankers and eight hundred and fifty pounds in the safe  laverick haggard from his long vigil locked up his books at last turned out the lights and locking the doors behind him walked into the silent street  instinctively he turned his steps westwards this might well be the last night on which he would care to show himself in his accustomed haunts the last night on which he could mix with his fellows freely and without that terrible sense of consciousness which follows upon disaster  already there was little enough left of it  it was too late to change and go to his club the places of amusement were already closed  tomorrow night both club and theatres would lie outside his world  he walked slowly yet he had scarcely taken in fact a dozen steps when with a purely mechanical impulse he paused by a stoneflagged entry to light a cigarette  it was a passage almost a tunnel for a few yards leading to an open space on one side of which was an old churchyardstrange survival in such a partand on the other the offices of several firms of stockbrokers a russian banker an actuary  it was the barest of impulses which led him to glance up the entry before he blew out the match  then he gave a quick start and became for a moment paralyzed  within a few feet of him something was lying on the grounda dark mass black and softthe body of a man perhaps  just above it a pair of eyes gleamed at him through the semidarkness  laverick at first had no thought of tragedy  it might be a tramp or a drunkard perhapsa fight or a man taken ill  then something sinister about the light of those burning eyes set his heart beating faster  he struck another match with firm fingers and bent forward  what he saw upon the ground made him feel a little sick  what he saw racing away down the passage prompted him to swift pursuit  down the arched court into the open space he ran himself an athlete but mocked by the swiftness of the shadowlike form which he pursued  at the end was another streetempty  he looked up and down seeking in vain for any signs of life  there was nothing to tell him which way to turn  opposite was a very labyrinth of courts and turnings  there was not even the sound of a footfall to guide him  slowly he retraced his steps lit another match and leaned over the prostrate figure  then he knew that it was a tragedy indeed upon which he had stumbled  the man was dead and he had met with his death by unusual means these were the first two things of which laverick assured himself without any doubt a savage and a terrible crime had been committed a hornhandled knife of unusual length had been driven up to the hilt through the heart of the murdered man  there had been other blows notably about the head  there was not much blood but the position of the knife alone told its ugly story  laverick though his nerves were of the strongest felt his head swim as he looked  he rose to his feet and walked to the opening of the passage gasping  the street was no longer empty  about thirty yards away looking westwards a man was standing in the middle of the road  the light from the lamppost escaped his face  laverick could only see that he was slim of medium height dressed in dark clothes with his hands in the pockets of his overcoat  to all appearance he was watching the entry  laverick took a step towards himthe man as deliberately took a step further away  laverick held up his hand  hullo he called out and beckoned  the person addressed took no notice  laverick advanced another two or three stepsthe man retreated a similar distance  laverick changed his tactics and made a sudden spring forward  the man hesitated no longerhe turned and ran as though for his life  in a few minutes he was round the corner of the street and out of sight laverick returned slowly to the entry  a distant clock struck midnight  a couple of clerks came along the pavement on the other side their hands and arms full of letters laverick hesitated  he was never afterwards able to account for the impulse which prevented his calling out to them  instead he lurked in the shadows and watched them go by  when he was sure that they had disappeared he bent once more over the body of the murdered man  already that huddledup heap was beginning to exercise a nameless and terrible fascination for him  his first feelings of horror were mingled now with an insatiable curiosity  what manner of man was he  he was tall and strongly built fairof almost florid complexion  his clothes were very shabby and apparently readymade  his moustache was upturned and his hair was trimmed closer than is the custom amongst englishmen  laverick stooped lower and lower until he found himself almost on his knees  there was something projecting from the mans pocket as though it had been half snatched outa large portfolio of brown leather almost the size of a satchel  laverick drew it out holding it in one hand whilst with firm fingers he struck another match  then for the first time a little cry broke from his lips  both sides of the pocketbook were filled with banknotes  as his match flickered out he caught a glimpse of the figures in the lefthand corner500 poundsgreat rolls of them  laverick rose gasping to his feet  it was a new arabian nights thisa dreama continuation of the nightmare which had threatened him all day  or was it perhaps the madness comingthe madness which he had begun only an hour or so ago to fear  he walked into the gaslit streets and looked up and down  the mysterious stranger had vanished  there was not a soul in sight he clutched the rough stone wall with his hands he kicked the pavement with his heels  there was no doubt about iteverything around him was real  most real of all was the fact that within a few feet of him lay a murdered man and that in his hands was that brown leather pocketbook with its miraculous contents  for the last time laverick retraced his steps and bent over that huddledup shape  one by one he went through the other pockets  there was a packet of russian cigarettes an empty cardcase of chased silver and obviously of foreign workmanship a cigarette holder stained with much use but of the finest amber with rich gold mountings there was nothing else upon the dead man no means of identification of any sort  laverick stood up giddy half terrified with the thoughts that went tearing through his brain  the pocketbook began to burn his hand he felt the perspiration breaking out anew upon his forehead  yet he never hesitated  he walked like a man in a dream but his footsteps were steady and short  deliberately and without any sign of hurry he made his way towards his offices  if a policeman had come in sight up or down the street he had decided to call him and to acquaint him with what had happened  it was the one chance he held against himselfthe gamblers method of decision perhaps unconsciously arrived at  as it turned out there was still not a soul in sight  laverick opened the outer door with his latchkey let himself in and closed it  then he groped his way through the clerks office into his own room switched on the electric light and once more sat down before his desk  he drew his shaded writing lamp towards him and looked around with a nervousness wholly unfamiliar  then he opened the pocketbook drew out the roll of banknotes and counted them  it was curious that he felt no surprise at their value  banknotes for five hundred pounds are not exactly common and yet he proceeded with his task without the slightest instinct of surprise  then he leaned back in his chair  twenty thousand pounds in bank of england notes there they lay on the table before him  a man had died for their sakeanother must go through all the days with the price of blood upon his heada murderera haunted creature for the rest of his life  and there on the table were the spoils  laverick tried to think the matter out dispassionately  he was a man of average moral fibrethat is to say he was honest in his dealings with other men because his father and his grandfather before him had been honest and because the penalty for dishonesty was shameful  here however he was face to face with an altogether unusual problem these notes belonged without a doubt to the dead man  save for his own interference they would have been in the hands of his murderer  the use of them for a few days could do no one any harm such risk as there was he took himself  that it was a risk he knew and fully realized  laverick had sat in his place unmoved when his partner had poured out his wail of fear and misery  yet of the two men it was probable that laverick himself had felt their position the more keenly  he was a man of some social standing with a large circle of friends a sportsman and with many interests outside the daily routine of his city life  to him failure meant more than the loss of money it would rob him of everything in life worth having  the days to come had been emptied of all promise he had held himself stubbornly because he was a man because he had strength enough to refuse to let his mind dwell upon the indignities and humiliation to come  and here before him was possible salvation there was a price to be paid of course a risk to be run in making use even for an hour of this money  yet from the first he had known that he meant to do it  quite cool now he opened his private safe thrust the pocketbook into one of the drawers and locked it up  then he lit a cigarette finally shut up the office and walked down the street  as he passed the entry he turned his head slowly  apparently no one had been there nothing had been disturbed  straining his eyes through the darkness he could even see that dark shape still lying huddled up on the ground  then he walked on  he had burned his boats now and was prepared for all emergencies  at the corner he met a policeman to whom he wished a cheery goodnight  he told himself that the thing which he had done was for the best he owed it to himself he owed it to those who had trusted him  after all it was the chief part of his lifehis city career  it was here that his friends lived  it was here that his ambitions flourished  disgrace here was eternal disgrace  his father and his grandfather before him had been men honored and respected in this same circle  disgrace to him such disgrace as that with which he had stood face to face a few hours ago would have been in a certain sense a reflection upon their memories  the names upon the brass plates to right and to left of him were the names of men he knew men with whom he desired to stand well whose friendship or contempt made life worth living or the reverse  it was worth a great riskthis effort of his to keep his place  his one mistakethis association with morrisonhad been such an unparalleled stroke of bad luck  he was rid of the fellow now  for the future there should be no more partners  he had his life to live  it was not reasonable that he should allow himself to be dragged down into the mire by such a creature  he found an empty taxicab at the corner of queen victoria street and hailed it  whitehall court he told the driver     chapter x  bellamy is outwitted   bellamy was a man used to all hazards whose supreme effort of life it was to meet success and disaster with unvarying mien  but this was disaster too appalling even for his selfcontrol  he felt his knees shake so that he caught at the edge of the table before which he was standing  there was no possible doubt about it he had been tricked  von behrling after allvon behrling whom he had looked upon merely as a stupid infatuated austrian ready to sell his country for the sake of a woman had fooled him utterly  the man who sat at the head of the tablethe only other occupant of the roomwas in court dress with many orders upon his coat he had just been attending a court function from which bellamys message had summoned him  before him on the table was an envelope hastily torn open and several sheets of blank paper  it was upon these that bellamys eyes were fixed with an expression of mingled horror and amazement  the cabinet minister had already pushed them away with a little gesture of contempt  bellamy he said gravely it is not like you to make so serious an error  i hope not sir bellamy answered  iyes i have been deceived  the minister glanced at the clock  what is to be done he asked  bellamy with an effort pulled himself together  he caught up the envelope looked once more inside held up the blank sheets of paper to the lamp and laid them down  then with clenched fists he walked to the other side of the room and returned  he was himself again  sir james i will not waste your time by saying that i am sorry only an hour ago i met von behrling in a little restaurant in the city and gave him twenty thousand pounds for that envelope  you paid him the money the minister remarked slowly without opening the envelope  bellamy admitted it  in such transactions as these he declared great risks are almost inevitable  i took what must seem to you now to be an absurd risk  to tell you the honest truth sir and i have had experience in these things i thought it no risk at all when i handed over the money  von behrling was there in disguise  the men with whom he came to this country are furious with him  to all appearance he seemed to have broken with them absolutely  even now  well  even now bellamy said slowly with his eyes fixed upon the wall of the room and a dawning light growing stronger every moment in his face even now i believe that von behrling made a mistake  an envelope such as this had been arranged for him to show the others or leave at the austrian embassy in case of emergency  he had it with him in his pocketbook  he even told me so  god in heaven he gave me the wrong one  the minister glanced once more at the clock  in that case he said perhaps he would not go to the embassy tonight especially if he was in disguise  you may still be able to find him and repair the error  i will try answered bellamy  thank heaven he added with a sudden gleam of satisfaction my watchers are still dogging his footsteps  i can find out before morning where he went when he left our rendezvous  there is another way too  mademoisellethis man von behrling believed that she was leaving the country with him  she was to have had a message within the next few hours  the minister nodded thoughtfully  bellamy i have been your friend and you have done us good service often  the secret service estimates as you know are above supervision but twenty thousand pounds is a great deal of money to have paid for this  he touched the sheets of blank paper with his forefinger  bellamys teeth were clenched  the money shall be returned sir  do not misunderstand me sir james went on speaking a little more kindly  the money after all in comparison with what it was destined to purchase is nothing  we might even count it a fair risk if it was lost  it shall not be lost bellamy promised  if von behrling has played the traitor to us then he will go back to his country  in that case i will have the money from him without a doubt  if on the other hand he was honest to us and a traitor to his country as i firmly believe it may not yet be too late  let us hope not sir james declared  bellamy he continued a note of agitation trembling in his tone i need not tell you i am sure how important this matter is  you work like a mole in the dark yet you have brainsyou understand  let me tell you how things are with us  a certain amount of confidence is due to you if to any one  i may tell you that at the cabinet council today a very serious tone prevailed  we do not understand in the least the attitude of several of the european powers  it can be understood only under certain assumptions  a note of ours sent through the ambassador to vienna has remained unanswered for two days  the german ambassador has left unexpectedly for berlin on urgent business  we have just heard too that a secret mission from russia left st petersburg last night for paris  side by side with all this sir james continued the czar is trying to evade his promised visit here  the note we have received speaks of his health  well we know all about that  we know i may tell you that his health has never been better than at the present moment  it all means one thing and one thing only bellamy affirmed  in vienna and berlin today they look at an englishman and smile  even the man in the street seems to know what is coming  sir james leaned a little back in his seat  his hands were tightly clenched and there was a fierce light in his hollow eyes  those who were intimate with him knew that he had aged many years during the last few weeks  the cruel part is he said softly that it should have come in my administration when for ten years i have prayed from the opposition benches for the one thing which would have made us safe today  an army murmured bellamy  the days are coming sir james continued when those who prated of militarism and the security of our island walls will see with their own eyes the ruin they have brought upon us  secretly we are mobilizing all that we have to mobilize he added with a little sigh  at the very best however our position is pitiful  even if we are prepared to defend i am afraid that we shall see things on the continent in which we shall be driven to interfere or else suffer the greatest blow which our prestige has ever known  if we could only tell what was coming he wound up looking once more at those empty sheets of paper  it is this darkness which is so alarming  bellamy turned toward the door  you have the telephone in your bedroom sir he asked  yes ring me up at any time in the night or morning if you have news  bellamy drove at once to dover street  it was halfpast one but he had no fear of not being admitted  louises french maid answered the bell  madame has not retired bellamy inquired  but no sir the woman assured him with a welcoming smile  it is only a few minutes ago that she has returned  bellamy was ushered at once into her room  she was gorgeous in blue satin and pearls  her other maid was taking off her jewels  she dismissed both the women abruptly  i absolutely couldnt avoid a supperparty she said holding out her hands  you expected that of course  you were not at the opera house  he shook his head and walking to the door tried the handle  it was securely closed  he came back slowly to her side  her eyes were questioning him fiercely  well she exclaimed  well  have you heard from von behrling  no she answered  he knew that i must sing tonight  i have been expecting him to telephone every moment since i got home  you have seen him  i have seen him bellamy admitted  either he has deceived us both or the most unfortunate mistake in the world has happened listen  i met him where he appointed  he was there disguised almost unrecognizable  he was nervous and desperate he had the air of a man who has cut himself adrift from the world  i gave him the moneytwenty thousand pounds in bank of england notes louiseand he gave me the papers or what we thought were the papers he told me that he was keeping a false duplicate upon him for a little time in case he was seized but that he was going to liverpool street station to wait and would telephone you from the hotel there later on  you have not heard yet then  she shook her head  there has been no message but go on  he gave me the wrong documentthe wrong envelope continued bellamy  when i took it toto downing street it was full of blank paper  the color slowly left her cheeks  she looked at him with horror in her face  do you think that he meant to do it she exclaimed  we cannot tell bellamy answered  my own impression is that he did not  we must find out at once what has become of him  he might even if he fancies himself safe destroy the envelope he has believing it to be the duplicate  he is sure to telephone you  the moment you hear you must let me know  you had better stay here she declared  there are plenty of rooms  you will be on the spot then  bellamy shook his head  the joke of it is that i too am being watched whereever i go that fellow streuss has spies everywhere  that is one reason why i believe that von behrling was serious  oh he was serious louise repeated  you are sure bellamy asked  you have never had even any doubt about him  never she answered firmly  david i had not meant to tell you this  you know that i saw him for a moment this morning  he was in deadly earnest  he gave me a ringa triflebut it had belonged to his mother  he would not have done this if he had been playing us false  bellamy sprang to his feet  you are right louise he exclaimed  i shall go back to my rooms at once  fortunately i had a man shadowing von behrling and there may be a report for me  if anything comes here you will telephone at once  of course she assented  you do not think it possible he asked slowly that he would attempt to see you here  louise shuddered for a moment  i absolutely forbade it so i am sure there is no chance of that  very well then he decided we will wait  dear he added in an altered tone how splendid you look  her face suddenly softened  ah david she murmured to hear you speak naturally even for a momentit makes everything seem so different  he held out his arms and she came to him with a little sigh of satisfaction  louise he said some day the time may come when we shall be able to give up this life of anxiety and terrors  but it cannot be yetnot for your countrys sake or mine  she kissed him fondly  so long as there is hope she whispered     chapter xi  von behrlings fate   it seemed to louise that she had scarcely been in bed an hour when the more confidential of her maidsannette the frenchwomanwoke her with a light touch of the arm  she sat up in bed sleepily  what is it annette she asked  surely it is not midday yet why do you disturb me  it is barely nine oclock mademoiselle but monsieur bellamymademoiselle told me that she wished to receive him whenever he came  he is in the boudoir now and very impatient  did he send any message  only that his business was of the most urgent the maid replied  louise sighedshe was really very sleepy  then as the thoughts began to crowd into her brain she began also to remember  some part of the excitement of a few hours ago returned  my bath annette and a dressinggown she ordered  tell monsieur bellamy that i hurry  i will be with him in twenty minutes  to bellamy the twenty minutes were minutes of purgatory  she came at last however fresh and eager her hair tied up with ribbon she herself clad in a pink dressinggown and pink slippers  david she criedmy dear david  then she broke off  what is it she asked in a different tone  he showed her the headlines of the newspaper he was carrying  tragedy he answered hoarsely  von behrling was true after allat least it seems so  what has happened she demanded  bellamy pointed once more to the newspaper  he was murdered last night within fifty yards of the place of our rendezvous  a little exclamation broke from louises lips  she sat down suddenly  the color called into her cheeks by the exercise of her bath was rapidly fading away  david she murmured is this true  it is indeed bellamy assured her  not only that but there is no mention of his pocketbook in the account of his murder  it must have been engineered by streuss and the others and they have got away with the pocketbook and the money  what can we do she asked  there is nothing to be done bellamy declared calmly  we are defeated  the thing is quite apparent  von behrling never succeeded after all in shaking off the espionage of the men who were watching him  they tracked him to our rendezvous they waited about while i met him  afterwards he had to pass along a narrow passage  it was there that he was found murdered  but david i dont understand  why did they wait until after he had seen you  how did they know that he had not parted with the paper in the restaurant  to all intents and purposes he ought to have done so  i cannot understand that myself bellamy admitted  in fact it is inexplicable  she took up the newspaper and glanced at the report  then you are sure i suppose that this does refer to von behrling  he is quite unidentified you see  there is no doubt about it bellamy declared  i have been to the mortuary  it is certainly he  all our work has been in vainjust as i thought too that we had made a splendid success of it  she looked at him compassionately  it is hard lines dear she admitted  you are tired too  you look as though you had been up all night  yes i am tired he answered sinking into a chair  i am worse than tired  this has been the grossest failure of my career and i am afraid that it is the end of everything  i have lost twenty thousand pounds of secret service money i have lost the one chance which might have saved england  they will never trust me again  you did your best she said coming over and sitting on the arm of his chair  you did your best david  she laid her hands upon his forehead her cheek against hissmooth and coldexquisitely refreshing it seemed to his jaded nerves  ah louise he murmured life is getting a little too strenuous perhaps we have given too much of it up to others  what do you think  she shook her head  dear i have felt like that sometimes yet what can we do  could we be happy you and i in exile if the things which we dread were coming to pass  could i go away and hide while my countrymen were being butchered out of existence  and youyou are not the sort of man to be content with an ignoble peace  no it isnt possible our work may not be over yet  there was a knock at the door and annette entered with many apologies  mademoiselle she explained a thousand pardons and to monsieur also but there is a gentleman here who says that his business is of the most urgent importance and that he must see you at once  i have done all that i can but he will not go away  he knows that monsieur bellamy is here too she added turning to him and he says his business has to do with monsieur as well as mademoiselle  bellamy almost snatched the card from the girls fingers  he read out the name in blank amazement  baron de streuss  there was a moments silence  louise and he exchanged wondering glances  what can this mean she asked hoarsely  heaven knows he answered  let us see him together  after allafter all  you can show the gentleman in annette her mistress ordered  if he has the papers bellamy continued slowly why does he come to us  it is not like these men to be vindictive  diplomacy to them is nothinga game of chess  i do not understand  the door opened  annette announced their visitor  streuss bowed low to louisehe bowed also to bellamy  i need not introduce myself he said  with mr bellamy i have the honor to be well acquainted  madame is known to all the world  louise nodded somewhat coldly  we can dispense with an introduction i think monsieur le baron she said  at the same time you will perhaps explain to what i owe this somewhat unexpected pleasure  mademoiselle an explanation there must certainly be  i know that it is an impossible hour  i know too that to have forced my presence upon you in this manner may seem discourteous  yet the urgency of the matter i am convinced justifies me  louise motioned him to a chair but he declined with a little bow of thanks  mademoiselle he said and you mr bellamy we need not waste words  we have played a game of chess together  you mademoiselle and mr bellamy on the one sidei and my friends upon the other the honor of rudolph von behrling was the pawn for which we fought the victory remains with you  bellamy never moved a muscle  louise on the contrary could not help a slight start  under the circumstances the baron continued smoothly the struggle was uneven  i do myself the justice to remember that from the first i realized that we played a losing game  mademoiselle he added from the days of cleopatraay and throughout those shadowy days which lie beyondthe diplomats of the world have been powerless when matched against your sex  rudolph von behrling was an honest fellow enough until he looked into your eyes  mademoiselle you have gifts which might perhaps have driven from his senses a stronger man  louise smiled but there was no suggestion of mirth in the curl of her lips  her eyes all the time sought his questioningly  she did not understand  you flatter me baron she murmured  no i do not flatter you i speak the truth  this plain talking is pleasant enough when the time comes that one may indulge in it that time i think is now  rudolph von behrling against my advice but because he was the chancellors nephew was associated with me in a certain enterprise the nature of which is no secret to you mademoiselle or to mr bellamy here  we followed a man who by some strange chance was in possession of a few sheets of foolscap the contents of which were alike priceless to my country and priceless to yours  the subsequent history of those papers should have been automatic  the first step was fulfilled readily enough the man disappearedthe papers were ours  von behrling was the man who secured them and von behrling it was who retained them if my advice had been followed i admit frankly that we should have ignored all possible comment and returned with them at once to vienna  the others thought differently  they ruled that we should come on to london and deposit the packet with our ambassador here in a weak moment i consented  it was your opportunity mademoiselle an opportunity of which you have splendidly availed yourself  this time louise held herself with composure  bellamys brain was in a whirl but he remained silent  i come to you both the baron continued with my hands open  i comei make no secret of iti come to make terms  but first of all i must know whether i am in time  there is one question which i must ask  i address it sir to you he added turning to bellamy  have you yet placed in the hands of your government the papers which you obtained from von behrling  bellamy shook his head  the baron drew a long breath of relief  though he had maintained his savoir faire perfectly the fingers which for a moment played with his tie as though to rearrange it were trembling  well then i am in time  will you see my hand  mademoiselle and i answered bellamy are at least ready to listen to anything you may have to say  you know quite well the baron continued what it is that i have come to say yet i want you to remember this  i do not come to bribe you in any ordinary manner  the things which are to come will happen they must happen if not this year nextif not next year within half a decade of years  history is an absolute science  the future as well as the past can be read by those who know the signs the thing which has been resolved upon is certain  the knowledge of the contents of those papers by your government might delay the final catastrophe for a short while it could do no more  in the long run it would be better for your country mr bellamy in every way that the end come soon  therefore i ask you to perform no traitorous deed  i ask you to do that which is simply reasonable for all of us which is indeed for the advantage of all of us restore those papers to me instead of handing them to your government and i will pay you for them the sum of one hundred thousand pounds  one hundred thousand pounds bellamy repeated  one hundred thousand pounds murmured louise  there was a brief intense pause  louise waited warned by the expression in bellamys face  silence she felt was safest and it was bellamy who spoke  baron said he your visit and your proposal are both a little amazing  forgive me if i speak alone with mademoiselle for a moment  most certainly the baron agreed  i go away and leave youout of the room if you will  it is not necessary bellamy replied  louise  the baron withdrew to the window and bellamy led louise into the furthest corner of the room  what can it mean he whispered  what do you suppose has happened  i cannot imagine  my brain is in a whirl  if they have not got the pocketbook bellamy muttered it must have gone with von behrling to the mortuary  if so there is a chance  louise say nothing leave this to me  as you will she assented  i have no wish to interfere  i only hope that he does not ask me any questions  they came once more into the middle of the room and the baron turned to meet them  you must forgive mademoiselle said bellamy if she is a little upset this morning  she knows of course as i know and you know that von behrling was playing a desperate game and that he carried his life in his hands  yet his death has been a shockhas been a shock i may say to both of us  from your point of view bellamy went on it was doubtless deserved but  what in gods name is this that you say the baron interrupted i do not understand at all  you speak of von behrlings death what do you mean  bellamy looked at him as one who listens to strange words  baron he said between us who know so much there is surely no need for you to play a part  von behrling knew that you were watching him  your spies were shadowing him as they have done me he knew that he was running terrible risks  he was not unprepared and he has paid  it is not for us  now in gods name tell me the truth baron de streuss interrupted once more  what is it that you are saying about von behrlings death  bellamy drew a little breath between his teeth  he leaned forward with his hands resting upon the table  do you mean to say that you do not know  upon my soul no replied the baron  bellamy threw open the newspaper before him  von behrling was murdered last night ten minutes after our interview     chapter xii  baron de streuss proposal   the baron adjusted his eyeglass with shaking fingers  his face now was waxenwhite as he spread out the newspaper upon the table and read the paragraph word by word                       terrible crime in the city          early this morning the body of a man was discovered         in a narrow passageway leading from crooked friars to         royal street under circumstances which leave little         doubt but that the mans death was owing to foul play         the deceased had apparently been stabbed and had         received several severe blows about the head  he was         shabbily dressed but was well supplied with money and         he was wearing a gold watch and chain when he was found                              later          there appears to be no further doubt but that the man         found in the entry leading from crooked friars had been         the victim of a particularly murderous assault  neither         his clothes nor his linen bore any mark by means of which         he could be identified  the body has been removed to the         nearest mortuary and an inquest will shortly be held  streuss looked up from the newspaper and the reality of his surprise was apparent  he had all the appearance of a man shaken with emotion while he looked at his two companions wonderingly strange thoughts were forming in his mind  von behrling dead he muttered  but whowho could have done this  until this moment bellamy answered dryly it was not a matter concerning which we had any doubt  the only wonder to us was that it should have been done too late  you mean streuss said slowly that he was murdered after he had completed his bargain with you  naturally  i suppose the baron continued there is no question but that it was done afterwards  you smile he exclaimed but what am i to think  neither i nor my people had any hand in this deed  how about yours  bellamy shook his head  we do not fight that way he replied  i had bought von behrling he was of no further interest to me  i did not care whether he lived or died  there is something very strange about this the baron said  if neither you nor i were responsible for his death who was  that i cant tell you  perhaps later in the day we shall hear from the police  it is scarcely the sort of murder which would remain long undetected especially as he was robbed of a large sum in banknotes  supplied by his majestys government i presume streuss remarked  precisely bellamy assented and paid to him by me  at any rate streuss said grimly we have now no more secrets from one another  i will ask you one last question  where is that packet at the present moment  bellamy raised his eyebrows  it is a question he declared which you could scarcely expect me to answer  i will put it another way streuss continued  supposing you decide to accept my offer how long will it be before the packet can be placed in my hands  if we decide to accept bellamy answered there is no reason why there should be any delay at all  streuss was silent for several moments  his hands were thrust deep down into the pockets of his overcoat  with eyes fixed upon the tablecloth he seemed to be thinking deeply till presently he raised his head and looked steadily at bellamy  you are sure that von behrling has not fooled you  you are sure that you have that identical packet  i am absolutely certain that i have bellamy answered without flinching  then accept my price and have done with this matter streuss begged  i will sign a draft for you here and i will undertake to bring you the money or honor it wherever you say within twentyfour hours  i cannot decide so quickly said bellamy shaking his head mademoiselle idiale and i must talk together first i am not sure he added whether i might not find a higher bidder  streuss laughed mirthlessly  there is little fear of that he said  the papers are of no use except to us and to england  to england i will admit that the foreknowledge of what is to come would be worth much although the eventful result would be the same  it is for that reason that i am here for that reason that i have made you this offer  mademoiselle and i must discuss it bellamy declared  it is not a matter to be decided upon offhand  remember that it is not only the packet which you are offering to buy but also my career and my honor  one hundred thousand pounds streuss said slowly  from your own side you get nothingnothing but your beggarly salary and an occasional reprimand  one hundred thousand pounds is not immense wealth but it is something  your offer is a generous one admitted bellamy there is no doubt about that  on the other hand i cannot decide without further consideration  it is a big thing for us remember  i have worked very hard for the contents of that packet  once more streuss felt an uneasy pang of incredulity  after all was this englishman playing with him  so he asked you are quite sure that you have it  there is no means of convincing you of which i care to make use you must be content with my word  i have the packet  i paid von behrling for it and he gave it to me with his own hands  i must accept your word streuss declared  i give you three days for reflection  before i go mr bellamy forgive me if i refer once more to thistouching the newspaper which still lay upon the table  remember that rudolph von behrling moved about a marked man  your spies and mine were most of the time upon his heels  yet in the end some third person seems to have intervened  are you quite sure that you know nothing of this  upon my honor bellamy replied i have not the slightest information concerning von behrlings death beyond what you can read there  it was as great a surprise to me as to you  it is incomprehensible streuss murmured  one can only conclude bellamy remarked thoughtfully that someone must have seen him with those notes  there were people moving about in the little restaurant where we met  the rustle of banknotes has cost more than one man his life  for the present streuss said we must believe that it was so listen to me both of you  you will be wiser if you do not delay you are young people and the world is before you  with money one can do everything  without it life is but a slavery  the world is full of beautiful dwellingplaces for those who have the means to choose  remember too that not a soul will ever know of this transaction if you should decide to accept my offer  we shall remember all those things bellamy assured him  streuss took up his hat and gloves  with your permission then mademoiselle he concluded turning to louise i go  i must try and understand for myself the meaning of this thing which has happened to von behrling  do not forget bellamy said that if you discover anything we are equally interested  they heard him go out  bellamy purposely held the door open until he saw the lift descend  then he closed it firmly and came back into the room  louise and he looked at each other their faces full of anxious questioning  what does it mean louise cried  what can it mean  heaven alone knows bellamy answered  there is not a gleam of daylight  my people are absolutely innocent of any attempt upon von behrling  if streuss tells the truth and i believe he does his people are in the same position  who then in the name of all that is miraculous can have murdered and robbed von behrling  in london too louise murmured  it is not vienna this or belgrade  you are right bellamy agreed  london is one of the most lawabiding cities in europe  besides the quarter where the murder occurred is entirely unfrequented by the criminal classes  it is simply a region of great banks and the offices of merchant princes  is it possible that there is some one else who knew about that document louise askedsome one else who has been watching von behrling  bellamy shook his head  how can that be  besides if any one else were really on his track they must have believed that he had parted with it to me  i shall go back now to downing street to ask for a letter to the chief of scotland yard  if anything comes out i must have plenty of warning  and i she said with an approving nod shall go back to bed again  these days are too strenuous for me  wont you stay and take your coffee with me  bellamy held her hand for a moment in his  dear he said i would stay but you understand dont you what a maze this is into which we have wandered  von behrling has been murdered by some person who seems to have dropped from the skies whoever they may be they have in their possession my twenty thousand pounds and the packet which should have been mine  i must trace them if i can louise  it is a poor chance but i must do my best i myself am of the opinion that von behrling was murdered for the money and for the money only  if so that packet may be in the hands of people who have no idea what use to make of it they may even destroy it  if streuss returns and you are forced to see him be careful  remember we have the documentwe are hesitating  so long as he believes that it is in our possession he will not look elsewhere  i will be careful louise promised with her arms around his neck and dear take care  when i think of poor rudolph von behrling i tremble also for you  it seems to me that your danger is no less than his  i do not go about with twenty thousand pounds in my pocketbook with a smile  she shook her head  no but streuss believes that you have the document which he is pledged to recover  be careful that they do not lead you into a trap  they are not above anything these men  i heard once of a bulgarian in vienna who was torturedtortured almost to deathbefore he spoke  then they thrust him into a lunatic asylum  remember dear they have no consciences and no pity  we are in london he reminded her  so was von behrling she answered quicklynot only in london but in a safe part of london  yet he is dead  it was not their doing he declared  in their own country they have the whole machinery of their wonderful police system at their backs and no fear of the law in their hearts  here they must needs go cautiously  i dont think you need be afraid he added smiling as he opened the door  i think i can promise you that if you will do me the honor we will sup together tonight  you must fetch me from the opera house louise insisted  it is a bargain  i have suffered enough neglect at your hands  one thing davidwhere do you go first from here  to find the man bellamy answered gravely who was watching von behrling when he left me  if any man in england knows anything of the murder it must be he  he should be at my rooms by now     chapter xiii  stephen lavericks conscience   stephen laverick was a bachelorhis friends called him an incorrigible one  he had a small but pleasantly situated suite of rooms in whitehall court looking out upon the river  his habits were almost monotonous in their regularity and the morning following his late night in the city was no exception to the general rule  at eight oclock the valet attached to the suite knocked at his door and informed him that his bath was ready  he awoke at once from a sound sleep sat up in bed and remembered the events of the preceding evening  at first he was inclined to doubt that slowly stirring effort of memory  he was a man of unromantic temperament unimaginative and by no means of an adventurous turn of mind  he sought naturally for the most reasonable explanation of this strange picture which no effort of his will could dismiss from his memory  it was a dream of course  but the dream did not fade  slowly it spread itself out so that he could no longer doubt  he knew very well as he sat there on the edge of his bed that the thing was truth  he stephen laverick a man hitherto of upright character with a reputation of which unconsciously he was proud had robbed a dead man had looked into the burning eyes of his murderer had stolen away with twenty thousand pounds of someone elses money  morally at any rateprobably legally as wellhe was a thief  a glimpse inside his safe on the part of an astute detective might very easily bring him under the grave suspicion of being a criminal of altogether deeper dye  stephen laverick was in his way something of a philosopher  in the cold daylight with the sound of the water running into his bath this deed which he had done seemed to him foolish and reprehensible nevertheless he realized the absolute finality of his action  the thing was done he must make the best of it  behaving in every way like a sensible man he did not send for the newspapers and search hysterically for their account of last nights tragedy but took his bath as usual dressed with more than ordinary care and sat down to his breakfast before he even unfolded the paper  the item for which he searched occupied by no means so prominent a position as he had expected  it appeared under one of the leading headlines but it consisted of only a few words  he read them with interest but without emotion  afterwards he turned to the stock exchange quotations and made notes of a few prices in which he was interested  he completed in leisurely fashion an excellent breakfast and followed his usual custom of walking along the embankment as far as the royal hotel where he called a taxicab and drove to his offices  a little crowd had gathered around the end of the passage which led from crooked friars and laverick himself leaned forward and looked curiously at the spot where the body of the murdered man had lain it seemed hard to him to reconstruct last nights scene in his mind now that the narrow street was filled with hurrying men and a stream of vehicles blocked every inch of the roadway  in his early morning mood the thing was impossible  in a moment or two he paid his driver and dismissed him  he fancied that a certain relief was visible among his clerks when he opened the door at precisely his usual time and with a cheerful goodmorning made his way into the private office  he lit his customary cigarette and dealt rapidly with the correspondence which was brought in to him by his headclerk  afterwards as soon as he was alone he opened the safe thrust the contents of that inner drawer into his breastpocket and took up once more his hat and gloves  i am going around to the bank he told his clerk as he passed out i shall be back in halfanhourperhaps less  very good sir the man answered  will mr morrison be here this morning  laverick hesitated  no mr morrison will not be here today  it was only a few steps to his bankers and his request for an interview with the manager was immediately granted  the latter received him kindly but with a certain restraint  there are not many secrets in the city and morrisons big plunge on a particular mining share notwithstanding its steady drop had been freely commented upon  what can i do for you mr laverick the banker asked  i am not sure answered laverick  to tell you the truth i am in a somewhat singular position  the banker nodded  he had not a doubt but that he understood exactly what that position was  you have perhaps heard laverick continued slowly that my late partner mr morrison  late partner the manager interrupted  laverick assented  we had a few words last night he explained and mr morrison left the office with an understanding between us that he should not return  you will receive a formal intimation of that during the course of the next day or so  we will revert to the matter presently if you wish  my immediate business with you is to discuss the fact that i have to provide something like twenty thousand pounds today if i decide to take up the purchases of stock which morrison has made  you understand the position of course mr laverick if you fail to do so the manager remarked gravely  naturally laverick answered  i am quite aware of the fact that morrison acted on behalf of the firm and that i am responsible for his transactions  he has plunged pretty deeply though a great deal more deeply than our capital warranted  i may add that i had not the slightest idea as to the extent of his dealings  the bank manager adopted a sympathetic but serious attitude  twenty thousand pounds he declared is a great deal of money mr laverick  it is a great deal of money laverick admitted  i am here to ask you to lend it to me  the bank manager raised his eyebrows  my dear mr laverick he exclaimed reproachfully  upon unimpeachable security laverick continued  the bank manager was conscious that he had allowed a little start of surprise to escape him and bit his lip with annoyance  it was entirely contrary to his tenets to display at any time during office hours any sort of emotion  unimpeachable security he repeated  of course if you have that to offer mr laverick although the sum is a large one it is our business to see what we can do for you  my security is of the best laverick declared grimly  i have banknotes here mr fenwick for twenty thousand pounds  the bank manager was again guilty of an unprofessional action  he whistled softly under his breath  a very respectable client he had always considered mr stephen laverick but he had certainly never suspected him of being able to produce at a pinch such evidence of means  laverick smoothed out the notes and laid them upon the table  mr fenwick he said i believe i am right in assuming that when one comes to ones bankers one enters as it were into a confessional  i feel convinced that nothing which i say to you will be repeated outside this office or will be allowed to dwell in your own mind except with reference to this particular transaction between you and me  i have the right have i not to take that for granted  most certainly the banker agreed  from a strictly ethical point of view laverick went on this money is not mine  i hold it in trust for its owner but i hold it without any conditions  i have power to make what use i wish of it and i choose today to use it on my own behalf  whether i am justified or not is scarcely a matter i presume which concerns this excellent banking establishment over which you preside so ably i do not pay these banknotes in to my account and ask you to credit me with twenty thousand pounds  i ask you to allow me to deposit them here for seven days as security against an overdraft you can then advance me enough money to meet my engagements of today  the banker took up the notes and looked them through one by one they were very crisp very new and absolutely genuine  this is somewhat an extraordinary proceeding mr laverick he said  i have no doubt that it must seem so to you laverick admitted at the same time there the money is  you can run no risk  if i am exceeding my moral right in making use of these notes it is i who will have to pay  will you do as i ask  the banker hesitated  the transaction was somewhat a peculiar one but on the face of it there could be no possible risk  at the same time there was something about it which he could not understand  your wish mr laverick he remarked looking at him thoughtfully seems to be to keep these notes out of circulation  laverick returned his gaze without flinching  in a sense that is so he assented  on the whole the banker declared i should prefer to credit them to your account in the usual way  i am sorry laverick answered but i have a sentimental feeling about it  i prefer to keep the notes intact  if you cannot follow out my suggestion i must remove my account at once  this isnt a threat mr fenwickyou will understand that i am sure  it is simply a matter of business and owing to morrisons speculations i have no time for arguments  i am quite satisfied to remain in your hands but my feeling in the matter is exactly as i have stated and i cannot change  if you are to retain my account my engagements for today must be met precisely in the way i have pointed out  the banker excused himself and left the room for a few moments when he returned he shrugged his shoulders with the air of one who is giving in to an unreasonable client  it shall be as you say mr laverick he announced  the notes are placed upon deposit  your engagements today up to twenty thousand pounds shall be duly honored  laverick shook hands with him talked for a moment or two about indifferent matters and strolled back towards his office  he had rather the sense of a man who moves in a dream who is living somehow in a life which doesnt belong to him  he was doing the impossible  he knew very well that his name was in every ones mouth  people were looking at him sympathetically wondering how he could have been such a fool as to become the victim of an irresponsible speculator  no one ever imagined that he would be able to keep his engagements  and he had done it  the price might be a great one but he was prepared to pay  at any moment the sensational news might be upon the placards and the whole world might know that the man who had been murdered in crooked friars last night had first been robbed of twenty thousand pounds so far he had felt himself curiously free from anything in the shape of direct apprehensions  already however the shadow was beginning to fall  even as he entered his office the sight of a stranger offering office files for sale made him start  he half expected to feel a hand upon his shoulder a few words whispered in his ear  he set his teeth tight  this was his risk and he must take it  for several hours he remained in his office engaged in a scheme for the redirection of its policy  with the absence of morrison too there were other changes to be madechanges in the nature of the business they were prepared to handle limits to be fixed it was not until nearly luncheon time that the telephone the simultaneous arrival of several clients and the breathless entry of his own headclerk rushing in from the house told him what was going on  unions have taken their turn at last the clerk announced in an excited tone  they sagged a little this morning but since eleven they have been going steadily up  just now there seems to be a boom  listen  laverick heard the roar of voices in the street and nodded  he was prepared to be surprised at nothing  they were bound to go within a day or two he remarked  morrison wasnt an absolute idiot  the luncheon hour passed  the excitement in the city grew  by three oclock ten thousand pounds would have covered all of lavericks engagements  just before closingtime it was even doubtful whether he might not have borrowed every penny without security at all  he took it all quite calmly and as a matter of course  he left the office a little earlier than usual and every man whom he met stopped to slap him on the back and chaff him  he escaped as soon as he could bought the evening papers found a taxicab and as soon as he had started spread them open  it was a remarkable proof of the mans selfrestraint that at no time during the afternoon had he sent out for one of these early editions he turned them over now with firm fingers  there was absolutely no fresh news  no one had come forward with any suggestion as to the identity of the murdered man  all day long the body had lain in the mortuary visited by a constant stream of the curious but presumably unrecognized  laverick could scarcely believe the words he read  the thing seemed ludicrously impossible  the twenty thousand pounds must have come from some one  why did they keep silence  what was the mystery about it  could it be that they were not in a position to disclose the fact  curiously enough this unnatural absence of news inspired him with something which was almost fear  he had taken his risks boldly enough  now that fate was playing him this unexpectedly good turn he was conscious of a growing nervousness  who could he have been this man  whence could he have derived this great sum  one person at least must know that he had been robbedthe man who murdered him must know it  a cold shiver passed through lavericks veins at the thought somewhere in london there must be a man thirsting for his blood a man who had committed a murder in vain and been robbed of his spoil  laverick had no engagements for that evening but instead of going to his club he drove straight to his rooms meaning to change a little early for dinner and go to a theatre lie found there however a small boy waiting for him with a note in his hand  it was addressed in pencil only and his name was printed upon it  laverick tore it open with a haste which he only imperfectly concealed  there was something ominous to him in those printed characters  its contents however were short enough  dear laverick i must see you  come the moment you get this  come without fail for your own sake and mine  a  m  laverick looked at the boy  his fingers were trembling but it was with relief  the note was from morrison  there is no address here he remarked  the gent said as i was to take you back with me the boy answered  is it far laverick asked  close to red lion square the boy declared  not more nor five minutes in one of them taxicabs  the gent said we was to take one  he is in a great hurry to see you  laverick did not hesitate a moment  very well he said well start at once  he put on his hat again and waited while the commissionaire called them a taxicab  what address he asked  number 7 theobald square the boy said  laverick nodded and repeated the address to the driver  what the dickens can morrison be doing in a part like that he thought as they passed up northumberland avenue     chapter xiv  arthur morrisons collapse   the square was a small one and in a particularly unsavory neighborhood  laverick who had once visited his partners somewhat extensive suite of rooms in jermyn street rang the bell doubtfully the door was opened almost at once not by a servant but by a young lady who was obviously expecting him  before he could open his lips to frame an inquiry she had closed the door behind him  will you please come this way she said timidly  laverick found himself in a small sittingroom unexpectedly neat and with the plainness of its furniture relieved by certain undeniable traces of some cultured presence  the girl who had followed him stood with her back to the door a little out of breath laverick contemplated her in surprise  she was under medium height with small pale face and wonderful dark eyes  her brown hair was parted in the middle and arranged low down so that at first taking into account her obvious nervousness he thought that she was a child  when she spoke however he knew that for some reason she was afraid  her voice was soft and low but it was the voice of a woman  it is mr laverick is it not she asked looking at him eagerly  my name is stephen laverick he admitted  i understood that i should find mr arthur morrison here  yes the girl answered he sent for you  the note was from him he is here  she made no movement to summon him  she still stood in fact with her back to the door  laverick was distinctly puzzled  he felt himself unable to place this timid childlike woman with her terrified face and beautiful eyes  he had never heard morrison speak of having any relations  his presence in such a locality indeed was hard to understand unless he had met with an accident morrison was one of those young men who would have chosen hell with a w rather than heaven e c  i am afraid laverick said that for some reason or other you are afraid of me  i can assure you that i am quite harmless he added smiling  wont you sit down and tell me what is the matter is mr morrison in any trouble  yes she answered he is  as for me i am terrified  she came a little away from the door  laverick was a man who inspired trust his tone too was unusually kind  he had the protective instinct of a big man toward a small woman  come and tell me all about it he suggested  i expected to hear that he had gone abroad  mr laverick she said looking up at him tremulously  i was hoping that you could have told me what it was that had come to him  well that rather depends laverick answered  we certainly had a terribly anxious time yesterday  our business has been most unfortunate  yes yes the girl interrupted  please go on  there have been business troubles then  rather laverick continued  last night they reached such a pitch that i gave morrison some money and it was agreed that he should leave the firm and try his luck somewhere else  i quite understood that he was going abroad  the girl seemed for some reason relieved  there was something then she said half to herself  there was something  oh i am glad of that  you were angry with him perhaps mr laverick  laverick stood with his back to the little fireplace and with his hands behind hima commanding figure in the tiny room full of feminine trifles  he looked a great deal more at his ease than he really was  perhaps i was inclined to be shorttempered he admitted  you see to be frank with you the department of our business that was going wrong was the one over which morrison has had sole control he had entered into certain speculations which i considered unjustifiable  today however matters took an unexpected turn for the better  almost as he spoke his face clouded  morrison of course would be triumphant  perhaps he would even expect to be reinstated  for many reasons this was a thing which laverick did not desire  now tell me he continued what is the matter with morrison and why has he sent for me and if you will pardon my saying so why is he here instead of in his own rooms  i will explain she began softly  you will please explain sitting down he said firmly  and dont look so terrified he added with a little laugh  i can assure you that i am not going to eat you or anything of that sort  you make me feel quite uncomfortable  she smiled for the first time and laverick thought that he had never seen anything so wonderful as the change in her features  the strained rigidity passed away  an altogether softer light gleamed in her wonderful eyes  she was certainly by far the prettiest child he had ever seen  as yet he could not take her altogether seriously  thank you she said sinking down upon the arm of an easychair first of all then arthur is here because he is my brother  your brother laverick repeated wonderingly  somehow or other he had never associated morrison with relations besides this meant that she must be of his race  there was nothing in her face to denote it except the darkness of her eyes and that nameless charm of manner a sort of ultrasensitiveness which belongs sometimes to the highest type of jews  it was not a quality laverick thought which he should have associated with morrisons sister  my brother in a way she resumed  arthurs father was a widower and my mother was a widow when they were married  you are surprised  there is no reason why i should be he answered curiously relieved at her last statement  your brother and i have been connected in business for some years  we have seen very little of one another outside  i dare say she continued still timidly that arthurs friends would not be your friends and that he wouldnt care for the same sort of things  you see my mother is dead and also his father and as we arent really related at all i cannot expect that he would come to see me very often  last night though quite latelong after i had gone to bedhe rang the bell here  i was frightened for just now i am all alone and my servant only comes in the morning  so i looked out of the window and i saw him on the pavement huddled up against the door  i hurried down and let him in  mr laverick she went on with an appealing glance at him i have never seen any one look like it  he was terrified to death something seemed to have happened which had taken away from him even the power of speech  he pushed past me into this room threw himself into that chair she added pointing across the room and he sobbed and beat his hands upon his knees as though he were a woman in a fit of hysterics  his clothes were all untidy he was as pale as death and his eyes looked as though they were ready to start out of his head  you must indeed have been frightened laverick said softly  frightened  i shall never forget it  i did not sleep all night he would tell me nothinghe has scarcely spoken a sensible word early this morning i persuaded him to go upstairs and made him lie down  he has taken two draughts which i bought from the chemist but he has not slept  every now and then he tries to get up but in a minute or two he throws himself down on the bed again and hides his face  if any one rings at the bell he shrieks  if he hears a footfall in the street even he calls out for me  mr laverick i have never been so frightened in my life  i didnt know whom to send for or what to do  when he wrote that note to you i was so relieved  you cant imagine how glad i am to think you have come  lavericks eyes were full of sympathy  one could see that the scene of last night had risen up again before her eyes  she was shrinking back and the terror was upon her once more  he moved over to her side and with an impulse which when he thought of it afterwards amazed him laid his hand gently upon her shoulder  dont worry yourself thinking about it he said  i will talk to your brother  we did have words ill admit last night but there wasnt the slightest reason why it should have upset him in this way  things in the city were shocking yesterday but they have improved a great deal today  let me go upstairs and ill try and pump some courage into him  you are so kind she murmured suddenly dropping her hands from before her face and looking up at him with shining eyes so very kind  will you come then  she rose and he followed her out of the room up the stairs and into a tiny bedroom  laverick had no time to look around but it seemed to him notwithstanding the cheap white furniture and very ordinary appointments that the same note of dainty femininity pervaded this little apartment as the one below  it is my room she said shyly  there is no other properly furnished and i thought that he might sleep upon the bed  perhaps he is asleep now laverick whispered  even as he spoke the dark figure stretched upon the sheets sprang into a sitting posture  laverick was conscious of a distinct shock it was morrison still wearing the clothes in which he had left the office his collar crushed out of all shape his tie vanished  his black hair usually so shiny and perfectly arranged was all disordered  out of his staring eyes flashed an expression which one sees seldom in lifean expression of real and mortal terror  who is it he cried out and even his voice was unrecognizable who is that  what do you want  it is ilaverick laverick answered  what on earth is the matter with you man  morrison drew a quick breath  some part of the terror seemed to leave his face but he was still an alarminglooking object laverick quietly opened the door and laid his hand upon the girls shoulder  will you leave us alone he asked  i will come and talk to you afterwards if i may  she nodded understandingly and passed out  laverick closed the door and came up to the bedside  what in the name of thunder has come over you morrison he said are you ill or what is it  morrison opened his lipsopened them twicewithout any sort of sound issuing  this is absurd laverick exclaimed protestingly  i have been feeling worried myself but theres nothing so terrifying in losing ones money after all  as a matter of fact things are altogether better in the city today  you made a big mistake in taking us out of our depth but we are going to pull through after all  unions have been going up all day  lavericks presence and the sound of his even matteroffact tone seemed to act like a tonic upon his late partner  he made no reference however to lavericks words  you got my note he asked hoarsely  naturally i got it laverick answered impatiently and i came at once  try and pull yourself together  sit up and tell me what you are doing here frightening your sister out of her life  morrison groaned  i came here he muttered because i dared not go to my own rooms i was afraid  laverick struggled with the contempt he felt  man alive he exclaimed what was there to be afraid of  you dont know morrison faltered  you dont know  then for the first time it occurred to laverick that perhaps the financial crisis in their affairs was not the only thing which had reduced his late partner to this hopeless state  he looked at him narrowly  where did you go last night he asked when you left me  nowhere morrison gasped  i came here  laverick made a space for himself at the end of the bed and sat down  look here he said its no use sending for me unless you mean to tell me everything  have you been getting yourself into any trouble apart from our affairs or is there anything in connection with them which i dont know  again morrison opened his lips and again for some reason or other he remained speechless  then a certain fear came also upon laverick there was something in morrisons state which was in itself terrifying  you had better tell me all about it laverick persisted whatever it is  i will help you if i can  morrison shook his head  there was a glass of water by his side he thrust his finger into it and passed it across his lips  they were dry almost cracking  look here he said ive got a breakdownthats whats the matter with me  my nerves were never good  im afraid of going mad  the anxiety of the last few weeks has been too much for me i want to get out of the country quickly and i dont know how to manage it  i cant think  directly i try to think my head goes round  there is nothing in the world to prevent your going away laverick answered  it is the simplest matter possible  even if we had gone under today no one could have stopped your going wherever you chose to go  ruin even if it had been ruinand i told you just now that business was betteris not a crime  pull yourself together for heavens sake man  you should be ashamed to come here and frighten that poor little girl downstairs almost to death  morrison gripped his partners arm  you must do as i ask he declared hoarsely  it doesnt matter about prices being better  i want to get away  you must help me  laverick looked at him steadily  morrison was an ordinary young man of his type something of a swaggerer probably at heart a coward  but this was no ordinary fearnot even the ordinary fear of a coward  lavericks face became graver  there was something else then  i will get you out of the country if i can said he  there is no difficulty about it at all unless you are concealing something from me  you can catch a fast steamer tomorrow either for south africa or new york but before i make any definite plans hadnt you better tell me exactly what happened last night  once more morrisons lips parted without the ability to frame words then a feeble moan escaped him  he threw up his hands and his head fell back  the ghastliness of his face spread almost to his lips and he sank back among the pillows  laverick strode across the room to the door  are you anywhere about he called out  the girl was by his side in a moment  there is nothing to be alarmed at he said but your brother has fainted  bring me some sal volatile if you have it and i think that you had better run out and get a doctor  i will stay with him i know exactly what to do  she pointed to the dressingtable where a little bottle was standing and ran downstairs without a word  laverick mixed some of the spirit and moved over to the side of the fainting man     chapter xv  lavericks partner flees   the doctor a grave incurious person arrived within a few minutes to find morrison already conscious but absolutely exhausted  he felt his patients pulse prescribed a draught and followed laverick down into the sitting room  an ordinary case of nervous exhaustion he pronounced  the patient appears to have had a very severe shock lately  he will be all right with proper diet and treatment and a complete rest i will call again tomorrow  he accepted the fee which laverick slipped into his hand and took his departure  once more laverick was alone with the girl who had followed them downstairs   there is nothing to be alarmed at you see he remarked  it is not his health which frightens me  i am surei am quite sure that he has something upon his mind  did he tell you nothing  nothing at all laverick answered with an inward sense of thankfulness  to tell you the truth though i am afraid you are right and that he did get into some sort of trouble last night  he was just about to tell me something when he fainted  upstairs they could hear him moaning  the girl listened with pitiful face  what am i to do she asked  i cannot leave him like this and if i am not at the theatre in twenty minutes i shall be fined  the theatre laverick repeated  she nodded  i am on the stage she saidonly a chorus girl at the universal worse luck  still they dont allow us to stay away and i cant afford to lose my place  do you mean to say that you have been keeping yourself here then laverick asked bluntly  of course she answered  i do not like to be a burden on any one and after all you see arthur and i are really not related at all  he has always told me too that times have been so bad lately  laverick was on the point of telling her that bad though they had been arthur morrison had never drawn less than fifteen hundred a year but he checked himself  it was not his business to interfere  i think he said that your brother ought to have provided for you  he could have done so with very little effort  but what am i to do now she asked him  if i am absent i shall lose my place  laverick thought for a moment  if you went round there and told them he suggested would that make any difference  i could stay until you came back  do you mind she asked eagerly  it would be so kind of you  not at all he answered  perhaps you would be good enough to bring a taxicab back and i could take it on to my rooms  take one from here if you can find it  there are always some at the corner  id love to she answered  i must run upstairs and get my hat and coat  he watched her go up on tiptoe for fear of disturbing her brother her feet seemed almost unearthly in the lightness of their pressure not a board creaked  she seemed to float down to him in a most becoming little hat but a shockingly shabby jacket of whose deficiencies she seemed wholly unaware  her lips were parted once more in a smile  he is fast asleep and breathing quite regularly she announced it is nice of you to stay  he looked at her almost jealously  do you know he said you ought not to go about alone  she laughed softly but heartily  have you any idea how old i am  i took you for fourteen when i came inside he answered afterwards i thought you might be sixteen  later on it seemed to me possible that you were eighteen  i am absolutely certain that you are not more than nineteen  that shows how little you know about it  i am twenty and i am quite used to going about alone  will you sit upstairs or here i am so sorry that i have nothing to offer you  thanks i need nothing  i think i will sit upstairs in case he wakes  she nodded and stole out closing the door behind her noiselessly laverick watched her from the window until she was out of sight moving without any appearance of haste yet with an incredible swiftness  when she had turned the corner he went slowly upstairs and into the room where morrison still lay asleep  he drew a chair to the bedside and leaning forward opened out the evening paper  the events of the last hour or so had completely blotted out from his mind for the time being his own expedition into the world of tragical happenings  he glanced at the sleeping man then opened his paper  there was very little fresh news except that this time the fact was mentioned that upon the body of the murdered man was discovered a sum larger than was at first supposed  it seemed doubtful therefore whether robbery after all was the motive of the crime especially as it took place in a neighborhood which was by no means infested with criminals  there was a suggestion of political motive a reference to the black hand concerning whose doings the papers had been full since the murder of a wellknown detective a few weeks ago  but apart from this there was nothing fresh  laverick folded up the paper and leaned back in his chair  the strain of the last twentyfour hours was beginning to tell even upon his robust constitution  the atmosphere of the room too was close he leaned back in his chair and was suddenly weary  perhaps he dozed  at any rate the whisper which called him back to realization of where he was came to him so unexpectedly that he sat up with a sudden start  morrisons eyes were open he had raised himself on his elbow his lips were parted  his manner was quieter but there were black lines deep engraven under his eyes in which there still shone something of that haunting fear  laverick he repeated hoarsely  laverick fully awakened now leaned towards him  hullo he said are you feeling more like yourself  morrison nodded  yes he admitted i am feelingbetter  how did you come here i cant remember anything  you sent for me laverick answered  i arrived to find you pretty well in a state of collapse  your sister has gone round to the theatre to ask them to excuse her this evening  i remember now that i sent for you morrison continued  tell me has any one been around at the office asking after me  no one particular laverick answeredno one at all that i can think of  there were one or two inquiries through the telephone but they were all ordinary business matters  the man on the bed drew a little breath which sounded like a sigh of relief  i have made a fool of myself laverick he said hoarsely  you are making a worse one of yourself by lying here and giving way laverick declared besides frightening your sister half to death  morrison passed his hand across his forehead  we talkedsome time ago he went on about my getting away you promised that you would help me  you said that i could get off to africa or america tomorrow  not the slightest difficulty about that laverick answered  there are halfadozen steamers sailing at least at the same time i suppose i ought to remind you that the firm is going to pull through minddont take this unkindly but the truth is besti will not have you back again  there may have to be a more definite readjustment of our affairs now but the old business is finished with  i dont want to come back morrison murmured  i have had enough of the city for the rest of my life  id rather get away somewhere and make a fresh start  youll help me laverick wont you  yes i will help you laverick promised  you were always a good sort morrison continued much too good for me  it was a rotten partnership for you  we could never have pulled together  let that go laverick interrupted  if you really mean getting away that simplifies matters of course  have you made any plans at all  where do you want to go  to new york answered morrison new york would suit me best there is money to be made there if one has something to make a start with  there will be some more money to come to you laverick answered probably a great deal more  i shall place our affairs in the hands of an accountant and shall have an estimate drawn up to yesterday you shall have every penny that is due to you  you have quite enough however to get there with  i will see to your ticket tonight if possible  when youve arrived you can cable me your address or you can decide where you will stay before you leave and i will send you a further remittance  youre a good sort laverick morrison mumbled  youd better give me the key of your rooms laverick continued and i will go back and put together some of your things  i suppose you will not want much to go away with  the rest can be sent on afterwards  and what about your letters  morrison with a sudden movement threw himself almost out of the bed  he clutched at lavericks shoulder frantically  dont go near my rooms laverick he begged  promise me that you wont  i dont want any letters  i dont want any of my things  laverick was dumfounded  you mean you want to go away without  i mean just what i have said morrison continued hysterically if you go there they will watch you they will follow you they will find out where i am  i should be there now but for that  laverick was silent for a moment  the matter was becoming serious  very well he said i will do as you say  i will not go near your rooms  i will get you a few things somewhere to start with  morrison sank back upon his pillow  thank you laverick he said thank you  i wishi wish  his voice seemed to die away  laverick glanced towards him wondering at the unfinished sentence  once again the mans face seemed to be convulsed with horror  he flung himself face downward upon the bed and tore at the sheets with both his hands  dont be a fool laverick said sternly  if youve anything on your mind apart from business tell me about it and ill do what i can to help you  morrison made no reply  he was sobbing now like a child  laverick rose to his feet and went to the window  what was to be done with such a creature  when he got back morrison had raised himself once more into a sitting posture  his appearance was absolutely spectral  laverick he said feebly there is something else but i cannot tell youi cannot tell any one  just as you please of course laverick answered  i am simply anxious to help you  you can do that as it is morrison exclaimed feverishly  you must promise me somethingpromise that if any one asks for me tomorrow before i get away you will not tell them where i am say you suppose that i am at my rooms or that i have gone into the country for a few days  say that you are expecting me back dont let any one know that i have gone abroad until i am safely away  and then dont tell a soul where i have gone  have you been up to any tricks with your friends laverick asked sternly  i haventi swear that i havent morrison declared  its something quite outside businessquite outside business altogether  very well answered laverick i will promise what you have asked then  listenhere is your sister back again he added as he heard the taxicab stop outside  pull yourself together and dont frighten her so much  i am going down to meet her  i shall tell her that you are better  try and buck up when she comes in to see you  ill do my best morrison said humbly  if you knew  if you only knew  he began to sob again  laverick left the room and descending the stairs met the girl in the hall  her white face questioned him before her lips had time to frame the speech  your brother is very much better laverick said  i am sure that you need not be anxious about him  i am so glad she murmured  they let me off but i had to pay a fine  i had no idea before that i was so important  shall i go to him now  one moment laverick answered holding open the door of the sittingroom  miss morrison he went on  miss leneven is my name she interrupted  i beg your pardon  your brother evidently has something on his mind apart from business  i am afraid that he has been getting into some sort of trouble  i dont think there is any object in bothering him about it but the great thing is to get him away  you will help she begged  i will help certainly laverick answered  i have promised to you must see that he is ready to leave here at seven oclock tomorrow morning  he wants to go to new york and the special to catch the german boat will leave waterloo somewhere about eight to eightthirty  but his clothes she cried  how can he be ready by then  your brother does not wish me or any one to go near his rooms or to send him any of his belongings laverick continued quietly  but how strange the girl exclaimed  do you mean to say then that he is going without anything  i am afraid laverick said kindly that we must take it for granted that your brother has got mixed up in some undesirable business or other  he is nervously anxious to keep his whereabouts an entire secret  he has been asking me whether any one has been to the office to inquire for him  under the circumstances i think the best thing we can do is to humor him  i shall buy him before tomorrow morning a cheap dressingcase and a readymade suit of clothes and a few things for the voyage  then i shall send a cab for you both at seven oclock and meet you at the station  you are very kind she murmured  what should i have done without you  oh i cannot think  the protective instinct in the man was suddenly strong  naturally unaffectionate he was conscious of an almost overmastering desire to take her hands in his even to lift her up and kiss away the tears which shone in her deep childlike eyes  he reminded himself that she was a stranger that her appearance of youth was a delusion that she could only construe such an action as a liberty an impertinence offered under circumstances for which there could be no possible excuse  he moved away towards the door  naturally he said i am glad to be of use to your brother  you see he explained a little awkwardly after all we have been partners in business  he caught a look upon her face and smiled  naturally too he continued it has been a great pleasure for me to do anything to relieve your anxiety  she gave him her hands then of her own accord  the gratitude which shone out of her swimming eyes seemed mingled with something which was almost invitation  laverick was suddenly swept off his feet something had come into his lifesomething absurd uncounted upon incomprehensible  the atmosphere of the room seemed electrified in a moment he had done what only a second or two before he had told himself would be the action of a cad  he had taken her unresisting up into his arms kissed her eyes and lips  afterwards he was never able to remember those few moments clearly only it seemed to him that she had accepted his caress almost without hesitation with the effortless serenity of a child receiving a natural consolation in a time of trouble  but laverick was conscious of other feelings as he leaned hard back in the corner of his taxicab and was driven swiftly away     chapter xvi  the waiter at the black post   laverick notwithstanding that the hour was becoming late found an outfitters shop in the strand still open and made such purchases as he could on morrisons behalf  then with the bag ready packed he returned to his rooms  time had passed quickly during the last three hours  it was nearly nine oclock when he stepped out of the lift and opened the door of his small suite of rooms with the latchkey which hung from his chain  he began to change his clothes mechanically and he had nearly finished when the telephone bell upon his table rang  whos that he asked taking up the receiver  hallporter sir was the answer  person here wishes to see you particularly  a person laverick repeated  man or woman  man sir  better send him up laverick ordered  hes a seedylooking lot sir the porter explained i told him that i scarcely thought youd see him  never mind laverick answered  i can soon get rid of the fellow if hes cadging  he went back to his room and finished fastening his tie  his own affairs had sunk a little into the background lately but the announcement of this unusual visitor brought them back into his mind with a rush  notwithstanding his iron nerves his fingers shook as he drew on his dinnerjacket and walked out to the passageway to answer the bell which rang a few seconds later  a man stood outside dressed in shabby black clothes whose face somehow was familiar to him although he could not for the moment place it  do you want to see me laverick asked  if you please mr laverick the man replied if you could spare me just a moment  you had better come inside then laverick said closing the door and preceding the way into the sittingroom  at any rate there was nothing threatening about the appearance of this visitornor anything official  i have taken the liberty of coming sir the man announced to ask you if you can tell me where i can find mr arthur morrison  lavericks face showed no sign of his relief  what he felt he succeeded in keeping to himself  you mean morrisonmy partner i suppose he answered  if you please sir the man admitted  i wanted a word or two with him most particular  i found out his address from the caretaker of your office but he dont seem to have been home to his rooms at all last night and they know nothing about him there  your face seems familiar to me laverick remarked  where do you come from  the man hesitated  i am the waiter sir at the black postlittle bar and restaurant you know he added just behind your offices sir at the end of crooked friars alley  youve been in once or twice mr laverick i think  mr morrisons a regular customer he comes in for a drink most mornings  laverick nodded   i knew id seen your face somewhere he said  what do you want with mr morrison  the man was silent  he twirled his hat and looked embarrassed  its a matter i shouldnt like to mention to any one except mr morrison himself sir he declared finally  if you could put me in the way of seeing him id be glad  i may say that it would be to his advantage too  laverick was thoughtful for a moment  as it happens thats a little difficult he explained  mr morrison and i disagreed on a matter of business last night  i undertook certain responsibilities which he should have shared and he arranged to leave the firm and the country at once  we partedwell not exactly the best of friends  i am afraid i cannot give you any information  you havent seen him since then sir the man asked  laverick lied promptly but he lied badly  his visitor was not in the least convinced  i am afraid i havent made myself quite plain sir he said its to do him a bit o good that im here  im not wishing him any harm at all  on the contrary its a great deal more to his advantage to see me than it will be mine to find him  i think laverick suggested that you had better be frank with me  supposing i knew where to catch morrison before he left the country i could easily deal with you on his behalf  the man looked doubtful  you see sir he replied awkwardly its a matter i wouldnt like to breathe a word about to any one but mr morrison himself itsits a bit serious  the mans face gave weight to his words  curiously enough the gleam of terror which laverick caught in his white face reminded him of a similar look which he had seen in morrisons eyes barely an hour ago  to gain time laverick moved across the room took a cigarette from a box and lit it  a conviction was forming itself in his mind  there was something definite behind these hysterical paroxysms of his late partner something of which this man had an inkling  look here he said throwing himself into an easychair i think you had better be frank with me  i must know more than i know at present before i help you to find morrison even if he is to be found  we didnt part very good friends but im his friend enoughfor the sake of others he added after a moments hesitation to do all that i could to help him out of any difficulty he may have stumbled into  so you see that so far as anything you may have to say to him is concerned i think you might as well say it to me  you couldnt see your way then sir the man continued doggedly to tell me where i could find mr morrison himself  no i couldnt laverick decided  even if i knew exactly where he wasand im not admitting thati couldnt put you in touch with him unless i knew what your business was  the mans eyes gleamed  he was a typical waiterpastyfaced unwholesomelookingbut he had small eyes of a greenish cast and they were expressive  i think sir he said youve some idea yourself then that mr morrison has been getting into a bit of trouble  we wont discuss that laverick answered  you must either go awayits past nine oclock and i havent had my dinner yetor you must treat me as you would mr morrison  the man looked upon the carpet for several moments  very well sir he said theres no great reason why i should put myself out about this at all  the only thing is  he hesitated  well go on laverick said encouragingly  i think the man continued that mr morrisonknowing as i well do sir the sort of gent he iswould be more likely to talk common sense with me about this matter than you sir  ill imagine im morrison for the moment laverick said smiling especially as im acting for him  the man looked around the room  the door behind had been left ajar he stepped backward and closed it  youll pardon the liberty sir he said but this is a serious matter im going to speak about  ill just tell you a little thing and you can form your own conclusions  last night we was open late at the black post  we keep open sir as you know when you gentlemen at the stock exchange are busy  about nine oclock there was a strange customer came in  he had two drinks and he sat as though he were waiting  in about arfanhour another gent came in and they went into a corner together and seemed to be doing some sort of business  anyways there was papers passed between them  i was fairly busy about then as there were one or two more customers in the place but i noticed these two talking together and i noticed the dark gentleman leave  the others went out a few minutes afterwards and the gent who had come first was alone in the place he sat in the corner and he had a pocketbook on the table before him  i had a sort of casual glance at it when i brought him a drink and it seemed to me that it was full of banknotes  he sat there just like a man extra deep in thought  just after eleven in came mr morrison  i could see he was rare and put out for he was white and shaking all over  give me a drink jim he saida big brandy and soda big as you make em  the man paused for a moment as though to collect himself  laverick was suddenly conscious of a strange thrill creeping through his pulses  go on he said  that was after he left me  go on  he was quite close to the other gent mr morrison was the waiter continued but they didnt say nowt to each other  all of a sudden i see mr morrison set down his glass and stare at the other chap as though hed seen something that had given him a turn  i leaned over the counter and had a look too  there he satthis tall fair chap who had been in the place so longwith his big pocketbook on the table in front of him and even from where i was i could see that there was a great pile of banknotes sticking out from it  all of a sudden he looks up and sees mr morrison awatching him and me from behind the counter  back he whisks the pocketbook into his pocket calls me for my bill gives me two mouldy pennies for a tip buttons up his coat and walks out  you know who he was laverick inquired  again the waiter paused for a moment before he answeredpaused and looked nervously around the room  his voice shook  he was the man as was murdered about a hundred yards off the black post last night sir he said  how do you know laverick asked  i got an hour off today the waiter continued and went down to the mortuary  there was no doubt about it  there he wassame chap same clothes  i could swear to him anywhere and i reckon ill have to at the inquest  lavericks cigarette burned away between his fingers  it seemed to him that he was no longer in the room  he was listening to big ben striking the hour he was back again in that tiny little bedroom with its spotless sheets and lace curtains  the man on the bed was looking at him  laverick remembered the look and shivered  what has this to do with morrison he demanded  once more the waiter looked around in that half mysterious half terrified way  mr morrison sir he said dropping his voice to a hoarse whisper he followed the other chap out within thirty seconds  a sort of queer look hed got in his face too and he went out without paying me  ive read the papers pretty careful sir the man went on but i aint seen no word of that pocketbook of banknotes being found on the man as was murdered  laverick threw the end of his burning cigarette away  he walked to the window keeping his back deliberately turned on his visitor his eyes followed the glittering arc of lights which fringed the thames embankment were caught by the flaring skysign on the other side of the river  he felt his heart beating with unaccustomed vigor was this then the secret of morrisons terror  he wondered no longer at his collapse  the terror was upon him too  he felt his forehead and his hand when he drew it away was wet  it was not morrison alone but he himself who might be implicated in this mans knowledge  the thoughts flitted through his brain like parts of a nightmare  he saw morrison arrested he saw the whole story of the missing pocketbook in the papers he imagined his bank manager reading it and thinking of that parcel of mysterious banknotes deposited in his keeping on the morning after the tragedy laverick was a strong man and his moment of weakness poignant though it had been passed  this was no new thing with which he was confronted  all the time he had known that the probabilities were in favor of such a discovery  he set his teeth and turned to face his visitor  this is a very serious thing which you have told me he said have you spoken about it to any one else  not a soul sir the man answered  i thought it best to have a word or two first with mr morrison  you were thinking of attending the inquest laverick said thoughtfully  the police would thank you for your evidence and there i suppose the matter would end  youve hit it precisely sir the man admitted  there the matter would end  on the other hand laverick continued speaking as though he were reasoning this matter out to himself supposing you decided not to meddle in an affair which does not concern you supposing you were not sure as to the identity of your customer last night and being a little tired you could not rightly remember whether mr morrison called in for a drink or not and so to cut the matter short you dismissed the whole matter from your mind and let the inquest take its own courselaverick paused  his visitor scratched the side of his chin and nodded  youve put this matter plainly sir he said in what i call an understandable straightforward way  im a poor manive been a poor man all my lifeand ive never seed a chance before of getting away from it  i see one now  you want to do the best you can for yourself  so elp me god sir i do the man agreed  laverick nodded  you have done a remarkably wise thing he said in coming to me and in telling me about this affair  the idea of connecting mr morrison with the murder would of course be ridiculous but on the other hand it would be very disagreeable to him to have his name mentioned in connection with it  you have behaved discreetly and you have done mr morrison a service in trying to find him out you will do him a further service by adopting the second course i suggested with regard to the inquest  what do you consider that service is worth  it depends sir the man answered quietly at what price mr morrison values his life     chapter xvii  the price of silence   the mans manner was expressive  laverick repeated his phrase frowning  his life  yes sir  laverick shrugged his shoulders  come he declared you must not go too far with this thing  i have admitted so as to clear the way for anything you have to say that mr morrison would not care to have his name mentioned in connection with this affair  but because he left your bar a few minutes after the murdered man it is sheer folly to assume that therefore he is necessarily implicated in his death  i cannot conceive anything more unlikely  the man smileda slow uncomfortable smile which suggested mirth less than anything in the world  there are a few other things sir he remarkedone in especial  well laverick inquired  lets have it  you had better tell me everything that is in your mind  the man was stabbed with a hornhandled knife  i remember reading that laverick admitted  well  the knife was mine his visitor affirmed dropping his voice once more to a whisper  it lay on the edge of the counter close to where mr morrison was leaning and as soon as hed gone i missed it  laverick was silent  what was there to be said  hornhandled knives he muttered are not rare not uncommon things  one dont possess a knife for a matter of eight or nine years without being able to swear to it the other remarked dryly  is there anything more  there dont need to be was the quiet reply  you know that sir so do i  there dont need to be any more evidence than mine to send mr morrison to the gallows  we will waive that point laverick declared  the jury sometimes are very hard to convince by circumstantial evidence alone  however as i have said let us waive that point  your position is clear enough  you go to the inquest you tell all you know and you get nothing  you are a poor man you have worked hard all your life the chance has come in your way to do yourself a little good  now take my advice  dont spoil it all by asking for anything ridiculous it wont do for you to come into a fortune a few days after this affair especially if it ever comes out that the murdered man was in your place  i am here to act for mr morrison  what is it that you want  you are talking like a gent sir the man saidlike a sensible gent too  id have to keep it quiet of course that id come into a bit of moneyjust at present at any rate  i could easy find an excuse for changing my jobperhaps get away from london altogether  ive got a few pounds saved and ive always wanted to open a banking account  a gent like you perhaps could put me in the way of doing it  how much do you consider would be a satisfactory balance to commence with laverick asked  i was thinking of a thousand pounds sir  laverick was thoughtful for a few moments  by the way what is your name he inquired at last  james shepherd sir the man answeredgenerally called jim sir  well you see shepherd laverick continued the difficulty is in your case as in all similar ones that one never knows where the thing will end  a thousand pounds is a considerable sum but in four amounts with three months interval between each it could be arranged this would be better for you in any case  two hundred and fifty pounds is not an unheardof sum for you to have saved or got together  after that your investments would be my lookout and they would produce as i have said another seven hundred and fifty pounds  but what security have ihas mr morrison let us saythat you will be content with this sum  he hasnt any sir the man admitted at once  he couldnt have any  im a modestliving man and ive no desire to go shouting around that im independent all of a sudden  that wouldnt do nohow  a thousand pounds would bring me in near enough a pound a week if i invested it or two pounds a week for an annuity my health being none too good  ive no wife or children sir  i was thinking of an annuity  with two pounds a week id have no cause to trouble any one again  laverick considered  it shall be done he said  tomorrow i shall buy shares for you to the extent of two hundred and fifty pounds  they will be deposited in a bank  some day you can look in and see me and i will take you round there  you are my client who has speculated under my instructions successfully and you will sign your name and become a customer  after that you will speculate again when your thousand pounds has been made i will show you how to buy an annuity  keep your mouth shut and last night will be the luckiest night of your life  do you drink  a drop or two sir the man admitted if i didnt i guess id go off my chump  do you talk when youre drunk laverick asked  never sir the man declared ive a way of getting a drop too much when im by myself  then i tumbles off to sleep and thats the end of it  ive no fancy for company at such times  its a good thing laverick remarked thrusting his hand into his pocket  heres a fivepound note on account  i daresay you can manage to keep sober tonight at any rate  thats all isnt it  thats all sir the man answered unless i might make so bold as to ask whether mr morrison has really hooked it  mr morrison had decided to hook it as you graphically say before he came in for that drink to your bar shepherd laverick affirmed business had been none too good with us and we had had a disagreement  the man nodded  i see sir he said taking up his hat good night sir  good night laverick answered you can find your way down  quite well sir and thank you declared mr shepherd closing the door softly behind him  laverick sat down in his chair he had forgotten that he was hungry he was faced now with a new tragedy     chapter xviii  the lonely chorus girl   they stood together upon the platform watching the receding train the girls eyes were filled with tears but laverick was conscious of a sense of immense relief  morrison had been at the station some time before the train was due to leave and although a physical wreck he seemed only too anxious to depart he had all the appearance of a brokenspirited man he looked about him on the platform and even from the carriage in the furtive way of a criminal expecting apprehension at any moment  the whistle of the train had been a relief as great to him as to laverick  well write you to new york care of barclays laverick called out good luck morrison  pull yourself together and make a fresh start  morrisons only reply was a somewhat feeble nod  laverick had not attempted to shake hands  he felt himself at the last moment stirred almost to anger by the perfunctory farewell which was all this man had offered to the girl he had treated so inconsiderately his thoughts were engrossed upon himself and his own danger  he would not even have kissed her if she had not drawn his face down to hers and whispered a reassuring little message  laverick turned away for some reason or other he felt himself shuddering conversation during those last few moments had been increasingly difficult  the train was off at last however and they were alone  the girl drew a long breath which might very well have been one of relief  they turned silently toward the exit  are you going back home laverick asked  yes she answered listlessly  there is nothing else to do  isnt it rather sad for you there by yourself  she nodded  it is the first time she said  another girl and her mother have lived with me always  they started off last week touring they are paying a little toward the house or i should have to go into rooms  as it is i think that it would be more comfortable  laverick looked at her wonderingly  you seem such a child he said to be left all alone in the world like this  but i am not a child actually you see she answered with an effort at lightness  somehow though i do miss arthurs going his father was always very good to me and made him promise that he would do what he could  i didnt see much of him but one felt always that there was somebody  its different now  it makes one feel very lonely  i too laverick said with commendable mendacity am rather a lonely person  you must let me see something of you now and then  she looked up at him quickly  her gaze was altogether disingenuous but her eyesthose wonderful eyesspoke volumes  if you really mean it she said i should be so glad  supposing we start today he suggested smiling  i cannot ask you to lunch as i have a busy day before me but we might have dinner together quite early  then i would take you to the theatre and meet you afterwards if you liked  if i liked she whispered  oh how good you are  i am not at all sure about that  now ill put you in this taxi and send you home  she laughed  you mustnt do anything so extravagant  i can get a bus just outside  i never have taxicabs  just this morning he insisted and i think he wont trouble you for his fare  you must let me please  remember that theres a large account open still between your halfbrother and me so you neednt mind these trifles  till this evening then  shall i fetch you or will you come to me  let me fetch you if i may she said  it isnt nice for you to come down to where i live  its such a horrid part  just as you like he answered  id be very glad to fetch you if you prefer it but it would give me more time if you came  shall we say seven oclock  ive written the address down on this card so that you can make no mistake  she laughed gayly  you know all the time she said i feel that you are treating me as though i were a baby  ill be there punctually and i dont think i need tie the card around my neck  the cab glided off  laverick caught a glimpse of a wan little face with a faint smile quivering at the corner of her lips as she leaned out for a moment to say goodbye  then he went back to his rooms breakfasted and made his way to his office  the morning papers had nothing new to report concerning the murder in crooked friars alley  evidently what information the police had obtained they were keeping for the inquest laverick from the moment when he entered the office had little or no time to think of the tragedy under whose shadow he had come  the longpredicted boom had arrived at last  without lunch he and all his clerks worked until after six oclock  even then laverick found it hard to leave  during the day a dozen people or so had been in to ask for morrison  to all of them he had given the same replymorrison had gone abroad on private business for the firm  very few were deceived by lavericks dry statement  he was quite aware that he was looked upon either as one of the luckiest men on earth or as a financier of consummate skill  the failure of laverick  morrison had been looked upon as a certainty  how they had tided over that twentyfour hours had been known to no oneto no one but laverick himself and the manager of his bank  just before four oclock the telephone rang at his elbow  mr fenwick from the bank sir is wishing to speak to you for a moment his headclerk announced  laverick took up the telephone  yes he said i am laverick  good afternoon mr fenwick absolutely impossible to spare any time today  what is it  the account is all right isnt it  quite right mr laverick was the answer  at the same time if you could spare me a moment i should be glad to see you concerning the deposit you made yesterday  i will come in tomorrow laverick promised  this afternoon it is quite out of the question  i have a crowd of people waiting to see me and several important engagements for which i am late already  the banker seemed scarcely satisfied  i may rely upon seeing you tomorrow he pressed  tomorrow laverick repeated ringing off  for a time this last message troubled him  as soon as the days work was over however and he stepped into his cab he dismissed it entirely from his thoughts  it was curious how notwithstanding this new seriousness which had come into his life notwithstanding that sensation of walking all the time on the brink of a precipice he set his face homeward and looked forward to his evening with a pleasure which he had not felt for many months  the whirl of the day faded easily from his mind  he lived no more in an atmosphere of wild excitement of changing prices of feverish anxiety  how empty his life must have unconsciously grown that he could find so much pleasure in being kind to a pretty child  it was hard to think of her otherwiseimpossible  a strange heritage this to have been left him by such a person as arthur morrison  how in the world he wondered did he happen to have such a connection  she was a little shy when she arrived  laverick had left special orders downstairs and she was brought up into his sittingroom immediately  she was very quietly dressed except for her hat which was large and wavy  he found it becoming but he knew enough to understand that her clothes were very simple and very inexpensive and he was conscious of being curiously glad of the fact  i am afraid she said timidly with a glance at his evening attire that we must go somewhere very quiet  you see i have only one evening gown and i couldnt wear that  there wouldnt be time to change afterwards  besides ones clothes do get so knocked about in the dressingrooms  there are heaps of places we can go to he assured her pleasantly of course you cant dress for the evening when you have to go on to work but you must remember that there are a good many other smart young ladies in the same position  i had to change because i have taken a stall to see your performance  tell me how are you feeling now  rather lonely she admitted making a pathetic little grimace that is to say i have been feeling lonely she added softly  i dont now of course  you are a queer little person he said kindly as they went down in the lift  havent you any friends  she shrugged her shoulders  what sort of friends could i have she asked  the girls in the chorus with me are very nice some of them but they know so many people whom i dont and they are always out to supper or something of the sort  and you  she shook her head  i went to one supperparty with the girl who is near me she said i liked it very much but they didnt ask me again  i wonder why he remarked  oh i dont know she went on drearily  you see i think the men who take out girls who are in the chorus generally expect to be allowed to make love to them  at any rate they behaved like that  such a horrid man tried to say nice things to me and i didnt like it a bit  so they left me alone afterwards  the girl i lived with and her mother are quite nice and they have a few friends we go to see sometimes on sunday or holidays  its dull though very dull especially now theyre away  what on earth made you think of going on the stage at all he asked  what could one do she answered  my mothers money died with hershe had only an annuityand my stepfather who had promised to look after me lost all his money and died quite suddenly  arthur was in a stockbrokers office and he couldnt save anything  my only friend was my old musicmaster and he had given up teaching and was director of the orchestra at the universal  all he could do for me was to get me a place in the chorus  i have been there ever since they keep on promising me a little part but i never get it  its always like that in theatres  you have to be a favorite of the managers for some reason or other or you never get your chance unless you are unusually lucky  i dont know much about theatres he admitted  i am afraid i am rather a stupid person  when i can get away from work i go into the country and play cricket or golf or anything thats going when i am up in town i am generally content with looking up a few friends or playing bridge at the club  i never have been a theatregoer  i wonder she asked as they seated themselves at a small round table in the restaurant which he had choseni wonder why every now and then you look so serious  i didnt know that i did he answered  weve had thundering hard times lately in business though  i suppose that makes a man look thoughtful  poor mr laverick she murmured softly  are things any better now  much better  then you have nothing really to bother you she persisted  i suppose we all have something he replied suddenly grave why do you ask that  she leaned across the table  in the shaded light her oval face with its little halo of deep brown hair seemed to him as though it might have belonged to some old miniature  she was delightful like watteauwork upon a piece of priceless porcelaindelightful when the lights played in her eyes and the smile quivered at the corner of her lips  just now however she became very much in earnest  i will tell you why i ask that question she said  i cannot help worrying still about arthur  you know you admitted last night that he had done something  you saw how terribly frightened he was this morning and how he kept on looking around as though he were afraid that he would see somebody whom he wished to avoid oh  i dont want to worry you she went on but i feel so terrified sometimes  i feel that he must have done somethingbad it was not an ordinary business trouble which took the life out of him so completely  it was not laverick admitted at once  he has done something i believe quite foolish but the matter is in my hands to arrange and i think you can assure yourself that nothing will come of it  did you tell him so this morning she asked eagerly  i did not he answered  i told him nothing  for many reasons it was better to keep him ignorant  he and i might not have seen things the same way and i am sure that what i am doing is for the best if i were you miss leneveu i think i wouldnt worry any more  soon you will hear from your brother that he is safe in new york and i think i can promise you that the trouble will never come to anything serious  why have you been so kind to him she asked timidly  from what he said i do not think that he was very useful to you and indeed you and he are so different  laverick was silent for a moment  to be honest he said i think that i should not have taken so much trouble for his sake alone  you see he continued smiling you are rather a delightful young person and you were very anxious werent you  her hand came across the tablean impulsive little gesture which he nevertheless found perfectly natural and delightful  he took it into his and would have raised the fingers to his lips but for the waiters who were hovering around  you are so kind she said and i am so fortunate  i think that i wanted a friend  you poor child he answered i should think you did  you are not drinking your wine  she shook her head  do you mind she asked  a very little gets into my head because i take it so seldom and the manager is cross if one makes the least bit of a mistake  besides i do not think that i like to drink wine  if one does not take it at all there is an excuse for never having anything when the girls ask you  he nodded sympathetically  i believe you are quite right he said in a general way at any rate  well i will drink by myself to your brothers safe arrival in new york  are you ready  she glanced at the clock  i must be there in a quarter of an hour she told him  i will drive you to the theatre he said and then go round and fetch my ticket  as he waited for her in the reception hall of the restaurant he took an evening paper from the stall  a brief paragraph at once attracted his attention       murder in the citywe understand that very important      information has come into the hands of the police  an      arrest is expected tonight or tomorrow at the latest  he crushed the paper in his hand and threw it on one side  it was the usual sort of thing  there was nothing they could have found outnothing he told himself     chapter xix  mysterious inquiries   as soon as he had gone through his letters on the following morning laverick in response to a second and more urgent message went round to his bank  mr fenwick greeted him gravely  he was feeling keenly the responsibilities of his position  just how much to say and how much to leave unsaid was a question which called for a full measure of diplomacy  you understand mr laverick he began that i wished to see you with regard to the arrangement we came to the day before yesterday  laverick nodded  it suited him to remain monosyllabic  well he asked  the arrangement of course was most unusual the manager continued i agreed to it as you were an old customer and the matter was an urgent one  i do not quite follow you laverick remarked frowning  what is it you wish me to do  withdraw my account  not in the least the manager answered hastily  you know the position of our market of course laverick went on three days ago i was in a situation which might have been called desperate  i could quite understand that you needed security to go on making the necessary payments on my behalf  today things are entirely different  i am twenty thousand pounds better off and if necessary i could realize sufficient to pay off the whole of my overdraft within halfanhour  that i do not do so is simply a matter of policy and prices  i quite understand that my dear mr laverick the bank manager declared  the position is simply this  we have had a most unusual and a strictly private inquiry of a nature which i cannot divulge to you asking whether any large sum in five hundred pound banknotes has been passed through our account during the last few days  you have actually had this inquiry laverick asked calmly  we have  i can tell you no more  the source of the inquiry was in a sense amazing  may i ask what your reply was  my reply was mr fenwick said slowly that no such notes had passed through our account  we asked them however without giving any reasons to repeat their question in a few days time  our reply was perfectly truthful  owing to your peculiar stipulations we are simply holding a certain packet for you in our security chamber  we know it to contain banknotes and there is very little doubt but that it contains the notes which have been the subject of this inquiry  i want to ask you mr laverick to be so good as to open that packet let me credit the notes to your account in the usual way and leave me free to reply as i ought to have done in the first instance to this inquiry  the course which you suggest replied the other is one which i absolutely decline to take  it is not for me to tell you the nature of the relations which should exist between a banker and his client all that i can say is that those notes are deposited with you and must remain on deposit and that the transaction is one which must be treated entirely as a confidential one  if you decline to do this i must remove my account in which case i shall of course take the packet away with me  to be plain with you mr fenwick he wound up i do not intend to make use of those notes i never intended to do so  i simply deposited them as security until the turn in price of unions came  it is a very nice point mr laverick the bank manager remarked i should consider that you had already made use of them  every one to his own conscience laverick answered calmly  you place me in a very embarrassing position mr laverick  i cannot admit that at all laverick replied  there is only one inquiry which you could have had which could justify you in insisting upon what you have suggested  it emanated i presume from scotland yard  if it had mr fenwick answered no considerations of etiquette would have intervened at all  i should have felt it my duty to have revealed at once the fact of your deposit  at the same time the inquiry comes from an even more important sourcea source which cannot be ignored  laverick thought for a moment  after all the matter is a very simple one he declared  by four oclock this afternoon my account shall be within its limits you will then automatically restore to me the packet which you hold on my behalf and the possession of which seems to embarrass you  if you do not mind the banker answered i should be glad if you would take it with you  it means i think a matter of six or seven thousand pounds added to your overdraft but as a temporary thing we will pass that  as you will laverick assented carelessly  the charge of those documents is a trust with me as well as with yourself  i have no doubt that i can arrange for their being held in a secure place elsewhere  the usual formalities were gone through and laverick left the bank with the brown leather pocketbook in his breastcoat pocket arrived at his office he locked it up at once in his private safe and proceeded with the usual business of the day  even with an added staff of clerks the office was almost in an uproar  laverick threw himself into the struggle with a wholehearted desire to escape from these unpleasant memories  he succeeded perfectly  it was two hours before he was able to sit down even for a moment  his headclerk almost as exhausted followed him into his room  i forgot to tell you sir he announced that there s a man outsidemr shepherd was his name i believesaid he had a small investment to make which you promised to look after personally  he would insist on seeing yousaid he was a waiter at a restaurant which you visited sometimes  thats all right laverick declared  you can show him in  well probably give him american rails  cant we attend to it in the office for you sir the clerk asked i suppose its only a matter of a few hundreds  less than that probably but i promised the fellow id look after it myself  send him in scropes  there was a brief delay and then mr shepherd was announced laverick who was sitting with his coat off smoking a wellearned cigarette looked up and nodded to his visitor as the door was closed  sorry to keep you waiting he remarked  were having a bit of a rush  the man laid down his hat and came up to lavericks side  i guess that sir he said from the number of people weve had in the black post today and the way theyve all been shouting and talking  they dont seem to eat much these days but theres some of them can shift the drink  ive got some sound stocks looked out for you laverick remarked two hundred and fifty pounds worth  if youll just approve that list as a matter of form he added pushing a piece of paper across you can come in tomorrow and have the certificates  i shall tell them to debit the purchase money to my private account so that if any one asks you anything you can say that you paid me for them  im sure im much obliged sir the man said  to tell you the truth he went on ive had a bit of a scare today  laverick looked up quickly  what do you mean he demanded  may i sit down sir  im a bit worn out  ive been on the go since halfpast ten  laverick nodded and pointed to a chair  shepherd brought it up to the side of the table and leaned forward  theres been two men in today he said asking questions  they wanted to know how many customers i had there on monday night and could i describe them  was there any one i recognized and so on  what did you say  i declared i couldnt remember any one  to the best of my recollection i told them there was no one served at all after ten oclock  i wouldnt say for certainit looked as though i might have had a reason  and were they satisfied  i dont think they were shepherd admitted  not altogether that is to say  did they mention any names asked laverickmorrisons for instance  did they want to know whether he was a regular customer  they didnt mention no names at all sir the man answered but they did begin to ask questions about my regular clients  fortunate like the place was so crowded that i had every excuse for not paying any too much attention to them  it was all i could do to keep on getting orders attended to  what sort of men were they laverick asked  do you think that they came from the police  i shouldnt have said so shepherd replied but one cant tell and these gentlemen from scotland yard do make themselves up so sometimes on purpose to deceive  i should have said that these two were foreigners the same kidney as the poor chap as was murdered i heard a word or two pass and i sort of gathered that theyd a shrewd idea as to that meeting in the black post between the man who was murdered and the little dark fellow  laverick nodded  jim shepherd he declared you appear to me to be a very sagacious person  im sure im much obliged sir i can tell you though he added i dont half like these chaps coming round making inquiries  my nerves aint quite what they were and it gives me the jumps  laverick was thoughtful for a few moments  after all there was no one else in the bar that night he remarkedno one who could contradict you  not a soul jim shepherd agreed  then dont you bother laverick continued  you see youve been wise  you havent given yourself away altogether  youve simply said that you dont recollect any one coming in  why should you recollect  at the end of a days work you are not likely to notice every stray customer  stick to it and if you take my advice dont go throwing any money about and dont give your notice in for another week or so  pave the way for it a bit  ask the governor for a risesay youre not making a living out of it  im on jim shepherd remarked nodding his head  im on to it sir  i dont want to get into no trouble im sure  you cant laverick answered dryly unless you chuck yourself in youre not obliged to remember anything  no one can ever prove that you remembered anything  keep your eyes open and let me hear if these fellows turn up again  im pretty certain they will sir the man declared  they sat about waiting for me to be disengaged but when my time off came i hopped out the back way  theyll be there again tonight sure enough  laverick nodded  well you must let me know he said what happens  jim shepherd leaned across the corner of the table and dropped his voice  its an awful thing to think of sir he whispered blinking rapidly  i wouldnt be that young mr morrison for all that great pocketful of notes  but my there was a sight of money there sir  hell be a rich man for all his days if nothing comes out  we wont talk any more about it laverick insisted  it isnt a pleasant thing to think about or talk about  we wont know anything shepherd  we shall be better off  the man took his departure and the whirl of business recommenced laverick turned his back upon the city only a few minutes before eight and tired out he dined at a restaurant on his homeward way when at last he reached his sittingroom he threw himself on the sofa and lit a cigar  once more the evening papers had no particular news  this time however one of them had a leading article upon the english police system  the fact that an undetected murder should take place in a wealthy neighborhood away from the slums a murder which must have been premeditated was in itself alarming  until the inquest had been held it was better to make little comment upon the facts of the case so far as they were known at the same time the circumstance could not fail to incite a considerable amount of alarm among those who had offices in the vicinity of the tragedy  it was rumored that some mysterious inquiries were being circulated around london banks  it was possible that robbery after all had been the real motive of the crime but robbery on a scale as yet unimagined  the whole interest of the case now was centred upon the discovery of the mans identity as soon as this was solved some very startling developments might be expected  laverick threw the paper away  he tried to rest upon the sofa but tried in vain  he found himself continually glancing at the clock  tonight he muttered to himselfno i will not go tonight it is not fair to the child  it is absurd  why she would think that i was  he stopped short  ill change and go to the club he decided  he rose to his feet  just then there was a ring at his bell  he opened the door and found a messenger boy standing in the vestibule  note sir for mr stephen laverick the boy announced opening his wallet  laverick held out his hand  the boy gave him a large square envelope and upon the back of it was universal theatre laverick tried to assure himself that he was not so ridiculously pleased  he stepped back into the room tore open the envelope and read the few lines traced in rather faint but delicate handwriting   are you coming to fetch me tonight  dont let me be a nuisance but do come if you have nothing to do  i have something to tell you                                                          zoe   laverick gave the boy a shilling for himself and suddenly forgot that he was tired  he changed his clothes whistling softly to himself all the time  at eleven oclock he was at the stagedoor of the universal theatre waiting in a taxicab     chapter xx  laverick is crossexamined   one by one the young ladies of the chorus came out from the stagedoor of the universal in most cases to be assisted into a waiting hansom or taxicab by an attendant cavalier  laverick stood back in the shadows as much as possible smiling now and then to himself at this to him somewhat novel way of spending the evening zoe was among the last to appear  she came up to him with a delightful little gesture of pleasure and took his arm as a matter of course as he led her across to the waiting cab  this sort of thing is making me feel absurdly young he declared luigis for supper i suppose  supper she exclaimed clapping her hands  delightful  two nights following too  i did love last night  we had better engage a table at luigis permanently he remarked  if only you meant it she sighed  he laughed at her but he was thoughtful for a few minutes afterwards when they sat at a small round table in the somewhat bohemian restaurant which was the fashionable rendezvous of the moment for ladies of the theatrical profession he asked her a question  tell me what you meant in your note he begged  you said that you had some information for me  im afraid it wasnt anything very much she admitted  i found out today that some one had been inquiring at the stagedoor about me and whether i was connected in any way with a mr arthur morrison the stockbroker  do you know who it was he asked  she shook her head  the man left no name at all  i tried to get the doorkeeper to tell me about him but hes such a surly old fellow and hes so used to that sort of thing that he pretended he didnt remember anything  it seems odd he remarked thoughtfully that any one should have found you out  you were so seldom with morrison  i dare say he added it was just some one to whom your brother owes some small sum of money  very likely she answered  but i was going to tell you  he came again tonight while the performance was on and sent a note round i have brought it for you to see  the noteit was really little more than a messagewas written on the back of a programme and enclosed in an envelope evidently borrowed from the boxoffice  it read as follows   dear miss leneveu  i believe that mr arthur morrison is a connection of yours and i am venturing to introduce myself to you as a friend of his  could you spare me halfanhour of your company after the performance of this evening  if you could honor me so much you might perhaps allow me to give you some supper                                                 sincerely                                                philip e miles   laverick felt an absurd pang of jealousy as he handed back the programme  i should say he declared that this was simply some young man who was trying to scrape an acquaintance with you because he was or had been a friend of morrisons  in that case answered zoe he is very soon forgotten  she tore the programme into two pieces and laverick was conscious of a ridiculous feeling of pleasure at her indifference  if you hear anything more about him he said you might let me know  you are a brave young lady to dismiss your admirers so summarily  perhaps i am quite satisfied with one laughing softly  laverick told himself that at his age he was behaving like an idiot nevertheless his eyes across the table expressed his appreciation of her speech  tell me something about yourself mr laverick she begged  for instance  first of all then how old are you  he made a grimace  thirtyeightthirtynine my next birthday  doesnt that seem grandfatherly to you  you must not be absurd she exclaimed  it is not even middleaged  now tell mehow do you spend your time generally do you really mean that you go and play cards at your club most evenings  i have a good many friends and i dine out quite a great deal  you have no sisters  i have no relatives at all in london he explained  it is to be a real crossexamination she warned him  i am quite content he answered  go ahead but remember though that i am a very dull person  you look so young for your years she declared  i wonder have you ever been in love  he laughed heartily  about a dozen times i suppose  why  do i seem to you like a misanthrope  i dont know she admitted hesitatingly  you dont seem to me as though you cared to make friends very easily  i just felt i wanted to ask you  have you ever been engaged  never he assured her  and when was the last time she asked that you felt you cared a little for any one  it dates from the day before yesterday he declared filling her glass  she laughed at him  of course it is nonsense to talk to you like this she said you are quite right to make fun of me  on the contrary he insisted  i am very much in earnest  very well then she answered if you are in earnest you shall be in love with me  you shall take me about give me supper every night send me some sweets and cigarettes to the theatreoh and there are heaps of things you ought to do if you really mean it she wound up  if those things mean being fond of you he answered ill prove it with pleasure  sweets cigarettes suppers taxicabs at the stagedoor  it all sounds very terrible she sighed  its a horrid little life  yet i suppose you enjoy it he remarked tentatively  i hate it but i must do something  i could not live on charity if i knew any other way i could make money i would rather but there is no other way  i tried once to give music lessons  i had a few pupils but they never paidthey never do pay  i wish i could think of something laverick said thoughtfully of course it is occupation you want  so far as regards the monetary part of it i still owe your brother a great deal  she shook her head interrupting him with a quick little gesture  no no she declared  i have never complained about arthur sometimes he made me suffer because i know that he was ashamed of having a relative in the chorus but i am quite sure that i do not wish to take any of his moneyor of anybody elses she added i want always to earn my own living  for such a child he remarked smiling you are wonderfully independent  why not she answered softly  it is years since i had any one to do very much for me  necessity teaches us a good many things oh i was helpless enough when it began she added with a little sigh  i got over it  we all do  tell mewho is that woman and why does she stare so at you  laverick looked across the room  louise and bellamy were sitting at the opposite table  the former was strikingly handsome and very wonderfully dressed  her closelyclinging gown cut slightly open in front displayed her marvelous figure  she wore long pearl earrings and a hat with white feathers which drooped over her fair hair  laverick recognized her at once  it is mademoiselle idiale he said the most wonderful soprano in the world  why does she look so at you zoe asked  laverick shook his head  i do not know her he said  i know who she is of courseevery one does  she is a servian and they say that she is devoted to her country  she left vienna at a moments notice only a few days ago and they say that it was because she had sworn never to sing again before the enemies of her country  she had been engaged a long time to appear at covent garden but no one believed that she would really come  she breaks her engagements just when she chooses  in fact she is a very wonderful person altogether  i never saw such pearls in my life zoe whispered  and how lovely she is  i do not understand though why she is so interested in you  she mistakes me for some one perhaps  it certainly seemed probable  even at that moment she touched her escort upon the arm and he distinctly looked across at laverick  it was obvious that he was the subject of her conversation  i know the man laverick said  he was at harrow with me and i have played cricket with him since  but i have certainly never met mademoiselle idiale  one does not forget that sort of person  her figure is magnificent zoe murmured wistfully  do you like tall women very much mr laverick  i adore them he answered smiling but i prefer small ones  we are very foolish people you and i she laughed  we came together so strangely and yet we talk such frivolous nonsense  you are making me young again he declared  oh you are quite young enough she assured him  to tell you the truth i am jealous  mademoiselle idiale looks at you all the time  look at her now  is she not beautiful  there was no doubt about her beauty but those who were criticising herand she was by far the most interesting person in the roomthought her a little sad  though bellamy was doing his utmost to be entertaining her eyes seemed to travel every now and then over his head and out of the room  wherever her thoughts were one could be very sure that they were not fixed upon the subject under discussion  she is like that when she sings laverick remarked  she has none of the vivacity of the frenchwomen  yet there was never anything so graceful in the world as the way she moves about the stage  if i were a man zoe sighed that is the sort of woman i would die for  if you were a man he replied you would probably find some one whom you preferred to live for  do you know you are rather a morbid sort of person miss zoe  ah i like that she declared  i will not be called miss leneveu any more by you  you must call me miss zoe pleasezoe if you like  zoe by all means  under the circumstances i think it is only fitting  his eyes wandered across the room again  ah she cried softly you too are coming under the spell then i was reading about her only the other day  they say that so many men fall in love with herso many men to whom she gives no encouragement at all  laverick looked into his companions face  come he said my heart is not so easily won  i can assure you that i never aspire to so mighty a personage as a covent garden star dont you know that she gets a salary of five hundred pounds a week and wears ropes of pearls which would represent ten times my entire income  heaven alone knows what her gowns cost  after all though murmured zoe she is a woman  see your friend is coming to speak to you  bellamy was indeed crossing the room  he nodded to laverick and bowed to his companion  forgive my intruding laverick he said  you do remember me i hope  bellamy you know  i remember you quite well  we used to play together at lords even after we left school  bellamy smiled  that is so he answered  i see by the papers that you have kept up your cricket  mine alas has had to go  i have been too much of a rolling stone lately  do you know that i have come to ask you a favor  go ahead laverick interposed  mademoiselle idiale has a fancy to meet you bellamy explained you know or i dare say you have heard what a creature of whims she is  if you wont come across and be introduced like a good fellow she probably wont speak a word all through suppertime go off in a huff and my evening will be spoiled  laverick laughed heartily  a little smile played at the corner of zoes lipsnevertheless she was looking slightly anxious  under those circumstances remarked laverick perhaps i had better go  you will understand he added with a glance at zoe that i cannot stay for more than a second  naturally bellamy answered  if mademoiselle really has anything to say to you i will if i am permitted return for a moment  laverick introduced him to zoe  i am sure i have seen you at the universal he declared  youre in the front row arent you  i have seen you in that clever little stepdance and song in the second act  she nodded evidently pleased  does it seem clever to you she asked wistfully  you see we are all so tired of it  i think it is ripping bellamy declared  i shall have the pleasure again directly he added with a bow  the two men crossed the room  what the dickens does mademoiselle idiale want with me laverick demanded  does she know that i am a poor stockbroker struggling against hard times  bellamy shrugged his shoulders  she isnt the sort to care who or what you are he answered  and as for the rest i suppose she could buy any of us up if she wanted to  her interest in you is rather a curious one  no time to explain it now  shell tell you  louise smiled as he paused before her  she was certainly exquisitely beautiful  her dress her carriage her delicate hands even her voice were all perfection  she gave him the tips of her fingers as bellamy pronounced his name  it is so kind of you she said to come and speak to me  and indeed you will laugh when i tell you why i thought that i would like to say one word with you  laverick bowed  i am thankful mademoiselle he replied for anything which procures me such a pleasure  she smiled  ah you too are gallant she said  but indeed then i fear you will not be flattered when i tell you why i was so interested i read all your newspapers  i read of that terrible murder in crooked friars alley only a few days agois not that how you call the place  laverick was suddenly grave  what was this that was coming  one of the reports she continued says that the man was a foreigner  the makers name upon his clothes was austrian  i too come from that part of europeif not from austria from a country very nearand i am always interested in my countrypeople a few moments ago i asked my friend mr bellamy where is this crooked friars alley  just then he bowed to you and he answered me it is in the city  it is within a yard or two of the offices of the gentleman to whom i just have said goodevening  so i looked across at you and i thought that it was strange  laverick scarcely knew what to say  it was a terrible affair he admitted and as mr bellamy has told you it occurred within a few steps of my office  so far too the police seem completely at a loss  ah she went on shaking her head your police i am afraid they are not very clever  it is too bad but i am afraid that it is so tell me mr laverick is this then a very lonely spot where your offices are  not at all laverick replied  on the contrary in the daytime it might be called the heart of the cityof the moneymaking part of the city at any rate  only this thing you see seems to have taken place very late at night  when all the offices were closed she remarked  most of them laverick answered  mine as it happened was open late that night  i passed the spot within halfanhour or so of the time when the murder must have been committed  but that is terrible she declared shaking her head  tell me mr laverick if i drive to your office some morning you will show me this placeyes  if you are in earnest mademoiselle i will certainly do so but there is nothing there  it is just a passage  you give me your address she insisted and i think that i will come  you are a stockbroker mr bellamy tells me  well sometimes i have a good deal of money to invest i come to you and you will give me your advice  so  you have a card  laverick found one and scribbled his city address upon it  she thanked him and once more held out the tips of her fingers  so i shall see you again some day mr laverick  he bowed and recrossed the room  bellamy was standing talking to zoe  well he asked as laverick returned are you too going to throw yourself beneath the car  laverick shook his head  i do not think so he answered  our acquaintance promises to be a business one  mademoiselle spoke of investing some money though me  bellamy laughed  then you have kept your heart he remarked  ah well you have every reason  he bowed to zoe nodded to laverick and returned to his place laverick looked after him a little compassionately  poor fellow he said  who is he  he has some sort of a government appointment laverick answered they say he is hopelessly in love with mademoiselle idiale  why not zoe exclaimed  he is nice  she must care for some one  why do you pity him  they say too that she has no more heart than a stone laverick continued and that never a man has had even a kind word from her she is very patriotic and all the thoughts and love she has to spare from herself are given to her country  zoe shuddered  ah she murmured i do not like to think of heartless women perhaps she is not so cruel after all  to me she seems only very very sad  tell me mr laverick why did she send for you  i imagine said he that it was a whim  it must have been a whim     chapter xxi  mademoiselle idiales visit   laverick on the following morning found many things to think about  he was accustomed to lunch always at the same restaurant within a few yards of his office and with the same little company of friends  just as he was leaving an outside broker whom he knew slightly came across the room to him  tell me laverick he asked whats become of your partner  he has gone abroad for a few weeks  as a matter of fact we shall be announcing a change in the firm shortly  queer thing the broker remarked  i was in liverpool yesterday and i could have sworn that i saw him hanging around the docks  i should never have doubted it but morrison was always so careful about his appearance and this fellow was such a seedylooking individual  i called out to him and he vanished like a streak  it could scarcely have been morrison laverick said  he sailed several days ago for new york  that settles it the man declared passing on  all the same it was the most extraordinary likeness i ever saw  laverick on his way back went into a cable office and wrote out a marconigram to the lusitania        have you passenger arthur morrison on board  reply  he signed his name and paid for an answer  then he went back to his office  any one to see me he inquired  mr shepherd is here waiting his clerk told himqueer looking fellow who paid you two hundred and fifty pounds in cash for some railway stock  laverick nodded  ill see him he said  anything else  a lady rang upname sounded like a french one but we could none of us catch what it wasto say that she was coming down to see you  if it is mademoiselle idiale laverick directed i must see her directly she arrives  how are you shepherd he added nodding to the waiter as he passed towards his room  come in will you youve got your certificates all right  mr james shepherd had the air of a man with whom prosperity had not wholly agreed  he was paler and pastierlooking than ever and his little green eyes seemed even more restless  his attirea long rough overcoat over the livery of his professionscarcely enhanced the dignity of his appearance  well what is it laverick asked as soon as the door was closed  our bar is being watched the man declared  i dont think its anything to do with the police  seems to be a sort of foreign gang theyre all round the place morning noon and night  theyve pumped everybody  there isnt very much laverick remarked slowly for them to find out except from you  theyve found out something anyway shepherd continued  my junior waiter unfortunately who was asleep in the sittingroom told them he was sure there were customers in the place between ten and twelve on monday night because they woke him up twice talking theyre beginning to look at me a bit doubtful  i shouldnt worry laverick advised  the inquests on now and you havent been called  i dont fancy youre running any sort of risk  any one may say they believe there were people in the bar between those hours but there isnt any one who can contradict you outright  besides you havent sworn to anything  youve simply said as might be very possible that you dont remember any one  it makes me a bit nervous though shepherd remarked apologetically theyre a regular keenlooking tribe i can tell you  their eyes seem to follow you all over the place  i shall come in for a drink presently myself laverick declared i should like to see them  i might get an idea as to their nationality at any rate  very good sir  im sure im doing just as you suggested  ive said nothing about leaving but im beginning to grumble a bit at the work so as to pave the way  its a hard job and no mistake i had thirtynine chops between one and halfpast singlehanded too with only a boy to carry the bread and that and no one to serve the drinks unless they go to the counter for them  its more than one mans work mr laverick  laverick assented  so much the better he declared  all the more excuse for your leaving  youll be round sometime today sir then the man asked taking up his hat  i shall look in for a few moments for certain laverick answered if you get a chance you must point out to me one of those fellows  jim shepherd departed  there was a shouting of newspaper boys in the street outside  laverick sent out for a paper  the account of the inquest was brief enough and there were no witnesses called except the men who had found the dead body  the nature of the wounds was explained to the jury also the impossibility of their having been selfinflicted  in the absence of any police evidence or any identification the discussion as to the manner of the death was naturally limited  the jury contented themselves by bringing in a verdict of wilful murder against some person or persons unknown laverick laid down the paper  the completion of the inquest was at least the first definite step toward safety  the question now before him was what to do with that twenty thousand pounds  he sat at his desk looking into vacancy  after all had he paid too great a price  the millstone was gone from around his neck something new and incomprehensible had crept into his life yet for a background there was always this secret knowledge  a clerk announcing mademoiselle idiale broke in upon his reflections laverick rose from his seat to greet his visitor  she was wonderfully dressed as usual yet with the utmost simplicitya white serge gown with a large black hat but a gown that seemed to have been moulded on to her slim faultless figure  she brought with her a musical rustle a slight suggestion of subtle perfumesa perfume so thin and ethereal that it was unrecognizable except in its faint suggestion of hothouse flowers  she held out her hand to laverick who placed for her at once an easychair  this is indeed an honor mademoiselle  she inclined her head graciously  you are very kind said she  i know that here in the city you are very busy making money all the time so i must not stay long will you buy me some stockssome good safe stocks which will bring me in at least four per cent  i can promise to do that laverick answered  have you any choice  no i have no choice louise told him  i bring with me a chequesee i give it to youit is for six thousand pounds  i would like to buy some stocks with this and to know the names so that i may watch them in the paper  i like to see whether they go up or down but i do not wish to risk their going down too much  it is something like gambling but it is no trouble  your money shall be spent in a few minutes mademoiselle laverick assured her and i think i can promise you that for a week or two at any rate your stocks will go up  with regard to selling  i leave everything to you she interrupted only let me know what you propose  we will do our best laverick promised  it is good she said  money is a wonderful thing  without it one can do little  you have not forgotten mr laverick that you were going to show me this passage  certainly not  come with me now if you will  it is only a yard or two away  he took her out into the street  every clerk in the office forgot his manners and craned his neck  outside mademoiselle let fall her veil and passed unrecognized  laverick showed her the entry  it was just there he explained about half a dozen yards up on the left that the body was found  she looked at the place steadily  then she looked along the passage  where does it lead tothat she asked  come and i will show you  on the leftas they passed along the flagged pavementis st nicholas church and churchyard  on the right here there are just offices  the street in front of us is henschell street  all of those buildings are stockbrokers offices  and directly opposite she askedthat is a café is it nota restaurant as you would call it  laverick nodded  that is so he agreed  one goes in there sometimes for a drink  and a meeting place perhaps she inquired  it would probably be a meeting place  one might leave there and walk down this passage naturally enough  laverick inclined his head  as a matter of fact he declared i think that the evidence went to prove that there were no visitors in the restaurant that night you see all these offices round here close at six or seven oclock and the whole neighborhood becomes deserted  she shrugged her shoulders impatiently  your english police they do not know how to collect evidence  in the hands of frenchmen this mystery would have been solved long before now  the guilty person would be in the hands of the law as it is i suppose that he will go free  well we must give the police a chance at any rate answered laverick  they havent had much time so far  no she admitted they have not had much time i wonder  she hesitated for a moment and did not conclude her sentence  come she exclaimed with a little shiver let us go back to your office this place is not cheerful  all the time i think of that poor man it does make me frightened  laverick escorted his visitor back to the electric brougham which was waiting before his door  a list of stocks purchased on your behalf will reach you by tonights post he promised her  we shall do our best in your interests  he held out his hand but she seemed in no hurry to let him go  you are very kind mr laverick  i would like to see you again very soon  you have heard me sing in samson and delilah  not yet but i am hoping to very shortly  tonight she declared you must come to the opera house  i leave a box for you at the door  send me round a note that you are there and it is possible that i may see you  it is against the rules but for me there are no rules  laverick hesitating she leaned forward and looked into his face  you are doing something else she protested  you were perhaps thinking of taking out again the little girl with whom you were sitting last night  i had half promised  no no she exclaimed holding his hand tighter  she is not for youthat child  she is too young  she knows nothing  better to leave her alone  she is not for a man of the world like you  soon she would cease to amuse you  you would be dull and she would still care  oh there is so much tragedy in these things mr laverickso much tragedy for the woman  it is she always who suffers  you will take my advice  you will leave that little girl alone  laverick smiled  i am afraid said he that i cannot promise that so quickly  you see i have not known her long but she has very few friends and i think that she would miss me  perhaps he added after a seconds pause i care for her too much  it is not for you she answered scornfully to care too much an englishman he cares never enough  a woman to him is something amusinghis companion for a little of his spare time something to be pleased about to show off to his friendsto share even the passion of the moment  but an englishman he does not care too much  he never cares enough  he does not know what it is to care enough  mademoiselle there may be truth in what you say and again there may not  we have the name i know of being cold lovers but at least we are faithful  she held up her hand with a little grimace  oh how i do hate that word she exclaimed  who is there indeed who wishes that you would be faithful  how much we poor women do suffer from that  why can you never understand that a woman would be cared for very very much with all the strength and all the passion you can conceive but let it not last for too long  it gets weary  it gets stale  it is as you saythe englishman he cares very little perhaps but he cares always and the woman if she be an artiste and a woman she tires  but good afternoon mr laverick i must not keep you here on the pavement talking of these frivolous matters  you come tonight  you are very kind laverick said  if i may come until eleven oclock it would give me the greatest pleasure  as you will she declared  we shall see  i expect you then you ask for your box  if you wish it certainly  she smiled and waved her hand  you will tell him please she directed to drive to bond street  laverick reentered his office pausing for a minute to give his clerk instructions for the purchase of stocks for mademoiselle idiale  he had scarcely reached his own room when he was told that mr james shepherd wished to speak to him for a moment upon the telephone  he took up the receiver  who is it he asked  it is shepherd was the answer  is that mr laverick  yes  you were outside the restaurant here a few minutes ago shepherd continued  you had with you a ladya young tall lady with a veil  thats right laverick admitted  what about her  one of the two men who watch always here was reading the paper in the window shepherd went on hoarsely  he saw her with you and i heard him mutter something as though he had received a shock  he dropped his glass and his paper  he watched you every second of the time you were there until you had disappeared  then he too put on his hat and went out  anything else  nothing else was the reply  i thought you might like to know this sir  the man recognized the lady right enough  it seems queer laverick admitted  thank you for ringing me up shepherd  good morning  laverick leaned back in his chair  there was no doubt whatever now in his mind but that mademoiselle idiale for some reason or other was interested in this crime  her wish to see the place her introduction to him last night and her purchase of stocks were all part of a scheme  he was suddenly and absolutely convinced of it as friend or foe she was very certainly about to take her place amongst the few people over whom this tragedy loomed     chapter xxii  activity of austrian spies   louise left her brougham in piccadilly and walked across the green park  bellamy who was waiting rose up from a seat hat in hand she took his arm in foreign fashion  they walked together towards buckingham palacea strangely distinguishedlooking couple  my dear david she said the man perplexes me  to look at him to hear him speak one would swear that he was honest  he has just those clear blue eyes and the stolid face half stupid and half splendid of your athletic englishman  one would imagine him doing a foolishly honorable thing but he is not my conception of a criminal at all  bellamy kicked a pebble from the path  his forehead wore a perplexed frown  he didnt give himself away then  not in the least  he took you out and showed you the spot where it happened  without an instants hesitation  as a matter of curiosity asked bellamy did he try to make love to you  she shook her head  i even gave him an opening she said  of flirtation he has no more idea than the average stupid englishman one meets  bellamy was silent for several moments  i cant believe he said that there is the least doubt but that he has the money and the portfolio  i have made one or two other inquiries and i find that his firm was in very low water indeed only a week ago  they were spoken of in fact as being hopelessly insolvent  no one can imagine how they tided over the crisis  the man who was watching for you she inquired  he makes no mistakes bellamy assured her  he saw laverick enter that passage and come out  afterwards he went back to his office although he had closed up there and had been on his homeward way the thing could not have been accidental  why do you not go to him openly she suggested  he is after all an englishman and when you tell him what you know he will be very much in your power  tell him of the value of that document tell him that you must have it  it could be done bellamy admitted  i think that one of us must talk plainly to him  listen louiseare you seeing him again  i have invited him to come to the opera house tonight  see what you can do he begged  i would rather keep away from him myself if i can  have you heard anything of streuss  she shrugged her shoulders  nothing directly she replied but my rooms have been searchedeven my dressingroom at the opera house  that mans spies are simply wonderful  he seems able to plant them everywhere  and david  yes dear  he has got hold of lassen she continued  i am perfectly certain of it  then the sooner you get rid of lassen the better bellamy declared  it is so difficult she murmured in a perplexed tone  the man has all my affairs in his hands  up till now although he is uncomely and a brute in many ways he has served me well  if he is streusss creature he must go bellamy insisted  she nodded  let us sit down for a few minutes she said  i am tired  she sank on to a seat and bellamy sat by her side  in full view of them was buckingham palace with its flag flying  she looked thoughtfully at it and across to westminster  do they know i wonder your countrypeople she asked  halfadozen of them perhaps he answered gloomily no more  today she declared i seem to have lost confidence  i seem to feel the sense of impending calamity to hear the guns as i walk to see the terror fall upon the faces of all these great crowds who throng your streets  they are a stolid unbelieving peoplethese the blow when it comes will be the harder  bellamy sighed  you are right he said  when one comes to think of it it is amazing  how long the prophets of woe have preached and how completely their teachings have been ignored  the invasion bogey has been so long among us that it has become nothing but a jest even i in a way am one of the unbelievers  you are not serious david she exclaimed  i am he affirmed  i think that if we could read that document we should see that there is no plan there for the immediate invasion of england  i think you would find that the blow would be struck simultaneously at our colonies  we should either have to submit or send a considerable fleet away from home waters  then i presume the question of invasion would come again  all the time of course the gage would be flung down treaties would be defied we should be scorned as though we were a nation of weaklings  austria would gather in what she wanted and there would be no one to interfere  louise was very pale but her eyes were flashing fire  it is the most terrible thing which has happened in history she said this decadence of your country  once england held the scales of justice for the world  now she is no longer strong enough and there is none to take her place  david even if you know what that document contains even then will it help very much  very much indeed  dont you see that there is one hope left to usone hopeand that is russia  the czar must be made to withdraw from that compact  we want to know his share in it  when we know that there will be a secret mission sent to russia  germany and austria are strong but they are not all the world  with russia behind and france and england westward the struggle is at least an equal one  they have to face both directions they have to face two great armies working from the east and from the west  she nodded and they sat there in silence for several moments bellamy was thinking deeply  you say louise he asked looking up quickly that your rooms have been searched  when was this  only last night she replied  bellamy drew a little sigh of relief  at any rate he said streuss has no idea that the document is not in our possession  he knows nothing about laverick  how are we going to deal with him louise when he comes for his answer  you have a plan she asked  there is only one thing to be done bellamy declared  i shall say that we have already handed over the document to the english government  it will be a bluff pure and simple  he may believe it or he may not  you will break your compact then she reminded him  i shall call myself justified he continued  he has attempted to rob us of the document  you are sure of what you saythat your rooms and dressingroom have been searched  absolutely certain she declared  that will be sufficient bellamy decided  if streuss comes to me i shall meet him frankly  i shall tell him that he has tried to play the burglar and that it must be war  i shall tell him that the compact is in the hands of the prime minister and that he and his spies had better clear out  she looked at him questioningly  of course you understand he added there is one thing we can do and one thing only  we must send a mission to russia and another to france and before the german fleet can pass down the north sea we must declare war  it is the only thing left to usa bold front without that packet we have no casus belli  with it we can strike and strike hard  i still believe that if we declare war within seven days we shall save ourselves  streuss and kahn looked too across the panorama of london across the dingy adelphi gardens the turbid thames the smokehung world beyond  they were together in streusss sittingroom on the seventh floor of one of the great strand hotels  our enterprise is a failure kahn exclaimed gloomily  we cannot doubt it any longer  i think streuss that the best course you and i could adopt would be to realize it and to get back  we do no good here  we only run needless risks  the face of the other man was dark with anger  his tone when he spoke shook with passion  you dont know what you say kahn he cried hoarsely  i tell you that we must succeed  if that document reaches the hands of any one in authority here it would be the worst disaster which has fallen upon our country since you or i were born  you dont understand kahn  you keep your eyes closed  what men can do we have done the other answered  von behrling played us false  he has died a traitors death but it is very certain that he parted with his document before he received that twenty thousand pounds  once and for all i do not believe it streuss declared  at midday i can swear to it that the contents of that envelope were unknown to the ministers of the king here  now if von behrling had parted with that document last monday night dont you suppose that everything would be known by now  he did not part with it bellamy and mademoiselle lie when they say that they possess it that document remains in the possession of von behrlings murderer and it is for us to find him  kahn sighed  it is outside our spherethat  what can we do against the police of this country working in their own land  streuss struck the table before which they were standing  the veins in his temples were like whipcord  adolf he muttered you talk like a fool  cant you see what it means  if that document reaches its destination what do you suppose will happen  they will know our plans of course kahn answered  they will have time to make preparation  streuss laughed bitterly  worse than that he exclaimed  they are not all fools these english statesmen though one would think so to read their speeches cant you see what the result would be if that document reaches downing street  war at a moments notice war six months too soon dont you know that every shipbuilding yard in germany is working night and day  dont you know that every nerve is being strained that the muscles of the country are hammering the rivets into our new battleships  there is but one chance for this country and if her statesmen read that document they will know what it is  it is open to them to destroy the german navy utterly to render themselves secure against attack  they would never have the courage kahn declared  they might make a show of defending themselves if they were attacked but to take the initiativeno  i do not believe it  there is one man who has wit enough to do it streuss said  he may not be in the cabinet but he commands it  kahn wake up man you and i together have never known what failure means  i tell you that that document is still to be bought or fought for and we must find it  this morning mademoiselle drove into the city and called at the offices of a stockbroker within a dozen yards of crooked friars alley  she was there a long time  the stockbroker himself came out with her into the street took her to see the entry stood with her there and returned  what was her interest in him kahn his name is laverick  four days ago he was on the brink of ruin to the amazement of every one he met all his engagements  why did mademoiselle go to the city to see him  he was at his office late that tuesday night  he had a partner who has disappeared  kahn looked at his companion with admiration  you have found all this out he exclaimed  and more streuss declared  for twentyfour hours this man laverick has not moved without my spies at his heels  why not approach him boldly kahn suggested  if he has the document let us outbid mademoiselle louise and do it quickly  streuss shook his head  you dont know the man  he is an englishman and if he had any idea what that document contained our chances of buying it would be small indeed  this is what i think will happen  mademoiselle will try to obtain it and try in vain  then bellamy will tell him the truth and he will part with it willingly  in the meantime i believe that it is in his possession  the evidence is slender enough objected kahn  what if it is streuss exclaimed  if it is only a hundred to one chance we have to take it  i have no fancy for disgrace adolf and i know very well what will happen if we go back emptyhanded  the telephone bell rang  streuss took off the receiver and held it to his ear  the words which he spoke were few but when he laid the instrument down there was a certain amount of satisfaction in his face  at any rate he announced this man laverick did not part with the document today  mademoiselle louise and bellamy have been sitting in the park for an hour  when they separated she drove home and dropped him at his club  up till now then they have not the document  we shall see what mr laverick does when he leaves business this evening if he goes straight home either the document has never been in his possession or else it is in the safe in his office if he goes to mademoiselle idiales  well kahn asked eagerly  if he goes to mademoiselle idiales streuss repeated slowly there is still a chance for us     chapter xxiii  laverick at the opera   laverick in presenting his card at the box office at covent garden that evening did so without the slightest misconception of the reasons which had prompted mademoiselle idiale to beg him to become her guest it was sheer curiosity which prompted him to pursue this adventure  he was perfectly convinced that personally he had no interest for her  in some way or other he had become connected in her mind with the murder which had taken place within a few yards of his office and in some other equally mysterious manner that murder had become a subject of interest to her  either that or this was one of the whims of a spoiled and pleasuresurfeited woman  he found an excellent box reserved for him and a measure of courtesy from the attendants not often vouchsafed to an ordinary visitor  the opera was samson and delilah and even before her wonderful voice thrilled the house it seemed to laverick that no person more lovely than the woman he had come to see had ever moved upon any stage  it appeared impossible that movement so graceful and passionate should remain so absolutely effortless  there seemed to be some strange power inside the woman  surely her will guided her feet  the necessity for physical effort never once appeared  notwithstanding the slight prejudice which he had felt against her it was impossible to keep his admiration altogether in check  the fascination of her wonderful presence and then her glorious voice moved him with the rest of the audience  he clapped as the others did at the end of the first act and he leaned forward just as eagerly to catch a glimpse of her when she reappeared and stood there with that marvelous smile upon her lips accepting with faint deprecating gratitude the homage of the packed house  just before the curtain rose upon the second act there was a knock at his box door  one of the attendants ushered in a short man of somewhat remarkable personality  he was barely five feet in height and an extremely fat neck and a corpulent body gave him almost the appearance of a hunchback  he had black beady eyes a black moustache fiercely turned up and sallow skin  his white gloves had curious stitchings on the back not common in england and his silk hat exceedingly glossy had wider brims than are usually associated with bond street  laverick half rose but the little man spread out one hand and commenced to speak  his accent was foreign but if not an englishman he at any rate spoke the language with confidence  my dear sir he began i owe you many apologies  it was mademoiselle idiales wish that i should make your acquaintance my name is lassen  i have the fortune to be mademoiselles business manager  i am very glad to meet you mr lassen said laverick  will you sit down  mr lassen thereupon hung his hat upon a peg removed his overcoat straightened his white tie with the aid of a lookingglass brushed back his glossy black hair with the palms of his hands and took the seat opposite laverick  his first question was inevitable  what do you think of the opera sir  it is like mademoiselle idiale herself laverick answered  it is above criticism  she is mr lassen said firmly the loveliest woman in europe and her voice is the most wonderful  it is a great combination this  i myself have managed for many stars i have brought to england most of those whose names are known during the last ten years but there has never been another louise idialenever will be  i can believe it laverick admitted  she has wonderful qualities too continued mr lassen  your acquaintance with her i believe sir is of the shortest  that is so laverick answered a little coldly  he was not particularly taken with his visitor  mademoiselle has spoken to me of you the latter proceeded she desired that i should pay my respects during the performance  it is very kind of you laverick answered  as a matter of fact it is exceedingly kind also of mademoiselle idiale to insist upon my coming here tonight  she did me the honor as you may know of paying me a visit in the city this morning  so she did tell me mr lassen declared  mademoiselle is a great woman of business  most of her investments she controls herself  she has whims however and it never does to contradict her  she has also curiously enough a preference for the men of affairs  laverick had reached that stage when he felt indisposed to discuss mademoiselle any longer with a stranger even though that stranger should be her manager  he nodded and took up his programme  as he did so the curtain rang up upon the next act  laverick turned deliberately towards the stage  the little man had paid his respects as he put it  laverick felt disinclined for further conversation with him  yet though his head was turned he knew very well that his companions eyes were fixed upon him  he had an uncomfortable sense that he was an object of more than ordinary interest to this visitor that he had come for some specific object which as yet he had not declared  you will like to go round and see mademoiselle the latter remarked some time afterwards  laverick shook his head  i shall find another opportunity i hope to congratulate her  but my dear sir she expects to see you mr lassen protested you are here at her invitation  it is usual i can assure you  mademoiselle idiale will perhaps excuse me laverick said  i have an engagement immediately after the performance is over  his companion muttered something which laverick could not catch and made some excuse to leave the box a few minutes later  when he returned he carried a little note which he presented to laverick with an air of triumph  it is as i said he exclaimed  mademoiselle expects you  laverick read the few lines which she had written     i wish to see you after the performance  if you cannot come   round or escort me yourself will you come later to the restaurant   of luigi where as always i shall sup  do not fail                                                     louise idiale   laverick placed the note in his waistcoat pocket without immediate remark  later on he turned to his companion  will you tell mademoiselle idiale he said that i will do myself the honor of coming to her at luigis restaurant  i have an engagement after the performance which i must keep  you will certainly come lassen asked anxiously  without a doubt laverick promised  mr lassen took up his hat  i will go and tell mademoiselle  for some reason or other she seemed particularly desirous of seeing you this evening  she has her whims and those who have most to do with her like myself find it well to keep them gratified  if i do not see you again sir permit me to wish you good evening  he disappeared with several bows of his pudgy little person and laverick was left with another puzzle to solve  he was not in the least conceited and he did not for a moment misinterpret this womans interest in him  her invitation he knew very well was one which half london would have coveted  yet it meant nothing personal he was sure of that  it simply meant that for some mysterious reason the same reason which had prompted her to visit him in the city he was of interest to her  at a few minutes before eleven laverick left the place and drove to the stagedoor of the universal theatre  zoe came out among the first and paused upon the threshold looking up and down the street eagerly  when she recognized him her smile was heavenly  oh how nice of you she exclaimed stepping at once into his taxicab  you dont know how different it feels to hope that there is some one waiting for you and then to find your hope come true tonight i was not sure  you had said nothing about it and yet i could not help believing that you would be here  i was hoping he said that we might have another supper together unfortunately i have an engagement  an engagement she repeated her face falling  laverick loved the truth and he seldom hesitated to tell it  it is rather an odd thing he declared  you remember that woman at luigis last nightmademoiselle idiale  of course  she came to my office today and gave me six thousand pounds to invest for her  she made me take her out and show her where the murder was committed and asked a great many questions about it then she insisted that i should go and hear her sing this evening and i find that i was expected to take her on to supper afterwards i excused myself for a little while but i have promised to go to luigis where she will be  the girl was silent for a moment  where are we going now then she asked  wherever you like  i can take you home first or i can leave you anywhere  she looked at him with a piteous little smile  the last two nights you have spoiled me she said  i have so many evil thoughts and i am afraid to go home  i am sorry  if i could think of anything or anywhere  no you must take me home please said she  it was selfish of me  only mademoiselle idiale is such a wonderful person  do you think that she will want you every night  of course not he laughed  come i will make an engagement with you  we will have supper together tomorrow evening  she brightened up at once  i wonder she asked timidly a few minutes afterwards have you heard anything from arthur  he promised to send a telegram from queenstown  laverick shook his head  he said nothing about the marconigram he had sent or the answer which he had received informing him that there was no such person on board  it seemed scarcely worth while to worry her  i have heard nothing he replied  of course he must be halfway to america by now  there have been no more inquiries about him she asked  no more than the usual ones from his friends and a few creditors the latter i am paying as they come  but there is one thing you ought to do with me  i think we ought to go to his rooms and lock up his papers and letters  he never even went back you know after that night  she nodded thoughtfully  when would you like to do this  i am so busy just now that i am afraid i can spare no time until monday afternoon  would you go with me then  of course  my time is my own  we have no matinee and i have nothing to do except in the evening  they had reached her home  it looked very dark and very uninviting she shivered as she took her latchkey from the bag which she was carrying  come in with me please while i light the gas she begged  it looks so dreary doesnt it  you ought to have some one with you he declared especially in a part like this  oh i am not really afraid she answered  i am only lonely  he stood in the passage while she felt for a box of matches and lit the gas jet  in the parlor there was a bowl of milk standing waiting for her and some bread  thank you so much she said  now i am going to make up the fire and read for a short time  i hope that you will enjoy your supperwell moderately she added with a little laugh  i can promise you he answered that i shall enjoy it no more than last nights or tomorrow nights  she sighed  poor little me she exclaimed  it is not fair to have to compete with mademoiselle idiale  good night  something he saw in her eyes moved him strangely as he turned away  would you like me he asked hesitatingly supposing i get away earlywould you like me to come in and say good night to you later on  her face was suddenly flushed with joy  oh do she begged  do  he turned away with a smile  very well he said  dont shut up just yet and i will try  i shall stay here until three oclock she declareduntil four even  you must come  remember you must come  see  she held out to him her key  i can knock at the door he protested  you would hear me  but i might fall asleep she answered  i am afraid  if you have the key i am sure that you will come  he put it in his waistcoat pocket with a laugh  very well he said if it is only for five minutes i will come     chapter xxiv  a supper party at luigis   laverick walked into luigis restaurant at about a quarter to twelve and found the place crowded with many little supperparties on their way to a fancy dress ball  the demand for tables was far in excess of the supply but he had scarcely shown himself before the head maitre dhotel came hurrying up  mademoiselle idiale is waiting for you sir he announced at once will you be so good as to come this way  laverick followed him  she was sitting at the same table as last night but she was alone and it was laid he noticed with surprise only for two  you have treated me she said as she held out her fingers to a new sensation  i have waited for you alone here for a quarter of an houri  such a thing has never happened to me before  you do me too much honor laverick declared seating himself and taking up the carte  then too she continued i sup alone with you  that is what i seldom do with any man  not that i care for the appearance she added with a contemptuous wave of the hand  nothing troubles me less  it is simply that one man alone wearies me  almost always he will make love and that i do not like  you mr laverick i am not afraid of  i do not think that you will make love to me  any intentions i may have had laverick remarked with a sigh i forthwith banish  you ask a hard task of your cavaliers though mademoiselle  she smiled and looked at him from under her eyelids  not of you i fancy mr laverick she said  i do not think that you are one of those who make love to every woman because she is goodlooking or famous  to tell you the truth laverick admitted i find it hard to make love to any one  i often feel the most profound admiration for individual members of your sex but to express ones self is difficultsometimes it is even embarrassing  for supper  it is ordered she declared  you are my guest  impossible laverick asserted firmly  i have been your guest at the opera  you at least owe me the honor of being mine for supper  she frowned a little  she was obviously unused to being contradicted  i sup with you then another night she insisted  no she continued if you are going to look like that i take it back  i sup with you tonight  this is an ill omen for our future acquaintance  i have given in to you alreadyi who give in to no man  give me some champagne please  laverick took the bottle from the icepail by his side but the sommelier darted forward and served them  i drink to our better understanding of one another mr laverick she said raising her glass and if you would like a double toast i drink also to the early gratification of the curiosity which is consuming you  the curiosity  yes  you are wondering all the time why it is that i chose last night to send and have you presented to me why i came to your office in the city today with the excuse of investing money with you why i invited you to the opera tonight why i commanded you to supper here and am supping with you alone  now confess the truth you are full of curiosity is it not so  frankly i am  she smiled goodhumoredly  i knew it quite well  you are not conceited  you do not believe as so many men would that i have fallen in love with you  you think that there must be some object and you ask yourself all the time what is it in your heart mr laverick i wonder whether you have any idea  her voice had fallen almost to a whisper  she looked at him with a suggestion of stealthiness from under her eyelids a look which only needed the slightest softening of her face to have made it something almost irresistible  i can assure you laverick said firmly that i have no idea  do you remember almost my first question to you she asked  it was about the murder  you seemed interested in the fact that my office was within a few yards of the passage where it occurred  quite right she admitted  i see that your memory is very good there then mr laverick you have the secret of my desire to meet you  laverick drank his wine slowly  the woman knew  impossible  her eyes were watching his face but he held himself bravely  what could she know  how could she guess  frankly he said i do not understand  your interest in me arises from the fact that my offices are near the scene of that murder  well to begin with what concern have you in that  the murdered man she declared thoughtfully was an acquaintance of mine  an acquaintance of yours laverick exclaimed  why he has not been identified  no one knows who he was  she raised her eyebrows very slightly  mr laverick she murmured the newspapers do not tell you everything  i repeat that the murdered man was an acquaintance of mine  only three days ago i traveled part of the way from vienna with him  laverick was intensely interested  you could perhaps throw some light then upon his death  perhaps i could she answered  i can tell you one thing at any rate mr laverick if it is news to you  at the time when he was murdered he was carrying a very large sum of money with him  this is a fact which has not been spoken of in the press  once again laverick was thankful for those nerves of his  he sat quite still  his face exhibited nothing more than the blank amazement which he certainly felt  this is marvelous he said  have you told the police  i have not she answered  i wish if i can to avoid telling the police  but the money  to whom did it belong  not to the murdered man  to any one whom you know of he inquired  i wonder she said after a moment of hesitation whether i am telling you too much  you are telling me a good deal he admitted frankly  i wonder how far she asked you will be inclined to reciprocate  i reciprocate he exclaimed  but what can i do  what do i know of these things  she stretched out her hand lazily and drew towards her a wonderful gold purse set with emeralds  carefully opening it she drew from the interior a small flat pocketbook also of gold with a great uncut emerald set into its centre  this too she opened and drew out several sheets of foreign notepaper pinned together at the top these she glanced through until she came to the third or fourth then she bent it down and passed it across the table to laverick  you may read that she said  it is part of a report which i have had in my pos session since wednesday morning  laverick drew the sheet towards him and read in thin angular characters very distinct and plain            some ten minutes after the assault a policeman passed down           the street but did not glance toward the passage  the next           person to appear was a gentleman who left some offices on the           same side as the passage and walked down evidently on his           homeward way  he glanced up the passage and saw the body           lying there  he disappeared for a moment and struck a match           a minute afterwards he emerged from the passage looked up and           down the street and finding it empty returned to the office           from which he had issued let himself in with his latchkey           and closed the door behind him  he was there for about ten           minutes  when he reappeared he walked quickly down the street           and for obvious reasons i was unable to follow him            the address of the offices which he left and reentered was           messrs laverick  morrison stockbrokers  that interests you mr laverick she asked softly  he handed it back to her  it interests me very much he answered  who was this unseen person who wrote from the clouds  i may not tell you all my secrets mr laverick she declared what have you done with that twenty thousand pounds  laverick helped himself to champagne  he listened for a moment to the music and looked into the wonderful eyes which shone from that beautiful face a few feet away  her lips were slightly parted her forehead wrinkled  there was nothing of the accuser in her countenance a gentle irony was its most poignant expression  is this a fairy tale mademoiselle idiale  she shrugged her shoulders  it might seem so she answered  sometimes i think that all the time we live two livesthe life of which the world sees the outside and the life inside of which no one save ourselves knows anything at all  look for instance at all these peoplethese chorus girls and young men about townthe older ones tooall hungry for pleasure all drinking at the cup of life as though they had indeed but today and tomorrow in which to live and enjoy have they no shadows too no secrets  they seem so harmless yet if the great white truth shone down might one not find a murderer there a dying man who knew his terrible secret yonder a croesus on the verge of bankruptcy a strong man playing with dishonor  but those are the things of the other world which we do not see  the men look at us tonight and they envy you because you are with me the women envy me more because i have emeralds upon my neck and shoulders for which they would give their souls and a fame throughout europe which would turn their foolish heads in a very few minutes  but they do not know  there are the shadows across my path and i think that there are the shadows across yours  what do you say mr laverick  he looked at her curiously moved  now at last he began to believe that it was true what they said of her that she was indeed a marvelous woman  she had a fame which would have contented nine hundred and ninetynine women out of a thousand  she had beauty and more wonderful still the grace the fascination which are irresistible  she had but to lift a finger and there were few who would not kneel to do her bidding  and yet behind it all there were other things in her life  had she sought them or had they come to her  you are one of those wise people mr laverick she said who realize the danger of words  you believe in silence  well silence is often good  you do not choose to admit anything  what is there for me to admit  do you want to know whether i am the man who left those offices who disappeared into the passage who reappeared again  with a pocketbook containing twenty thousand pounds she murmured across the flowers  at least tell me this he demanded  was the money yours  i am not like you she replied  i have talked a great deal and i have reached the limit of the things which i may tell you  but where are we he asked  are you seriously accusing me of having robbed this murdered man  be thankful she declared that i am not accusing you of having murdered him  but seriously he insisted am i on my defence have i to account for my movements that night as against the written word of your mysterious informant  is it you who are charging me with being a thief  is it to you i am to account for my actions to defend myself or to plead guilty  she shook her head  no she answered  i have said almost my last word to you upon this subject  all that i have to ask of you is this  if that pocketbook is in your possession empty it first of its contents then go over it carefully with your fingers and see if there is not a secret pocket  if you discover that i think that you will find in it a sealed document  if you find that document you must bring it to me  the lights went down  the voice of the waiter murmured something in his ears  it is after hours mademoiselle idiale said but luigi does not wish to disturb us  still perhaps we had better go  they passed down the room  to laverick it was alllike a dreamthe laughing crowd the flushed men and brighteyed women the lowered lights the air of voluptuousness which somehow seemed to have enfolded the place  in the hall her maid came up  a small motorbrougham with two servants on the box was standing at the doorway  mademoiselle turned suddenly and gave him her hand  our supperparty i think mr laverick she said has been quite a success  we shall before long i hope meet again  he handed her into the carriage  her maid walked with them  the footman stood erect by his side  there were no further words to be spoken  a little crowd in the doorway envied him as he stood bareheaded upon the pavement     chapter xxv  jim shepherds scare   it was in its way a pathetic sight upon which laverick gazed when he stole into that shabby little sittingroom  zoe had fallen asleep in a small uncomfortable easychair with its back to the window  her supper of bread and milk was half finished her hat lay upon the table  a book was upon her lap as though she had started to read only to find it slip through her fingers  he stood with his elbow upon the mantelpiece looking down at her  her eyelashes long and silky were more beautiful than ever now that her eyes were closed  her complexion pale though she was seemed more the creamy pallor of some southern race than the whiteness of illhealth  the bodice of her dress was open a few inches at the neck showing the faint white smoothness of her flawless skin not even her shabby shoes could conceal the perfect shape of her feet and ankles  once more he remembered his first simile his first thought of her  she seemed indeed like some dainty statuette uncouthly clad who had strayed from a world of her own upon rough days and found herself illequipped indeed for the struggle  his heart grew hot with anger against morrison as he stood and watched her  supposing she had been different  it would have been his fault leaving her alone to battle her way through the most difficult of all lives  brute  he had muttered the word half aloud and she suddenly opened her eyes  at first she seemed bewildered  then she smiled and sat up  i have been asleep she exclaimed  a most unnecessary statement he answered smiling  i have been standing looking at you for five minutes at least  how fortunate that i gave you the key she declared  i dont suppose i should ever have heard you  now please stand there in the light and let me look at you  why  i want to look at a man who has had supper with mademoiselle idiale  he shrugged his shoulders  am i supposed to be a wanderer out of paradise then  she looked at him doubtfully  they tell strange stories about her she said but oh she is so beautiful  if i were a man i should fall in love with her if she even looked my way  then i am glad he answered that i am less impressionable  and you are not in love with her she asked eagerly  why should i be he laughed  she is like a wonderful picture a marvelous statue if you will  everything about her is faultless but one looks at these things calmly enough you know  it is life which stirs life  do you think that there is no life in her veins then zoe asked  if there is he answered i do not think that i am the man to stir it  she drew a little sigh of content  you see she said you are my first admirer and i havent the least desire to let you go  incredible he declared  but it is true she answered earnestly  you would not have me talk to these boys who come and hang on at the stagedoor  the men to whom i have been introduced by the other girls have been very few and they have not been very nice and they have not cared for me and i have not cared for them  i think she said disconsolately i am too small  every one today seems to like big women  cora sinclair who is just behind me in the chorus gets bouquets every night and simply chooses with whom she should go out to supper  laverick looked grave  you are not envying her he asked  not in the least as long as i too am taken out sometimes  laverick smiled and sat on the arm of her chair  miss zoe he said i have come because you told me to just to prove you see that i am not in the toils of mademoiselle idiale but do you know that it is half past one  i must not stay here any longer  she sighed once more  you are right she admitted but it is so lonely  i have never been here without may and her mother  i have never slept alone in the house before the other night  if i had known that they were going away i should never have dared to come here  it is too bad he declared  couldnt you get one of the other girls to stay with you  she shook her head  there are one or two whom i would like to have she said but they are all living either at home or with relatives  the others i am afraid about  they seem to like to sit up so late and  you are quite right he interrupted hastilyquite right  you are better alone  but you ought to have a servant  she laughed  on two pounds fifteen a week she asked  you must remember that i could not even live here only i have practically no rent to pay  he fidgeted for a moment  miss zoe he said i am perfectly serious when i tell you that i have money which should go to your brother  why will you not let me alter your arrangements just a little  i cannot bear to think of you here all alone  it is very kind of you she answered doubtfully but please no somehow i think that it would spoil everything if i accepted that sort of help from you  if you have any money of arthurs keep it for a time and i think when you write himi do not want to seem graspingbut i think if he has any to spare you might suggest that he does give me just a little  i have never had anything from him at all  perhaps he does not quite understand how hard it is for me  i will do that of course laverick answered but i wish you would let me at least pay over a little of what i consider due to you  i will take the responsibility for it  it will come from him and not from me  she remained unconvinced  i would rather wait she said  if you really want to give me something i will let youout of my brothers money of course i mean she added  i havent anything saved at all or i wouldnt have that  but one day you shall take me out and buy me a dress and hat  you can tell arthur directly you write to him  i dont mind that for sometimes i do feel ashamedi did the other night to have you sit with me there and to feel that i was dressed so very differently from all of them  he laughed reassuringly  i dont think men notice those things  to me you seemed just as you should seem  i only know that i was glad enough to be there with you  were yourather wistfully  of course i was  now i am going but before i go dont forget monday afternoon  well have lunch and then go to your brothers rooms  she glanced at the clock  is it really so late she asked  it is  dont you notice how quiet it is outside  they stood hand in hand for a moment  a strange silence seemed to have fallen upon the streets  laverick was suddenly conscious of something which he had never felt when mademoiselle idiale had smiled upon hima quickening of the pulses a sense of gathering excitement which almost took his breath away  his eyes were fixed upon hers and he seemed to see the reflection of that same wave of feeling in her own expressive face  her lips trembled her eyes were deeper and softer than ever  they seemed to be asking him a question asking and asking till every fibre of his body was concentrated in the desperate effort with which he kept her at arms length  is it so very late she whispered coming just a little closer so that she was indeed almost within the shelter of his arms  he clutched her hands almost roughly and raised them to his lips  much too late for me to stay here child he said and his voice even to himself sounded hard and unnatural  run along to bed  tomorrow nighttomorrow night then i will fetch you  goodbye  he let himself out  he did not even look behind to the spot where he had left her  he closed the front door and walked with swift almost savage footsteps down the quiet street across the square and into new oxford street  here he seemed to breathe more freely he called a hansom and drove to his rooms  the hallporter had left his post in the front hall and there was no one to inform laverick that a visitor was awaiting him  when he entered his sittingroom however he gave a little start of surprise mr james shepherd was reclining in his easychair with his hands upon his kneesmr james shepherd with his face more pasty even than usual his eyes a trifle greener his whole demeanor one of unconcealed and unaffected terror  hullo laverick exclaimed  what the dickenswhat do you want here shepherd  upon my word sir im not sure that i know the man replied but im scared  ive brought you back the certificates of them shares  i want you to keep them for me  im terrified lest they come and search my room  i am i tell you fair  im terrified to order a pint of beer for myself  theyre watching me all the time  who are laverick demanded  lord knows who shepherd answered but theres two of them at it i told you about them as asked questions and i thought there wed done and finished with it  not a bit of it  there was another one there this afternoon said he was a journalist making sketches of the passage and asking me no end of questions  he wasnt no journalist ill swear to that  i asked him about his paper halfadozen he declared  theyre all glad to have what i send them journalist  lord knows who the other chap was and what he was asking questions for but this one was a tec straight  joe forman he was in today looking after my place for id given a months notice and he says to me you see that big chapmeaning him as had been asking me the questionsand i says yes and he says thats a tee  ive seed him in a police court giving evidence  i went all of a shiver so that you could have knocked me down  come come said laverick  theres no need for you to be feeling like this about it  all that youve done is not to have remembered those two customers who were in your restaurant late one night theres nothing criminal in that  theres something criminal in having two hundred and fifty pounds worth of shares in ones pocketsomething suspicious anyway shepherd declared plumping them down on the table  i aint giving you these back mind but you must keep em for me  i wish id never given notice  i think ill ask the boss to keep me on  why do you suppose that this man is particularly interested in you laverick inquired  aint i told you shepherd exclaimed sitting up  why hes been to my place down in ammersmith asking questions about me my landlady swears he didnt go into my room but who can tell whether he did or not  those sort of chaps can get in anywhere then i went out for a bit of an airing after the one oclock rush was over today and im danged if he wasnt at my eels  i seed him coming round by liverpool street just as i went in a bar to get a drop of something  laverick frowned  if there is anything in this story shepherd he said if you are really being followed what a thundering fool you were to come here  all the world knows that arthur morrison was my partner  i couldnt help it sir the man declared  i couldnt indeed i was so scared i felt i must speak about it to some one  and then there were these shares  there was nowhere i could keep em safe  look here laverick went on youre alarming yourself about nothing  in any case there is only one thing for you to do  pull yourself together and put a bold face upon it  ill keep these certificates for you and when you want some money you can come to me for it  go back to your place and if your master is willing to keep you on perhaps it would be a good thing to stay there for another month or so  but dont let any one see that youre frightened  remember theres nothing that you can get into trouble for  no ones obliged to answer such questions as youve been asked except in a court and under oath  stick to your story and if you take my advice laverick added glancing at his visitors shaking fingers you will keep away from the drink  its little enough ive had sir shepherd assured him  a drop now and then just to keep up ones spiritsnothing that amounts to anything  make it as little as possible laverick said  remember im back of you ill see that you get into no trouble  and dont come here again  come to my office if you liketheres nothing in thatbut dont come here you understand  shepherd took up his hat  i understand sir  im sorry to have troubled you but the sight of that man following me about fairly gave me the shivers  come into the office as often as you like in reason laverick said showing him out but not here again  keep your eyes open and let me know if you think youve been followed here  theres no more news in the papers sir  nothing turned up  nothing replied laverick  if the police have found out anything at all they will keep it until after the inquest  and youve heard nothing sir shepherd asked speaking in a hoarse whisper of mr morrison  nothing laverick answered  mr morrison is abroad  the man wiped his forehead with his hand  of course he muttered  a good job too for him     chapter xxvi  the document discovered   on the following morning laverick surprised his office cleaner and one errandboy by appearing at about a quarter to nine  he found a woman busy brushing out his room and a man cleaning the windows they stared at him in amazement  his arrival at such an hour was absolutely unprecedented  you can leave the office just as it is if you please he told them  i have a few things to attend to at once  he was accordingly left alone  he had reckoned upon this as being the one period during the day when he could rely upon not being disturbed  nevertheless he locked the door so as to be secure against any possible intruder  then he went to his safe unlocked it and drew from its secret drawer the worn brownleather pocketbook  first of all he took out the notes and laid them upon the table then he felt the pocketbook all over and his heart gave a little leap  it was true what mademoiselle idiale had told him  on one side there was distinctly a rustling as of paper  he opened the case quite flat and passed his fingers carefully over the lining very soon he found the openingit was simply a matter of drawing down the stiff silk lining from underneath the overlapping edge thrusting in his fingers he drew out a long foreign envelope securely sealed  scarcely stopping to glance at it he rearranged the pocketbook replaced the notes and locked it up again  then he unbolted his door and sat down at his desk with the document which he had discovered on the pad in front of him  there was not much to be made of it  there was no address but the black seal at the end bore the impression of a foreign coat of arms and a motto which to him was indecipherable  he held it up to the light but the outside sheet had not been written on and he gained no idea as to its contents  he leaned back in his chair for a moment and looked at it  so this was the document which would probably reveal the secret of the murder in crooked friars alley this was the document which mademoiselle idiale considered of so much more importance than the fortune represented by that packet of banknotes  what did it all mean  was this man who had either expiated a crime or been the victim of a terrible vengeancewas he a politician a dealer in trade secrets a member of a secret society an informer  or was he one of the underground criminals of the world one of those who crawl beneath the surface of known thingsa creature of the dark places  perhaps during those few minutes when his brain was cool and active with the great city awakening all around him laverick realized more completely than ever before exactly how he stood  without doubt he was walking on the brink of a precipice  four days ago there had been nothing for him but ruin  the means of salvation had suddenly presented themselves in this startling and dramatic manner and without hesitation he had embraced them  what did it all amount to  how far was he guilty and of what  was he a thief  the law would probably call him so  the law might have even more to say  it would say that by keeping his mouth closed as to his adventure on that night he had ranged himself on the side of the criminalshe was guilty not only of technical theft but of a criminal knowledge of this terrible crime  events had followed upon one another so rapidly during these last few days that he had little enough time for reflection little time to realize exactly how he stood  the longexpected boom in unions the coming of zoe the strange advances made to him by mademoiselle idiale her incomprehensible connection with this tragedy across which he had stumbled and her apparent knowledge of his share in itthese things were sufficient indeed to give him food for thought  laverick was not by nature a pessimist other things being equal he would have made without doubt a magnificent soldier for he had courage of a rare and high order  it never occurred to him to sit and brood upon his own danger he rather welcomed the opportunity of occupying his mind with other thoughts  yet in those few minutes while he waited for the business of the day to commence he looked his exact position in the face and he realized more thoroughly how grave it really was  how was he to find a way outto set himself right with the law  what could he do with those notes  they were there untouched  he had only made use of them in an indirect way  they were there intact as he had picked them up upon that fateful night  was there any possible chance by means of which he might discover the owner and restore them in such a way that his name might never be mentioned his eyes repeatedly sought that envelope which lay before him inside it must lie the secret of the whole tragedy  should he risk everything and break the seal or should he risk perhaps as much and tell the whole truth to mademoiselle idiale  it was a strange dilemma for a man to find himself in  then as he sat there the business of the day commenced  a pile of letters was brought in the telephones in the outer office began to ring  he thrust the sealed envelope into the breastpocket of his coat and buttoned it up  there for the present it must remain he owed it to himself to devote every energy he possessed to make the most of this great tide of business  with set face he closed the doors upon the unreal world and took hold of the levers which were to guide his passage through the one in which he was an actual figure  her visit was not altogether unexpected and yet when they told him that mademoiselle idiale was outside he hesitated  it is the lady who was here the other day his head clerk reminded him  we made a remarkably good choice of stocks for her  they must be showing nearly sixteen hundred pounds profit  perhaps she wants to realize  in any case you had better show her in said laverick  she came bringing with her notwithstanding her black clothes and heavy veil the atmosphere of a strange world into his somewhat severely furnished office  her skirts swept his carpet with a musical swirl  she carried with her a faint indefinable perfume of violetsa perfume altogether peculiar dedicated to her by a famous chemist in the rue royale and supplied to no other person upon earth  who else was there indeed who could have walked those few yards as she walked  he rose to his feet and pointed to a chair  you have come to ask about your shares he asked politely  so far we have nothing but good news for you  she recognized that he spoke to her in the presence of his clerk and she waved her hand  women who will come themselves to look after their poor investments are a nuisance i suppose she said  but indeed i will not keep you long  a few minutes are all that i shall ask of you  i am beginning to find city affairs so interesting  they were alone by now and louise raised her veil raised it so high that he could see her eyes  she leaned back in her chair supporting her chin with the long exquisite fingers of her right hand  she looked at him thoughtfully  you have examined the pocketbook she asked  i have  and the document was there  the document was there he admitted  perhaps you can tell me how it would be addressed  looking at her closely it came to him that her indifference was assumed  she was shivering slightly as though with cold  i imagine that there would be no address she said  you are right  that document is in my pocket  what are you going to do with it she asked  what do you advise me to do with it  give it to me  have you any claim  she leaned a little nearer to him  at least i have more claim to it she whispered than you to that twenty thousand pounds  i do not claim them he replied  they are in my safe at this moment untouched  they are there ready to be returned to their proper owner  why do you not find himwith a note of incredulity in her tone  how am i to do that laverick demanded  we waste words she continued coldly  i think that if i leave you with the contents of your safe it will be wise for you to hand me that document  i am inclined to do so laverick admitted  the very fact that you knew of its existence would seem to give you a sort of claim to it  but mademoiselle idiale will you answer me a few questions  i think she said that it would be better if you asked me none  but listen he begged  you are the only person with whom i have come into touch who seems to know anything about this affair  i should rather like to tell you exactly how i stumbled in upon it why can we not exchange confidence for confidence  i want neither the twenty thousand pounds nor the document  i want to be frank with you nothing but to escape from the position i am now in of being half a thief and half a criminal  show me some claim to that document and you shall have it  tell me to whom that money belongs and it shall be restored  you are incomprehensible she declared  are you by any chance playing a part with me  do you think that it is worth while  mademoiselle idiale laverick protested earnestly nothing in the world is further from my thoughts  there is very little of the conspirator about me  i am a plain man of business who stumbled in upon this affair at a critical moment and dared to make temporary use of his discovery  you can put it if you like that i am afraid i want to get out  nothing would give me greater pleasure if such a thing were possible than to send this pocketbook and its contents anonymously to scotland yard and never hear about them again  she listened to him with unchanged face  yet for some moments after he had finished speaking she was thoughtful  you may be speaking the truth she said  if so i have been deceived  you are not quite the sort of man i did believe you were what you tell me is amazing but it may be true  it is the truth laverick repeated calmly  listen she said after a brief pause  you were at school were you not with mr david bellamy  you know well who he is  perfectly well laverick admitted  you would consider him a person to be trusted  absolutely  very well then she declared  you shall come to my fiat at five oclock this afternoon and bring that document  if it is possible david bellamy shall be there himself  we will try then and prove to you that you do no harm in parting with that document to us  i will come laverick promised at five oclock but you must tell me where  you will put it down please she said  there must not be any mistake  you must come and you must come today  i am staying at number 15 dover street  i will leave orders that you are shown in at once  she rose to her feet and he walked to the door with her  on the way she hesitated  take care of yourself today mr laverick she begged  there are others beside myself who are interested in that packet you carry with you  you represent to them things beside which life and death are trivial happenings  laverick laughed shortly  he was a matteroffact man and there seemed something a little absurd in such a warning  i do not think he declared that you need have any fear  london is as you doubtless find it a dull old city but it is a remarkably safe one to live in  nevertheless mr laverick she repeated earnestly be on your guard today for all our sakes  he bowed and changed the subject  your investments he remarked you will be content perhaps to leave as they are  it is no doubt of some interest to you to know that they are showing already a profit of considerably over a thousand pounds  she shrugged her shoulders  it was an excusethat investment she declared  yet money is always good  keep it for me mr laverick and do what you will  i will trust your judgment  buy or sell as you please  you will let nothing prevent your coming this afternoon  nothing he promised her  from the window of her beautifully appointed little electric brougham she held out her hand in farewell  you think me foolish i know that i persist she said but i do beg that you will remember what i say  do not be alone today more than you can help  suspect every one who comes near to you  there may be a trap before your feet at any moment  be wary always and do not forgetat five oclock i expect you  laverick smiled as he bowed his adieux  it is a promise mademoiselle he assured her     chapter xxvii  penetrating a mystery   about an hour after mademoiselle idiales departure a note marked urgent was brought in and handed to laverick  he tore it open it was dated from the address of a firm of stockbrokers with two of the partners of which he was on friendly terms  it ran thus    my dear lavericki want a chat with you if you can spare   five minutes at lunch time  come to lyons a little earlier   than usual if you dont mindsay at a quarter to one                                                      j henshaw   laverick read the typewritten note carelessly enough at first  he had even laid it down and glanced at the clock with the intention of starting out when a thought struck him  he took it up and read it though again  then he turned to the telephone  put me on to the office of henshaw  allen  i want to speak to mr henshaw particularly  two minutes passed  laverick meanwhile had been washing his hands ready to go out  then the telephone bell rang  he took up the receiver  hullo  is that henshaw  im henshaw was the answer  thats laverick isnt it  how are you old fellow  im all right laverick replied  what is it that you want to see me about  nothing particular that i know of  who told you that i wanted to  laverick who had been standing with the instrument in his hand sat down in his chair  look here he said didnt you send me a note a few minutes ago asking me to come out to lunch at a quarter to one and meet you at lyons  henshaws laugh was sufficient response  delighted to lunch with you there or anywhere old chapyou know that was the answer but some ones been putting up a practical joke on you  you did not send me a note round this morning then laverick insisted  ill swear i didnt came the reply  do you seriously mean that youve had one purporting to come from me  laverick pulled himself together  well the signatures such a scrawl he said that no one could tell what the name really was  i guessed at you but i seem to have guessed wrong  goodbye  he set down the receiver and rang off to escape further questioning now indeed the plot was commencing to thicken  this was a deliberate effort on the part of some one to secure his absence from his offices at a quarter to one  with the document in his pocket and the safe securely locked laverick felt at ease as to the result of any attempted burglary of his premises  at the same time his curiosity was excited  here perhaps was a chance of finding some clue to this impenetrable mystery  there were thee clerks in the outer office  he put on his hat and despatched two of them on errands in different directions  the last he was obliged to take into his confidence  halsey he said i am going out to lunch  at least i wish it to be thought that i am going out to lunch  as a matter of fact i shall return in about ten minutes by the back way  i do not wish you however to know this  i want you to have it in your mind that i have gone to lunch and shall not be back until a quarter past two  if there are visitors for meinquirers of any sortact exactly as you would have done if you really believed that i was not in the building  halsey appeared a good deal mystified  laverick took him even further into his confidence  to tell you the truth halsey he said i have just received a bogus letter from mr henshaw asking me to lunch with him  some one was evidently anxious to get me out of my office for an hour or so  i want to find out for myself what this means if possible you understand  i think so sir the man replied doubtfully  i am not to be aware that you have returned then  certainly not laverick answered  please be quite clear about that  if you hear any commotion in the office you can come in but do not send for the police unless i tell you to  i wish to look into this affair for myself  halsey who had started life as a lawyers clerk and was distinctly formal in his ideas was a little shocked  would it not be better sir he suggested for me to communicate with the police in the first case  if this should really turn out to be an attempt at burglary it would surely be best to leave the matter to them  laverick frowned  for certain reasons halsey which i do not think it necessary to tell you i have a strong desire to investigate this matter personally  please do exactly as i say  he left the office and strolled up the street in the direction of the restaurant which he chiefly frequented  he reached it in a moment or two but left it at once by another entrance  within ten minutes he was back at his office  has any one been halsey  no one sir the clerk answered  you will be so good laverick continued as to forget that i have returned  he passed on quickly into his own room and made his way into the small closet where he kept his coat and washed his hands  he had scarcely been there a minute when he heard voices in the outside hall  the door of his office was opened  mr laverick said nothing about an appointment at this hour he heard halsey protest in a somewhat deprecating tone  he had perhaps forgotten was the answer in a totally unfamiliar voice  at any rate i am not in a great hurry  the matter is of some importance however and i will wait for mr laverick  the visitor was shown in  laverick investigated his appearance through a crack in the door  he was a man of medium height welldressed cleanshaven and wore goldrimmed spectacles  he made himself comfortable in lavericks easychair and accepted the paper which halsey offered him  i shall be quite glad of a rest he remarked genially  i have been running about all the morning  mr laverick is never very long out for lunch sir halsey said i daresay he will not keep you more than a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes  the clerk withdrew and closed the door  the man in the chair waited for a moment  then he laid down his newspaper and looked cautiously around the room  satisfied apparently that he was alone he rose to his feet and walked swiftly to lavericks writingtable  with fingers which seemed gifted with a lightninglike capacity for movement he swung open the drawers one by one and turned over the papers  his eyes were everywhere  every document seemed to be scanned and as rapidly discarded  at last he found something which interested him he held it up and paused in his search  laverick heard a little breath come though his teeth and with a thrill he recognized the paper as one which he had torn from a memorandum tablet and upon which he had written down the address which mademoiselle idiale had given him  the man with the goldrimmed glasses replaced the paper where he had found it  evidently he had done with the writingtable he moved swiftly over to the safe and stood there listening for a few seconds  then from his pocket he drew a bunch of keys  to lavericks surprise at the strangers first effort the great door of the safe swung open  he saw the man lean forward saw his hand reappear almost directly with the pocketbook clenched in his fingers then he stood once more quite still listening  satisfied that no one was disturbed he closed the door of the safe softly and moved once more to the writingtable  with marvelous swiftness the notes were laid upon the table the pocketbook was turned upside down the secret place disclosedthe secret place which was empty  it seemed to laverick that from his hidingplace he could hear the little oath of disappointment which broke from the thin red lips  the man replaced the notes and with the pocketbook in his hand hesitated laverick who thought that things had gone far enough stepped lightly out from his hidingplace and stood between his unbidden visitor and the door  you had better put down that pocketbook he ordered quietly  the man was upon him with a single spring but laverick without the slightest hesitation knocked him prone upon the floor where he lay for a moment motionless  then he slowly picked himself up his spectacles were brokenhe blinked as he stood there  sorry to be so rough laverick said  perhaps if you will kindly realize that of the two i am much the stronger man you will be so good as to sit in that chair and tell me the meaning of your intrusion  the man obeyed  he covered his eyes with his hand for a moment as though in pain  i imagine he saidand it seemed to laverick that his voice had a slight foreign accenti imagine that the motive for my paying you this visit is fairly clear to you  people who have compromising possessions may always expect visits of this sort  you see one runs so little risk  so little risk laverick repeated  exactly the other answered  confess that you are not in the least inclined to ring your bell and send for a constable to give me in charge for being in possession of a pocketbook abstracted from your safe containing twenty thousand pounds in bank of england notes  it wouldnt do at all laverick admitted  you are a man of common sense declared the other  it would not do  now comes the time when i have a question to ask you  there was a sealed document in this pocketbook  where is it  what have you done with it  can you tell me laverick asked why i should answer questions from a person whom i discover apparently engaged in a nefarious attempt at burglary  the mans hand shot out from his trouserpocket and laverick looked into the gleaming muzzle of a revolver  because if you dont you die was the quick reply  whether youve read that document or not i want it  if youve read it you know the sort of men youve got to deal with  if you havent take my word for it that we waste no time  the document  will you give it me  do i understand that you are threatening me  laverick asked retreating a few steps  you may understand that this is a repeating revolver and that i seldom miss a halfcrown at twenty paces his visitor answered if you put out your hand toward that bell it will be the last movement youll ever make on earth  london isnt really the place for this sort of thing laverick said  if you discharge that revolver you havent a dogs chance of getting clear of the building  my clerks would rush out after you into the street  youd find yourself surrounded by a crowd of business men  you couldnt make your way through anywhere  youd be held up before youd gone a dozen yards  put down your revolver we can perhaps settle this little matter without it  the document the man ordered  youve got it  you must have it you took that pocketbook from a dead man and in that pocketbook was the document  we must have it  we intend to have it  and who may i ask are we laverick inquired  if you do not know what does it matter  will you give it to me  laverick shook his head  i have no document  the man in the chair leaned forward  the muzzle of his revolver was very bright and he held it in fingers which were firm as a rock  give it to me he repeated  you ought to know that you are not dealing with men who are unaccustomed to death  you have it about you  produce it and ive done with you  deny me and you have not time to say your prayers  laverick was leaning against a small table which stood near the door his fingers suddenly gripped the ledger which lay upon it  he held it in front of his face for a single moment and then dashed it at his visitor  he followed behind with one desperate spring  once twice the revolver barked out  laverick felt the skin of his temple burn and a flick on the ear which reminded him of his schooldays then his hand was upon the other mans throat and the revolver lay upon the carpet  well see about that  by the lord ive a good mind to wring the life out of you  that bullet of yours might have been in my temple  it was meant to be there the man gasped  hand over the document you pigheaded fool  itll cost you your lifeif not today tomorrow  ill be hanged if you get it anyway laverick answered fiercely you assassin  scoundrel  to come here and make a coldblooded effort at murder  you shall see what you think of the inside of an english prison  the man laughed contemptuously  and what about the pocketbook he asked  laverick was silent  his assailant smiled and shrugged his shoulders  come he said i have made my effort and failed  you have twenty thousand pounds  thats a fair price but ill add another twenty thousand for that document unopened  it is possible that we might deal laverick remarked kicking the revolver a little further away  unfortunately i am too much in the dark  tell me the real position of the murdered man  tell me why he was murdered  tell me the contents of this document and why it was in his possession  perhaps i may then be inclined to treat with you  you are either an astonishingly ingenuous person mr laverick his visitor declared or youre too subtle for me  you do not expect me to believe that you are in this with your eyes blindfolded you do not expect me to believe that you do not know what is in that sealed envelope  bah  it is a childs game that and we play as men with men  laverick shook his head  your offer he asked what is it exactly  twenty thousand pounds the man answered  the document is worth no more than that to you  how you came into this thing is a mystery but you are in and what is more you have possession  twenty thousand pounds mr laverick  it is a large sum of money  you find it interesting  i find it interesting laverick answered dryly but i am not a seller  the intruder moved his hand away from his eyes  his expression was full of wonder  consider for a moment he said  while that document remains in your possession you walk the narrow way your life hangs upon a thread  better surrender it and attend to your stocks and shares heaven knows how you first came into our affairs but the sooner you are out of them the better  what do you say now to my offer  it is refused laverick declared  i regret to add he continued that i have already spared you all the time i have at my disposal  forgive me  he pressed a button with his finger  his visitor rose up in anger  you are not such a fool he exclaimed  you are not going to send me away without it  why i tell you that there wont be a safe corner in the world for you  halsey opened the door  laverick nodded toward his visitor  show this gentleman out halsey he ordered  halsey started  the noise of the revolver shot had evidently been muffled by the heavy connecting doors but there was a smell of gunpowder in the room and a little wreath of smoke  the man rose slowly to his feet still blinking  it must be as you will of course  i wonder if you would be so good as to let your clerk direct me to an oculist  i am unfortunately a helpless man in this condition  there is one a few yards off laverick answered  put on your hat halsey and show this gentleman where he can get some glasses  his visitor leaned towards laverick  it is your life which is in question not my eyesight he muttered do you accept my offer  will you give me the document  i do not and i will not laverick replied  i shall not part with anything until i know more than i know at present  the man stood motionless for a moment  his fingers seemed to be twitching  laverick had a fancy that he was about to spring but if ever he had had any thoughts of the kind halseys reappearance checked them  i am much obliged to you mr laverick he said quietly  we shall perhaps resume this discussion at some future date  with that he turned and followed halsey out of the room  laverick went to the window and threw it wide open  the smoke floated out the smell of gunpowder was gradually dispersed  then he walked back to his seat  once more he locked up the notes  the document was safe in his pocket  there was a slight mark by the side of his temple and his ear he discovered was bleeding  he rang the bell and halsey entered  has our friend gone halsey  i left him in the opticians sir the clerk answered  he was buying some spectacles  laverick glanced at the floor where the remains of those goldrimmed glasses were scattered  you had better send for a locksmith at once he said  the gentleman who has been here had a skeleton key to my safe  well have a combination put on  very good sir halsey answered  and halsey his master continued be careful about one thing for your own sake as well as mine  if that man presents himself again dont let him come into my room unannounced  if you can help it dont let him come in at all  i have an idea that he might be dangerous  the clerks face was a study  if he presents himself here sir he announced stiffly i shall take the liberty of sending for the police  laverick made no reply     chapter xxviii  lavericks narrow escape   at precisely a quarter past four nothing having happened in the meantime but a steady rush of business laverick ordered a taxicab to be summoned  he then unlocked his safe placed the pocketbook securely in his breast pocket walked through the office and directed the man to drive to chancery lane  here at the headquarters of the safe deposit company he engaged a compartment and down in the strongroom locked up the pocketbook  there was only now the document left  stepping once more into the street he found that his taxicab had vanished  he looked up and down in vain  the man had not been paid and there seemed to be no reason for his departure  a policeman who was standing by touched his hat and addressed him  were you looking for that taxi you stepped out of a few minutes ago sir he asked  i was laverick answered  i hadnt paid him and i told him to wait  i thought there was something queer about it the policeman remarked  soon after you had gone inside two gentlemen drove up in a hansom  they got out here and one of them spoke to your driver who shook his head and pointed to his flag  the gent then said something else to himcant say as i heard what it was but it was probably offering him double fare  anyway they both got in and off went your taxi sir  thank you laverick said thoughtfully  it sounds a little perplexing  he hesitated for a moment  constable he continued i have just made a very valuable deposit in there and i had an idea that i might be followed  i have still in my pocket a document of great importance  i have no doubt whatever but that the object of the men who have taken my taxicab is to leave me in the street here alone under circumstances which will render a quick attack upon me likely to be successful  the policeman turned his head and looked at laverick incredulously he was more than half inclined to believe that this was a practical joke  were they not standing on the pavement in chancery lane and was not he an ablebodied policeman of great bulk and immense muscle yet his companion did not look by any means a man of the nervous order  laverick was broadshouldered his skin was tanned a wholesome color his bearing was the bearing of a man prepared to defend himself at any time  the constable smiled in a noncommittal manner  if youll excuse my saying so sir he remarked i dont think this is exactly the spot any one would choose for an assault  i agree with you laverick answered but on the other hand you must remember that these gentlemen have had no choice  i stepped from my office direct into the taxi and i proposed to drive straight from here to the place where i shall probably leave the other document i am carrying with me  why i have taken you into my confidence is to ask you this  can you walk with me to the corner of the street or until we meet a taxicab  it sounds cowardly but as a matter of fact i am not afraid  i simply want to make sure of delivering this document to the person to whom it belongs  the constable stood still a little perplexed  my beat sir he said only goes about twentyfive yards further on  i will walk to the corner of holborn with you if you desire it  at the same time i may say that i am breaking regulations how do i know that it is not your scheme to get me away from this neighborhood for some purpose of your own  you dont believe anything of the sort laverick declared with a smile  i do not sir the policeman admitted  keep by my side and i think that nothing will happen to you before we reach holborn  laverick was a man of more than medium height but by the side of the policeman he seemed short  both scanned the faces of the passersby closelythe policeman with mild interest laverick with almost feverish anxiety  it was a gray afternoon pleasant but close  there seemed to be nothing whatever to account for the feeling of nervousness which had suddenly come over laverick  he felt himself in dangerhe had no idea how or in what waybut the conviction was there  he took every step fully alert absolutely on his guard  they were almost within sight of holborn when a cry from the bystanders caused them to look away into the middle of the road laverick only cast one glance there and abandoned every instinct of curiosity thinking once more only of himself and his own position  with the constable however it was naturally different he saw something which called at once for his intervention and he immediately forgot the somewhat singular task upon which he was engaged  a man had fallen in the middle of the street either knocked down by the shaft of a passing vehicle or in some sort of fit  there was a tangle of rearing horses an omnibus was making desperate efforts to avoid the prostrate body  the constable sprang to the rescue  laverick instantly suspicious and realizing that there was no one in front of him turned swiftly around  he was just in time to receive upon his left arm the blow which had been meant for the back of his head  he was confronted by a man dressed exactly as he himself was in morning coat and silk hat a man with long lean face and legal appearance such a person as would have passed anywhere without attracting a moments suspicion yet in the space of a few seconds he had whipped out from one pocket with the skill almost of a juggler a viciouslooking lifepreserver and from the other a pockethandkerchief soaked with chloroform  laverick quick and resourceful feeling his left arm sink helpless struck at the man with his right and sent him staggering against the wall  the handkerchief with its load of sickening odor fell to the pavement  the man was obviously worsted  laverick sprang at him  they were almost unobserved for the crowd was all intent upon the accident in the roadway with wonderful skill his assailant eluded his attempt to close and tore at his coat  laverick struck at him again but met only the air  the mans fingers now were upon his pocket but this time laverick made no mistake  he struck downward so hard that with a fierce cry of pain the man relaxed his hold  before he could recover laverick had struck him again  he reeled into the crowd that was fast gathering around them attracted by what seemed to be a fight between two men of unexceptionable appearance but there was to be no more fight  through the people swiftfooted cunning resourceful his assailant seemed to find some hidden way  laverick glared fiercely around him but the man had gone  his left hand crept to his chest the victory was with him the document was still there  at the outside of the double crowd he perceived a taxi  ignoring the storm of questions with which he was assailed and the advancing helmet of his friend the policeman at the back of the crowd laverick hailed it and stepped quickly inside  back out of this and drive to dover street he directed  the man obeyed him  people raced to look through the window at him the other commotion had died awaythe man in the road had got up and walked off  a policeman came hurrying along but he was just too late  very soon they were on their way down holborn  once more laverick had escaped  a french manservant with the sad face and immaculate dress of a highchurch cleric took possession of him as soon as he had asked for mademoiselle idiale  he was shown into one of the most delightful little rooms he had ever even dreamed of  the walls were hung with that peculiar shade of blue satin which mademoiselle so often affected in her clothes  laverick who was something of a connoisseur saw nowhere any object which was not of its sort pricelessfrench furniture of the best and choicest period a statuette which made him for a moment almost forget the scene from which he had just arrived  the air in the room seemed as though it had passed through a grove of lemon treesit was fresh and sweet yet curiously fragrant  laverick sank down into one of the luxurious bluebrocaded chairs conscious for the first time that he was out of breath  then the door opened silently and there entered not the woman whom he had been expecting but mr lassen  laverick rose to his feet half doubtfully  lassens small queerlyshaped face seemed to have become one huge ingratiating smile  i am very glad to see you mr laverick he saidvery glad indeed  i have come to call upon mademoiselle idiale laverick answered somewhat curtly  he had disliked this man from the first moment he had seen him and he saw no particular reason why he should conceal his feelings  i am here to explain mr lassen continued seating himself opposite to laverick  mademoiselle idiale is unfortunately prevented from seeing you  she has a severe nervous headache and her only chance of appearing tonight is to remain perfectly undisturbed  women of her position as you may understand have to be exceptionally careful  it would be a very serious matter indeed if she were unable to sing tonight  i am exceedingly sorry to hear it laverick answered  in that case i will call again when mademoiselle idiale has recovered  by all means my dear sir mr lassen exclaimed  many times let us hope  but in the meantime there is a little affair of a document which you were going to deliver to mademoiselle  she is most anxious that you should hand it to memost anxious  she will tender you her thanks personally tomorrow or the next day if she is well enough to receive  laverick shook his head firmly  under no circumstances he declared should i think of delivering the document into any other hands save those of mademoiselle idiale to tell you the truth i had not fully decided whether to part with it even to her  i was simply prepared to hear what she had to say but it may save time if i assure you mr lassen that nothing would induce me to part with it to any one else  there was no trace left of that ingratiating smile upon mr lassens face  he had the appearance now of an ugly animal about to show its teeth  laverick was suddenly on his guard  more adventures he thought casting a somewhat contemptuous glance at the physique of the other man  he laid his fingers as though carelessly upon a small bronze ornament which reposed amongst others on a table by his side  if mr lassens fat and ugly hand should steal toward his pocket laverick was prepared to hurl the ornament at his head  i am very sorry to hear you say that mr laverick lassen said slowly  i hope very much that you will see your way clear to change your mind  i can assure you that i have as much right to the document as mademoiselle idiale and that it is her earnest wish that you should hand it over to me  further i may inform you that the document itself is a most incriminating one  its possession upon your person or upon the person of any one who was not upon his guard might be a very serious matter indeed  laverick shrugged his shoulders  as a matter of fact he declared i certainly have no idea of carrying it about with me  on the other hand i shall part with it to no one  i might discuss the matter with mademoiselle idiale as soon as she is recovered  i am not disposedi mean no offence sirbut i may say frankly that i am not disposed even to do as much with you  laverick rose to his feet with the obvious intention of leaving lassen followed his example and confronted him  mr laverick he said in your own interests you must not talk like thatin your own interests i say  at any rate laverick remarked my interests are better looked after by myself than by strangers  you must forgive my adding mr lassen that you are a stranger to me  no more so than mademoiselle idiale the little man exclaimed  mademoiselle idiale has given me certain proof that she knew at least of the existence of this document laverick answered  she has established therefore a certain claim to my consideration you announce yourself as mademoiselle idiales deputy but you bring me no proof of the fact nor in any case am i disposed to treat with you  you must allow me to wish you good afternoon  lassen shook his head  mr laverick he declared you are too impetuous  you force me to remind you that your own position as holder of that document is not a very secure one  all the police in this capital are searching today for the man who killed that unfortunate creature who was found murdered in crooked friars alley  if they could find the man who was in possession of his pocketbook who was in possession of twenty thousand pounds taken from the dead mans body and with it had saved his business and his credit how then do you think i say nothing of the document  laverick was silent for a moment  he realized however that to make terms with this man was impossible  besides he did not trust him  he did not even trust him so far as to believe him the accredited envoy of mademoiselle  my unfortunate position laverick said has nothing whatever to do with the matter  where you got your information from i cannot say  i neither accept nor deny it  but i can assure you that i am not to be intimidated  this document will remain in my possession until some one can show me a very good reason for parting with it  lassen beat the back of the chair against which he was standing with his clenched fist  a reason why you should part with it he exclaimed fiercely  man it stares you there in the face  if you do not part with it you will be arrested within twentyfour hours for the murder or complicity in the murder of rudolph von behrling  that i swear  that i shall see to myself  in which case laverick remarked the document will fall into the hands of the english police  the shot told  laverick could have laughed as he watched its effect upon his listener  mr lassens face was black with unuttered curses  he looked as though he would have fallen upon laverick bodily  what do you know about its contents he hissed  why do you suppose it would not suit my purpose to have it fall into the hands of the english police  i can see no reason whatever laverick answered why i should take you into my confidence as to how much i know and how much i do not know  i wish you good afternoon mr lassen  i shall be ready to wait upon mademoiselle idiale at any time she sends for me  but in case it should interest you to be made aware of the fact he added with a little bow i am not going round with this terrible document in my possession  he moved to the door  already his hand was upon the knob when he saw the movement for which he had watched  laverick with a single bound was upon his wouldbe assailant  the hand which had already closed upon the butt of the small revolver was gripped as though in a vice  with a scream of pain lassen dropped the weapon upon the floor  laverick picked it up thrust it into his coat pocket and taking the mans collar with both hands he shook him till the eyes seemed starting from his head and his shrieks of fear were changed into moans  then he flung him into a corner of the room  you cowardly brute he exclaimed  you come of the breed of men who shoot from behind  if ever i lay my hands upon you again youll be lucky if you live to whimper about it  he left the room and rang for the lift  he saw no trace of any servants in the hall nor heard any sound of any one moving  from dover street he drove straight to zoes house  keeping the cab waiting he knocked at the door  she opened it herself at once and her eyes glowed with pleasure  how delightful she cried  please come in  have you come to take me to the theatre  he followed her into the parlor and closed the door behind them  zoe he said i am going to ask you a favor  me a favor she repeated  i think you know how happy it will make me if there is anythinganything at all in the world that i could do  a week ago laverick continued i was an honest but not very successful stockbroker with a natural longing for adventures which never came my way  since then things have altered  i have stumbled in upon the most curious little chain of happenings which ever became entwined with the life of a commonplace being like myself the net result for the moment is this  every one is trying to steal from me a certain document which i have in my pocket  i want to hide it for the night  i cannot go to the police it is too late to go back to chancery lane and i have an instinctive feeling that my flat is absolutely at the mercy of my enemies  may i hide my document in your room  i do not believe for a moment that any one would think of searching here  of course you may she answered  but listen  can you see out into the street without moving very much  he turned his head  he had been standing with his back to the window and zoe had been facing it  yes i can see into the street he assented  tell meyou see that taxi on the other side of the way she asked  he nodded  it wasnt there when i drove up he remarked  i was at the window looking out when you came she said  it followed you out from the square into this street  directly you stopped i saw the man put on the brake and pull up his cab  it seemed to me so strange just as though some one were watching you all the time  laverick stood still looking out of the window  who lives in the house opposite he asked  i am afraid she answered that there are no very nice people who live round here  the people whom i see coming in and out of that house are not nice people at all  i understand he said  thank you zoe  you are right  whatever i do with my precious document i will not leave it here  to tell you the truth i thought for certain reasons that after i had paid my last call this afternoon i should not be followed any more  come back with me and i will give you some dinner before you go to the theatre  she clapped her hands  i shall love it she declared  but what shall you do with the document  i shall take a room at the milan hotel he said and give it to the cashier  they have a wonderful safe there  it is the best thing i can think of  can you suggest anything  she considered for a moment  do you know what is inside she asked  he shook his head  i have no idea  it is the most mysterious document in the world so far as i am concerned  why not open it and read it she suggested then you will know exactly what it is all about  you can learn it by heart and tear it up  i must think that over he said  one second before we go out  he took from his pocket the revolver which lassen had dropped  it was a perfect little weapon and fully charged  he replaced it in his pocket keeping his finger upon the trigger  now zoe if you are ready he said come along  they stepped out and entered the taxi unmolested and laverick ordered  to the milan hotel     chapter xxix  lassens treachery discovered   about twenty minutes past six on the same evening bellamy his clothes thick with dust his face dark with anger jumped lightly from a sixty horsepower car and rang the bell of the lift at number 15 dover street  arrived on the first floor he was confronted almost immediately by the sadfaced manservant of mademoiselle idiale  mademoiselle is in bellamy asked quickly  the mans expression was one of sombre regret  mademoiselle is spending the day in the country sir  bellamy took him by the shoulders and flung him against the wall  thank you he said ive heard that before  he walked down the passage and knocked softly at the door of louises sleeping apartment  there was no answer  he knocked again and listened at the keyhole  there was some movement inside but no one spoke  louise he cried softly let me in  it is idavid  again the only reply was the strangest of sounds  almost it seemed as though a woman were trying to speak with a hand over her mouth then bellamy suddenly stiffened into rigid attention  there were voices in the small reception roomthe voice of henri the butler and another  reluctantly he turned away from the closed door and walked swiftly down the passage  he entered the reception room and looked around him in amazement  it was still in disorder  lassen sat in an easychair with a tumbler of brandy by his side  henri was tying a bandage around his head his collar was torn there were marks of blood about his shirt  bellamys eyes sparkled  he closed the door behind him  come he exclaimed after all i fancy that my arrival is somewhat opportune  henri turned towards him with a reproachful gesture  monsieur lassen has been unwell monsieur he said  he has had a fit and fallen down  bellamy laughed contemptuously  i think i can reconstruct the scene a little better than that he declared  what do you say mr lassen  the man glared at him viciously  i do not know what you are talking about he said  i do not wish to speak to you  i am ill  you had better go and persuade mademoiselle to return  she is at dover waiting  you are a liar bellamy answered  she is in her room now locked upguarded perhaps by one of your creatures  i have been halfway to dover but i tumbled to your scheme in time mr lassen you found our friend laverick a trifle awkward i fancy  lassen swore through his teeth but said nothing  from your somewhat dishevelled appearance bellamy continued i think i may conclude that you were not able to come to any amicable arrangement with mademoiselles visitor  he declined to accept you as her proxy i imagine  still one must make sure  he advanced quickly  lassen shrank back in his chair  what do you mean he asked gruffly  keep him away from me henri  ring the bell for your other man  this fellow will do me a mischief  not i bellamy answered scornfully  stay where you are henri to your other accomplishments i have no doubt you include that of valeting  take off his coat  but monsieur henri protested  im dd if he shall the man in the chair snarled  bellamy turned to the door locked it and put the key in his pocket  look here he said i do not for one moment believe that laverick handed over to you the document you were so anxious to obtain  on the other hand i imagine that your somewhat battered appearance is the result of fruitless argument on your part with a view to inducing him to do so  nevertheless i can afford to run no risks  the coat first please henri  it is necessary that i search it thoroughly  there was a brief hesitation  bellamys hand went reluctantly into his pocket  i hate to seem melodramatic he declared and i never carry firearms but i have a little lifepreserver here which i have learned how to use pretty effectively  come you know it isnt a fair fight  youve had all you want lassen and henri there hasnt the muscle of a chicken  lassen rose groaning to his feet and allowed his coat to be removed  bellamy glanced through the pockets holding one letter for a moment in his hands as he glanced at the address  the writing of our friend streuss he remarked with a smile no you need not fear lassen  i am not going to read it  there is plenty of proof of your treachery without this  lassens face was livid and his eyes seemed like beads  bellamy handed back the coat  thats all right he said  nothing there i am glad to seeor in the waistcoat he added passing his hands over it  ill trouble you to stand up for a moment mr lassen  the man did as he was bid and bellamy felt him all over  when he had finished he held in his hand a key  the key of mademoiselles chamber i have no doubt he announced i will leave you then while i see what deviltry you have been up to  he walked calmly to the table which stood by the window and deliberately cut the telephone wire  with the instrument under his arm he left the room  lassen blundered to his feet as though to intercept him but bellamys eyes suddenly flashed red fury and the lifepreserver of which he had spoken glittered above his head lassen staggered away  im a longsuffering man bellamy said and if you dont remember now that youre the beaten dog i may lose my temper  he locked them in walked down the passage and opened the door of louises bedchamber with fingers that trembled a little  with a smothered oath he cut the cord from the arms of the maid and the gag from her mouth  louise clad in a loose afternoon gown was lying upon the bed as though asleep  bellamy saw with an impulse of relief that she was breathing regularly  this is lassens work of course he exclaimed  what have they done to her  the maid spoke thickly  she was very pale and unsteady upon her feet  it was something they put in her wine she faltered  i heard mr lassen say that it would keep her quiet for three or four hours  i thinki think that she is waking now  louise opened her eyes and looked at them with amazement  bellamy sat by the side of the bed and supported her with his arm  it is only a skirmish dear he whispered and it is a drawn battle although you got the worst of it  she put her hand to her head struggling to remember  mr laverick has been here she asked  he has  your friend lassen has been taking a hand in the game  i came here to find you like this and annette tied up  henri is in with him  what has become of your other servants i dont know  henri asked for a holiday for them she said the color slowly returning to her cheeks  i begin to understand  but tell me what happened when mr laverick came  i can only guess bellamy answered but it seems that lassen must have received him as though with your authority  and what then she asked quickly  i am almost certain bellamy declared that laverick refused to have anything to do with him  i received a wire from dover to say that you were on your way home and asking me to meet you at the lord warden hotel  i borrowed montresors racingcar but i sent telegrams and i was pretty soon on my way back  when i arrived here i found lassen in your little room with a broken head evidently laverick and he had a scrimmage and he got the worst of it  i have searched him to his bones and he has no paper  laverick brought it here without a doubt and has taken it away again  she rose to her feet  go and let lassen out she said  tell him he must never come here again  i will see him at the opera house tonight or tomorrow nightthat is if i can get there  i do not know whether i shall feel fit to sing  i shall take the liberty also remarked bellamy of kicking henri out  louise sighed  he was such a good servant  i think it must have cost our friend streuss a good deal to buy henri  you will come back to me when you have finished with them  bellamy made short work of his discomfited prisoners  lassen was surly but only eager to depart henri was resigned but tearful almost as they went the other servants began to return from their various missions  bellamy went back to louise who was lying down again and drinking some tea  she motioned bellamy to come over to her side  tell me she asked what are you going to do now  i am going to do what i ought to have done before bellamy answered lavericks connection with this affair is suspicious enough but after all he is a sportsman and an englishman  i am going to tell him what that envelope containstell him the truth  you are right she exclaimed  whatever he may have done if you tell him the truth he will give you that document  i am sure of it do you know where to find him  i shall go to his rooms bellamy declared  i must be quick too for lassen is freethey will know that he has failed  come back to me david she begged and he kissed her fingers and hurried out     chapter xxx  the contest for the papers   laverick sitting with zoe at dinner caught his companion looking around the restaurant with an expression in her face which he did not wholly understand  something is the matter with you this evening zoe he said anxiously  tell me what it is  you dont like this place perhaps  of course i do  it is your dinner then or me he persisted  come out with it havent we promised to tell each other the truth always  the pink color came slowly into her cheeks  her eyes raised for a moment to his were almost reproachful  you know very well that it is not anything to do with you she whispered  you are too kind to me all the time  only she went on a little hesitatingly dont you realizecant you see how differently most of the girls here are dressed  i dont mind so much for myselfbut youyou have so many friends  you keep on seeing people whom you know  i am afraid they will think that i ought not to be here  he looked at her in surprise mingled perhaps with compunction for the first time he appreciated the actual shabbiness of her clothes  everything about her was so neatpathetically neat as it seemed to him in one illuminating moment of realization  the white linen collar notwithstanding its frayed edges was spotlessly clean  the black bow was carefully tied to conceal its worn parts her gloves had been stitched a good many times  her gown although it was tidy was oldfashioned and had distinctly seen its best days he suddenly recognized the effortthe almost despairing effortwhich her toilette had cost her  i dont think that men notice these things he said simply  to me you look just as you should lookand i wouldnt change places with any other man in the room for a great deal  her eyes were softperilously softas she looked at him with uplifted eyebrows and a faint smile struggling at the corners of her lips  a wave of tenderness crept into his heart  what a brave little child she was  you will quite spoil me if you make such nice speeches she murmured  anyhow he went on speaking with decision so long as you feel like that you are going to have a new gownor twoand a new hat and you are going to have them at once  they are going to be bought with your brothers money mind  shall i come shopping with you  she shook her head  mind it is partly for your sake that i give in she said  it would be lovely to have you come but you would spend far too much money  you really mean it all  absolutely he answered  i insist upon it  she leaned towards him with dancing eyes  after all she was very much of a child  the prospect of a new gown now that she permitted herself to think of it was enthralling  i might get a coat and skirt she remarked thoughtfully and a simple white dress  a black hat would do for both of them then  dont you study your brother too much laverick declared  his stock is going up all the time  tell me your favorite color she begged confidentially  i cant conceive your looking nicer than you do in black he replied  she made a wry face  i suppose it must be black she murmured doubtfully  it is much more economical than anything  she broke off to bow to a stout redfaced man who after a rude stare had greeted her with a patronizing nod  laverick frowned  who is that fellow he asked  mr heepman our stagemanager zoe answered a little timidly  is there any particular reason why he should behave like a boor laverick continued raising his voice a little  she caught at his arm in terror  the man was sitting at the next table  dont please she implored  he might hear you  he is just behind there  laverick half turned in his chair  she guessed what he was about to say and went on rapidly  he has been so foolish she whispered  he has asked me so often to go out with him  and he could get me sent away if he wanted any time  he almost threatened it the last time i refused  now that he has seen me with you he will be worse than ever  lavericks face darkened and there was a peculiar flash in his eyes the man was certainly looking at them in a rude manner  there are so many of the girls who would only be too pleased to go with him zoe continued in a terrified undertone  i cant think why he bothers me  i can laverick muttered  lets forget about the brute  but the dinner was already spoiled for zoe so laverick paid the bill a few minutes later and walked across to the stagedoor of the theatre with her  her little hand when she gave it to him at parting was quite cold  im as nervous as i can be she confessed  mr heepman will be watching all the night for something to find fault with me about  dont you let him bully you laverick begged  i wont she promised  goodbye  thanks so much for my dinner  she turned away with a brave attempt at a smile but it was only an attempt  laverick walked on to his club  there was no one in the diningroom whom he knew and the cardroom was empty  he played one game of billiards but he played badly  he was upset  his nerves were wrong he told himself and little wonder  there seemed to be no chance of a rubber at bridge so he sallied out again and walked aimlessly towards covent garden  outside the opera house he hesitated and finally entered yielding to an impulse the nature of which he scarcely recognized  while he was inquiring about a stall a small printed notice was thrust into his hand  he read it with a slight start  we regret to announce that owing to indisposition mademoiselle idiale will not be able to appear this evening  the part of delilah will be taken by mademoiselle blanche temoigne late of the royal opera house st petersburg  ten minutes later laverick rang the bell of her flat in dover street a strange manservant answered him  i came to inquire after mademoiselle idiale laverick said  the man held out a tray on which was already a small heap of cards laverick however retained his  i should be glad if you would take mine in to her he said  i think it is just likely that she may see me for a moment  the servants attitude was one of civil but unconcealed hostility he would have closed the door had not laverick already passed over the threshold  madame is not well enough to receive visitors sir the man declared  she shall have your card as soon as possible  i should like her to have it now laverick persisted drawing a fivepound note from his pocket  the man looked at the note longingly  it would be only waste of time sir he declared  mademoiselle is confined to her bedroom and my orders are absolute  you are not the man who was here earlier in the day laverick remarked  i wonder he continued with a sudden inspiration whether you are not mr bellamys servant  that is so sir  mr bellamy has sent me here to see that no one has access to mademoiselle idiale  then there is no harm whatever in taking in my card laverick declared convincingly  you can put that note in your pocket  i am perfectly certain that mademoiselle idiale will see me and that your master would wish her to do so  i will take the risk sir the man decided but the orders i have received were stringent  he disappeared and was gone for several moments  when he came back he was accompanied by a palefaced woman dressed in black obviously a maid  monsieur laverick she said mademoiselle idiale will receive you  if you will come this way  she opened the door of the little receptionroom and laverick followed her  the man returned to his place in the hall  madame will be here in a moment the maid said  she will be glad to see you but she has been very badly frightened  laverick bowed sympathetically  the woman herself was grayfaced terrorstricken  it is monsieur lassen the manager of madame who has caused a great deal of trouble here she said  madame never trusted him and now we have discovered that he is a spy  the woman seemed to fade away  the door of the inner room was opened and louise came out  she was still exceedingly pale and there were dark rims under her eyes  she came across the room with outstretched hands  there was no doubt whatever as to her pleasure  you have seen mr bellamy she asked  laverick shook his head  no i have seen nothing of bellamy today  i came to call upon you this afternoon  she wrung her hands  you understand of course she exclaimed  i did not trust lassen but i never imagined anything like this  he is an austrian only a few hours ago i learned that he is one of their most heavily paid spies  streuss got hold of him  but there i forgotyou do not understand this  it is enough that he laid a plot to get that document from you  where is it mr laverick  you have brought it now  why no laverick answered i have not  her eyes were round with terror  she held out her hands as though to keep away some tormenting thought  where is it she cried  you have not parted with it  i have not laverick replied gravely  it is in the safe deposit of a hotel to which i have moved  she closed her eyes and drew a long breath of relief  you are not well laverick said  let me help you to a chair  she sat down wearily  why have you moved to a hotel she asked  to tell you the truth laverick answered i seem to have wandered into a sort of modern arabian nights  three times today attempts have been made to get that document from me by force  i have been followed whereever i went  i felt that it was not safe in my chambers so i moved to a hotel and deposited it in their strongroom  i have come to the conclusion that the best thing i can do is to open it tomorrow morning and decide for myself as to its destination  louise sat quite still for several moments  then she opened her eyes  what you say is an immense relief to me mr laverick she declared  i perceive now that we have made a mistake  we should have told you the whole truth from the first  this afternoon when mr bellamy left me it was to come to you and tell you everything  laverick listened gravely  really he said it seems to me the wisest course  i havent the least desire to keep the document  i cannot think why bellamy did not treat me with confidence from the first  he stopped short  suddenly he understood  something in louises face gave him the hint  of course he murmured to himself  mr laverick louise said quietly in this matter i am no mans judge yet as you and i know well that paper could have come into your hands in one way and one way only  there may be some explanation  if so it is for you to offer it or not as you think best mr bellamy and i are allies in this matter  it is not our business to interfere with the course of justice  you will run no risk in parting with that paper  where can i see bellamy laverick inquired rising and taking up his hat  he would go straight to your rooms she answered  did you leave word there where you had gone  purposely i did not laverick replied  i had better try and find him perhaps  it is not necessary she announced  no wonder that you feel yourself to have wandered into the arabian nights mr laverick there are two sets of spies who follow you everywheretwo sets that i know of  there may be another  you think that bellamy will find me he asked  i am sure of it  then ill go back to the hotel and wait  she hurried him away but at the door she detained him for a moment  mr laverick she said looking at him earnestly somehow or other i cannot help believing that you are an honest man  laverick sighed  he opened his lips but closed them again  you are very kind mademoiselle he declared simply  laverick as he entered the reception hall at the milan hotel noticed a man leaning over the cashiers desk talking confidentially to the clerk in charge  the latter recognized laverick with obvious relief and at once directed his questioners attention to him  kahn turned swiftly around and without a moments hesitation came smiling towards laverick with the apparent intention of accosting him  he was correctly garbed tall and fair with every appearance of being a man of breeding  he glanced at laverick carelessly as he passed but as though changing his original purpose made no attempt to address him  the cashier who had been watching gave vent to a little exclamation of surprise and sprang over the counter  he approached laverick hastily  do you know that gentleman just going out sir he asked  i never saw him before in my life laverick answered  why  is this your handwriting sir the man inquired touching with his forefinger the half sheet of notepaper which he had been carrying  laverick read quickly            to the cashier at the milan hoteldeliver to bearer           document deposited with you                  stephen laverick  it is not he declared promptly  it is an impudent forgery good god  you dont mean to say that you parted with my property to  the cashier stopped his breathless question  i havent parted with anything sir he said  i was just wondering what to do when you came in  id no reason to believe that the signature was a forgery but i didnt like the look of it somehow  wed better be after him  come along sir  they hurried outside  the man was nowhere in sight  the cashier summoned the head porter  a gentleman has just come out he exclaimedtall and fair very carefully dressed with a single eyeglass  which way did he go  hes just driven off in a big daimler car sir the porter answered  i noticed him particularly  he spoke to the chauffeur in austrian  laverick looked out into the strand  cant we stop him he asked rapidly  the porter smiled as he shook his head  not the ghost of a chance sir  he shot round the corner there as though he were in a desperate hurry and went the wrong side of the island  i heard the police calling to him  i hope theres nothing wrong mr dean  the cashier hesitated and glanced at laverick  nothing much laverick answered  we should have liked to have asked him a questionthat is all  bellamy came out from the hotel and paused to light a cigarette  how are you laverick he said quietly  nothing the matter i hope  nothing worth mentioning laverick replied  the cashier returned to his duties  the two men were alone bellamy most carefully dressed with his silverheaded cane under his arm and his silk hat at precisely the correct angle seemed very far removed from the work of intrigue into which laverick felt himself to have blundered  he looked down for a moment at the tips of his patent shoes and up again at the sky as though anxious about the weather  what about a drink laverick he asked nonchalantly  delighted laverick assented     chapter xxxi  miss leneveus message   the two men stepped back into the hotel  the cashier had returned to his desk and the incident which had just transpired seemed to have passed unnoticed  nevertheless laverick felt that the studied indifference of his companions manner had its significance and he endeavored to imitate it  shall we go through into the bar he asked  theres very seldom any one there at this time  anywhere you say bellamy answered  its years since we had a drink together  they passed into the inner room and finding it empty drew two chairs into the further corner  bellamy summoned the waiter  two whiskies and sodas quick tim he ordered  now laverick listen to me he added as the waiter turned away  we are alone for the moment but it wont be for long  you know very well that it wasnt to renew our schoolboy acquaintance that ive asked you to come in here with me  laverick drew a little breath  please go on he said  i am as anxious as you can be to grasp this affair properly  when we left school bellamy remarked you were destined for the stock exchange  i went first to magdalen  did you ever hear what became of me afterwards  i always understood laverick answered that you went into one of the government offices  quite right bellamy assented  i did  at this moment i have the honor to serve his majesty  two thousand a year and two hours work a day laverick laughed i know the sort of thing  you evidently dont bellamy answered  i often work twenty hours a day i dont get half two thousand a year and most of the time i carry my life in my hands  when i am workingand i am working nowi am never sure of the morrow  laverick looked at him incredulously  youre not joking bellamy he asked  not by any manner of means  i have the honor to be a humble member of his majestys secret service  laverick glanced at his companion wonderingly  i really didnt know he said that such a service had any actual existence except in novels  i am a proof to the contrary bellamy declared grimly  abroad i run always the risk of being dubbed a spy and treated like one at home i am simply the head of the a2 branch of the secret service here come our drinks  laverick raised his whiskey and soda to his lips mechanically  heres luck he exclaimed  now go on bellamy he continued the waiter cant overhear  bellamy smiled  tim is one of the few persons in the place he said whom one can trust  as a matter of fact he has been very useful to me more than once  now listen to me attentively laverick  i am going to speak to you as one man to another  laverick nodded  i am ready he said  last monday bellamy went on leaning forward and speaking in a soft but very distinct undertone a man was murdered late at night in the heart of the citywithin one hundred yards of the stock exchange  the papers called it a mysterious murder  no one knows who the man was or who committed the crime or why  you and i laverick both know a little more than the rest of the world  well  the murder bellamy continued with a strange light in his eyes was accomplished only a stones throw from your office  laverick lit a cigarette and threw the match away  horrible affair it was he remarked  bellamy glanced toward the doora man had looked in and departed  enough of this fencing laverick he said  a theft was committed from the person of that murdered man of which the general public knows nothing  a pocketbook was stolen from him containing twenty thousand pounds and a sealed document  as to who murdered the man i want you to understand that that is not my affair  as to what has become of that twenty thousand pounds i have not the slightest curiosity  i want the document  what claim have you to it laverick asked quickly  i might retort but i will not bellamy replied  time is too short  i will answer you by explaining who the man was and what that document consists of  the mans name was von behrling and he was a trusted agent of the austrian secret service  the document of which he was robbed contains a verbatim report of the conference which recently took place at vienna between the emperor of germany the emperor of austria and the czar of russia  it contains the details of a plot against this country and the undertakings entered into by those several powers  i want that document laverick  have i established my claim  you have laverick answered  why on earth didnt you come to me before  dont you believe that i should have listened to you as readily as to mademoiselle idiale  i wish that i had come bellamy admitted and yet here is the truth laverick because the truth is best  twentytwo years lie between us and the time when we knew anything of one another  to me therefore you are a stranger  i had my spies following von behrling that night  i know that you took the pocketbook from his dead body  if you did not murder him yourself the deed was done by an accomplice of yours  how was i to trust you  we are speaking naked words my friend  we are dealing with naked truths  to me you were a murderer and a thief  a word from me and you would have realized the value of that document  i tell you frankly that austria would give you almost any sum for it today  laverick strong man though he was was conscious of a sudden weakness  he raised his hand to his forehead and drew it awaywet he struggled desperately for selfcontrol  bellamy he said heres truth for truth  i am not on my trial before you  believe me man for gods sake  ill try bellamy promised  go on  that night i stayed at my office late because i saw ruin before me on the morrow  i left it meaning to go straight home  i lit a cigarette near that entry and by the light of a match as i was throwing it away i saw the murdered man  i think for a time i was paralyzed  the pocketbook was half dragged out from his pocket why i looked inside it i dont know  i had some sort of wild idea that i must find out who he was  mind you though i should have given the alarm at once but there wasnt a soul in the street there was a man lurking in the entry and i chased him unsuccessfully when i came back the body was still there and the street empty  i looked inside that pocketbook which would have been in the possession of his murderer but for my unexpected appearance  i saw the notes there  once more i went out into the street  i gave no alarmi am not attempting to explain why  i was like a man made suddenly mad  i went back to my office and shut myself in  bellamy pointed to the glasses silently  the waiter came forward and refilled them  bellamy laverick continued your career and mine lie far apart and yet at their backbone as there is at the backbone of every mans life there must be something of the same sort of ambition my grandfather lived and died a member of the stock exchange honored and well thought of  my father followed in his footsteps  i too was there  without becoming wealthy the name i bear has become known and respected  failure whatever one may say means a broken life and a broken honor  i sat in my office and i knew that the use of those notes for a few days might save me from disgrace might keep the name which my father and grandfather had guarded so jealously free from shame  i would have paid any price for the use of them  i would have paid with my life if that had been possible think of the risk i ranthe danger i am now in  i deposited those notes on the morrow as security at my bank and i met all my engagements  the crisis is over  those notes are in a safe deposit vault in chancery lane  i only wish to heaven that i could find the owner  and the document bellamy asked  the document  it is in the hotel safe laverick answered  bellamy drew a long sigh of relief  then he emptied his tumbler and lit a cigarette  laverick he declared i believe you  thank god laverick muttered  i am no crime investigator bellamy went on thoughtfully  as to who killed von behrling or why i cannot now form the slightest idea  that twenty thousand pounds laverick is secret service money paid by me to von behrling only halfanhour before he was murdered in a small restaurant there for what i supposed to be the document  he deceived me by making up a false packet  the real one he kept  he deserved to die and i am glad he is dead  lavericks face was suddenly hopeful  then you can take these notes he exclaimed  bellamy nodded  in a few days he said i shall take you with me to a friend of minea cabinet minister  you shall tell him the story exactly as youve told it to me and restore the money  laverick laughed like a child  dont think im mad he apologized but i am not a person like you bellamyused to adventures and this sort of wild happenings im a steadygoing matteroffact englishman and this thing has been like a hateful nightmare to me  i cant believe that im going to get rid of it  bellamy smiled  its a great adventure he declared to come to any one like you to tell you the truth i cant imagine how you had the pluckdont misunderstand me i mean the moral pluckto run such a risk  why at the moment you used those notes bellamy continued the odds must have been about twenty to one against your not being found out  one doesnt stop to count the odds laverick said grimly  i saw a chance of salvation and i went for it  and now about this letter  bellamy rose to his feet  on the kings service he whispered softly  they walked once more to the cashiers desk  a stranger greeted them laverick produced his receipt  i should like the packet i deposited here this evening he said i am sorry to trouble you but i find that i require it unexpectedly  the clerk glanced at the receipt and up at the clock  i am afraid sir he answered that we cannot get at it before the morning  why not laverick demanded frowning  mr dean has just gone home the man declared and he is the only one who knows the combination on the l safe  you see sir he continued we keep this particular safe for documents and we did not expect that anything would be required from it tonight  bellamy drew laverick away  after all he said perhaps tomorrow morning would be better theres no need to get shirty with these fellows  as a matter of fact i dont think that i should have dared to receive it without making some special preparations  i can get some plain clothes men here upon whom i can rely at nine oclock  they strolled back into the hall  tell me laverick asked do you know who the man was who forged my name to the order a few hours ago  bellamy nodded  it was adolf kahn an austrian spy  i have been watching him for days  if theyd given him the paper i had four men at the door but it would have been touch and go  he is a very prince of conspirators that fellow  to tell you the truth i think i might as well go home  bellamy was drawing on his gloves when the hallporter brought a note to laverick  a messenger has just left this for you sir he explained  laverick tore open the envelope  the contents consisted of a few words only written on plain notepaper and in a handwriting which was strange to him    ring up 1232 gerrard  laverick frowned turned over the half sheet of paper and looked once more at the envelope  then he passed it on to his companion  what do you make of that bellamy he asked  bellamy smiled as he perused and returned it  what could any one make of it he remarked laconically  do you know the handwriting  never saw it before to my knowledge laverick answered  what should you do about it  i think bellamy suggested that i should ring up number 1232 gerrard  they crossed the hall and laverick entered one of the telephone booths  1232 gerrard he said  the connection was made almost at once  who are you laverick asked  i am speaking for miss zoe leneven was the reply  are you mr laverick  i am laverick answered  is miss leneveu there  can she speak to me herself  she is not here the voice continued  she was fetched away in a hurry from the theatrewe understood by her brother  she left two and sixpence with the doorkeeper here to ring you up and explain that she had been summoned to her brothers rooms 25 jermyn street and would you kindly go on there  who are you laverick demanded  there was no reply  laverick remained speechless listening intently  he stood still with the receiver pressed to his ear  was it his fancy or was that really zoes protesting voice which he heard in the background  it was a woman or a child who was speakinghe was almost sure that it was zoe  who are you he asked fiercely  miss leneveu is there with you why does she not speak for herself  miss leneveu is not here was the answer  i have done what she desired  you can please yourself whether you go or not  the address is 25 jermyn street  ring off  the connection was gone  laverick laid down the receiver and stepped out of the booth  i must be off at once he said to bellamy  youll be round in the morning  bellamy smiled  after all he remarked i have changed my plans  i shall not leave the hotel  i am going to telephone round to my man to bring me some clothes  by the bye do you mind telling me whether this message which you have just received had anything to do with the little affair in which we are interested  not directly laverick answered after a moments hesitation the message was from a young lady  i have to go and meet her  a young lady whom you can trust bellamy inquired quietly  implicitly laverick assured him  she spoke herself  no she sent a message  excuse me bellamy wont you but i must really go  by all means bellamy answered  they stood at the entrance to the hotel together while a taxicab was summoned  laverick stepped quickly in  25 jermyn street he ordered  bellamy watched him drive off  then he sighed  i think my friend laverick he said softly that you will need some one to look after you tonight     chapter xxxii  morrison is desperate   certainly it was a strange little gathering that waited in morrisons room for the coming of laverick  there was lassenflushed ugly breathing heavily and watching the door with fixed beady eyes there was adolf kahn the man who had strolled out from the milan hotel as laverick had entered it leaving the forged order behind him  there was streussstern and desperate with anxiety  there was morrison himself in the clothes of a workman worn to a shadow with the furtive gleam of terrified guilt shining in his sunken eyes and the slouched shoulders and broken mien of the habitual criminal  there was zoe around whom they were all standing with anger burning in her cheeks and gleaming out of her passionfilled eyes  she too like the others watched the door  so they waited  streuss not for the first time moved to the window and drawing aside the curtains looked down into the street  will he comethis englishman he muttered  has he courage  more courage than you who keep a girl here against her will zoe panted looking at him defiantly  more courage than my poor brother who stands there like a coward  shut up zoe morrison exclaimed harshly  there is nothing for you to be furious about or frightened  no one wants to illtreat you  these gentlemen all want to behave kindly to us  it is laverick they want  and you she cried are content to stand by and let him walk into a trapyou let them even use my name to bring him here arthur be a man  have nothing more to do with them  help me to get away from this place  call out  do something instead of standing there and wasting the precious minutes  he came towards herugly and threatening  ill do something in a minute he declared savagelysomething you wont like either  keep your mouth shut i tell you  its me or him and by heavens he deserves what hell get  streuss turned away from the window and looked towards zoe  young lady he said quietly let me beg you not to distress yourself so  i sincerely trust that nothing unpleasant will happen if it does i promise you that we will arrange for your temporary absence  you shall not be disturbed in any way  and as regards your brother have a care young lady lassen growled  if any ones in danger its he  hell be lucky if he saves his own skin  the young man glowered at her  you hear that you little fool he muttered  keep still cant you  her face was full of defiance  he came nearer to her and changed his tone  zoe he whispered hoarsely dont you understand  if they cant get what they want from laverick theyll visit it upon me  theyre desperate i tell you  they mean mischief all the time  yet you let him be brought here your partner who looked after you when you were ill and who helped you to get away she cried indignantly  he laughed unpleasantly  when it comes to a matter of life or death its every man for himself  besides if id known as much about laverick as i know now im not sure that i should have been so ready to gonot emptyhanded by any manner of means  what have you done that you should be so much in the power of these people she demanded fixing her dark eyes upon him searchingly  the terror whitened his face once more  the perspiration stood out in beads upon his forehead  dont dare to ask me questions he exclaimed nervously  i should like to know what laverick is to you eh that you take so much interest in him  listen here my fine young lady  if ive been mug enough to do the dirty work he hasnt made any bones about taking advantage of it  hes a nice sort of sportsman i can tell you  the man at the window suddenly dropped the curtain and spoke across the room to them all  he is here he announced  alone lassen asked thickly  alone streuss echoed  a little thrill seemed to pass through the room  zoe made no attempt to cry out  instead she leaned forward towards the door as though listening  her attitude seemed harmless enough  no one took any more notice of her  they all watched the entrance to the apartment zoe remembered the two flights of stairs  she was absorbed in a breathless calculation  nownow he should be coming quite close her whole being was concentrated upon one effort of listening  at last she raised her head  the room resounded with her cries  dont come in  dont come in here she shrieked  mr laverick do you hear  go away  dont come in here alone  her brother was the first to reach her his hand fell upon her mouth brutally  her little effort was naturally a failuredefeating in fact its own object  laverick hearing her cries simply hastened his coming threw open the door without waiting to knock and stepped quickly across the threshold  he saw a man dressed in shabby workmans clothes unshaven dishevelled holding zoe in a rough grasp and with a single welldirected blow he sent him reeling across the room  then something in the mans cry a momentary glimpse of his white face revealed his identity  morrison he cried  good god its morrison  arthur morrison was crouching in a corner of the room his evil face turned upon his aggressor  laverick took quick stock of his surroundings  there was the tall fair young manadolf kahnwhom he had seen at the milan a few hours agothe man who had unsuccessfully forged his name  there was lassen the man who under pretence of being her manager had been a spy upon louise  there was streuss with blanched face and hard features standing with his back to the door  there was zoe and behind her brother  she held out her hands timidly towards him and her eyes were soft with pleading  i did not want you to come here mr laverick she cried softly i tried so hard to stop you  it was not i who sent that message  he took her cold little fingers and raised them to his lips  i know it dear he murmured  then a movement in the room warned him and he was suddenly on guard lassen was close to his side some evil purpose plainly enough written in his pasty face and unwholesome eyes  laverick gave him his left shoulder and sent him staggering across the floor  he was angry at having been outwitted and his eyes gleamed ominously  well gentlemen he exclaimed you seem to have taken unusual pains to secure my presence here  tell me now what can i do for you  it was streuss who became spokesman  he addressed laverick with the consideration of one gentleman addressing another  his voice had many agreeable qualities  his demeanor was entirely amicable  mr laverick he answered let us first apologize if we used a little subterfuge to procure for us the pleasure of your visit  we are men who are in earnest and across whose path you have either wilfully or accidentally strayed  an understanding between us has become a necessity  go on laverick interrupted  tell me exactly who you are and what you want  as to who we are streuss answered does that really matter  i repeat that we are men who are in earnestlet that be enough  as to what we want it is a certain document to which we have every claim and which has come into your possessioni flatter you somewhat mr laverick if i say by chance  laverick shrugged his shoulders  let that go he said  i know all about the document you refer to and the notes  they were contained in a pocketbook which it is perfectly true has come into my possession  prove your claim to both and you shall have them  streuss smiled  you will admit that our claim since we know of its existence he asked suavely is equal to yours  certainly laverick answered but then i never had any idea of keeping either the document or the money  that your claim is better than mine is no guarantee that there is not some one else whose title is better still  streuss frowned  be reasonable mr laverick he begged  we are men of peacewhen peace is possible  the money of which you spoke you can consider as treasure trove if you will but it is our intention to possess ourselves of the document  it is for that reason that we are here in london  i personally am committed to the extent of my life and my honor to its recovery  a declaration of war courteously veiled but decisive  laverick looked around him a little defiantly and shrugged his shoulders  you know very well that i do not carry it about with me he said the gentleman on my left he added pointing to kahn can tell you where it is kept  quite so streuss admitted  we are not doing you the injustice to suppose that you would be so foolhardy as to trust yourself anywhere with that document upon your person  it is in the safe at the milan hotel  i may add that probably if it had not occurred to you to change your quarters it would have been in our possession before now  we are hoping to persuade you to return to the hotel with one of our friends here and procure it  as it happens laverick remarked that is impossible  the man who set the combination for that particular safe has gone off duty and will not be back again at the hotel till tomorrow morning  but he is to be found streuss answered easily  his present whereabouts and his address are known to us  he lives with his family at harvard court hampstead  we shall assist you in making it worth his while to return to the hotel or to give you the combination word for the safe  you are rather great on detail laverick exclaimed  it is our business  the question for you to decide and to decide immediately is whether you are ready to end this in some respects constrained situation and give your word to place that document in our hands  you are ready to accept my word then laverick asked  we have a certain hold upon you streuss continued slowly  your partner mr morrisons position in connection with the murder in crooked friars alley is as you may have surmised a somewhat unfortunate one  your own i will not allude to  i will simply suggest that for both your sakes publicityany measure of publicity in fact as regards this little affairwould not be desirable  laverick hesitated  he understood all that was implied  morrisons eyes were fixed upon himthe eyes of a craven coward  he felt the intensity of the moment  then zoe turned suddenly towards him  you are not to give it up she cried with trembling lips  they cannot hurt you and it is not trueabout arthur  kahn who was nearest clapped his hand over her mouth and laverick knocked him down  instantly the pacific atmosphere of the room was changed  lassen and morrison closed swiftly upon laverick from different sides  streuss covered him with the shining barrel of a revolver  mr laverick he said we are not here to be trifled with  keep your sister quiet morrison or by god youll swing  laverick looked at the revolverfascinated for an instant by its unexpected appearance  the face of the man who held it had changed  there was lightning playing about the room  its the dock for you both streuss exclaimed fiercelyfor you laverick and you morrison too if you play with us any longer  one of yous a murderer and the other receives the booty who are you to have scruplescriminals both of you  your place is in the dock and you shall be there within twentyfour hours if there are any more evasions  now laverick will you fetch that document  it is your last chance  upon the breathless silence that followed a quiet voice interveneda voice calm and emotionless tinged with a measure of polite inquiry  yet its level utterance fell like a bomb among the little company  the curtain separating this from the inner room had been drawn a few feet back and bellamy was standing there in black overcoat and white muffler his silk hat on the back of his head his left hand carefully gloved resting still upon the curtain which he had drawn aside  i hope i am not disturbing you at all he murmured softly  for a moment the development of the situation remained uncertain the gleaming barrel of streusss revolver changed its destination bellamy glanced at it with the pleased curiosity of a child  i really ought not to have intruded he continued amiably  i happened to hear the address my friend laverick gave to the taxicab driver and i was particularly anxious to have a word or two with him before i left for the continent  streuss was surely something of a charlatan  his revolver had disappeared  the smile upon his lips was both gracious and unembarrassed  one is always only too pleased to welcome mr bellamy anywhereanyhow he declared  if apologies are needed at all he continued it is to our friend and hostmr morrison here permit memr arthur morrisonthe honorable david bellamy these are mr morrisons rooms  morrison could do no more than stare  bellamy on the contrary with a little bow came further into the apartment removing his hat from his head  lassen glided round behind him remaining between bellamy and the heavy curtains  adolf kahn moved as though unconsciously in front of the door of the room in which they were  bellamy smiled courteously  i am afraid he said that i must not stay for more than a moment i have a car full of friends belowwe are on our way in fact to the covent garden balland one or two of them i fear he added indulgently have already reached that stage of exhilaration which such an entertainment in england seems to demand  they will certainly come and rout me out if i am here much longer  there he  exclaimed you hear that  there was the sound of a motor horn from the street below  streuss with an oath trembling upon his lips lifted the blind  there were two motorcars waiting therelarge cars with limousine bodies and apparently full of men  after all it was to be expected bellamy was no fool  since we are to lose you then mr laverick streuss remarked with a gesture of farewell let us say good night  the little matter of business which we were discussing can be concluded with your partner  laverick turned toward zoe  their eyes met and he read their message of terror  you are coming back to your own rooms miss leneveu he said you must let me offer you my escort  she half rose but in obedience to a gesture from streuss morrison moved near to them  if you leave me here laverick he muttered beneath his breathif you leave me to these hounds do you know what they will do they will hand me over to the policethey have sworn it  why did you come back laverick asked quickly  they stopped me as i was boarding the steamer morrison declared i tell you they have eyes everywhere  you cannot move without their knowledge  i had to come  now that i am here they have told me plainly the price of my freedom  it is that document  laverick it is my life  you must give inyou must indeed  remember youre in it too  am i laverick asked quietly  you fool of course you are morrison whispered hoarsely  didnt you come into the entry and take the pocketbook  heaven knows what possessed you to do it  heaven knows how you found the pluck to use the money  but you did it and you are a criminala criminal as i am  dont be a fool laverick  make terms with these people  they want the documentthe documentnothing but the document  they will let us keep the money  and you laverick asked turning suddenly to zoe  what do you say about all this  she looked at him fearlessly  i trust you she said  i trust you to do what is right     chapter xxxiii  laverick s arrest   at last david  louise welcomed her visitor eagerly with outstretched hands which bellamy raised for a moment to his lips  then she turned toward the third person who had also risen at the opening of the doora short somewhat thickset man with swarthy complexion closecropped black hair and upturned black moustache  you remember prince rosmaran she said to bellamy  he left servia only the day before yesterday  he has come to england on a special mission to the king  bellamy shook hands  i think he remarked i had the honor of meeting you once before prince at the opening of the servian parliament two years ago  it was just then i believe that you were elected to lead the patriotic party  the prince bowed sadly  my leadership i fear he declared has brought little good to my unhappy country  it is a terrible crisis through which your nation is passing bellamy reminded him sympathetically  at the same time we must not despair  austria holds out her clenched hands but as yet she has not dared to strike  the face of the prince was dark with passion  as yet no he answered  but how longhow long i wonderbefore the blow falls  we in servia have been blamed for arming ourselves but i tell you that today the austrian troops are being secretly concentrated on the frontier  their arsenals are working night and day  her soldiers are manoeuvering almost within sight of belgrade  we have hoped against hope yet in our hearts we know that our fate was sealed when the czar of russia left vienna last week  nothing is certain bellamy declared restlessly  england has been illgoverned for a great many years but we are not yet a negligible power  louise leaned a little towards him  david she whispered the compact  he answered her unspoken question  it is arranged he saidfinished  tomorrow morning at nine oclock i receive it  you are sure she begged  why need there be any delay  it is locked up in a powerful safe he explained and the clerk who has the combination will not be on duty again till nine laverick is there simply waiting for the hour  you were right louise as usual  i should have trusted him from the first  the prince had been listening to their conversation with undisguised interest  there is a rumor he said that some secret information concerning the compact of vienna has found its way to this country  bellamy smiled  hence i presume your mission prince  we three have no secrets from one another the prince declared our interests in this matter are absolutely identical  what you suggest mr bellamy is the truth  there is a rumor that the chancellor in the first few moments of his illness gave valuable information to some one who is likely to have communicated it to the government here  to be forewarned is to be forearmed  that i know is one of your own mottoes  so i am here to know if there is anything to be learned  bellamy nodded  your arrival is not inopportune prince  when did you come  i reached charing cross at midnight the prince answered  our train was an hour late  i am presenting my credentials early this morning and i am hoping for an interview during the afternoon  bellamy considered for a moment  it is true he said  between us three there is indeed no need for secrecy  the information you speak of will be in our hands within a few hours  i have no doubt whatever but that your minister will share in it  you know of what it consists the prince inquired curiously  i think so bellamy answered glancing at the clock  for my own part although the information itself is invaluable i see another and a profounder source of interest in that document  if indeed it is what we believe it to be it amounts to a casus belli  you mean that you would provoke war prince rosmaran asked  bellamy shrugged his shoulders  i said hei am not even a politician  but you know the lookerson see a good deal of the game and in my opinion there is only one course open for this countryto work upon russia so that she withdraws from any compact she may have entered into with austria and germany to accept germanys cooperation with austria in the despoilment of your country as a casus belli and to declare war at once while our fleet is invincible and our colonies free from danger  the prince nodded  it is good he admitted to hear mans talk once more  wherever one moves people bow the head before the might of germany and austria  let them alone but a little longer and they will indeed rule europe  three oclock struck  the prince rose  i go he announced  and i bellamy declared  come to my rooms at ten oclock tomorrow morning prince and you shall hear the news  bellamy lingered behind  for a moment he held louise in his arms and gazed sorrowfully into her weary face  is it worth while i wonder he asked bitterly  worth while she answered opening her eyes and looking at him to feel the mother love  who can help it who would not be ignoble  but yours dear he murmured is all grief  even now i am afraid  we can do no more than toil to the end she said  david you are sure this time  i am sure he replied  i am going back now to the hotel where laverick is staying  we are going to sit together and smoke until the morning  nothing short of an army could storm the hotel  i was with them all only an hour agostreuss that blackguard lassen and adolf kahn the police spy  they are beaten men and they know it  they had laverick had him by a trick but i made a dramatic entrance and the game was up  telephone me directly you have taken it safely to downing street she begged  i will he promised  bellamy walked from dover street to the strand  the streets were almost brilliant with the cold hard moonlight  the air seemed curiously keen  once or twice the fall of his feet upon the pavement was so clear and distinct that he fancied he was being followed and glanced sharply around  he reached the milan hotel however without adventure and looked towards the little open space in the hall where he had expected to find laverick  there was no one there  he stood still for a moment troubled with a sudden sense of apprehension  the place was deserted except for a couple of sleepylooking clerks and a small army of cleaners busy with their machines down in the restaurant moving about like mysterious figures in the dim light  bellamy turned back to the hallporter who had admitted him  do you happen to know what has become of the gentleman whom i was with about an hour ago he askeda tall fair gentlemanmr laverick his name was  the hallporter recognized bellamy and touched his hat  why yes sir he answered with a somewhat mysterious air  mr laverick was sitting over there in an easychair until about halfanhour ago  then two gentlemen arrived in a taxicab and inquired for him  they talked for a little time and finally mr laverick went away with them  bellamy was puzzled  went away with them he repeated  i dont understand that reynolds  he was to have waited here till i returned  the man hesitated  it didnt strike me sir he said that mr laverick was very wishful to go  it seemed as though he hadnt much choice about the matter  bellamy looked at him keenly  tell me what is in your mind he asked  mr bellamy sir the hallporter replied i knew one of those gentlemen by sight  he was a detective from scotland yard and the one who was with him was a policeman in plain clothes  good god bellamy exclaimed  you think then  i am afraid there was no doubt about it sir the man answered mr laverick was arrested on some charge     chapter xxxiv  morrisons disclosure   into new oxford street one of the ceaseless streams of polyglot humanity came zoe from her cheerless day bound for the theatre she was a little whiter a little more tired than usual  all day long she had heard nothing of laverick  all day long she had sat in her tiny room with the memory of that horrible night before her she had tried in vain to sleepshe had made no effort whatever to eat  she knew now why arthur morrison had fled away  she knew the cause of that paroxysm of fear in which he had sought her out the horror of the whole thing had crept into her blood like poison life was once more a dreary profitless struggle  all the wonderful dreams which had made existence seem almost like a fairytale for this last week had faded away  she was once more a mournful little waif among the pitiless crowds  she turned to the left and past the holborn tube  boys were shouting everywhere the contents of the evening papers  nearly every one seemed to be carrying one of the pink sheets  she herself passed on with unseeing eyes  news was nothing to her  governments might rise and fall war might come and goshe had still life to support a friendless little life too on two pounds fifteen shillings a week  the news they shouted fell upon deaf ears but one boy unfurled almost before her eyes the headlines of his sheet                sensational arrest of a wellknown               stockbroker  charge of murder  she came to a sudden stop and pulled out her purse  her fingers trembled so that the penny fell on to the pavement  the boy picked it up willingly enough however and she passed on with the paper in her hand  there it was on the front pagestaring her in the face             early yesterday morning mr stephen laverick of the firm of            laverick  morrison stockbrokers old broad street was            arrested at the milan hotel on the charge of being concerned            in the murder of a person unknown in crooked friars alley            on monday last the accused who made no reply to the charge            was removed to bow street policestation  particulars of his            examination before the magistrates will be found on page 4  there was a dull singing in her ears  an electric tram coming up from the underground passage seemed to bring with it some sort of thunder from an unknown world  she staggered on unseeing gasping for breath  if she could find somewhere to sit down  if she could only rest for a moment  then a sudden wave of strength came to her the blood flowed once more in her veinsblood that was hot with anger that stained her cheeks with a spot of red  it was the man she loved this being made to suffer falsely  it was the fulfilment of their threata deliberate plot against him  the murderer of crooked friars alleyshe knew who that wasshe knew  perhaps she might help  she had not the slightest recollection of the remainder of that walk but she found herself presently sitting in a quiet corner of the theatre with the paper spread out before her  she read that stephen laverick had been brought before mr rawson the magistrate of bow street police court on a warrant charging him with having been concerned with the murder of a person unknown and that he had pleaded not guilty  her eyes glittered as she read that the first witness called was mr arthur morrison late partner of the accused  she read his depositionthat he had left laverick at their offices at eleven oclock on the night in question that they were at that time absolutely without means and had no prospect of meeting their engagements on the morrow  she read the evidence of mr fenwick bank manager to the effect that mr laverick had on the following morning deposited with him the sum of twenty thousand pounds in bank of england notes by means of which the engagements of the firm were duly met that those notes had since been redeemed and that he had no idea of their present whereabouts she read too the evidence of adolf kahn an austrian visiting this country upon private business who deposed that he was in the vicinity just before midnight that he saw a person whom he identified as the accused walking down the street and after disappearing for a few minutes down the entry return and reenter the offices from which he had issued  he explained his presence there by the fact that he was waiting for a clerk employed by the goldfields corporation limited whose offices were close by further formal evidence was given and a remand asked for  the accuseds solicitor was on the point of addressing the court when mr rawson was unfortunately taken ill  after waiting for some time the case was adjourned until the next day and the accused man was removed in custody  zoe laid down the paper and rose to her feet  she made her way to where the stagemanager was superintending the erection of some new scenery  mr heepman she exclaimed i cannot stay to rehearsal  i have to go out  he turned heavily round and looked at her  rehearsal postponed he declared solemnly  shall you be back for the evening performance or shall we close the theatre  his clumsy irony missed its mark  her thoughts were too intensely focussed upon one thing  i am sorry she replied turning away  i will come back as soon as i can  he called out after her and she paused  look here he said you were absent from the performance the other evening and now you are skipping rehearsal without even waiting for permission  it cant be done young lady  you must do your playing around some other time  if youre not here when youre called you neednt trouble to turn up again  do you understand  her lips quivered and the sense of impending disaster which seemed to be brooding over her life became almost overwhelming  ill come back as soon as i can she promised with a little break in her voiceas soon as ever i can mr heepman  she hurried out of the theatre and took her place once more among the hurrying throng of pedestrians  several people turned round to look at her  her white face tightdrawn mouth and eyes almost unnaturally large seemed to have become the abidingplace for tragedy  she herself saw no one  she would have taken a cab but a glimpse at the contents of her purse dissuaded her  she walked steadily on to jermyn street walked up the stairs to the third floor and knocked at her brothers door  no one answered her at first she turned the handle and entered to find the room empty there were sounds however in the further apartment and she called out to him  arthur she cried are you there  who is it he demanded  it is izoe she exclaimed  what do you want  i want to speak to you arthur  i must speak to you  please come as quickly as you can  he growled something and in a few moments he appeared  he was wearing the morning clothes in which he had attended court earlier in the day but the change in him was perhaps all the more marked by reason of this resumption of his old attire  his cheeks were hollow his eyes scarcely for an instant seemed to lose that feverish gleam of terror with which he had returned from liverpool he knew very well what she had come about and he began nervously to try and bully her  i wish you wouldnt come to these rooms zoe he said  ive told you before theyre bachelors apartments and they dont like women about the place  what is it  what do you want  i was brought here last time without any particular desire on my part she answered looking him in the face  ive come now to ask you what accursed plot this is against stephen laverick  what were you doing in the court this morning lying  what is the meaning of it arthur  if youve come to talk rubbish like that he declared roughly youd better be off  no it is not rubbish she went on fearlessly  i think i can understand what it is that has happened  they have terrified you and bribed you until you are willing to do any despicable thingeven this  your father was good to my mother arthur and i have tried to feel towards you as though you were indeed a relation but nothing of that counts  i want you to realize that i know the truth and that i will not see an innocent man convicted while the guilty go free  he moved a step towards her  they were on opposite sides of the small round table which stood in the centre of the apartment  what do you mean he demanded hoarsely  isnt it plain enough she exclaimed  you came to my rooms a week or so ago a terrified brokendown man  if ever there was guilt in a mans face it was in yours  you sent for laverick  he pitied you and helped you away  at liverpool they would not let you embarkthese men  they have brought you back here  you are their tool  but you know very well arthur that it was not stephen laverick who killed the man in crooked friars alley  you know very well that it was not stephen laverick  why the devil should i know anything about it he asked fiercely  a note of passion suddenly crept into her voice  her little white hand with its accusing forefinger shot out towards him  because it was you arthur morrison who committed that crime she cried and sooner than another man should suffer for it i shall go to court myself and tell the truth  he was for the moment absolutely speechless pale as death with nervously twitching lips and fingers  but there was murder in his eyes  what do you know about this he muttered  never mind she answered  i know and i guess quite enough to convince meand i think anybody elsethat you are the guilty man i would have helped you and shielded you whatever it cost me but i will not do so at stephen lavericks expense  what is laverick to you he growled  he is nothing to me she replied but the best of friends  even were he less than that do you suppose that i would let an innocent man suffer  he moistened his dry lips rapidly  you are talking nonsense zoe he saidnonsense  even if there has been some little mistake what could i do now  i have given my evidence  so far as i am concerned the case is finished i shall not be called again until the trial  then you had better go to the magistrates tomorrow morning and take back your evidence she declared boldly for if you do not i shall be there and i shall tell the truth  zoe he gasped dont try me too high  this thing has upset me im ill  cant you see it zoe  look at me  i havent slept for weeks  night and day ive had the fearthe fear always with me you dont know what it isyou cant imagine  its like a terrible ghost keeping pace with you wherever you go laying his icy finger upon you whenever you would rest mocking at you when you try to drown thought even for a moment  dont you try me too far zoe im not responsible  laverick isnt the man you think him to be he isnt the man i believed  he did have that moneyhe did indeed  that she said is to be explained  but he is not a murderer  listen to me zoe morrison continued leaning across the table come and stay with me for a time and we will go away for a weeksomewhere to the seaside  we will talk about this and think it over  i want to get away from london  we will go to brighton if you like   i must do something for you zoe  im afraid ive neglected you a good deal  perhaps i could get you a better part at one of the theatres  i must make you an allowance  you ought to be wearing better clothes  she drew a little away  i want nothing from you arthur she said except thisthat you speak the truth  he wiped his forehead and struck the table before her  but good god zoe he exclaimed do you know what it is that you are asking me  do you want me to go into court and saythat isnt the man  it is i who am the murderer  do you want me to feel their hands upon my shoulder to be put there in the dock and have all the people staring at me curiously because they know that before very long i am to stand upon the scaffold and have that rope around my neck and  he broke off with a low cry wringing his hands like a child in a fit of impotent terror  but the girl in front of him never flinched  arthur she said crime is a terrible thing but nothing in the world can alter its punishment  if it is frightful for you to think of this what must it be for him  and you are guilty and he is not  i was mad morrison went on now almost beside himself  zoe i was mad  i called there to have a drink  we were brokethe firm was broke  id a hundred or so in my pocket and i was going to bolt the next day  and there within a few yards of me was that man with such a roll of notes as i had never seen in my life  five hundred pounds every one of them and a wad as thick as my fists zoe they fascinated me  i had two drinks quickly and i followed him out  somehow or other i found that id caught up a knife that was on the counter  i never meant to hurt him seriously but i wanted some of those notes  i was leaving the next day for africa and i hadnt enough money to make a fair start  i wanted itmy god how i wanted money  it couldnt have been worththat she cried looking at him wonderingly  i was mad he continued  i saw the notes and they went to my head  men do wild things sometimes when they are drunk or for love  i dont drink much and im not over fond of women but my god money is like the blood of my body to me  i saw it and i wanted it and i wanted it and i went mad  zoe you wont give me away  say you wont  but what am i to do she protested  he must not suffer  hell get off morrison assured her thickly  i tell you hell get off  hes only to part with the document which never belonged to him and the charge will be withdrawn  they know who the murdered man was  they know where the money came from which he was carrying  i tell you he can save himself  you wouldnt dream of sending me to the gallows zoe  stephen laverick will never give up that document to those people she declared  i am sure of that  its his own lookout morrison muttered  he has the chance anyway  she turned toward the door  i must go away she said  i must go away and think  it is all too horrible  he came round the table swiftly and caught at her wrists  listen he said i cant let you go like this  you must tell me that you are not going to give me up  do you hear  i can make no promises arthur she answered sadly only thisi shall not let stephen laverick suffer in your stead  he opened his hand and she shrank back terrified when she saw what it was that he was holding  then he struck her down and without a backward glance fled out of the place     chapter xxxv  bellamys success   late that afternoon the hallporter at the milan hotel the commissionaire and the chief maitre dhotel from the café who happened to be in the hall together with several others around the place who knew stephen laverick by sight were treated to an unexpected surprise  a large closed motorcar drove up to the front entrance and several men descended among whom was laverick himself  he nodded to the hallporter whose salute was purely mechanical and making his way without hesitation to the interior of the hotel presented his receipt at the cashiers desk and asked for his packet  the clerk looked up at him in amazement  he did not for the moment notice that the two men standing immediately behind bore the stamp of plainclothes policemen  he had only a few minutes ago finished reading the report of lavericks examination before the magistrates and his remand until the morrow upon the charge of murder  his knowledge of english law was by no means perfect but he was at least aware that lavericks appearance outside the purlieus of the prison was an unusual happening  your packet sir he repeated in amazement  why this is mr laverick himself is it not  certainly was the quiet reply  i am stephen laverick  the clerk called the head cashier who also stared at laverick as though he were a ghost they whispered together in the background for a moment and their faces were a study in perplexity  of lavericks identity however there was no manner of doubt  besides the presence of what was obviously a very ample escort somewhat reassured them  the cashier himself came forward  we shall be exceedingly glad mr laverick he said dryly to get rid of your packet  your instructions were that we should disregard all orders to hand it over to any person whatsoever and i may say that they have been strictly adhered to  we have however had two applications in your name this morning  they were both forgeries laverick declared  the cashier hesitated  then he leaned across the broad mahogany counter towards laverick  one of the men who appeared to form part of the escort detached himself from them and approached a few steps nearer  this gentleman is your friend sir the cashier asked glancing towards him  he is my solicitor laverick answered and is entirely in my confidence  if you have anything to tell me i should like mr bellamy also to hear  bellamy who was standing a little in the background took his place by lavericks side  the cashier who knew him by sight bowed  beside these two forged orders sir he said turning again to laverick we have had a man who took a room in the hotel leave a small black bag here which he insisted upon having deposited in our document safe  my assistant had accepted it and was actually locking it up when he noticed a faint sound inside which he could not understand  the bag was opened and found to contain an infernal machine which would have exploded in a quarter of an hour  bellamy drew his breath sharply between his teeth  we should have thought of that he exclaimed softly  thats kahns work  i seem to have given you a great deal of trouble laverick remarked quietly  i gather however from what you say that my packet is still in your possession  it is sir the man assented  we have two detectives from scotland yard here at the present moment though and we had almost decided to place it in their charge for greater security  it will be well taken care of from now i promise you laverick declared  the cashier and his clerk led the way into the inner office  at their invitation laverick and his solicitor followed and a few yards behind came the two plainclothes policemen bellamy and the superintendent  the safe was opened and the packet placed in lavericks hands  he passed it on at once to bellamy and immediately afterwards the doorway behind was thronged with men apparently ordinary loiterers around the hotel  they made a slow and exceedingly cautious exit  once outside bellamy turned to laverick with outstretched hand  au revoir and good luck old chap he said heartily  i think youll find things go your way all right tomorrow morning  he departed forming one of a somewhat singular cavalcadetwo of his friends on either side two in front and two behind  it had almost the appearance of a procession  the whole party stepped into a closed motorcar  three or four men were lounging on the pavement and there was some excited whispering but no one actually interfered  as soon as they had left the courtyard laverick and his solicitor with his own guard reentered the motorcar in which they had arrived and drove back to bow street  very few words were exchanged during the short journey  his solicitor however bade him goodnight cheerfully and lavericks bearing was by no means the bearing of a man in despair  in downing street within the next halfanhour a somewhat remarkable little gathering took place  the two men chiefly responsible for the destinies of the nationthe prime minister and the secretary of state for foreign affairssat side by side before a small table  facing them was bellamy and spread out in front were those few pages of foolscap released from their envelope a few minutes ago for the first time since the hand of the great chancellor himself had pressed down the seal  the foreign minister had just finished a translation for the benefit of his colleague and the two men were silent as men are in the presence of big events  bellamy the prime minister said slowly you are willing to stake i presume your reputation upon the authenticity of this document  my honor and my life if you will bellamy answered earnestly that is no copy which you have there  on the contrary the handwriting is the handwriting of the chancellor himself  the prime minister turned silently towards his colleague  the latter whose eyes still seemed glued to those fateful words looked up  all i can say is this he remarked impressively that never in my time have i seen written words possessed of so much significance one moment if you please  he touched the bell and his private secretary entered at once from an adjoining room  anthony he said telephone to the great western railway company at paddington  ask for the station master in my name and see that a special train is held ready to depart for windsor in halfanhour tell the stationmaster that all ordinary traffic must be held up but that the destination of the special is not to be divulged  the young man bowed and withdrew  the more i consider this matter the foreign minister went on the more miraculous does the appearance of this document seem we know now why the czar is struggling so frantically to curtail his visitwhy he came as it were under protest and seeks everywhere for an opportunity to leave before the appointed time his health is all right  he has had a hint from vienna that there has been a leakage  his special mission only reached paris this morning  the president is in the country and their audience is not fixed until tomorrow  rawson will go over with a copy of these papers and a dispatch from his majesty by the nine oclock train it is not often that we have had the chance of such a coup as this  he drew his chief a few steps away  they whispered together for several moments  when they returned the foreign minister rang the bell again for his secretary  anthony he said sir james and i will be leaving in a few minutes for windsor  go round yourself to general hamilton telephone to aldershot for lord neville and call round at the admiralty board for sir john harrison  tell them all to be here at ten oclock tonight  if i am not back they must wait  if either of them have royal commands you need only repeat the word finisterre  they will understand  the young man once more withdrew  the prime minister turned back to the papers  it will be worth a great deal he remarked with a grim smile to see his majestys face when he reads this  it would be worth a great deal more his fellow statesman answered dryly to be with his august cousin at the interview which will follow  a month ago the thought that war might come under our administration was a continual terror to me  today things are entirely different  today it really seems that if war does come it may be the most glorious happening for england of this century  you saw the last report from kiel  sir james nodded  there isnt a battleship or a cruiser worth a snap of the fingers south of the german ocean his colleague continued earnestly they are cooped upsafe enough they thinkunder the shelter of their fortifications  hamilton has another idea  between you and me sir james so have i  i tell you he went on in a deeper and more passionate tone its like the passing of a terrible nightmarethis  we have had ten years of panic of nervous fears of a german invasion and no one knows more than you and i sir james how much cause we have had for those fears  it will seem strange if after all history has to write that chapter differently  the secretary reentered and announced the result of his telephone interview with the superintendent at paddington  the two great men rose  the prime minister held out his hand to bellamy  bellamy he declared youve done us one more important service there may be work for you within the next few weeks but youve earned a rest for a day or two at any rate  there is nothing more we can do  nothing except a letter to the home secretary sir james bellamy answered  remember sir that although i have worked hard the man to whom we really owe those papers is stephen laverick  the prime minister frowned thoughtfully  its a difficult situation bellamy he said  you are asking a great deal when you suggest that we should interfere in the slightest manner with the course of justice  you are absolutely convinced i suppose that this man laverick had nothing to do with the murder  absolutely and entirely sir bellamy replied  the murdered man has never been identified by the police sir james remarked  who was he  his name was rudolph von behrling bellamy announced and he was actually the chancellors nephew also his private secretary  i have told you the history sir of those papers  it was von behrling who without a doubt murdered the american journalist and secured them  it was he who insisted upon coming to london instead of returning with them to vienna which would have been the most obvious course for him to have adopted  he was a pauper and desperately in love with a certain lady who has helped me throughout this matter  he agreed to part with the papers for twenty thousand pounds and the lady incidentally promised to elope with him the same night  i met him by appointment at that little restaurant in the city paid him the twenty thousand pounds and received the false packet which you remember i brought to you sir  as a matter of fact von behrling either by accident or design and no man now will ever know which left me with those papers which i was supposed to have bought in his possession and also the money  within five minutes he was murdered  doubtless we shall know sometime by whom but it was not by stephen laverick  lavericks share in the whole thing was nothing but thisthat he found the pocketbook and that he made use of the notes in his business for twentyfour hours to save himself from ruin  that was unjustifiable of course  he has made atonement  the notes at this minute are in a safe deposit vault and will be returned intact to the fund from which they came i want also to impress upon you sir james the fact that baron de streuss offered one hundred thousand pounds for that letter  sir james nodded thoughtfully  he stooped down and scrawled a few lines on half a sheet of notepaper  you must take this to lord estcourt at once he said and tell him the whole affair omitting all specific information as to the nature of the papers  the thing must be arranged of course  halfadozen reporters who had somehow got hold of the fact that the prime minister and his colleague from the foreign office were going down to windsor on a special mission followed them but even they remained altogether in the dark as to the events which were really transpiring  they knew nothing of the interview between the czar and his august hostan interview which in itself was a chapter in the history of these times  they knew nothing of the reason of their royal visitors decision to prolong his visit instead of shortening it or of his autograph letter to the president of the french republic which reached paris even before the special mission from st petersburg had presented themselves the one thing which they did know and that alone was significant enough was that the czars foreign minister was cabled for that night to come to his master by special train from st petersburg at the austrian and german embassies forewarned by a report from baron de streuss something like consternation reigned  the russian ambassador heckled to death took refuge at windsor under pretence of a command from his royal master  the happiest man in london was prince rosmaran     chapter xxxvi  laverick acquitted   at midday on the following morning laverick stepped down from the dock at bow street and as the evening papers put it in company with his friends left the court  the proceedings altogether took scarcely more than halfanhour  lavericks solicitor first put shepherd in the box who gave his account of morrisons visit to the restaurant spoke of his hurried exit and identified the knife which he had seen him snatch up  crossexamined as to why he had kept silent he explained that mr morrison had been a good customer and he saw no reason why he should give unsolicited evidence which would cost a man his life  directly however another man had been accused the matter appeared to him to be altogether different  he had come forward the moment he had heard of lavericks arrest to offer his evidence  while the opinion of the court was still undecided lavericks solicitor called miss zoe leneveu  a little murmur of interest ran though the court  laverick himself started  zoe stepped into the witnessbox looking exceedingly pale and with a bandage over the upper part of her head  she admitted that she was the halfsister of arthur morrison although there was no blood relationship  she described his sudden visit to her rooms on the night of the murder and his state of great alarm  she declared that he had confessed to her on the previous afternoon that he had been guilty of the murder in question  her place in the witnessbox was taken by the honorable david bellamy  he declared that the prisoner was an old friend of his and that the twenty thousand pounds of which he had been recently possessed had come from him for investment in lavericks business the circumstances he admitted were somewhat peculiar and until negotiations had been concluded mr laverick had doubtless felt uncertain how to make use of the money  but he assured the court that there was no person who had any claim to the sum of money in question save himself and that he was perfectly aware of the use to which laverick had put it  laverick was discharged within a very few minutes and a warrant was issued for the apprehension of morrison  laverick found bellamy waiting for him and was hurried into his motor  well you see the latter exclaimed we kept our word  that dear plucky little friend of yours turned the scale but in any case i think that there would not have been much trouble about the matter  the magistrate had received a communication direct from the home secretary concerning your case  i am very grateful indeed laverick declared  i tell you i think i am very lucky  i wish i knew what had become of miss leneveu  the usher told me she left the court before we came out  i asked her to go straight back to her rooms bellamy said  you must excuse me for interfering laverick but i found her almost in a state of collapse last night in jermyn street  i was having morrison watched and my man reported to me that he had left his rooms in a state of great excitement and that a young lady was there who appeared to be seriously injured  dd scamp laverick muttered  i did everything i could bellamy continued  i fetched her at once and sent her back to her house with a hospital nurse and some one to look after her  the wound wasnt serious but the fellow must have been a brute indeed to have lifted his hand against such a child  i wonder whether hell get away  i should doubt it laverick remarked  he hasnt the nerve hell probably get drunk and blow his brains out  hes a brokenspirited cur after all  youll have some lunch bellamy asked  laverick shook his head  if you dont mind id like to go on and see miss leneveu  put me down at the club then and take my car on if you will   laverick walked up and down the pavement outside zoes little house for nearly halfanhour  he had found the door closed and locked and a neighbor had informed him that miss leneveu had gone out in a cab with the nurse some time ago and had not returned  laverick sent bellamys car back and waited  presently a fourwheel cab came round the corner and stopped in front of her house  laverick opened the door and helped zoe out  she was as white as death and the nurse who was with her was looking anxious  you are safe then she murmured holding out her hands  quite he answered  you dear little girl  zoe had fainted however and laverick hurried out for the doctor curiously enough it was the same man who only a week or so ago had come to see arthur morrison  she has had a bad scalp wound he declared and her nervous system is very much run down  there is nothing serious  she seems to have just escaped concussion  the nurse had better stay with her for another day at any rate  you are sure that it isnt serious laverick asked eagerly  not in the least the doctor answered dryly  i see worse wounds every day of my life  ill come again tomorrow if you like but it really isnt necessary with the nurse on the spot  his natural pessimism was for a moment lightened by the fee which laverick pressed upon him and he departed with a few more encouraging words  laverick stayed and talked for a short time with the nurse  she has gone off to sleep now sir the latter announced  there isnt anything to worry about  she seems as though she had been having a hard time though  there was scarcely a thing in the house but half a packet of teaand these  she held up a packet of pawn tickets  i found these in a drawer when i came she said  i had to look round because there was no money and nothing whatever in the house  laverick was suddenly conscious of an absurd mistiness before his eyes  poor little woman he murmured  i think shed sooner have starved than ask for help  the nurse smiled  i thought at first that she was rather a vain young lady she remarked  an empty larder and a pile of pawn tickets and a new hat with a receipted bill for thirty shillings she added pointing to the sofa  laverick placed some notes in her hands  please keep these he begged and see that she has everything she wants  i shall be here again later in the day  there is not the slightest need for all this  she will be quite well off for the rest of her life  will you try and engage some one for a day or two to come in until she is able to be moved  ill look after her the nurse promised  laverick went reluctantly away  the events of the last few days were becoming more and more like a dream to him  he went to his club almost from habit  presently the excitement which all london seemed to be sharing drove his own personal feelings a little into the background  the air was full of rumors  the prime minister and the foreign secretary were spoken of as one speaks of heroes  nothing was definitely known but there was a splendid feeling of confidence that for once in her history england was preparing to justify her existence as a great power     chapter xxxvii  the plot that failed   the progress of the czar from buckingham palace to the mansion house where he had after all consented to lunch with the lord mayor witnessed a popular outburst of enthusiasm absolutely inexplicable to the general public  it was known that affairs in central europe were in a dangerously precarious state and it was felt that the czars visit here and the urgent summons which had brought from st petersburg his foreign minister were indications that the long wishedfor entente between russia and this country was now actually at hand  there was in the press a curious reticence with regard to the development of the political situation one felt everywhere that it was the calm before the stormthat at any moment the great black headlines might tell of some startling stroke of diplomacy some dangerous peril averted or defied  the circumstances themselves of the czars visit had been a little peculiar  on his arrival it was announced that for reasons of health the original period of his stay namely a week was to be cut down to two days  no sooner had he arrived at windsor however than a change was announced  the czar had so far recovered as to be able even to extend the period at first fixed for his visit simultaneously with this the german and austrian press were full of bitter and barely veiled articles whose meaning was unmistakable the czar had thrown in his lot at first with austria and germany that he was going deliberately to break away from that arrangement there seemed now scarcely any manner of doubt  bellamy and louise from a window in fleet street watched him go by  prince rosmaran had been specially bidden to the luncheon but he too had been with them earlier in the morning  afterwards they turned their backs upon the city and as soon as the crowd had thinned made their way to one of the westend restaurants  it seems too good to be true declared louise  bellamy nodded  nevertheless i am convinced that it is true  the humor of the whole thing is that it was our friends in germany themselves who pressed the czar not to altogether cancel his visit for fear of exciting suspicion  that of course was when there seemed to be no question of the news of the vienna compact leaking out  they would never have dared to expose a man to such a trial as the czar must have faced when the resume of the vienna proceedings in the chancellors own handwriting was read to him at windsor  you saw the telegram from paris louise interposed  the special mission from st petersburg has been recalled  bellamy smiled  it all goes to prove what i say he went on  any morning you may expect to hear that austria and germany have received an ultimatum  i wonder she remarked what became of streuss  he is hiding somewhere in london without a doubt bellamy answered  theres always plenty of work for spies  dont use that word she begged  he made a little grimace  you are thinking of my own connection with the profession are you not he asked  well that counts for nothing now  i hope i may still serve my country for many years but it must be in a different way  what do you mean she demanded  i heard from my uncles solicitors this morning bellamy continued that he is very feeble and cannot live more than a few months when he dies of course i must take my place in the house of lords it is his wish that i should not leave england again now so i suppose there is nothing left for me but to give it up  i have done my share of traveling and work after all he concluded thoughtfully  your share indeed she murmured  remember that but for that document which was read to the czar at windsor servia must have gone down and england would have had to take a place among the secondclass powers  there may be war now it is true but it will be a glorious war  louise very soon we shall know  until then i will say nothing but i do not want you altogether to forget that there has been something in my life dearer to me even than my career for these last few years  her blue eyes were suddenly soft  she looked across towards him wistfully  dear she whispered things will be altered with you now  i am not fit to be the wife of an english peeri am not noble  he laughed  i am afraid he assured her that i am democrat enough to think you one of the noblest women on earth  why should i not  your life itself has been a study in devotion  the modern virtues seem almost to ignore patriotism yet the love of ones country is a splendid thing  but dont you think louise that we have done our work that it is time to think of ourselves  she gave him her hand  let us see she said  let us wait for a little time and see what comes  that night another proof of the popular feeling absolutely spontaneous broke out in one of the least expected places  louise was encored for her wonderful solo in a modern opera of bellicose trend and instead of repeating it she came alone on the stage after a few minutes absence dressed in servian national dress  for a short time the costume was not recognized  then the musicthe national hymn of servia and the recollection of her parentage brought the thing home to the audience  they did not even wait for her to finish  in the middle of her song the applause broke like a crash of thunder  from the packed gallery to the stalls they cheered her wildly madly  a dozen times she came before the curtain  it seemed impossible that they would ever let her go  directly she turned to leave the stage the uproar broke out again  the manager at last insisted upon it that she should speak a few words  she stood in the centre of the stage amid a silence as complete as the previous applause had been unanimous  her voice reached easily to every place in the house  i thank you all very much she said  i am very happy indeed to be in london because it is the capital city of the most generous country in the worldthe country that is always ready to protect and help her weaker neighbors  i am a servian and i love my country and therefore she added with a little break in her voicetherefore i love you all  it was nearly midnight before the audience was got rid of and the streets of london had not been so impassable for years  crowds made their way to the front of buckingham palace and on to the war office where men were working late  everything seemed to denote that the spirit of the country was roused the papers next morning made immense capital of the incident and for the following twentyfour hours suspense throughout the country was almost at fever height  it was known that the cabinet council had been sitting for six hours  it was known too that without the least commotion with scarcely any movements of ships that could be called directly threatening the greatest naval force which the world had ever known was assembling off dover  the stock markets were wildly excited  laverick back again in his office found that his return to his accustomed haunts occasioned scarcely any comment  more startling events were shaping themselves  his own remarkable adventure remained curiously enough almost undiscussed  he left the office shortly before his usual time notwithstanding the rush of business and drove at once to the little house in theobald square  zoe was lying on the sofa still white but eager to declare that the pain had gone and that she was no longer suffering  it is too absurd she declared smiling my having this nurse here  really there is nothing whatever the matter with me  i should have gone to the theatre but you see it is no use  she passed him the letter which she had been reading and which contained her somewhat curt dismissal  he laughed as he tore it into pieces  are you so sorry zoe  is the stage so wonderful a place that you could not bear to think of leaving it  she shook her head  it is not that she whispered  you know that it is not that  he smiled as he took her confidently into his arms  there is a much more arduous life in front of you dear he said you have to come and look after me for the rest of your days  a bachelor who marries as late in life as i do you know is a trying sort of person  she shrank away a little  you dont mean it she murmured  you know very well that i mean it he answered kissing her  i think you knew from the very first that sooner or later you were doomed to become my wife  she sighed faintly and halfclosed her eyes  for the moment she had forgotten everything  she was absolutely and completely happy  later on he made her dress and come out to dinner and afterwards as they sat talking he laid an evening paper before her  zoe he declared the best thing that could has happened  you will not be foolish dear about it i know  remember the alternativeand read that  she glanced at the few lines which announced the finding of arthur morrison in a house in bloomsbury square  the police had apparently tracked him down and he had shot himself at the final moment  the details of his last few hours were indescribable  zoe shuddered and her eyes filled with tears  she smiled bravely in his face however  it is terrible she whispered simply but after all he was no relation of mine and he tried to do you a frightful injury  when i think of that i find it hard even to be sorry  there was indeed almost a pitiless look in her face as she folded up the paper as though she felt something of that common instinct of her sex which transforms a gentle woman so quickly into a hard merciless creature when the being whom she loves is threatened  laverick smiled  let us go out into the streets he said and hear what all this excitement is about  they bought a late edition and there it was at last in black and white  an ultimatum had been presented at berlin and vienna certain treaty rights which had been broken with regard to austrias action in the east were insisted upon by great britain  it was demanded that austria should cease the mobilization of her troops upon the servian frontier and renounce all rights to a protectorate over that country whose independence great britain felt called upon from that time forward to guarantee  it was further announced that england france and russia were acting in this matter in complete concert and that the neutrality of italy was assured  further it was known that the great english fleet had left for the north sea with sealed orders  laverick took zoe home early and called later at bellamys rooms bellamy greeted him heartily  he was on the point of going out and the two men drove off together in the latters car  see my dear friend bellamy exclaimed what great things come from small means  the document which you preserved for us and for which we had to fight so hard has done all this  it is marvelous laverick murmured  it is very simple bellamy declared  that meeting in vienna was meant to force our hands  it is all a question of the balance of strength  germany and austria together with russia friendlyeven with russia neutralcould have defied europe  germany could have spread out her army westwards while austria seized upon her prey  it was a splendid plot and it was going very well until the czar himself was suddenly confronted by our king and his ministers with a revelation of the whole affair  at windsor the thing seemed different to him  the french government behaved splendidly and the czar behaved like a man  germany and austria are left plante la if they fight well it will be no onesided affair  they have no fleet or rather they will have none in a fortnights time  they have no means of landing an army here  austria perhaps can hold russia but with a french army in better shape than it has been for years and the english landing as many men as they care to do with ease anywhere on the north coast of germany the entire scheme proved abortive  come into the club and have a drink laverick today great things have happened to me  and to me laverick interposed  you can guess my news perhaps bellamy said as they seated themselves in easychairs  mademoiselle idiale has promised to be my wife  laverick held out his hand  i congratulate you heartily he exclaimed  i have been an engaged man myself for something like halfanhour     chapter xxxviii  a farewell appearance   one thing at least these recent adventures should teach whoever may be responsible for the government of this country bellamy remarked to his wife as he laid down the morning paper  for the first time in many years we have taken the aggressive against powers of equal standing  we were always rather good at bullying smaller countries but the bare idea of an ultimatum to germany would have made our late premier go lightheaded  and yet it succeeded louise reminded him  absolutely he affirmed  todays news makes peace a certainty if your country knew everything louise theyd give us a royal welcome next month  you really mean that we are to go there then she asked  it isnt exactly one of my privileges he declared to fix upon the spot where we shall take our belated honeymoon but i havent been in belgrade for years and i know youd like to see your people  it will be more happiness than i ever dreamed of she murmured do you think we shall be safe in passing through vienna  bellamy laughed  remember he said that i am no longer david bellamy with a silver greyhound attached to my watchchain and an obnoxious reputation in foreign countries  i am lord denchester of denchester a harmless english peer traveling on his honeymoon by the way i hope you like the title  i shall love it when i get used to it she declared  to be an english countess is dazzling but i do think that i ought not to go on singing at covent garden  tomorrow will be your last night he reminded her  i have asked laverick and the dear little girl he is going to marry to come with me  afterwards we must all have supper together  how nice of you she exclaimed  i dont know about that bellamy said smiling  i really like laverick  he is a decent fellow and a good sort  incidentally he was thundering useful to us and pretty plucky about it  he interests me too in another way  he is a man who face to face with a moral problem acted exactly as i should have done myself  you mean about the twenty thousand pounds she asked  bellamy assented  he was practically dishonest he pointed out  he had no right to use that money and he ought to have taken the pocketbook to the policestation  if he had done sothat is to say if he had waited there for the police if he had been seen to hold out that pocketbook to have discussed it with any one it is ten to one that there would have been another tragedy that night  at any rate the document would never have come to us  she smiled  my moral judgment is warped she asserted from the fact that lavericks decision brought us the document  he nodded  perhaps so he agreed and yet there was the man face to face with ruin  the use of that money for a few hours did no one any harm and saved him  i say that such a deed is always a matter of calculation and in this case that he was justified  i wonder what he really thinks about it himself she remarked  perhaps ill ask him  but when the time came and he sat in the box with laverick and zoe he forgot everything else in the joy of watching the woman whom he had loved so long  she moved about the stage that night as though her feet indeed fell upon the air  she appeared to be singing always with restraint yet with some new power in her voice a quality which even in her simpler notes left the great audience thrilled  already there was a rumor that it was her last appearance her marriage to bellamy had been that day announced in the morning post when in the last act she sang alone on the stage the famous love song it seemed to them all that although her voice trembled more than once it was a new thing to which they listened  zoe found herself clasping lavericks hand in tremulous excitement bellamy sat like a statue a little back in the box his cleancut face thrown into powerful relief by the shadows beyond  yet as he listened his eyes too were marvelously soft  the song grew and grew till with the last notes the whole story of an exquisite and expectant passion seemed trembling in her voice  the last note came from her lips almost as though unwillingly and was prolonged for an extraordinary period  when it died away its passing seemed something almost unrealizable  it quivered away into a silence which lasted for many seconds before the gathering roar of applause swept the house  and in those last few seconds she had turned and faced bellamy  their eyes met and the light which flashed from his seemed answered by the quivering of her throat  it was her goodbye  she was singing a new lovesong singing her way into the life of the man whom she loved singing her way into love itself  once more the great house packed to the ceiling was worked up to a state of frenzied excitement  bellamy was recognized and the significance of her song sent a wave of sentiment through the house whose only possible form of expression took to itself shape in the frantic greetings which called her to the front again and again but the three in the box were silent  bellamy stood back in the shadows  laverick and zoe seemed suddenly to become immersed in themselves  bellamy threw open the door of the box and pointed outside  at luigis in halfanhour said he softly  you will excuse me for a few minutes  i am going to louise
