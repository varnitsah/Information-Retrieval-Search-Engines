99619566	mrs skaggss husbands   by bret harte     contents   mrs skaggss husbands  how santa claus came to simpsons bar  the princess bob and her friends  the iliad of sandy bar  mr thompsons prodigal  the romance or madrono hollow  the poet of sierra flat  the christmas gift that came to rupert     mrs skaggss husbands   part iwest   the sun was rising in the foothills but for an hour the black mass of sierra eastward of angels had been outlined with fire and the conventional morning had come two hours before with the down coach from placerville the dry cold dewless california night still lingered in the long canyons and folded skirts of table mountain even on the mountain road the air was still sharp and that urgent necessity for something to keep out the chill which sent the barkeeper sleepily among his bottles and wineglasses at the station obtained all along the road  perhaps it might be said that the first stir of life was in the barrooms a few birds twittered in the sycamores at the roadside but long before that glasses had clicked and bottles gurgled in the saloon of the mansion house this was still lit by a dissipatedlooking hanginglamp which was evidently the worse for having been up all night and bore a singular resemblance to a faded reveller of angels who even then sputtered and flickered in his socket in an armchair below ita resemblance so plain that when the first level sunbeam pierced the windowpane the barkeeper moved by a sentiment of consistency and compassion put them both out together  then the sun came up haughtily when it had passed the eastern ridge it began after its habit to lord it over angels sending the thermometer up twenty degrees in as many minutes driving the mules to the sparse shade of corrals and fences making the red dust incandescent and renewing its old imperious aggression on the spiked bosses of the convex shield of pines that defended table mountain thither by nine oclock all coolness had retreated and the outsides of the up stage plunged their hot faces in its aromatic shadows as in water  it was the custom of the driver of the wingdam coach to whip up his horses and enter angels at that remarkable pace which the woodcuts in the hotel barroom represented to credulous humanity as the usual rate of speed of that conveyance at such times the habitual expression of disdainful reticence and lazy official severity which he wore on the box became intensified as the loungers gathered about the vehicle and only the boldest ventured to address him it was the hon judge beeswinger member of assembly who today presumed perhaps rashly on the strength of his official position  any political news from below bill he asked as the latter slowly descended from his lofty perch without however any perceptible coming down of mien or manner  not much said bill with deliberate gravity the president o the united states heznt bin hisself sens you refoosed that seat in the cabinet the ginral feelin in perlitical circles is one o regret  irony even of this outrageous quality was too common in angels to excite either a smile or a frown bill slowly entered the barroom during a dry dead silence in which only a faint spirit of emulation survived  ye didnt bring up that agint o rothschilds this trip asked the barkeeper slowly by way of vague contribution to the prevailing tone of conversation  no responded bill with thoughtful exactitude he said he couldnt look inter that claim o johnsons without first consultin the bank o england  the mr johnson here alluded to being present as the faded reveller the barkeeper had lately put out and as the alleged claim notoriously possessed no attractions whatever to capitalists expectation naturally looked to him for some response to this evident challenge he did so by simply stating that he would take sugar in his and by walking unsteadily toward the bar as if accepting a festive invitation to the credit of bill be it recorded that he did not attempt to correct the mistake but gravely touched glasses with him and after saying heres another nail in your coffina cheerful sentiment to which and the hair all off your head was playfully added by the othershe threw off his liquor with a single dexterous movement of head and elbow and stood refreshed  hello old major said bill suddenly setting down his glass are you there  it was a boy who becoming bashfully conscious that this epithet was addressed to him retreated sideways to the doorway where he stood beating his hat against the doorpost with an assumption of indifference that his downcast but mirthful dark eyes and reddening cheek scarcely bore out perhaps it was owing to his size perhaps it was to a certain cherubic outline of face and figure perhaps to a peculiar trustfulness of expression that he did not look half his age which was really fourteen  everybody in angels knew the boy either under the venerable title bestowed by bill or as tom islington after his adopted father his was a familiar presence in the settlement and the theme of much local criticism and comment his waywardness indolence and unaccountable amiabilitya quality at once suspicious and gratuitous in a pioneer community like angelshad often been the subject of fierce discussion a large and reputable majority believed him destined for the gallows a minority not quite so reputable enjoyed his presence without troubling themselves much about his future to one or two the evil predictions of the majority possessed neither novelty nor terror  anything for me bill asked the boy half mechanically with the air of repeating some jocular formulary perfectly understood by bill  anythin for you echoed bill with an overacted severity equally well understood by tommyanythin for you no and its my opinion there wont be anythin for you ez long ez you hang around barrooms and spend your valooable time with loafers and bummers git  the reproof was accompanied by a suitable exaggeration of gesture bill had seized a decanter before which the boy retreated still goodhumoredly bill followed him to the door dern my skin if he heznt gone off with that bummer johnson he added as he looked down the road  whats he expectin bill asked the barkeeper  a letter from his aunt reckon hell hev to take it out in expectin likely theyre glad to get shut o him  hes leadin a shiftless idle life here interposed the member of assembly  well said bill who never allowed any one but himself to abuse his protege seein he aint expectin no offis from the hands of an enlightened constitooency it is rayther a shiftless life after delivering this parthian arrow with a gratuitous twanging of the bow to indicate its offensive personality bill winked at the barkeeper slowly resumed a pair of immense bulgy buckskin gloves which gave his fingers the appearance of being painfully sore and bandaged strode to the door without looking at anybody called out all aboard with a perfunctory air of supreme indifference whether the invitation was heeded remounted his box and drove stolidly away  perhaps it was well that he did so for the conversation at once assumed a disrespectful attitude toward tom and his relatives it was more than intimated that toms alleged aunt was none other than toms real mother while it was also asserted that toms alleged uncle did not himself participate in this intimate relationship to the boy to an extent which the fastidious taste of angels deemed moral and necessary popular opinion also believed that islington the adopted father who received a certain stipend ostensibly for the boys support retained it as a reward for his reticence regarding these facts he aint ruinin hisself by wastin it on tom said the barkeeper who possibly possessed positive knowledge of much of islingtons disbursements but at this point exhausted nature languished among some of the debaters and he turned from the frivolity of conversation to his severer professional duties  it was also well that bills momentary attitude of didactic propriety was not further excited by the subsequent conduct of his protege for by this time tom half supporting the unstable johnson who developed a tendency to occasionally dash across the glaring road but checked himself mid way each time reached the corral which adjoined the mansion house at its farther extremity was a pump and horsetrough here without a word being spoken but evidently in obedience to some habitual custom tom led his companion with the boys assistance johnson removed his coat and neckcloth turned back the collar of his shirt and gravely placed his head beneath the pumpspout with equal gravity and deliberation tom took his place at the handle for a few moments only the splashing of water and regular strokes of the pump broke the solemnly ludicrous silence then there was a pause in which johnson put his hands to his dripping head felt of it critically as if it belonged to somebody else and raised his eyes to his companion that ought to fetch it said tom in answer to the look ef it dont replied johnson doggedly with an air of relieving himself of all further responsibility in the matter its got to thets all  if it referred to some change in the physiognomy of johnson it had probably been fetched by the process just indicated the head that went under the pump was large and clothed with bushy uncertaincolored hair the face was flushed puffy and expressionless the eyes injected and full the head that came out from under the pump was of smaller size and different shape the hair straight dark and sleek the face pale and hollowcheeked the eyes bright and restless in the haggard nervous ascetic that rose from the horsetrough there was very little trace of the bacchus that had bowed there a moment before familiar as tom must have been with the spectacle he could not help looking inquiringly at the trough as if expecting to see some traces of the previous johnson in its shallow depths  a narrow strip of willow alder and buckeyea mere dusty ravelled fringe of the green mantle that swept the high shoulders of table mountainlapped the edge of the corral the silent pair were quick to avail themselves of even its scant shelter from the overpowering sun they had not proceeded far before johnson who was walking quite rapidly in advance suddenly brought himself up and turned to his companion with an interrogative eh  i didnt speak said tommy quietly  who said you spoke said johnson with a quick look of cunning in course you didnt speak and i didnt speak neither nobody spoke wot makes you think you spoke he continued peering curiously into tommys eyes  the smile which habitually shone there quickly vanished as the boy stepped quietly to his companions side and took his arm without a word  in course you didnt speak tommy said johnson deprecatingly you aint a boy to go for to play an ole soaker like me thats wot i like you for thets wot i seed in you from the first i sez thet ere boy aint goin to play you johnson you can go your whole pile on him when you cant trust even a barkeep thets wot i said eh  this time tommy prudently took no notice of the interrogation and johnson went on ef i was to ask you another question you wouldnt go to play me neitherwould you tommy  no said the boy  ef i was to ask you continued johnson without heeding the reply but with a growing anxiety of eye and a nervous twitching of his lipsef i was to ask you fur instance ef that was a jackass rabbit thet jest passedehyoud say it was or was not ez the case may be you wouldnt play the ole man on thet  no said tommy quietly it was a jackass rabbit  ef i was to ask you continued johnson ef it wore say fur instance a green hat with yaller ribbons you wouldnt play me and say it did onlesshe added with intensified cunningonless it did  no said tommy of course i wouldnt but then you see it did  it did  it did repeated tommy stoutly a green hat with yellow ribbonsandanda red rosette  i didnt get to see the rosette said johnson with slow and conscientious deliberation yet with an evident sense of relief but that aint sayin it warnt there you know eh  tommy glanced quietly at his companion there were great beads of perspiration on his ashengray forehead and on the ends of his lank hair the hand which twitched spasmodically in his was cold and clammy the other which was free had a vague purposeless jerky activity as if attached to some deranged mechanism without any apparent concern in these phenomena tommy halted and seating himself on a log motioned his companion to a place beside him johnson obeyed without a word slight as was the act perhaps no other incident of their singular companionship indicated as completely the dominance of this careless halfeffeminate but selfpossessed boy over this doggedly selfwilled abnormally excited man  it aint the square thing said johnson after a pause with a laugh that was neither mirthful nor musical and frightened away a lizard that had been regarding the pair with breathless suspenseit aint the square thing for jackass rabbits to wear hats tommyis it eh  well said tommy with unmoved composure sometimes they do and sometimes they dont animals are mighty queer and here tommy went off in an animated but i regret to say utterly untruthful and untrustworthy account of the habits of california fauna until he was interrupted by johnson  and snakes eh tommy said the man with an abstracted air gazing intently on the ground before him  and snakes said tommy but they dont bite at least not that kind you see theredont move uncle ben dont move theyre gone now and its about time you took your dose  johnson had hurriedly risen as if to leap upon the log but tommy had as quickly caught his arm with one hand while he drew a bottle from his pocket with the other johnson paused and eyed the bottle ef you say so my boy he faltered as his fingers closed nervously around it say when then he raised the bottle to his lips and took a long draught the boy regarding him critically when said tommy suddenly johnson started flushed and returned the bottle quickly but the color that had risen to his cheek stayed there his eye grew less restless and as they moved away again the hand that rested on tommys shoulder was steadier  their way lay along the flank of table mountaina wandering trail through a tangled solitude that might have seemed virgin and unbroken but for a few oystercans yeastpowder tins and empty bottles that had been apparently stranded by the first low wash of pioneer waves on the ragged trunk of an enormous pine hung a few tufts of gray hair caught from a passing grizzly but in strange juxtaposition at its foot lay an empty bottle of incomparable bittersthe chefdoeuvre of a hygienic civilization and blazoned with the arms of an allhealing republic the head of a rattlesnake peered from a case that had contained tobacco which was still brightly placarded with the highcolored effigy of a popular danseuse and a little beyond this the soil was broken and fissured there was a confused mass of roughly hewn timber a straggling line of sluicing a heap of gravel and dirt a rude cabin and the claim of johnson  except for the rudest purposes of shelter from rain and cold the cabin possessed but little advantage over the simple savagery of surrounding nature it had all the practical directness of the habitation of some animal without its comfort or picturesque quality the very birds that haunted it for food must have felt their own superiority as architects it was inconceivably dirty even with its scant capacity for accretion it was singularly stale even in its newness and freshness of material unspeakably dreary as it was in shadow the sunlight visited it in a blind aching purposeless way as if despairing of mellowing its outlines or of even tanning it into color  the claim worked by johnson in his intervals of sobriety was represented by half a dozen rude openings in the mountainside with the heapedup debris of rock and gravel before the mouth of each they gave very little evidence of engineering skill or constructive purpose or indeed showed anything but the vague successively abandoned essays of their projector today they served another purpose for as the sun had heated the little cabin almost to the point of combustion curling up the long dry shingles and starting aromatic tears from the green pine beams tommy led johnson into one of the larger openings and with a sense of satisfaction threw himself panting upon its rocky floor here and there the grateful dampness was condensed in quiet pools of water or in a monotonous and soothing drip from the rocks above without lay the staring sunlightcolorless clarified intense  for a few moments they lay resting on their elbows in blissful contemplation of the heat they had escaped wot do you say said johnson slowly without looking at his companion but abstractly addressing himself to the landscape beyondwot do you say to two straight games fur one thousand dollars  make it five thousand replied tommy reflectively also to the landscape and im in  wot do i owe you now said johnson after a lengthened silence  one hundred and seventyfive thousand two hundred and fifty dollars replied tommy with businesslike gravity  well said johnson after a deliberation commensurate with the magnitude of the transaction ef you win call it a hundred and eighty thousand round wars the keerds  they were in an old tin box in a crevice of a rock above his head they were greasy and worn with service johnson dealt albeit his right hand was still uncertainhovering after dropping the cards aimlessly about tommy and being only recalled by a strong nervous effort yet notwithstanding this incapacity for even honest manipulation mr johnson covertly turned a knave from the bottom of the pack with such shameless inefficiency and gratuitous unskilfulness that even tommy was obliged to cough and look elsewhere to hide his embarrassment possibly for this reason the young gentleman was himself constrained by way of correction to add a valuable card to his own hand over and above the number he legitimately held  nevertheless the game was unexciting and dragged listlessly johnson won he recorded the fact and the amount with a stub of pencil and shaking fingers in wandering hieroglyphics all over a pocket diary then there was a long pause when johnson slowly drew something from his pocket and held it up before his companion it was apparently a dull red stone  ef said johnson slowly with his old look of simple cunningef you happened to pick up sich a rock ez that tommy what might you say it was  dont know said tommy  mightnt you say continued johnson cautiously that it was gold or silver  neither said tommy promptly  mightnt you say it was quicksilver mightnt you say that ef thar was a friend o yourn ez knew war to go and turn out ten ton of it a day and every ton worth two thousand dollars that he had a soft thing a very soft thingallowin tommy that you used sich language which you dont  but said the boy coming to the point with great directness do you know where to get it have you struck it uncle ben  johnson looked carefully around i hev tommy listen i know whar thars cartloads of it but thars only one other specimenthe mate to this yerthets above ground and thets in frisco thars an agint comin up in a day or two to look into it i sent for him eh  his bright restless eyes were concentrated on tommys face now but the boy showed neither surprise nor interest least of all did he betray any recollection of bills ironical and gratuitous corroboration of this part of the story  nobody knows it continued johnson in a nervous whispernobody knows it but you and the agint in frisco the boys workin round yar passes by and sees the old man grubbin away and no signs o color not even rotten quartz the boys loafin round the mansion house sees the old man lyin round free in barrooms and they laughs and sez played out and spects nothin maybe ye think they spects suthin now eh queried johnson suddenly with a sharp look of suspicion  tommy looked up shook his head threw a stone at a passing rabbit but did not reply  when i fust set eyes on you tommy continued johnson apparently reassured the fust day you kem and pumped for me an entire stranger and hevin no call to do it i sez johnson johnson sez i yers a boy you kin trust yers a boy that wont play you yers a chap thats white and squarewhite and square tommy thems the very words i used  he paused for a moment and then went on in a confidential whisper you want capital johnson sez i to develop your resources and you want a pardner capital you can send for but your pardner johnsonyour pardner is right yer and his name it is tommy islington thems the very words i used  he stopped and chafed his clammy hands upon his knees its six months ago sens i made you my pardner thar aint a lick ive struck sens then tommy thar aint a hanful o yearth ive washed thar aint a shovelful o rock ive turned over but i thot o you share and share alike sez i when i wrote to my agint i wrote ekal for my pardner tommy islington he hevin no call to know ef the same was man or boy  he had moved nearer the boy and would perhaps have laid his hand caressingly upon him but even in his manifest affection there was a singular element of awed restraint and even feara suggestion of something withheld even his fullest confidences a hopeless perception of some vague barrier that never could be surmounted he may have been at times dimly conscious that in the eyes which tommy raised to his there was thorough intellectual appreciation critical goodhumor even feminine softness but nothing more his nervousness somewhat heightened by his embarrassment he went on with an attempt at calmness which his twitching white lips and unsteady fingers made pathetically grotesque thars a bill o sale in my bunk made out accordin to law of an ekal ondivided half of the claim and the consideration is two hundred and fifty thousand dollarsgambling debtsgambling debts from me to you tommyyou understandnothing could exceed the intense cunning of his eye at this momentand then thars a will  a will said tommy in amused surprise  johnson looked frightened  eh he said hurriedly wot will who said anythin bout a will tommy  nobody replied tommy with unblushing calm  johnson passed his hand over his cold forehead wrung the damp ends of his hair with his fingers and went on times when im took bad ez i was today the boys about yer sezyou sez maybe tommyits whiskey it aint tommy its pizenquicksilver pizen thats whats the matter with me im salviated salviated with merkery  ive heerd o it before continued johnson appealing to the boy and ez a boy o permiskus reading i reckon you hev too them men as works in cinnabar sooner or later gets salviated its bound to fetch em some time salviated by merkery  what are you goin to do for it asked tommy  when the agint comes up and i begins to realize on this yer mine said johnson contemplatively i goes to new york i sez to the barkeep o the hotel show me the biggest doctor here he shows me i sez to him salviated by merkerya years standinhow much he sez five thousand dollars and take two o these pills at bedtime and an ekil number o powders at meals and come back in a week and i goes back in a week cured and signs a certifikit to that effect  encouraged by a look of interest in tommys eye he went on  so i gets cured i goes to the barkeep and i sez show me the biggest fashionblest house thets for sale yer and he sez the biggest natrally blongs to john jacob astor and i sez show him and he shows him and i sez wot might you ask for this yer house and he looks at me scornful and sez go way old man you must be sick and i fetches him one over the left eye and he apologizes and i gives him his own price for the house i stocks that house with mohogany furniture and pervisions and thar we lives you and me tommy you and me  the sun no longer shone upon the hillside the shadows of the pines were beginning to creep over johnsons claim and the air within the cavern was growing chill in the gathering darkness his eyes shone brightly as he went on then thar comes a day when we gives a big spread we invites govners members o congress gentlemen o fashion and the like and among em i invites a man as holds his head very high a man i once knew but he doesnt know i knows him and he doesnt remember me and he comes and he sits opposite me and i watches him and hes very airy this man and very chipper and he wipes his mouth with a white hankercher and he smiles and he ketches my eye and he sez a glass o wine with you mr johnson and he fills his glass and i fills mine and we rises and i heaves that wine glass and all right into his damned grinnin face and he jumps for mefor he is very game this man very gamebut some on em grabs him and he sez who be you and i sez skaggs damn you skaggs look at me gimme back my wife and child gimme back the money you stole gimme back the good name you took away gimme back the health you ruined gimme back the last twelve years give em to me damn you quick before i cuts your heart out and naterally tommy he cant do it and so i cuts his heart out my boy i cuts his heart out  the purely animal fury of his eye suddenly changed again to cunning you think they hangs me for it tommy but they dont not much tommy i goes to the biggest lawyer there and i says to him salviated by merkeryyou hear mesalviated by merkery and he winks at me and he goes to the judge and he sez this yer unfortnet man isnt responsiblehes been salviated by merkery and he brings witnesses you comes tommy and you sez ez how youve seen me took bad afore and the doctor he comes and he sez as how hes seen me frightful and the jury without leavin their seats brings in a verdict o justifiable insanitysalviated by merkery  in the excitement of his climax he had risen to his feet but would have fallen had not tommy caught him and led him into the open air in this sharper light there was an odd change visible in his yellowwhite facea change which caused tommy to hurriedly support him half leading half dragging him toward the little cabin when they had reached it tommy placed him on a rude bunk or shelf and stood for a moment in anxious contemplation of the tremorstricken man before him then he said rapidly listen uncle ben im goin to townto town you understandfor the doctor youre not to get up or move on any account until i return do you hear johnson nodded violently ill be back in two hours in another moment he was gone  for an hour johnson kept his word then he suddenly sat up and began to gaze fixedly at a corner of the cabin from gazing at it he began to smile from smiling at it he began to talk from talking at it he began to scream from screaming he passed to cursing and sobbing wildly then he lay quiet again  he was so still that to merely human eyes he might have seemed asleep or dead but a squirrel that emboldened by the stillness had entered from the roof stopped short upon a beam above the bunk for he saw that the mans foot was slowly and cautiously moving toward the floor and that the mans eyes were as intent and watchful as his own presently still without a sound both feet were upon the floor and then the bunk creaked and the squirrel whisked into the eaves of the roof when he peered forth again everything was quiet and the man was gone  an hour later two muleteers on the placerville road passed a man with dishevelled hair glaring bloodshot eyes and clothes torn with bramble and stained with the red dust of the mountain they pursued him when he turned fiercely on the foremost wrested a pistol from his grasp and broke away later still when the sun had dropped behind paynes ridge the underbrush on deadwood slope crackled with a stealthy but continuous tread it must have been an animal whose dimly outlined bulk in the gathering darkness showed here and there in vague but incessant motion it could be nothing but an animal whose utterance was at once so incoherent monotonous and unremitting yet when the sound came nearer and the chaparral was parted it seemed to be a man and that man johnson  above the baying of phantasmal hounds that pressed him hard and drove him on with never rest or mercy above the lashing of a spectral whip that curled about his limbs sang in his ears and continually stung him forward above the outcries of the unclean shapes that thronged about himhe could still distinguish one real soundthe rush and sweep of hurrying waters the stanislaus river a thousand feet below him drove its yellowing current through all the vacillations of his unseated mind he had clung to one ideato reach the river to lave in it to swim it if need be but to put it forever between him and the harrying shapes to drown forever in its turbid depths the thronging spectres to wash away in its yellow flood all stains and color of the past and now he was leaping from boulder to boulder from blackened stump to stump from gnarled bush to bush caught for a moment and withheld by clinging vines or plunging downward into dusty hollows until rolling dropping sliding and stumbling he reached the riverbank whereon he fell rose staggered forward and fell again with outstretched arms upon a rock that breasted the swift current and there he lay as dead  a few stars came out hesitatingly above deadwood slope a cold wind that had sprung up with the going down of the sun fanned them into momentary brightness swept the heated flanks of the mountain and ruffled the river where the fallen man lay there was a sharp curve in the stream so that in the gathering shadows the rushing water seemed to leap out of the darkness and to vanish again decayed driftwood trunks of trees fragments of broken sluicingthe wash and waste of many a mileswept into sight a moment and were gone all of decay wreck and foulness gathered in the long circuit of miningcamp and settlement all the dregs and refuse of a crude and wanton civilization reappeared for an instant and then were hurried away in the darkness and lost no wonder that as the wind ruffled the yellow waters the waves seemed to lift their unclean hands toward the rock whereon the fallen man lay as if eager to snatch him from it too and hurry him toward the sea  it was very still in the clear air a horn blown a mile away was heard distinctly the jingling of a spur and a laugh on the highway over paynes ridge sounded clearly across the river the rattling of harness and hoofs foretold for many minutes the approach of the wingdam coach that at last with flashing lights passed within a few feet of the rock then for an hour all again was quiet presently the moon round and full lifted herself above the serried ridge and looked down upon the river at first the bared peak of deadwood hill gleamed white and skulllike then the shadows of paynes ridge cast on the slope slowly sank away leaving the unshapely stumps the dusty fissures and clinging outcrop of deadwood slope to stand out in black and silver still stealing softly downward the moonlight touched the bank and the rock and then glittered brightly on the river the rock was bare and the man was gone but the river still hurried swiftly to the sea   is there anything for me asked tommy islington as a week after the stage drew up at the mansion house and bill slowly entered the barroom bill did not reply but turning to a stranger who had entered with him indicated with a jerk of his finger the boy the stranger turned with an air half of business half of curiosity and looked critically at tommy is there anything for me repeated tommy a little confused at the silence and scrutiny bill walked deliberately to the bar and placing his back against it faced tommy with a look of demure enjoyment  ef he remarked slowlyef a hundred thousand dollars down and half a million in perspektive is ennything major there is   mrs skaggss husbands   part iieast   it was characteristic of angels that the disappearance of johnson and the fact that he had left his entire property to tommy thrilled the community but slightly in comparison with the astounding discovery that he had anything to leave the finding of a cinnabar lode at angels absorbed all collateral facts or subsequent details prospectors from adjoining camps thronged the settlement the hillside for a mile on either side of johnsons claim was staked out and preempted trade received a sudden stimulus and in the excited rhetoric of the weekly record a new era had broken upon angels on thursday last added that paper over five hundred dollars was taken in over the bar of the mansion house  of the fate of johnson there was little doubt he had been last seen lying on a boulder on the riverbank by outside passengers of the wingdam night coach and when finn of robinsons ferry admitted to have fired three shots from a revolver at a dark object struggling in the water near the ferry which he suspicioned to be a bear the question seemed to be settled whatever might have been the fallibility of his judgment of the accuracy of his aim there could be no doubt the general belief that johnson after possessing himself of the muleteers pistol could have run amuck gave a certain retributive justice to this story which rendered it acceptable to the camp  it was also characteristic of angels that no feeling of envy or opposition to the good fortune of tommy islington prevailed there that he was thoroughly cognizant from the first of johnsons discovery that his attentions to him were interested calculating and speculative was however the general belief of the majoritya belief that singularly enough awakened the first feelings of genuine respect for tommy ever shown by the camp he aint no fool yuba bill seed thet from the first said the barkeeper it was yuba bill who applied for the guardianship of tommy after his accession to johnsons claim and on whose bonds the richest men of calaveras were represented it was yuba bill also when tommy was sent east to finish his education accompanied him to san francisco and before parting with his charge on the steamers deck drew him aside and said ef at enny time you want enny money tommy over and bove your lowance you kin write but ef youll take my advice he added with a sudden huskiness mitigating the severity of his voice youll forget every derned ole spavined stringhalted bummer as you ever met or knew at angelsevry one tommyevry one and soboytake care of yourselfandand god bless ye and pertikerly dn me for a firstclass a 1 fool it was yuba bill also after this speech glared savagely around walked down the crowded gangplank with a rigid and aggressive shoulder picked a quarrel with his cabman and after bundling that functionary into his own vehicle took the reins himself and drove furiously to his hotel it cost me said bill recounting the occurrence somewhat later at angelsit cost me a matter o twenty dollars afore the jedge the next mornin but you kin bet high thet i taught them frisco chaps suthin new about drivin i didnt make it lively in montgomery street for about ten minuteso no  and so by degrees the two original locaters of the great cinnabar lode faded from the memory of angels and calaveras knew them no more in five years their very names had been forgotten in seven the name of the town was changed in ten the town itself was transported bodily to the hillside and the chimney of the union smelting works by night flickered like a corpselight over the site of johnsons cabin and by day poisoned the pure spices of the pines even the mansion house was dismantled and the wingdam stage deserted the highway for a shorter cut by quicksilver city only the bared crest of deadwood hill as of old sharply cut the clear blue sky and at its base as of old the stanislaus river unwearied and unresting babbled whispered and hurried away to the sea   a midsummers day was breaking lazily on the atlantic there was not wind enough to move the vapors in the foggy offing but where the vague distance heaved against a violet sky there were dull red streaks that growing brighter presently painted out the stars soon the brown rocks of greyport appeared faintly suffused and then the whole ashen line of dead coast was kindled and the lighthouse beacons went out one by one and then a hundred sail before invisible started out of the vapory horizon and pressed toward the shore it was morning indeed and some of the best society in greyport having been up all night were thinking it was time to go to bed  for as the sky flashed brighter it fired the clustering red roofs of a picturesque house by the sands that had all that night from open lattice and illuminated balcony given light and music to the shore it glittered on the broad crystal spaces of a great conservatory that looked upon an exquisite lawn where all night long the blended odors of sea and shore had swooned under the summer moon but it wrought confusion among the colored lamps on the long veranda and startled a group of ladies and gentlemen who had stepped from the drawingroom window to gaze upon it it was so searching and sincere in its way that as the carriage of the fairest miss gillyflower rolled away that peerless young woman catching sight of her face in the oval mirror instantly pulled down the blinds and nestling the whitest shoulders in greyport against the crimson cushions went to sleep  how haggard everybody is rose dear you look almost intellectual said blanche masterman  i hope not said rose simply sunrises are very trying look how that pink regularly puts out mrs brownrobinson hair and all  the angels said the count de nugat with a polite gesture toward the sky must have find these celestial combinations very bad for the toilette  theyre safe in whiteexcept when they sit for their pictures in venice said blanche how fresh mr islington looks its really uncomplimentary to us  i suppose the sun recognizes in me no rival said the young man demurely but he added i have lived much in the open air and require very little sleep  how delightful said mrs brownrobinson in a low enthusiastic voice and a manner that held the glowing sentiment of sixteen and the practical experiences of thirtytwo in dangerous combinationhow perfectly delightful what sunrises you must have seen and in such wild romantic places how i envy you my nephew was a classmate of yours and has often repeated to me those charming stories you tell of your adventures wont you tell some now do how you must tire of us and this artificial life here so frightfully artificial you know in a confidential whisper and then to think of the days when you roamed the great west with the indians and the bisons and the grizzly bears of course you have seen grizzly bears and bisons  of course he has dear said blanche a little pettishly throwing a cloak over her shoulders and seizing her chaperon by the arm his earliest infancy was soothed by bisons and he proudly points to the grizzly bear as the playmate of his youth come with me and ill tell you all about it how good it is of you she added sotto voce to islington as he stood by the carriagehow perfectly good it is of you to be like those animals you tell us of and not know your full power think with your experiences and our credulity what stories you might tell and you are going to walk good night then a slim gloved hand was frankly extended from the window and the next moment the carriage rolled away  isnt islington throwing away a chance there said captain merwin on the veranda  perhaps he couldnt stand my lovely aunts superadded presence but then hes the guest of blanches father and i dare say they see enough of each other as it is  but isnt it a rather dangerous situation  for him perhaps although hes awfully old and very queer for her with an experience that takes in all the available men in both hemispheres ending with nugat over there i should say a man more or less wouldnt affect her much anyway of course he laughed these are the accents of bitterness but that was last year  perhaps islington did not overhear the speaker perhaps if he did the criticism was not new he turned carelessly away and sauntered out on the road to the sea thence he strolled along the sands toward the cliffs where meeting an impediment in the shape of a garden wall he leaped it with a certain agile boyish ease and experience and struck across an open lawn toward the rocks again the best society of greyport were not early risers and the spectacle of a trespasser in an evening dress excited only the criticism of grooms hanging about the stables or cleanly housemaids on the broad verandas that in greyport architecture dutifully gave upon the sea only once as he entered the boundaries of cliffwood lodge the famous seat of renwyck masterman was he aware of suspicious scrutiny but a slouching figure that vanished quickly in the lodge offered no opposition to his progress avoiding the pathway to the lodge islington kept along the rocks until reaching a little promontory and rustic pavilion he sat down and gazed upon the sea  and presently an infinite peace stole upon him except where the waves lapped lazily the crags below the vast expanse beyond seemed unbroken by ripple heaving only in broad ponderable sheets and rhythmically as if still in sleep the air was filled with a luminous haze that caught and held the direct sunbeams in the deep calm that lay upon the sea it seemed to islington that all the tenderness of culture magic of wealth and spell of refinement that for years had wrought upon that favored shore had extended its gracious influence even here what a pampered and caressed old ocean it was cajoled flattered and feted where it lay an odd recollection of the turbid stanislaus hurrying by the ascetic pines of the grim outlines of deadwood hill swam before his eyes and made the yellow green of the velvet lawn and graceful foliage seem almost tropical by contrast and looking up a few yards distant he beheld a tall slip of a girl gazing upon the seablanche masterman  she had plucked somewhere a large fanshaped leaf which she held parasolwise shading the blond masses of her hair and hiding her gray eyes she had changed her festal dress with its amplitude of flounce and train for a closely fitting halfantique habit whose scant outlines would have been trying to limbs less shapely but which prettily accented the graceful curves and sweeping lines of this greyport goddess as islington rose she came toward him with a frankly outstretched hand and unconstrained manner had she observed him first i dont know  they sat down together on a rustic seat miss blanche facing the sea and shading her eyes with the leaf  i dont really know how long i have been sitting here said islington or whether i have not been actually asleep and dreaming it seemed too lovely a morning to go to bed but you  from behind the leaf it appeared that miss blanche on retiring had been pursued by a hideous winged bug which defied the efforts of herself and maid to dislodge odin the spitz dog had insisted upon scratching at the door and it made her eyes red to sleep in the morning and she had an early call to make and the sea looked lovely  im glad to find you here whatever be the cause said islington with his old directness today as you know is my last day in greyport and it is much pleasanter to say good by under this blue sky than even beneath your fathers wonderful frescos yonder i want to remember you too as part of this pleasant prospect which belongs to us all rather than recall you in anybodys particular setting  i know said blanche with equal directness that houses are one of the defects of our civilization but i dont think i ever heard the idea as elegantly expressed before where do you go  i dont know yet i have several plans i may go to south america and become president of one of the republicsi am not particular which i am rich but in that part of america which lies outside of greyport it is necessary for every man to have some work my friends think i should have some great aim in life with a capital a but i was born a vagabond and a vagabond i shall probably die  i dont know anybody in south america said blanche languidly there were two girls here last season but they didnt wear stays in the house and their white frocks never were properly done up if you go to south america you must write to me  i will can you tell me the name of this flower which i found in your greenhouse it looks much like a california blossom  perhaps it is father bought it of a halfcrazy old man who came here one day do you know him  islington laughed i am afraid not but let me present this in a less businesslike fashion  thank you remind me to give you one in return before you goor will you choose yourself  they had both risen as by a common instinct  good by  the cool flowerlike hand lay in his for an instant  will you oblige me by putting aside that leaf a moment before i go  but my eyes are red and i look like a perfect fright  yet after a long pause the leaf fluttered down and a pair of very beautiful but withal very clear and critical eyes met his islington was constrained to look away when he turned again she was gone  mister hislingtonsir  it was chalker the english groom out of breath with running  seein you alone sirbeg your pardon sirbut theres a person  a person what the devil do you mean speak englishno damn it i mean dont said islington snappishly  i sed a person sir beg pardonno offencebut not a gent sir in the libry  a little amused even through the utter dissatisfaction with himself and vague loneliness that had suddenly come upon him islington as he walked toward the lodge asked why isnt he a gent  no gentbeggin your pardin sirud guy a man in sarvis sir takes me ands so sir as i sits in the rumble at the gate and puts em downd so sir and sez put em in your pocket young manor is it a road agint you expects to see that you olds hup your ands hand crosses em like to that sez he old ard sez he on the short curves or youll bust your precious crust sez he and hasks for you sir this way sir  they entered the lodge islington hurried down the long gothic hall and opened the library door  in an armchair in the centre of the room a man sat apparently contemplating a large stiff yellow hat with an enormous brim that was placed on the floor before him his hands rested lightly between his knees but one foot was drawn up at the side of his chair in a peculiar manner in the first glance that islington gave the attitude in some odd irreconcilable way suggested a brake in another moment he dashed across the room and holding out both hands cried yuba bill  the man rose caught islington by the shoulders wheeled him round hugged him felt of his ribs like a goodnatured ogre shook his hands violently laughed and then said somewhat ruefully and how ever did you know me  seeing that yuba bill evidently regarded himself as in some elaborate disguise islington laughed and suggested that it must have been instinct  and you said bill holding him at arms length and surveying him criticallyyoutoe thinktoe thinka little cuss no higher nor a trace a boy as ive flicked outer the road with a whip time in agin a boy ez never hed much clothes to speak of turned into a sport  islington remembered with a thrill of ludicrous terror that he still wore his evening dress  turned continued yuba bill severelyturned into a restyourant waitera garsong eh alfonse bring me a patty de foy grass and an omelette demme  dear old chap said islington laughing and trying to put his hand over bills bearded mouth but youyou dont look exactly like yourself youre not well bill and indeed as he turned toward the light bills eyes appeared cavernous and his hair and beard thickly streaked with gray  maybe its this yer harness said bill a little anxiously when i hitches on this yer curb he indicated a massive gold watchchain with enormous links and mounts this morning star he pointed to a very large solitaire pin which had the appearance of blistering his whole shirtfront it kinder weighs heavy on me tommy otherwise im all right my boyall right but he evaded islingtons keen eye and turned from the light  you have something to tell me bill said islington suddenly and with almost brusque directness out with it  bill did not speak but moved uneasily toward his hat  you didnt come three thousand miles without a word of warning to talk to me of old times said islington more kindly glad as i would have been to see you it isnt your way bill and you know it we shall not be disturbed here he added in reply to an inquiring glance that bill directed to the door and i am ready to hear you  firstly then said bill drawing his chair nearer islington answer me one question tommy fair and square and up and down  go on said islington with a slight smile  ef i should say to you tommysay to you today right here you must come with meyou must leave this place for a month a year two years maybe perhaps foreveris there anything that ud keep youanything my boy ez you couldnt leave  no said tommy quietly i am only visiting here i thought of leaving greyport today  but if i should say to you tommy come with me on a pasear to chiny to japan to south ameriky praps could you go  yes said islington after a slight pause  thar isnt ennything said bill drawing a little closer and lowering his voice confidentiallyennything in the way of a young womanyou understand tommyez would keep you theyre mighty sweet about here and whether a man is young or old tommy theres always some woman as is brake or whip to him  in a certain excited bitterness that characterized the delivery of this abstract truth bill did not see that the young mans face flushed slightly as he answered no  then listen its seven years ago tommy thet i was working one o the pioneer coaches over from gold hill ez i stood in front o the stageoffice the sheriff o the county comes to me and he sez bill sez he ive got a looney chap as im in charge of taking im down to the sylum in stockton hez quiet and peaceable but the insides dont like to ride with him hev you enny objection to give him a lift on the box beside you i sez no put him up when i came to go and get up on that box beside him that man tommythat man sittin there quiet and peaceable wasjohnson  he didnt know me my boy yuba bill continued rising and putting his hands on tommys shouldershe didnt know me he didnt know nothing about you nor angels nor the quicksilver lode nor even his own name he said his name was skaggs but i knowd it was johnson thar was times tommy you might have knocked me off that box with a feather thar was times when if the twentyseven passengers o that stage hed found theirselves swimming in the american river five hundred feet below the road i never could have explained it satisfactorily to the companynever  the sheriff said bill continued hastily as if to preclude any interruption from the young manthe sheriff said he had been brought into murphys camp three years before dripping with water and sufferin from perkussion of the brain and had been cared for generally by the boys round when i told the sheriff i knowed im i got him to leave him in my care and i took him to frisco tommy to frisco and i put him in charge o the best doctors there and paid his board myself there was nothin he didnt have ez he wanted dont look that way my dear boy for gods sake dont  o bill said islington rising and staggering to the window why did you keep this from me  why said bill turning on him savagelywhy because i warnt a fool thar was you winnin your way in college thar was you risin in the world and of some account to it yer was an old bummer ez good ez dead to ita man ez oughter been dead afore a man ez never denied it but you allus liked him better nor me said bill bitterly  forgive me bill said the young man seizing both his hands i know you did it for the best but go on  thar aint much more to tell nor much use to tell it as i can see said bill moodily he never could be cured the doctors said for he had what they called monomaniawas always talking about his wife and darter that somebody had stole away years ago and plannin revenge on that somebody and six months ago he was missed i tracked him to carson to salt lake city to omaha to chicago to new yorkand here  here echoed islington  here and thats what brings me here today whethers hes crazy or well whethers hes huntin you or lookin up that other man you must get away from here you mustnt see him you and me tommy will go away on a cruise in three or four years hell be dead or missing and then well come back come and he rose to his feet  bill said islington rising also and taking the hand of his friend with the same quiet obstinacy that in the old days had endeared him to bill wherever he is here or elsewhere sane or crazy i shall seek and find him every dollar that i have shall be his every dollar that i have spent shall be returned to him i am young yet thank god and can work and if there is a way out of this miserable business i shall find it  i knew said bill with a surliness that ill concealed his evident admiration of the calm figure before himi knew the partikler style of dn fool that you was and expected no better good by thengod almighty whos that  he was on his way to the open french window but had started back his face quite white and bloodless and his eyes staring islington ran to the window and looked out a white skirt vanished around the corner of the veranda when he returned bill had dropped into a chair  it must have been miss masterman i think but whats the matter  nothing said bill faintly have you got any whiskey handy  islington brought a decanter and pouring out some spirits handed the glass to bill bill drained it and then said who is miss masterman  mr mastermans daughter that is an adopted daughter i believe  wot name  i really dont know said islington pettishly more vexed than he cared to own at this questioning  yuba bill rose and walked to the window closed it walked back again to the door glanced at islington hesitated and then returned to his chair  i didnt tell you i was marrieddid i he said suddenly looking up in islingtons face with an unsuccessful attempt at a reckless laugh  no said islington more pained at the manner than the words  fact said yuba bill three years ago it was tommythree years ago  he looked so hard at islington that feeling he was expected to say something he asked vaguely who did you marry  thets it said yuba bill i cant ezactly say partikly though a she devil generally the wife of half a dozen other men  accustomed apparently to have his conjugal infelicities a theme of mirth among men and seeing no trace of amusement on islingtons grave face his dogged reckless manner softened and drawing his chair closer to islington he went on it all began outer this we was coming down watsons grade one night pretty free when the expressman turns to me and sez theres a row inside and youd better pull up i pulls up and out hops first a woman and then two or three chaps swearing and cursin and tryin to drag some one arter them then it peard tommy thet it was this womans drunken husband they was going to put out for abusin her and strikin her in the coach and if it hadnt been for me my boy theyd hev left that chap thar in the road but i fixes matters up by putting her alongside o me on the box and we drove on she was very white tommyfor the matter o that she was always one o these very white women that never got red in the facebut she never cried a whimper most wimin would have cried it was queer but she never cried i thought so at the time  she was very tall with a lot o light hair meandering down the back of her head as long as a deerskin whiplash and about the color she hed eyes thetd bore you through at fifty yards and pooty hands and feet and when she kinder got out o that stiff narvous state she was in and warmed up a little and got chipper by gd sir she was handsomeshe was that  a little flushed and embarrassed at his own enthusiasm he stopped and then said carelessly they got off at murphys  well said islington  well i used to see her often arter thet and when she was alone she allus took the boxseat she kinder confided her troubles to me how her husband got drunk and abused her and i didnt see much o him for he was away in frisco arter thet but it was all square tommyall square twixt me and her  i got a going there a good deal and then one day i sez to myself bill this wont do and i got changed to another route did you ever know jackson filltree tommy said bill breaking off suddenly  no  might have heerd of him praps  no said islington impatiently  jackson filltree ran the express from whites out to summit cross the north fork of the yuba one day he sez to me bill thats a mighty bad ford at the north fork i sez i believe you jackson itll git me some day bill sure sez he i sez why dont you take the lower ford i dont know sez he but i cant so ever after when i met him he sez that north fork aint got me yet one day i was in sacramento and up comes filltree he sez ive sold out the express business on account of the north fork but its bound to get me yet bill sure and he laughs two weeks after they finds his body below the ford whar he tried to cross comin down from the summit way folks said it was foolishness tommy i sez it was fate the second day arter i was changed to the placerville route thet woman comes outer the hotel above the stageoffice her husband she said was lying sick in placerville thats what she said but it was fate tommy fate three months afterward her husband takes an overdose of morphine for delirium tremems and dies theres folks ez sez she gave it to him but its fate a year after that i married herfate tommy fate  i lived with her jest three months he went on after a long breaththree months it aint much time for a happy man ive seen a good deal o hard life in my day but there was days in that three months longer than any day in my lifedays tommy when it was a tossup whether i should kill her or she me but thar im done you are a young man tommy and i aint goin to tell things thet old as i am three years ago i couldnt have believed  when at last with his grim face turned toward the window he sat silently with his clinched hands on his knees before him islington asked where his wife was now  ask me no more my boyno more ive said my say with a gesture as of throwing down a pair of reins before him he rose and walked to the window  you kin understand tommy why a little trip around the world ud do me good ef you cant go with me well and good but go i must  not before luncheon i hope said a very sweet voice as blanche masterman suddenly stood before them father would never forgive me if in his absence i permitted one of mr islingtons friends to go in this way you will stay wont you do and you will give me your arm now and when mr islington has done staring he will follow us into the diningroom and introduce you   i have quite fallen in love with your friend said miss blanche as they stood in the drawingroom looking at the figure of bill strolling with his short pipe in his mouth through the distant shrubbery he asks very queer questions though he wanted to know my mothers maiden name  he is an honest fellow said islington gravely  you are very much subdued you dont thank me i dare say for keeping you and your friend here but you couldnt go you know until father returned  islington smiled but not very gayly  and then i think it much better for us to part here under these frescos dont you good by  she extended her long slim hand  out in the sunlight there when my eyes were red you were very anxious to look at me she added in a dangerous voice  islington raised his sad eyes to hers something glittering upon her own sweet lashes trembled and fell  blanche  she was rosy enough now and would have withdrawn her hand but islington detained it she was not quite certain but that her waist was also in jeopardy yet she could not help saying are you sure that there isnt anything in the way of a young woman that would keep you  blanche said islington in reproachful horror  if gentlemen will roar out their secrets before an open window with a young woman lying on a sofa on the veranda reading a stupid french novel they must not be surprised if she gives more attention to them than her book  then you know all blanche  i know said blanche lets seei know the partiklar style ofahemfool you was and expected no better good by and gliding like a lovely and innocent milk snake out of his grasp she slipped away   to the pleasant ripple of waves the sound of music and light voices the yellow midsummer moon again rose over greyport it looked upon formless masses of rock and shrubbery wide spaces of lawn and beach and a shimmering expanse of water it singled out particular objectsa white sail in shore a crystal globe upon the lawn and flashed upon something held between the teeth of a crouching figure scaling the low wall of cliffwood lodge then as a man and woman passed out from under the shadows of the foliage into the open moonlight of the garden path the figure leaped from the wall and stood erect and waiting in the shadow  it was the figure of an old man with rolling eyes his trembling hand grasping a long keen knifea figure more pitiable than pitiless more pathetic than terrible but the next moment the knife was stricken from his hand and he struggled in the firm grasp of another figure that apparently sprang from the wall beside him  dn you masterman cried the old man hoarsely give me fair play and ill kill you yet  which my name is yuba bill said bill quietly and its time this dn fooling was stopped  the old man glared in bills face savagely i know you youre one of mastermans friendsdn youlet me go till i cut his heart outlet me go where is my marywhere is my wifethere she is theretherethere mary he would have screamed but bill placed his powerful hand upon his mouth as he turned in the direction of the old mans glance distinct in the moonlight the figures of islington and blanche arm in arm stood out upon the garden path  give me my wife muttered the old man hoarsely between bills fingers where is she  a sudden fury passed over yuba bills face where is your wife he echoed pressing the old man back against the garden wall and holding him there as in a vice where is your wife he repeated thrusting his grim sardonic jaw and savage eyes into the old mans frightened face where is jack adams wife where is my wife where is the shedevil that drove one man mad that sent another to hell by his own hand that eternally broke and ruined me where where do you ask where in jail in sacramentoin jail do you hearin jail for murder johnsonmurder  the old man gasped stiffened and then relaxing suddenly slipped a mere inanimate mass at yuba bills feet with a sudden revulsion of feeling yuba bill dropped at his side and lifting him tenderly in his arms whispered look up old man johnson look up for gods sakeits meyuba bill and yonder is your daughter andtommydont you knowtommy little tommy islington  johnsons eyes slowly opened he whispered tommy yes tommy sit by me tommy but dont sit so near the bank dont you see how the river is rising and beckoning to mehissing and boilin over the rocks its gittin higherhold me tommyhold me and dont let me go yet well live to cut his heart out tommywell livewell his head sank and the rushing river invisible to all eyes save his leaped toward him out of the darkness and bore him away no longer to the darkness but through it to the distant peaceful shining sea     how santa claus came to simpsons bar   it had been raining in the valley of the sacramento the north fork had overflowed its banks and rattlesnake creek was impassable the few boulders that had marked the summer ford at simpsons crossing were obliterated by a vast sheet of water stretching to the foothills the up stage was stopped at grangers the last mail had been abandoned in the tules the rider swimming for his life an area remarked the sierra avalanche with pensive local pride as large as the state of massachusetts is now under water  nor was the weather any better in the foothills the mud lay deep on the mountain road wagons that neither physical force nor moral objurgation could move from the evil ways into which they had fallen encumbered the track and the way to simpsons bar was indicated by brokendown teams and hard swearing and farther on cut off and inaccessible rained upon and bedraggled smitten by high winds and threatened by high water simpsons bar on the eve of christmas day 1862 clung like a swallows nest to the rocky entablature and splintered capitals of table mountain and shook in the blast  as night shut down on the settlement a few lights gleamed through the mist from the windows of cabins on either side of the highway now crossed and gullied by lawless streams and swept by marauding winds happily most of the population were gathered at thompsons store clustered around a redhot stove at which they silently spat in some accepted sense of social communion that perhaps rendered conversation unnecessary indeed most methods of diversion had long since been exhausted on simpsons bar high water had suspended the regular occupations on gulch and on river and a consequent lack of money and whiskey had taken the zest from most illegitimate recreation even mr hamlin was fain to leave the bar with fifty dollars in his pocketthe only amount actually realized of the large sums won by him in the successful exercise of his arduous profession ef i was asked he remarked somewhat lateref i was asked to pint out a purty little village where a retired sport as didnt care for money could exercise hisself frequent and lively id say simpsons bar but for a young man with a large family depending on his exertions it dont pay as mr hamlins family consisted mainly of female adults this remark is quoted rather to show the breadth of his humor than the exact extent of his responsibilities  howbeit the unconscious objects of this satire sat that evening in the listless apathy begotten of idleness and lack of excitement even the sudden splashing of hoofs before the door did not arouse them dick bullen alone paused in the act of scraping out his pipe and lifted his head but no other one of the group indicated any interest in or recognition of the man who entered  it was a figure familiar enough to the company and known in simpsons bar as the old man a man of perhaps fifty years grizzled and scant of hair but still fresh and youthful of complexion a face full of ready but not very powerful sympathy with a chameleonlike aptitude for taking on the shade and color of contiguous moods and feelings he had evidently just left some hilarious companions and did not at first notice the gravity of the group but clapped the shoulder of the nearest man jocularly and threw himself into a vacant chair  jest heard the best thing out boys ye know smiley over yarjim smileyfunniest man in the bar well jim was jest telling the richest yarn about  smileys a  fool interrupted a gloomy voice  a particular  skunk added another in sepulchral accents  a silence followed these positive statements the old man glanced quickly around the group then his face slowly changed thats so he said reflectively after a pause certingly a sort of a skunk and suthin of a fool in course he was silent for a moment as in painful contemplation of the unsavoriness and folly of the unpopular smiley dismal weather aint it he added now fully embarked on the current of prevailing sentiment mighty rough papers on the boys and no show for money this season and tomorrows christmas  there was a movement among the men at this announcement but whether of satisfaction or disgust was not plain yes continued the old man in the lugubrious tone he had within the last few moments unconsciously adoptedyes christmas and tonights christmas eve ye see boys i kinder thoughtthat is i sorter had an idee jest passin like you knowthat may be yed all like to come over to my house tonight and have a sort of tear round but i suppose now you wouldnt dont feel like it may be he added with anxious sympathy peering into the faces of his companions  well i dont know responded tom flynn with some cheerfulness praps we may but how about your wife old man what does she say to it  the old man hesitated his conjugal experience had not been a happy one and the fact was known to simpsons bar his first wife a delicate pretty little woman had suffered keenly and secretly from the jealous suspicions of her husband until one day he invited the whole bar to his house to expose her infidelity on arriving the party found the shy petite creature quietly engaged in her household duties and retired abashed and discomfited but the sensitive woman did not easily recover from the shock of this extraordinary outrage it was with difficulty she regained her equanimity sufficiently to release her lover from the closet in which he was concealed and escape with him she left a boy of three years to comfort her bereaved husband the old mans present wife had been his cook she was large loyal and aggressive  before he could reply joe dimmick suggested with great directness that it was the old mans house and that invoking the divine power if the case were his own he would invite whom he pleased even if in so doing he imperilled his salvation the powers of evil he further remarked should contend against him vainly all this delivered with a terseness and vigor lost in this necessary translation  in course certainly thets it said the old man with a sympathetic frown thars no trouble about thet its my own house built every stick on it myself dont you be afeard o her boys she may cut up a trifle roughez wimmin dobut shell come round secretly the old man trusted to the exaltation of liquor and the power of courageous example to sustain him in such an emergency  as yet dick bullen the oracle and leader of simpsons bar had not spoken he now took his pipe from his lips old man hows that yer johnny gettin on seems to me he didnt look so peart last time i seed him on the bluff heavin rocks at chinamen didnt seem to take much interest in it thar was a gang of em by yar yesterdaydrownded out up the riverand i kinder thought o johnny and how hed miss em may be now wed be in the way ef he wus sick  the father evidently touched not only by this pathetic picture of johnnys deprivation but by the considerate delicacy of the speaker hastened to assure him that johnny was better and that a little fun might liven him up whereupon dick arose shook himself and saying im ready lead the way old man here goes himself led the way with a leap a characteristic howl and darted out into the night as he passed through the outer room he caught up a blazing brand from the hearth the action was repeated by the rest of the party closely following and elbowing each other and before the astonished proprietor of thompsons grocery was aware of the intention of his guests the room was deserted  the night was pitchy dark in the first gust of wind their temporary torches were extinguished and only the red brands dancing and flitting in the gloom like drunken willothewisps indicated their whereabouts their way led up pinetree canyon at the head of which a broad low barkthatched cabin burrowed in the mountainside it was the home of the old man and the entrance to the tunnel in which he worked when he worked at all here the crowd paused for a moment out of delicate deference to their host who came up panting in the rear  praps yed better hold on a second out yer whilst i go in and see thet things is all right said the old man with an indifference he was far from feeling the suggestion was graciously accepted the door opened and closed on the host and the crowd leaning their backs against the wall and cowering under the eaves waited and listened  for a few moments there was no sound but the dripping of water from the eaves and the stir and rustle of wrestling boughs above them then the men became uneasy and whispered suggestion and suspicion passed from the one to the other reckon shes caved in his head the first lick decoyed him inter the tunnel and barred him up likely got him down and sittin on him probly bilin suthin to heave on us stand clear the door boys for just then the latch clicked the door slowly opened and a voice said come in out o the wet  the voice was neither that of the old man nor of his wife it was the voice of a small boy its weak treble broken by that preternatural hoarseness which only vagabondage and the habit of premature selfassertion can give it was the face of a small boy that looked up at theirsa face that might have been pretty and even refined but that it was darkened by evil knowledge from within and dirt and hard experience from without he had a blanket around his shoulders and had evidently just risen from his bed come in he repeated and dont make no noise the old mans in there talking to mar he continued pointing to an adjacent room which seemed to be a kitchen from which the old mans voice came in deprecating accents let me be he added querulously to dick bullen who had caught him up blanket and all and was affecting to toss him into the fire let go o me you dd old fool dye hear  thus adjured dick bullen lowered johnny to the ground with a smothered laugh while the men entering quietly ranged themselves around a long table of rough boards which occupied the centre of the room johnny then gravely proceeded to a cupboard and brought out several articles which he deposited on the table thars whiskey and crackers and red herons and cheese he took a bite of the latter on his way to the table and sugar he scooped up a mouthful en route with a small and very dirty hand and terbacker thars dried appils too on the shelf but i dont admire em appils is swellin thar he concluded now wade in and dont be afeard i dont mind the old woman she dont blong to me slong  he had stepped to the threshold of a small room scarcely larger than a closet partitioned off from the main apartment and holding in its dim recess a small bed he stood there a moment looking at the company his bare feet peeping from the blanket and nodded  hello johnny you aint goin to turn in agin are ye said dick  yes i are responded johnny decidedly  why wots up old fellow  im sick  how sick  ive got a fevier and childblains and roomatiz returned johnny and vanished within after a moments pause he added in the dark apparently from under the bedclothesand biles  there was an embarrassing silence the men looked at each other and at the fire even with the appetizing banquet before them it seemed as if they might again fall into the despondency of thompsons grocery when the voice of the old man incautiously lifted came deprecatingly from the kitchen  certainly thets so in course they is a gang o lazy drunken loafers and that ar dick bullens the ornariest of all didnt hev no more sabe than to come round yar with sickness in the house and no provision thets what i said bullen sez i its crazy drunk you are or a fool sez i to think o such a thing staples i sez be you a man staples and spect to raise hll under my roof and invalids lyin round but they would comethey would thets wot you must spect o such trash as lays round the bar  a burst of laughter from the men followed this unfortunate exposure whether it was overheard in the kitchen or whether the old mans irate companion had just then exhausted all other modes of expressing her contemptuous indignation i cannot say but a back door was suddenly slammed with great violence a moment later and the old man reappeared haply unconscious of the cause of the late hilarious outburst and smiled blandly  the old woman thought shed jest run over to mrs mcfaddens for a sociable call he explained with jaunty indifference as he took a seat at the board  oddly enough it needed this untoward incident to relieve the embarrassment that was beginning to be felt by the party and their natural audacity returned with their host i do not propose to record the convivialities of that evening the inquisitive reader will accept the statement that the conversation was characterized by the same intellectual exaltation the same cautious reverence the same fastidious delicacy the same rhetorical precision and the same logical and coherent discourse somewhat later in the evening which distinguish similar gatherings of the masculine sex in more civilized localities and under more favorable auspices no glasses were broken in the absence of any no liquor was uselessly spilt on floor or table in the scarcity of that article  it was nearly midnight when the festivities were interrupted hush said dick bullen holding up his hand it was the querulous voice of johnny from his adjacent closet o dad  the old man arose hurriedly and disappeared in the closet presently he reappeared his rheumatiz is coming on agin bad he explained and he wants rubbin he lifted the demijohn of whiskey from the table and shook it it was empty dick bullen put down his tin cup with an embarrassed laugh so did the others the old man examined their contents and said hopefully i reckon thats enough he dont need much you hold on all o you for a spell and ill be back and vanished in the closet with an old flannel shirt and the whiskey the door closed but imperfectly and the following dialogue was distinctly audible  now sonny whar does she ache worst  sometimes over yar and sometimes under yer but its most powerful from yer to yer rub yer dad  a silence seemed to indicate a brisk rubbing then johnny  hevin a good time out yer dad  yes sonny  tomorrers chrismiss aint it  yes sonny how does she feel now  better rub a little furder down wots chrismiss anyway wots it all about  o its a day  this exhaustive definition was apparently satisfactory for there was a silent interval of rubbing presently johnny again  mar sez that everywhere else but yer everybody gives things to everybody chrismiss and then she jist waded inter you she sez thars a man they call sandy claws not a white man you know but a kind o chinemin comes down the chimbley night afore chrismiss and gives things to chillernboys like me puts em in their butes thets what she tried to play upon me easy now pop whar are you rubbin tothets a mile from the place she jest made that up didnt she jest to aggrewate me and you dont rub thar    why dad  in the great quiet that seemed to have fallen upon the house the sigh of the near pines and the drip of leaves without was very distinct johnnys voice too was lowered as he went on dont you take on now fur im gettin all right fast wots the boys doin out thar  the old man partly opened the door and peered through his guests were sitting there sociably enough and there were a few silver coins and a lean buckskin purse on the table bettin on suthinsome little game or nother theyre all right he replied to johnny and recommenced his rubbing  id like to take a hand and win some money said johnny reflectively after a pause  the old man glibly repeated what was evidently a familiar formula that if johnny would wait until he struck it rich in the tunnel hed have lots of money etc etc  yes said johnny but you dont and whether you strike it or i win it its about the same its all luck but its mighty curos about chrismissaint it why do they call it chrismiss  perhaps from some instinctive deference to the overhearing of his guests or from some vague sense of incongruity the old mans reply was so low as to be inaudible beyond the room  yes said johnny with some slight abatement of interest ive heerd o him before thar thatll do dad i dont ache near so bad as i did now wrap me tight in this yer blanket so now he added in a muffled whisper sit down yer by me till i go asleep to assure himself of obedience he disengaged one hand from the blanket and grasping his fathers sleeve again composed himself to rest  for some moments the old man waited patiently then the unwonted stillness of the house excited his curiosity and without moving from the bed he cautiously opened the door with his disengaged hand and looked into the main room to his infinite surprise it was dark and deserted but even then a smouldering log on the hearth broke and by the upspringing blaze he saw the figure of dick bullen sitting by the dying embers  hello  dick started rose and came somewhat unsteadily toward him  whars the boys said the old man  gone up the canyon on a little pasear theyre coming back for me in a minit im waitin round for em what are you starin at old man he added with a forced laugh do you think im drunk  the old man might have been pardoned the supposition for dicks eyes were humid and his face flushed he loitered and lounged back to the chimney yawned shook himself buttoned up his coat and laughed liquor aint so plenty as that old man now dont you git up he continued as the old man made a movement to release his sleeve from johnnys hand dont you mind manners sit jest whar you be im goin in a jiffy thar thats them now  there was a low tap at the door dick bullen opened it quickly nodded good night to his host and disappeared the old man would have followed him but for the hand that still unconsciously grasped his sleeve he could have easily disengaged it it was small weak and emaciated but perhaps because it was small weak and emaciated he changed his mind and drawing his chair closer to the bed rested his head upon it in this defenceless attitude the potency of his earlier potations surprised him the room flickered and faded before his eyes reappeared faded again went out and left himasleep  meantime dick bullen closing the door confronted his companions are you ready said staples ready said dick whats the time past twelve was the reply can you make itits nigh on fifty miles the round trip hither and yon i reckon returned dick shortly whars the mare bill and jacks holdin her at the crossin let em hold on a minit longer said dick  he turned and reentered the house softly by the light of the guttering candle and dying fire he saw that the door of the little room was open he stepped toward it on tiptoe and looked in the old man had fallen back in his chair snoring his helpless feet thrust out in a line with his collapsed shoulders and his hat pulled over his eyes beside him on a narrow wooden bedstead lay johnny muffled tightly in a blanket that hid all save a strip of forehead and a few curls damp with perspiration dick bullen made a step forward hesitated and glanced over his shoulder into the deserted room everything was quiet with a sudden resolution he parted his huge mustaches with both hands and stooped over the sleeping boy but even as he did so a mischievous blast lying in wait swooped down the chimney rekindled the hearth and lit up the room with a shameless glow from which dick fled in bashful terror  his companions were already waiting for him at the crossing two of them were struggling in the darkness with some strange misshapen bulk which as dick came nearer took the semblance of a great yellow horse  it was the mare she was not a pretty picture from her roman nose to her rising haunches from her arched spine hidden by the stiff machillas of a mexican saddle to her thick straight bony legs there was not a line of equine grace in her halfblind but wholly vicious white eyes in her protruding under lip in her monstrous color there was nothing but ugliness and vice  now then said staples stand clar of her heels boys and up with you dont miss your first holt of her mane and mind ye get your off stirrup quick ready  there was a leap a scrambling struggle a bound a wild retreat of the crowd a circle of flying hoofs two springless leaps that jarred the earth a rapid play and jingle of spurs a plunge and then the voice of dick somewhere in the darkness all right  dont take the lower road back onless youre hard pushed for time dont hold her in down hill well be at the ford at five glang hoopa mula go  a splash a spark struck from the ledge in the road a clatter in the rocky cut beyond and dick was gone    sing o muse the ride of richard bullen sing o muse of chivalrous men the sacred quest the doughty deeds the battery of low churls the fearsome ride and grewsome perils of the flower of simpsons bar alack she is dainty this muse she will have none of this bucking brute and swaggering ragged rider and i must fain follow him in prose afoot  it was one oclock and yet he had only gained rattlesnake hill for in that time jovita had rehearsed to him all her imperfections and practised all her vices thrice had she stumbled twice had she thrown up her roman nose in a straight line with the reins and resisting bit and spur struck out madly across country twice had she reared and rearing fallen backward and twice had the agile dick unharmed regained his seat before she found her vicious legs again and a mile beyond them at the foot of a long hill was rattlesnake creek dick knew that here was the crucial test of his ability to perform his enterprise set his teeth grimly put his knees well into her flanks and changed his defensive tactics to brisk aggression bullied and maddened jovita began the descent of the hill here the artful richard pretended to hold her in with ostentatious objurgation and wellfeigned cries of alarm it is unnecessary to add that jovita instantly ran away nor need i state the time made in the descent it is written in the chronicles of simpsons bar enough that in another moment as it seemed to dick she was splashing on the overflowed banks of rattlesnake creek as dick expected the momentum she had acquired carried her beyond the point of balking and holding her well together for a mighty leap they dashed into the middle of the swiftly flowing current a few moments of kicking wading and swimming and dick drew a long breath on the opposite bank  the road from rattlesnake creek to red mountain was tolerably level either the plunge in rattlesnake creek had dampened her baleful fire or the art which led to it had shown her the superior wickedness of her rider for jovita no longer wasted her surplus energy in wanton conceits once she bucked but it was from force of habit once she shied but it was from a new freshly painted meetinghouse at the crossing of the county road hollows ditches gravelly deposits patches of freshly springing grasses flew from beneath her rattling hoofs she began to smell unpleasantly once or twice she coughed slightly but there was no abatement of her strength or speed by two oclock he had passed red mountain and begun the descent to the plain ten minutes later the driver of the fast pioneer coach was overtaken and passed by a man on a pinto hossan event sufficiently notable for remark at half past two dick rose in his stirrups with a great shout stars were glittering through the rifted clouds and beyond him out of the plain rose two spires a flagstaff and a straggling line of black objects dick jingled his spurs and swung his riata jovita bounded forward and in another moment they swept into tuttleville and drew up before the wooden piazza of the hotel of all nations  what transpired that night at tuttleville is not strictly a part of this record briefly i may state however that after jovita had been handed over to a sleepy ostler whom she at once kicked into unpleasant consciousness dick sallied out with the barkeeper for a tour of the sleeping town lights still gleamed from a few saloons and gamblinghouses but avoiding these they stopped before several closed shops and by persistent tapping and judicious outcry roused the proprietors from their beds and made them unbar the doors of their magazines and expose their wares sometimes they were met by curses but oftener by interest and some concern in their needs and the interview was invariably concluded by a drink it was three oclock before this pleasantry was given over and with a small waterproof bag of indiarubber strapped on his shoulders dick returned to the hotel but here he was waylaid by beautybeauty opulent in charms affluent in dress persuasive in speech and spanish in accent in vain she repeated the invitation in excelsior happily scorned by all alpineclimbing youth and rejected by this child of the sierrasa rejection softened in this instance by a laugh and his last gold coin and then he sprang to the saddle and dashed down the lonely street and out into the lonelier plain where presently the lights the black line of houses the spires and the flagstaff sank into the earth behind him again and were lost in the distance  the storm had cleared away the air was brisk and cold the outlines of adjacent landmarks were distinct but it was half past four before dick reached the meetinghouse and the crossing of the county road to avoid the rising grade he had taken a longer and more circuitous road in whose viscid mud jovita sank fetlock deep at every bound it was a poor preparation for a steady ascent of five miles more but jovita gathering her legs under her took it with her usual blind unreasoning fury and a halfhour later reached the long level that led to rattlesnake creek another halfhour would bring him to the creek he threw the reins lightly upon the neck of the mare chirruped to her and began to sing  suddenly jovita shied with a bound that would have unseated a less practised rider hanging to her rein was a figure that had leaped from the bank and at the same time from the road before her arose a shadowy horse and rider throw up your hands commanded this second apparition with an oath  dick felt the mare tremble quiver and apparently sink under him he knew what it meant and was prepared  stand aside jack simpson i know you you dd thief let me pass or  he did not finish the sentence jovita rose straight in the air with a terrific bound throwing the figure from her bit with a single shake of her vicious head and charged with deadly malevolence down on the impediment before her an oath a pistolshot horse and highwayman rolled over in the road and the next moment jovita was a hundred yards away but the good right arm of her rider shattered by a bullet dropped helplessly at his side  without slacking his speed he shifted the reins to his left hand but a few moments later he was obliged to halt and tighten the saddlegirths that had slipped in the onset this in his crippled condition took some time he had no fear of pursuit but looking up he saw that the eastern stars were already paling and that the distant peaks had lost their ghostly whiteness and now stood out blackly against a lighter sky day was upon him then completely absorbed in a single idea he forgot the pain of his wound and mounting again dashed on toward rattlesnake creek but now jovitas breath came broken by gasps dick reeled in his saddle and brighter and brighter grew the sky  ride richard run jovita linger o day  for the last few rods there was a roaring in his ears was it exhaustion from loss of blood or what he was dazed and giddy as he swept down the hill and did not recognize his surroundings had he taken the wrong road or was this rattlesnake creek  it was but the brawling creek he had swam a few hours before had risen more than doubled its volume and now rolled a swift and resistless river between him and rattlesnake hill for the first time that night richards heart sank within him the river the mountain the quickening east swam before his eyes he shut them to recover his selfcontrol in that brief interval by some fantastic mental process the little room at simpsons bar and the figures of the sleeping father and son rose upon him he opened his eyes wildly cast off his coat pistol boots and saddle bound his precious pack tightly to his shoulders grasped the bare flanks of jovita with his bared knees and with a shout dashed into the yellow water a cry rose from the opposite bank as the head of a man and horse struggled for a few moments against the battling current and then were swept away amidst uprooted trees and whirling driftwood    the old man started and woke the fire on the hearth was dead the candle in the outer room flickering in its socket and somebody was rapping at the door he opened it but fell back with a cry before the dripping halfnaked figure that reeled against the doorpost  dick  hush is he awake yet  nobut dick  dry up you old fool get me some whiskey quick the old man flew and returned withan empty bottle dick would have sworn but his strength was not equal to the occasion he staggered caught at the handle of the door and motioned to the old man  thars suthin in my pack yer for johnny take it off i cant  the old man unstrapped the pack and laid it before the exhausted man  open it quick  he did so with trembling fingers it contained only a few poor toyscheap and barbaric enough goodness knows but bright with paint and tinsel one of them was broken another i fear was irretrievably ruined by water and on the thirdah me there was a cruel spot  it dont look like much thats a fact said dick ruefully     but its the best we could do    take em old man and put em in his stocking and tell himtell him you knowhold me old man the old man caught at his sinking figure tell him said dick with a weak little laughtell him sandy claus has come   and even so bedraggled ragged unshaven and unshorn with one arm hanging helplessly at his side santa claus came to simpsons bar and fell fainting on the first threshold the christmas dawn came slowly after touching the remoter peaks with the rosy warmth of ineffable love and it looked so tenderly on simpsons bar that the whole mountain as if caught in a generous action blushed to the skies     the princess bob and her friends   she was a klamath indian her title was i think a compromise between her claim as daughter of a chief and gratitude to her earliest white protector whose name after the indian fashion she had adopted bob walker had taken her from the breast of her dead mother at a time when the sincere volunteer soldiery of the california frontier were impressed with the belief that extermination was the manifest destiny of the indian race he had with difficulty restrained the noble zeal of his compatriots long enough to convince them that the exemption of one indian baby would not invalidate this theory and he took her to his homea pastoral clearing on the banks of the salmon riverwhere she was cared for after a frontier fashion  before she was nine years old she had exhausted the scant kindliness of the thin overworked mrs walker as a playfellow of the young walkers she was unreliable as a nurse for the baby she was inefficient she lost the former in the trackless depths of a redwood forest she basely abandoned the latter in an extemporized cradle hanging like a chrysalis to a convenient bough she lied and she stoletwo unpardonable sins in a frontier community where truth was a necessity and provisions were the only property worse than this the outskirts of the clearing were sometimes haunted by blanketed tatterdemalions with whom she had mysterious confidences mr walker more than once regretted his indiscreet humanity but she presently relieved him of responsibility and possibly of bloodguiltiness by disappearing entirely  when she reappeared it was at the adjacent village of logport in the capacity of housemaid to a traders wife who joining some little culture to considerable conscientiousness attempted to instruct her charge but the princess proved an unsatisfactory pupil to even so liberal a teacher she accepted the alphabet with great goodhumor but always as a pleasing and recurring novelty in which all interest expired at the completion of each lesson she found a thousand uses for her books and writing materials other than those known to civilized children she made a curious necklace of bits of slatepencil she constructed a miniature canoe from the pasteboard covers of her primer she bent her pens into fishhooks and tattooed the faces of her younger companions with blue ink religious instruction she received as goodhumoredly and learned to pronounce the name of the deity with a cheerful familiarity that shocked her preceptress nor could her reverence be reached through analogy she knew nothing of the great spirit and professed entire ignorance of the happy huntinggrounds yet she attended divine service regularly and as regularly asked for a hymnbook and it was only through the discovery that she had collected twentyfive of these volumes and had hidden them behind the woodpile that her connection with the first baptist church of logport ceased she would occasionally abandon these civilized and christian privileges and disappear from her home returning after several days of absence with an odor of bark and fish and a peaceoffering to her mistress in the shape of venison or game  to add to her troubles she was now fourteen and according to the laws of her race a woman i do not think the most romantic fancy would have called her pretty her complexion defied most of those ambiguous similes through which poets unconsciously apologize for any deviation from the caucasian standard it was not wine nor amber colored if anything it was smoky her face was tattooed with red and white lines on one cheek as if a duotoothed comb had been drawn from cheekbone to jaw and but for the goodhumor that beamed from her small berrylike eyes and shone in her white teeth would have been repulsive she was short and stout in her scant drapery and unrestrained freedom she was hardly statuesque and her more unstudied attitudes were marred by a simian habit of softly scratching her left ankle with the toes of her right foot in moments of contemplation  i think i have already shown enough to indicate the incongruity of her existence with even the low standard of civilization that obtained at logport in the year 1860 it needed but one more fact to prove the farsighted poetical sagacity and prophetic ethics of those sincere advocates of extermination to whose virtues i have done but scant justice in the beginning of this article this fact was presently furnished by the princess after one of her periodical disappearancesthis time unusually prolongedshe astonished logport by returning with a halfbreed baby of a week old in her arms that night a meeting of the hardfeatured serious matrons of logport was held at mrs browns the immediate banishment of the princess was demanded softhearted mrs brown endeavored vainly to get a mitigation or suspension of the sentence but as on a former occasion the princess took matters into her own hands a few mornings afterwards a wicker cradle containing an indian baby was found hanging on the handle of the door of the first baptist church it was the parthian arrow of the flying princess from that day logport knew her no more   it had been a bright clear day on the upland so clear that the ramparts of fort jackson and the flagstaff were plainly visible twelve miles away from the long curving peninsula that stretched a bared white arm around the peaceful waters of logport bay it had been a clear day upon the seashore albeit the air was filled with the flying spume and shifting sand of a straggling beach whose low dunes were dragged down by the long surges of the pacific and thrown up again by the tumultuous tradewinds but the sun had gone down in a bank of fleecy fog that was beginning to roll in upon the beach gradually the headland at the entrance of the harbor and the lighthouse disappeared then the willow fringe that marked the line of salmon river vanished and the ocean was gone a few sails still gleamed on the waters of the bay but the advancing fog wiped them out one by one crept across the steelblue expanse swallowed up the white mills and single spire of logport and joining with reinforcements from the marshes moved solemnly upon the hills ten minutes more and the landscape was utterly blotted out simultaneously the wind died away and a deathlike silence stole over sea and shore the faint clang high overhead of unseen brent the nearer call of invisible plover the lap and wash of undistinguishable waters and the monotonous roll of the vanished ocean were the only sounds as night deepened the faroff booming of the fogbell on the headland at intervals stirred the thick air  hard by the shore of the bay and half hidden by a drifting sandhill stood a low nondescript structure to whose composition sea and shore had equally contributed it was built partly of logs and partly of driftwood and tarred canvas joined to one end of the main buildingthe ordinary logcabin of the settlerwas the halfround pilothouse of some wrecked steamer while the other gable terminated in half of a broken whaleboat nailed against the boat were the dried skins of wild animals and scattered about lay the flotsam and jetsam of many years gatheringbamboo crates casks hatches blocks oars boxes part of a whales vertebrae and the blades of swordfish drawn up on the beach of a little cove before the house lay a canoe as the night thickened and the fog grew more dense these details grew imperceptible and only the windows of the pilothouse lit up by a roaring fire within the hut gleamed redly through the mist  by this fire beneath a ships lamp that swung from the roof two figures were seated a man and a woman the man broadshouldered and heavily bearded stretched his listless powerful length beyond a broken bamboo chair with his eyes fixed on the fire the woman crouched crosslegged upon the broad earthen hearth with her eyes blinkingly fixed on her companion they were small black round berrylike eyes and as the firelight shone upon her smoky face with its one striped cheek of gorgeous brilliancy it was plainly the princess bob and no other  not a word was spoken they had been sitting thus for more than an hour and there was about their attitude a suggestion that silence was habitual once or twice the man rose and walked up and down the narrow room or gazed absently from the windows of the pilothouse but never by look or sign betrayed the slightest consciousness of his companion at such times the princess from her nest by the fire followed him with eyes of canine expectancy and wistfulness but he would as inevitably return to his contemplation of the fire and the princess to her blinking watchfulness of his face  they had sat there silent and undisturbed for many an evening in fair weather and foul they had spent many a day in sunshine and storm gathering the unclaimed spoil of sea and shore they had kept these mute relations varied only by the incidents of the hunt or meagre household duties for three years ever since the man wandering moodily over the lonely sands had fallen upon the halfstarved woman lying in the little hollow where she had crawled to die it had seemed as if they would never be disturbed until now when the princess started and with the instinct of her race bent her ear to the ground  the wind had risen and was rattling the tarred canvas but in another moment there plainly came from without the hut the sound of voices then followed a rap at the door then another rap and then before they could rise to their feet the door was flung briskly open  i beg your pardon said a pleasant but somewhat decided contralto voice but i dont think you heard me knock ah i see you did not may i come in  there was no reply had the battered figurehead of the goddess of liberty which lay deeply embedded in the sand on the beach suddenly appeared at the door demanding admittance the occupants of the cabin could not have been more speechlessly and hopelessly astonished than at the form which stood in the open doorway  it was that of a slim shapely elegantly dressed young woman a scarletlined silken hood was half thrown back from the shining mass of the black hair that covered her small head from her pretty shoulders dropped a fur cloak only restrained by a cord and tassel in her small gloved hand around her full throat was a double necklace of large white beads that by some cunning feminine trick relieved with its infantile suggestion the strong decision of her lower face  did you say yes ah thank you we may come in barker here a shadow in a blue army overcoat followed her into the cabin touched its cap respectfully and then stood silent and erect against the wall dont disturb yourself in the least i beg what a distressingly unpleasant night is this your usual climate  half graciously half absently overlooking the still embarrassed silence of the group she went on we started from the fort over three hours agothree hours ago wasnt it barker the erect barker touched his capto go to captain emmonss quarters on indian islandi think you call it indian island dont you she was appealing to the awestricken princessand we got into the fog and lost our way that is barker lost his way barker touched his cap deprecatingly and goodness knows where we didnt wander to until we mistook your light for the lighthouse and pulled up here no no pray keep your seat do really i must insist  nothing could exceed the languid grace of the latter part of this speechnothing except the easy unconsciousness with which she glided by the offered chair of her stammering embarrassed host and stood beside the open hearth  barker will tell you she continued warming her feet by the fire that i am miss portfire daughter of major portfire commanding the post ah excuse me child she had accidentally trodden upon the bare yellow toes of the princess really i did not know you were there i am very nearsighted in confirmation of her statement she put to her eyes a dainty double eyeglass that dangled from her neck its a shocking thing to be nearsighted isnt it  if the shamefaced uneasy man to whom this remark was addressed could have found words to utter the thought that even in his confusion struggled uppermost in his mind he would looking at the bold dark eyes that questioned him have denied the fact but he only stammered yes the next moment however miss portfire had apparently forgotten him and was examining the princess through her glass  and what is your name child  the princess beatified by the eyes and eyeglass showed all her white teeth at once and softly scratched her leg  bob  bob what a singular name  miss portfires host here hastened to explain the origin of the princesss title  then you are bob eyeglass  no my name is greyjohn grey and he actually achieved a bow where awkwardness was rather the air of imperfectly recalling a forgotten habit  greyah let me see yes certainly you are mr grey the recluse the hermit the philosopher and all that sort of thing why certainly dr jones our surgeon has told me all about you dear me how interesting a rencontre lived all alone here for sevenwas it seven yearsyes i remember now existed quite au naturel one might say how odd not that i know anything about that sort of thing you know ive lived always among people and am really quite a stranger i assure you but honestly mri beg your pardonmr grey how do you like it  she had quietly taken his chair and thrown her cloak and hood over its back and was now thoughtfully removing her gloves whatever were the argumentsand they were doubtless many and profoundwhatever the experienceand it was doubtless hard and satisfying enoughby which this unfortunate man had justified his life for the last seven years somehow they suddenly became trivial and terribly ridiculous before this simple but practical question  well you shall tell me all about it after you have given me something to eat we will have time enough barker cannot find his way back in this fog tonight now dont put yourselves to any trouble on my account barker will assist  barker came forward glad to escape the scrutiny of his guest the hermit gave a few rapid directions to the princess in her native tongue and disappeared in the shed left a moment alone miss portfire took a quick halfaudible feminine inventory of the cabin books guns skins one chair one bed no pictures and no lookingglass she took a book from the swinging shelf and resumed her seat by the fire as the princess reentered with fresh fuel but while kneeling on the hearth the princess chanced to look up and met miss portfires dark eyes over the edge of her book  bob  the princess showed her teeth  listen would you like to have fine clothes rings and beads like these to have your hair nicely combed and put up so would you  the princess nodded violently  would you like to live with me and have them answer quickly dont look round for him speak for yourself would you hush never mind now  the hermit reentered and the princess blinking retreated into the shadow of the whaleboat shed from which she did not emerge even when the homely repast of cold venison ship biscuit and tea was served miss portfire noticed her absence you really must not let me interfere with your usual simple ways do you know this is exceedingly interesting to me so pastoral and patriarchal and all that sort of thing i must insist upon the princess coming back really i must  but the princess was not to be found in the shed and miss portfire who the next minute seemed to have forgotten all about her took her place in the single chair before an extemporized table barker stood behind her and the hermit leaned against the fireplace miss portfires appetite did not come up to her protestations for the first time in seven years it occurred to the hermit that his ordinary victual might be improved he stammered out something to that effect  i have eaten better and worse said miss portfire quietly  but i thought youthat is you said  i spent a year in the hospitals when father was on the potomac returned miss portfire composedly after a pause she continued you remember after the second bull runbut dear me i beg your pardon of course you know nothing about the war and all that sort of thing and dont care she put up her eyeglass and quietly surveyed his broad muscular figure against the chimney or perhaps your prejudicesbut then as a hermit you know you have no politics of course please dont let me bore you  to have been strictly consistent the hermit should have exhibited no interest in this topic perhaps it was owing to some quality in the narrator but he was constrained to beg her to continue in such phrases as his unfamiliar lips could command so that little by little miss portfire yielded up incident and personal observation of the contest then raging with the same halfabstracted halfunconcerned air that seemed habitual to her she told the stories of privation of suffering of endurance and of sacrifice with the same assumption of timid deference that concealed her great selfcontrol she talked of principles and rights apparently without enthusiasm and without effort of which his morbid nature would have been suspicious she sang the great american iliad in a way that stirred the depths of her solitary auditor to its massive foundations then she stopped and asked quietly where is bob  the hermit started he would look for her but bob for some reason was not forthcoming search was made within and without the hut but in vain for the first time that evening miss portfire showed some anxiety go she said to barker and find her she must be found stay give me your overcoat ill go myself she threw the overcoat over her shoulders and stepped out into the night in the thick veil of fog that seemed suddenly to inwrap her she stood for a moment irresolute and then walked toward the beach guided by the low wash of waters on the sand she had not taken many steps before she stumbled over some dark crouching object reaching down her hand she felt the coarse wiry mane of the princess  bob  there was no reply  bob ive been looking for you come  go way  nonsense bob i want you to stay with me tonight come  injin squaw no good for waugee woman go way  listen bob you are daughter of a chief so am i your father had many warriors so has mine it is good that you stay with me come  the princess chuckled and suffered herself to be lifted up a few moments later and they reentered the hut hand in hand  with the first red streaks of dawn the next day the erect barker touched his cap at the door of the hut beside him stood the hermit also just risen from his blanketed nest in the sand forth from the hut fresh as the morning air stepped miss portfire leading the princess by the hand hand in hand also they walked to the shore and when the princess had been safely bestowed in the stern sheets miss portfire turned and held out her own to her late host  i shall take the best of care of her of course you will come and see her often i should ask you to come and see me but you are a hermit you know and all that sort of thing but if its the correct anchorite thing and can be done my father will be glad to requite you for this nights hospitality but dont do anything on my account that interferes with your simple habits good by  she handed him a card which he took mechanically  good by  the sail was hoisted and the boat shoved off as the fresh morning breeze caught the white canvas it seemed to bow a parting salutation there was a rosy flash of promise on the water and as the light craft darted forward toward the ascending sun it seemed for a moment uplifted in its glory   miss portfire kept her word if thoughtful care and intelligent kindness could regenerate the princess her future was secure and it really seemed as if she were for the first time inclined to heed the lessons of civilization and profit by her new condition an agreeable change was first noticed in her appearance her lawless hair was caught in a net and no longer strayed over her low forehead her unstable bust was stayed and upheld by french corsets her plantigrade shuffle was limited by heeled boots her dresses were neat and clean and she wore a double necklace of glass beads with this physical improvement there also seemed some moral awakening she no longer stole nor lied with the possession of personal property came a respect for that of others with increased dependence on the word of those about her came a thoughtful consideration of her own intellectually she was still feeble although she grappled sturdily with the simple lessons which miss portfire set before her but her zeal and simple vanity outran her discretion and she would often sit for hours with an open book before her which she could not read she was a favorite with the officers at the fort from the major who shared his daughters prejudices and often yielded to her powerful selfwill to the subalterns who liked her none the less that their natural enemies the frontier volunteers had declared war against her helpless sisterhood the only restraint put upon her was the limitation of her liberty to the enclosure of the fort and parade and only once did she break this parole and was stopped by the sentry as she stepped into a boat at the landing  the recluse did not avail himself of miss portfires invitation but after the departure of the princess he spent less of his time in the hut and was more frequently seen in the distant marshes of eel river and on the upland hills a feverish restlessness quite opposed to his usual phlegm led him into singular freaks strangely inconsistent with his usual habits and reputation the purser of the occasional steamer which stopped at logport with the mails reported to have been boarded just inside the bar by a strange bearded man who asked for a newspaper containing the last war telegrams he tore his red shirt into narrow strips and spent two days with his needle over the pieces and the tattered remnant of his only white garment and a few days afterward the fishermen on the bay were surprised to see what on nearer approach proved to be a rude imitation of the national flag floating from a spar above the hut  one evening as the fog began to drift over the sandhills the recluse sat alone in his hut the fire was dying unheeded on the hearth for he had been sitting there for a long time completely absorbed in the blurred pages of an old newspaper presently he arose and refolding itan operation of great care and delicacy in its tattered conditionplaced it under the blankets of his bed he resumed his seat by the fire but soon began drumming with his fingers on the arm of his chair eventually this assumed the time and accent of some air then he began to whistle softly and hesitatingly as if trying to recall a forgotten tune finally this took shape in a rude resemblance not unlike that which his flag bore to the national standard to yankee doodle suddenly he stopped  there was an unmistakable rapping at the door the blood which had at first rushed to his face now forsook it and settled slowly around his heart he tried to rise but could not then the door was flung open and a figure with a scarletlined hood and fur mantle stood on the threshold with a mighty effort he took one stride to the door the next moment he saw the wide mouth and white teeth of the princess and was greeted by a kiss that felt like a baptism  to tear the hood and mantle from her figure in the sudden fury that seized him and to fiercely demand the reason of this masquerade was his only return to her greeting why are you here did you steal these garments he again demanded in her guttural language as he shook her roughly by the arm the princess hung her head did you he screamed as he reached wildly for his rifle  i did  his hold relaxed and he staggered back against the wall the princess began to whimper between her sobs she was trying to explain that the major and his daughter were going away and that they wanted to send her to the reservation but he cut her short take off those things the princess tremblingly obeyed he rolled them up placed them in the canoe she had just left and then leaped into the frail craft she would have followed but with a great oath he threw her from him and with one stroke of his paddle swept out into the fog and was gone  jessamy said the major a few days after as he sat at dinner with his daughter i think i can tell you something to match the mysterious disappearance and return of your wardrobe your crazy friend the recluse has enlisted this morning in the fourth artillery hes a splendidlooking animal and theres the right stuff for a soldier in him if im not mistaken hes in earnest too for he enlists in the regiment ordered back to washington bless me child another goblet broken youll ruin the mess in glassware at this rate  have you heard anything more of the princess papa  nothing but perhaps its as well that she has gone these cursed settlers are at their old complaints again about what they call indian depredations and i have just received orders from headquarters to keep the settlement clear of all vagabond aborigines i am afraid my dear that a strict construction of the term would include your protegee  the time for the departure of the fourth artillery had come the night before was thick and foggy at one oclock a shot on the ramparts called out the guard and roused the sleeping garrison the new sentry private grey had challenged a dusky figure creeping on the glacis and receiving no answer had fired the guard sent out presently returned bearing a lifeless figure in their arms the new sentrys zeal joined with an exfrontiersmans aim was fatal  they laid the helpless ragged form before the guardhouse door and then saw for the first time that it was the princess presently she opened her eyes they fell upon the agonized face of her innocent slayer but haply without intelligence or reproach  georgy she whispered  bob  alls same now me get plenty well soon me make no more fuss me go to reservation  then she stopped a tremor ran through her limbs and she lay still she had gone to the reservation not that devised by the wisdom of man but that one set apart from the foundation of the world for the wisest as well as the meanest of his creatures     the iliad of sandy bar   before nine oclock it was pretty well known all along the river that the two partners of the amity claim had quarrelled and separated at daybreak at that time the attention of their nearest neighbor had been attracted by the sounds of altercations and two consecutive pistolshots running out he had seen dimly in the gray mist that rose from the river the tall form of scott one of the partners descending the hill toward the canyon a moment later york the other partner had appeared from the cabin and walked in an opposite direction toward the river passing within a few feet of the curious watcher later it was discovered that a serious chinaman cutting wood before the cabin had witnessed part of the quarrel but john was stolid indifferent and reticent me choppee wood me no fightee was his serene response to all anxious queries but what did they say john john did not sabe colonel starbottle deftly ran over the various popular epithets which a generous public sentiment might accept as reasonable provocation for an assault but john did not recognize them and this yers the cattle said the colonel with some severity that some thinks oughter be allowed to testify agin a white man gityou heathen  still the quarrel remained inexplicable that two men whose amiability and grave tact had earned for them the title of the peacemakers in a community not greatly given to the passive virtuesthat these men singularly devoted to each other should suddenly and violently quarrel might well excite the curiosity of the camp a few of the more inquisitive visited the late scene of conflict now deserted by its former occupants there was no trace of disorder or confusion in the neat cabin the rude table was arranged as if for breakfast the pan of yellow biscuit still sat upon that hearth whose dead embers might have typified the evil passions that had raged there but an hour before but colonel starbottles eyealbeit somewhat bloodshot and rheumywas more intent on practical details on examination a bullethole was found in the doorpost and another nearly opposite in the casing of the window the colonel called attention to the fact that the one agreed with the bore of scotts revolver and the other with that of yorks derringer they must hev stood about yer said the colonel taking position not morn three feet apart andmissed there was a fine touch of pathos in the falling inflection of the colonels voice which was not without effect a delicate perception of wasted opportunity thrilled his auditors  but the bar was destined to experience a greater disappointment the two antagonists had not met since the quarrel and it was vaguely rumored that on the occasion of a second meeting each had determined to kill the other on sight there was consequently some excitementand it is to be feared no little gratificationwhen at ten oclock york stepped from the magnolia saloon into the one long straggling street of the camp at the same moment that scott left the blacksmiths shop at the forks of the road it was evident at a glance that a meeting could only be avoided by the actual retreat of one or the other  in an instant the doors and windows of the adjacent saloons were filled with faces heads unaccountably appeared above the riverbanks and from behind bowlders an empty wagon at the crossroad was suddenly crowded with people who seemed to have sprung from the earth there was much running and confusion on the hillside on the mountainroad mr jack hamlin had reined up his horse and was standing upright on the seat of his buggy and the two objects of this absorbing attention approached each other  yorks got the sun scottll line him on that tree hes waitin to draw his fire came from the cart and then it was silent but above this human breathlessness the river rushed and sang and the wind rustled the treetops with an indifference that seemed obtrusive colonel starbottle felt it and in a moment of sublime preoccupation without looking around waved his cane behind him warningly to all nature and said shu  the men were now within a few feet of each other a hen ran across the road before one of them a feathery seedvessel wafted from a wayside tree fell at the feet of the other and unheeding this irony of nature the two opponents came nearer erect and rigid looked in each others eyes andpassed  colonel starbottle had to be lifted from the cart this yer camp is played out he said gloomily as he affected to be supported into the magnolia with what further expression he might have indicated his feelings it was impossible to say for at that moment scott joined the group did you speak to me he asked of the colonel dropping his hand as if with accidental familiarity on that gentlemans shoulder the colonel recognizing some occult quality in the touch and some unknown quantity in the glance of his questioner contented himself by replying no sir with dignity a few rods away yorks conduct was as characteristic and peculiar you had a mighty fine chance why didnt you plump him said jack hamlin as york drew near the buggy because i hate him was the reply heard only by jack contrary to popular belief this reply was not hissed between the lips of the speaker but was said in an ordinary tone but jack hamlin who was an observer of mankind noticed that the speakers hands were cold and his lips dry as he helped him into the buggy and accepted the seeming paradox with a smile   when sandy bar became convinced that the quarrel between york and scott could not be settled after the usual local methods it gave no further concern thereto but presently it was rumored that the amity claim was in litigation and that its possession would be expensively disputed by each of the partners as it was well known that the claim in question was worked out and worthless and that the partners whom it had already enriched had talked of abandoning it but a day or two before the quarrel this proceeding could only be accounted for as gratuitous spite later two san francisco lawyers made their appearance in this guileless arcadia and were eventually taken into the saloons andwhat was pretty much the same thingthe confidences of the inhabitants the results of this unhallowed intimacy were many subpoenas and indeed when the amity claim came to trial all of sandy bar that was not in compulsory attendance at the county seat came there from curiosity the gulches and ditches for miles around were deserted i do not propose to describe that already famous trial enough that in the language of the plaintiffs counsel it was one of no ordinary significance involving the inherent rights of that untiring industry which had developed the pactolian resources of this golden land and in the homelier phrase of colonel starbottle a fuss that gentlemen might hev settled in ten minutes over a social glass ef they meant business or in ten seconds with a revolver ef they meant fun scott got a verdict from which york instantly appealed it was said that he had sworn to spend his last dollar in the struggle  in this way sandy bar began to accept the enmity of the former partners as a lifelong feud and the fact that they had ever been friends was forgotten the few who expected to learn from the trial the origin of the quarrel were disappointed among the various conjectures that which ascribed some occult feminine influence as the cause was naturally popular in a camp given to dubious compliment of the sex my word for it gentlemen said colonel starbottle who had been known in sacramento as a gentleman of the old school theres some lovely creature at the bottom of this the gallant colonel then proceeded to illustrate his theory by divers sprightly stories such as gentlemen of the old school are in the habit of repeating but which from deference to the prejudices of gentlemen of a more recent school i refrain from transcribing here but it would appear that even the colonels theory was fallacious the only woman who personally might have exercised any influence over the partners was the pretty daughter of old man folinsbee of poverty flat at whose hospitable housewhich exhibited some comforts and refinements rare in that crude civilizationboth york and scott were frequent visitors yet into this charming retreat york strode one evening a month after the quarrel and beholding scott sitting there turned to the fair hostess with the abrupt query do you love this man the young woman thus addressed returned that answerat once spirited and evasivewhich would occur to most of my fair readers in such an exigency without another word york left the house miss jo heaved the least possible sigh as the door closed on yorks curls and square shoulders and then like a good girl turned to her insulted guest but would you believe it dear she afterward related to an intimate friend the other creature after glowering at me for a moment got upon its hind legs took its hat and left too and thats the last ive seen of either  the same hard disregard of all other interests or feelings in the gratification of their blind rancor characterized all their actions when york purchased the land below scotts new claim and obliged the latter at a great expense to make a long detour to carry a tailrace around it scott retaliated by building a dam that overflowed yorks claim on the river it was scott who in conjunction with colonel starbottle first organized that active opposition to the chinamen which resulted in the driving off of yorks mongolian laborers it was york who built the wagonroad and established the express which rendered scotts mules and packtrains obsolete it was scott who called into life the vigilance committee which expatriated yorks friend jack hamlin it was york who created the sandy bar herald which characterized the act as a lawless outrage and scott as a border ruffian it was scott at the head of twenty masked men who one moonlight night threw the offending forms into the yellow river and scattered the types in the dusty road these proceedings were received in the distant and more civilized outlying towns as vague indications of progress and vitality i have before me a copy of the poverty flat pioneer for the week ending august 12 1856 in which the editor under the head of county improvements says the new presbyterian church on c street at sandy bar is completed it stands upon the lot formerly occupied by the magnolia saloon which was so mysteriously burnt last month the temple which now rises like a phoenix from the ashes of the magnolia is virtually the free gift of h j york esq of sandy bar who purchased the lot and donated the lumber other buildings are going up in the vicinity but the most noticeable is the sunny south saloon erected by captain mat scott nearly opposite the church captain scott has spared no expense in the furnishing of this saloon which promises to be one of the most agreeable places of resort in old tuolumne he has recently imported two new firstclass billiardtables with cork cushions our old friend mountain jimmy will dispense liquors at the bar we refer our readers to the advertisement in another column visitors to sandy bar cannot do better than give jimmy a call among the local items occurred the following h j york esq of sandy bar has offered a reward of 100 for the detection of the parties who hauled away the steps of the new presbyterian church c street sandy bar during divine service on sabbath evening last captain scott adds another hundred for the capture of the miscreants who broke the magnificent plateglass windows of the new saloon on the following evening there is some talk of reorganizing the old vigilance committee at sandy bar  when for many months of cloudless weather the hard unwinking sun of sandy bar had regularly gone down on the unpacified wrath of these men there was some talk of mediation in particular the pastor of the church to which i have just referreda sincere fearless but perhaps not fully enlightened manseized gladly upon the occasion of yorks liberality to attempt to reunite the former partners he preached an earnest sermon on the abstract sinfulness of discord and rancor but the excellent sermons of the rev mr daws were directed to an ideal congregation that did not exist at sandy bara congregation of beings of unmixed vices and virtues of single impulses and perfectly logical motives of preternatural simplicity of childlike faith and grownup responsibilities as unfortunately the people who actually attended mr dawss church were mainly very human somewhat artful more selfexcusing than selfaccusing rather goodnatured and decidedly weak they quietly shed that portion of the sermon which referred to themselves and accepting york and scottwho were both in defiant attendanceas curious examples of those ideal beings above referred to felt a certain satisfactionwhich i fear was not altogether christianlikein their rakingdown if mr daws expected york and scott to shake hands after the sermon he was disappointed but he did not relax his purpose with that quiet fearlessness and determination which had won for him the respect of men who were too apt to regard piety as synonymous with effeminacy he attacked scott in his own house what he said has not been recorded but it is to be feared that it was part of his sermon when he had concluded scott looked at him not unkindly over the glasses of his bar and said less irreverently than the words might convey young man i rather like your style but when you know york and me as well as you do god almighty itll be time to talk  and so the feud progressed and so as in more illustrious examples the private and personal enmity of two representative men led gradually to the evolution of some crude halfexpressed principle or belief it was not long before it was made evident that those beliefs were identical with certain broad principles laid down by the founders of the american constitution as expounded by the statesmanlike a or were the fatal quicksands on which the ship of state might be wrecked warningly pointed out by the eloquent b the practical result of all which was the nomination of york and scott to represent the opposite factions of sandy bar in legislative councils  for some weeks past the voters of sandy bar and the adjacent camps had been called upon in large type to rally in vain the great pines at the crossroadswhose trunks were compelled to bear this and other legendsmoaned and protested from their windy watchtowers but one day with fife and drum and flaming transparency a procession filed into the triangular grove at the head of the gulch the meeting was called to order by colonel starbottle who having once enjoyed legislative functions and being vaguely known as a warhorse was considered to be a valuable partisan of york he concluded an appeal for his friend with an enunciation of principles interspersed with one or two anecdotes so gratuitously coarse that the very pines might have been moved to pelt him with their castoff cones as he stood there but he created a laugh on which his candidate rode into popular notice and when york rose to speak he was greeted with cheers but to the general astonishment the new speaker at once launched into bitter denunciation of his rival he not only dwelt upon scotts deeds and example as known to sandy bar but spoke of facts connected with his previous career hitherto unknown to his auditors to great precision of epithet and directness of statement the speaker added the fascination of revelation and exposure the crowd cheered yelled and were delighted but when this astounding philippic was concluded there was a unanimous call for scott colonel starbottle would have resisted this manifest impropriety but in vain partly from a crude sense of justice partly from a meaner craving for excitement the assemblage was inflexible and scott was dragged pushed and pulled upon the platform  as his frowsy head and unkempt beard appeared above the railing it was evident that he was drunk but it was also evident before he opened his lips that the orator of sandy barthe one man who could touch their vagabond sympathies perhaps because he was not above appealing to themstood before them a consciousness of this power lent a certain dignity to his figure and i am not sure but that his very physical condition impressed them as a kind of regal unbending and large condescension howbeit when this unexpected hector arose from the ditch yorks myrmidons trembled  theres naught gentlemen said scott leaning forward on the railingtheres naught as that man hez said as isnt true i was run outer cairo i did belong to the regulators i did desert from the army i did leave a wife in kansas but thars one thing he didnt charge me with and maybe hes forgotten for three years gentlemen i was that mans pardner whether he intended to say more i cannot tell a burst of applause artistically rounded and enforced the climax and virtually elected the speaker that fall he went to sacramento york went abroad and for the first time in many years distance and a new atmosphere isolated the old antagonists   with little of change in the green wood gray rock and yellow river but with much shifting of human landmarks and new faces in its habitations three years passed over sandy bar the two men once so identified with its character seemed to have been quite forgotten you will never return to sandy bar said miss folinsbee the lily of poverty flat on meeting york in paris for sandy bar is no more they call it riverside now and the new town is built higher up on the riverbank by the by jo says that scott has won his suit about the amity claim and that he lives in the old cabin and is drunk half his time o i beg your pardon added the lively lady as a flush crossed yorks sallow cheek but bless me i really thought that old grudge was made up im sure it ought to be  it was three months after this conversation and a pleasant summer evening that the poverty flat coach drew up before the veranda of the union hotel at sandy bar among its passengers was one apparently a stranger in the local distinction of wellfitting clothes and closely shaven face who demanded a private room and retired early to rest but before sunrise next morning he arose and drawing some clothes from his carpetbag proceeded to array himself in a pair of white duck trousers a white duck overshirt and straw hat when his toilet was completed he tied a red bandanna handkerchief in a loop and threw it loosely over his shoulders the transformation was complete as he crept softly down the stairs and stepped into the road no one would have detected in him the elegant stranger of the previous night and but few have recognized the face and figure of henry york of sandy bar  in the uncertain light of that early hour and in the change that had come over the settlement he had to pause for a moment to recall where he stood the sandy bar of his recollection lay below him nearer the river the buildings around him were of later date and newer fashion as he strode toward the river he noticed here a schoolhouse and there a church a little farther on the sunny south came in view transformed into a restaurant its gilding faded and its paint rubbed off he now knew where he was and running briskly down a declivity crossed a ditch and stood upon the lower boundary of the amity claim  the gray mist was rising slowly from the river clinging to the treetops and drifting up the mountainside until it was caught among those rocky altars and held a sacrifice to the ascending sun at his feet the earth cruelly gashed and scarred by his forgotten engines had since the old days put on a show of greenness here and there and now smiled forgivingly up at him as if things were not so bad after all a few birds were bathing in the ditch with a pleasant suggestion of its being a new and special provision of nature and a hare ran into an inverted sluicebox as he approached as if it were put there for that purpose  he had not yet dared to look in a certain direction but the sun was now high enough to paint the little eminence on which the cabin stood in spite of his selfcontrol his heart beat faster as he raised his eyes toward it its window and door were closed no smoke came from its adobe chimney but it was else unchanged when within a few yards of it he picked up a broken shovel and shouldering it with a smile strode toward the door and knocked there was no sound from within the smile died upon his lips as he nervously pushed the door open  a figure started up angrily and came toward hima figure whose bloodshot eyes suddenly fixed into a vacant stare whose arms were at first outstretched and then thrown up in warning gesticulationa figure that suddenly gasped choked and then fell forward in a fit  but before he touched the ground york had him out into the open air and sunshine in the struggle both fell and rolled over on the ground but the next moment york was sitting up holding the convulsed frame of his former partner on his knee and wiping the foam from his inarticulate lips gradually the tremor became less frequent and then ceased and the strong man lay unconscious in his arms  for some moments york held him quietly thus looking in his face afar the stroke of a woodmans axea mere phantom of soundwas all that broke the stillness high up the mountain a wheeling hawk hung breathlessly above them and then came voices and two men joined them  a fight no a fit and would they help him bring the sick man to the hotel  and there for a week the stricken partner lay unconscious of aught but the visions wrought by disease and fear on the eighth day at sunrise he rallied and opening his eyes looked upon york and pressed his hand then he spoke  and its you i thought it was only whiskey  york replied by taking both of his hands boyishly working them backward and forward as his elbow rested on the bed with a pleasant smile  and youve been abroad how did you like paris  so so how did you like sacramento  bully  and that was all they could think to say presently scott opened his eyes again  im mighty weak  youll get better soon  not much  a long silence followed in which they could hear the sounds of woodchopping and that sandy bar was already astir for the coming day then scott slowly and with difficulty turned his face to york and said  i might hev killed you once  i wish you had  they pressed each others hands again but scotts grasp was evidently failing he seemed to summon his energies for a special effort  old man  old chap  closer  york bent his head toward the slowly fading face  do ye mind that morning  yes  a gleam of fun slid into the corner of scotts blue eye as he whispered  old man thar was too much saleratus in that bread  it is said that these were his last words for when the sun which had so often gone down upon the idle wrath of these foolish men looked again upon them reunited it saw the hand of scott fall cold and irresponsive from the yearning clasp of his former partner and it knew that the feud of sandy bar was at an end     mr thompsons prodigal   we all knew that mr thompson was looking for his son and a pretty bad one at that that he was coming to california for this sole object was no secret to his fellowpassengers and the physical peculiarities as well as the moral weaknesses of the missing prodigal were made equally plain to us through the frank volubility of the parent you was speaking of a young man which was hung at red dog for sluicerobbing said mr thompson to a steerage passenger one day be you aware of the color of his eyes black responded the passenger ah said mr thompson referring to some mental memoranda charless eyes was blue he then walked away perhaps it was from this unsympathetic mode of inquiry perhaps it was from that western predilection to take a humorous view of any principle or sentiment persistently brought before them that mr thompsons quest was the subject of some satire among the passengers a gratuitous advertisement of the missing charles addressed to jailers and guardians circulated privately among them everybody remembered to have met charles under distressing circumstances yet it is but due to my countrymen to state that when it was known that thompson had embarked some wealth in this visionary project but little of this satire found its way to his ears and nothing was uttered in his hearing that might bring a pang to a fathers heart or imperil a possible pecuniary advantage of the satirist indeed mr bracy tibbetss jocular proposition to form a jointstock company to prospect for the missing youth received at one time quite serious entertainment  perhaps to superficial criticism mr thompsons nature was not picturesque nor lovable his history as imparted at dinner one day by himself was practical even in its singularity after a hard and wilful youth and maturityin which he had buried a brokenspirited wife and driven his son to seahe suddenly experienced religion i got it in new orleans in 59 said mr thompson with the general suggestion of referring to an epidemic enter ye the narrer gate parse me the beans perhaps this practical quality upheld him in his apparently hopeless search he had no clew to the whereabouts of his runaway son indeed scarcely a proof of his present existence from his indifferent recollection of the boy of twelve he now expected to identify the man of twentyfive  it would seem that he was successful how he succeeded was one of the few things he did not tell there are i believe two versions of the story one that mr thompson visiting a hospital discovered his son by reason of a peculiar hymn chanted by the sufferer in a delirious dream of his boyhood this version giving as it did wide range to the finer feelings of the heart was quite popular and as told by the rev mr gushington on his return from his california tour never failed to satisfy an audience the other was less simple and as i shall adopt it here deserves more elaboration  it was after mr thompson had given up searching for his son among the living and had taken to the examination of cemeteries and a careful inspection of the cold hic jacets of the dead at this time he was a frequent visitor of lone mountaina dreary hilltop bleak enough in its original isolation and bleaker for the whitefaced marbles by which san francisco anchored her departed citizens and kept them down in a shifting sand that refused to cover them and against a fierce and persistent wind that strove to blow them utterly away against this wind the old man opposed a will quite as persistenta grizzled hard face and a tall crapebound hat drawn tightly over his eyesand so spent days in reading the mortuary inscriptions audibly to himself the frequency of scriptural quotation pleased him and he was fond of corroborating them by a pocket bible thats from psalms he said one day to an adjacent gravedigger the man made no reply not at all rebuffed mr thompson at once slid down into the open grave with a more practical inquiry did you ever in your profession come across charles thompson thompson be dd said the gravedigger with great directness which if he hadnt religion i think he is responded the old man as he clambered out of the grave  it was perhaps on this occasion that mr thompson stayed later than usual as he turned his face toward the city lights were beginning to twinkle ahead and a fierce wind made visible by fog drove him forward or lying in wait charged him angrily from the corners of deserted suburban streets it was on one of these corners that something else quite as indistinct and malevolent leaped upon him with an oath a presented pistol and a demand for money but it was met by a will of iron and a grip of steel the assailant and assailed rolled together on the ground but the next moment the old man was erect one hand grasping the captured pistol the other clutching at arms length the throat of a figure surly youthful and savage  young man said mr thompson setting his thin lips together what might be your name  thompson  the old mans hand slid from the throat to the arm of his prisoner without relaxing its firmness  charles thompson come with me he said presently and marched his captive to the hotel what took place there has not transpired but it was known the next morning that mr thompson had found his son   it is proper to add to the above improbable story that there was nothing in the young mans appearance or manners to justify it grave reticent and handsome devoted to his newly found parent he assumed the emoluments and responsibilities of his new condition with a certain serious ease that more nearly approached that which san francisco society lacked andrejected some chose to despise this quality as a tendency to psalmsinging others saw in it the inherited qualities of the parent and were ready to prophesy for the son the same hard old age but all agreed that it was not inconsistent with the habits of moneygetting for which father and son were respected  and yet the old man did not seem to be happy perhaps it was that the consummation of his wishes left him without a practical mission perhapsand it is the more probablehe had little love for the son he had regained the obedience he exacted was freely given the reform he had set his heart upon was complete and yet somehow it did not seem to please him in reclaiming his son he had fulfilled all the requirements that his religious duty required of him and yet the act seemed to lack sanctification in this perplexity he read again the parable of the prodigal sonwhich he had long ago adopted for his guidanceand found that he had omitted the final feast of reconciliation this seemed to offer the proper quality of ceremoniousness in the sacrament between himself and his son and so a year after the appearance of charles he set about giving him a party invite everybody charles he said dryly everybody who knows that i brought you out of the winehusks of iniquity and the company of harlots and bid them eat drink and be merry  perhaps the old man had another reason not yet clearly analyzed the fine house he had built on the sandhills sometimes seemed lonely and bare he often found himself trying to reconstruct from the grave features of charles the little boy whom he but dimly remembered in the past and of whom lately he had been thinking a great deal he believed this to be a sign of impending old age and childishness but coming one day in his formal drawingroom upon a child of one of the servants who had strayed therein he would have taken him in his arms but the child fled from before his grizzled face so that it seemed eminently proper to invite a number of people to his house and from the array of san francisco maidenhood to select a daughterinlaw and then there would be a childa boy whom he could rare up from the beginning andloveas he did not love charles  we were all at the party the smiths joneses browns and robinsons also came in that fine flow of animal spirits unchecked by any respect for the entertainer which most of us are apt to find so fascinating the proceedings would have been somewhat riotous but for the social position of the actors in fact mr bracy tibbets having naturally a fine appreciation of a humorous situation but further impelled by the bright eyes of the jones girls conducted himself so remarkably as to attract the serious regard of mr charles thompson who approached him saying quietly you look ill mr tibbets let me conduct you to your carriage resist you hound and ill throw you through that window this way please the room is close and distressing it is hardly necessary to say that but a part of this speech was audible to the company and that the rest was not divulged by mr tibbets who afterward regretted the sudden illness which kept him from witnessing a certain amusing incident which the fastest miss jones characterized as the richest part of the blowout and which i hasten to record  it was at supper it was evident that mr thompson had overlooked much lawlessness in the conduct of the younger people in his abstract contemplation of some impending event when the cloth was removed he rose to his feet and grimly tapped upon the table a titter that broke out among the jones girls became epidemic on one side of the board charles thompson from the foot of the table looked up in tender perplexity hes going to sing a doxology hes going to pray silence for a speech ran round the room  its one year today christian brothers and sisters said mr thompson with grim deliberationone year today since my son came home from eating of winehusks and spending of his substance on harlots the tittering suddenly ceased look at him now charles thompson stand up charles thompson stood up one year ago todayand look at him now  he was certainly a handsome prodigal standing there in his cheerful eveningdressa repentant prodigal with sad obedient eyes turned upon the harsh and unsympathetic glance of his father the youngest miss smith from the pure depths of her foolish little heart moved unconsciously toward him  its fifteen years ago since he left my house said mr thompson a rovier and a prodigal i was myself a man of sin o christian friendsa man of wrath and bitterness amen from the eldest miss smithbut praise be god ive fled the wrath to come its five years ago since i got the peace that passeth understanding have you got it friends a general subchorus of no no from the girls and pass the word for it from midshipman coxe of the u s sloop wethersfield knock and it shall be opened to you  and when i found the error of my ways and the preciousness of grace continued mr thompson i came to give it to my son by sea and land i sought him far and fainted not i did not wait for him to come to me which the same i might have done and justified myself by the book of books but i sought him out among his husks and the rest of the sentence was lost in the rustling withdrawal of the ladies works christian friends is my motto by their works shall ye know them and there is mine  the particular and accepted work to which mr thompson was alluding had turned quite pale and was looking fixedly toward an open door leading to the veranda lately filled by gaping servants and now the scene of some vague tumult as the noise continued a man shabbily dressed and evidently in liquor broke through the opposing guardians and staggered into the room the transition from the fog and darkness without to the glare and heat within evidently dazzled and stupefied him he removed his battered hat and passed it once or twice before his eyes as he steadied himself but unsuccessfully by the back of a chair suddenly his wandering glance fell upon the pale face of charles thompson and with a gleam of childlike recognition and a weak falsetto laugh he darted forward caught at the table upset the glasses and literally fell upon the prodigals breast  shaly yo dd ol scounrel hoo rar ye  hushsit downhush said charles thompson hurriedly endeavoring to extricate himself from the embrace of his unexpected guest  look at m continued the stranger unheeding the admonition but suddenly holding the unfortunate charles at arms length in loving and undisguised admiration of his festive appearance look at m aint he nasty shals im prow of yer  leave the house said mr thompson rising with a dangerous look in his cold gray eye charles how dare you  simmer down ole man shals whos th ol bloat eh  hush man here take this with nervous hands charles thompson filled a glass with liquor drink it and gountil tomorrowany time butleave usgo now but even then ere the miserable wretch could drink the old man pale with passion was upon him half carrying him in his powerful arms half dragging him through the circling crowd of frightened guests he had reached the door swung open by the waiting servants when charles thompson started from a seeming stupor crying  stop  the old man stopped through the open door the fog and wind drove chilly what does this mean he asked turning a baleful face on charles  nothingbut stopfor gods sake wait till tomorrow but not tonight do noti implore youdo this thing  there was something in the tone of the young mans voice something perhaps in the contact of the struggling wretch he held in his powerful arms but a dim indefinite fear took possession of the old mans heart who he whispered hoarsely is this man  charles did not answer  stand back there all of you thundered mr thompson to the crowding guests around him charlescome here i command youiiibeg youtell me who is this man  only two persons heard the answer that came faintly from the lips of charles thompson  your son   when day broke over the bleak sandhills the guests had departed from mr thompsons banquethalls the lights still burned dimly and coldly in the deserted roomsdeserted by all but three figures that huddled together in the chill drawingroom as if for warmth one lay in drunken slumber on a couch at his feet sat he who had been known as charles thompson and beside them haggard and shrunken to half his size bowed the figure of mr thompson his gray eye fixed his elbows upon his knees and his hands clasped over his ears as if to shut out the sad entreating voice that seemed to fill the room  god knows i did not set about to wilfully deceive the name i gave that night was the first that came into my thoughtthe name of one whom i thought deadthe dissolute companion of my shame and when you questioned further i used the knowledge that i gained from him to touch your heart to set me free only i swear for that but when you told me who you were and i first saw the opening of another life before methentheno sir if i was hungry homeless and reckless when i would have robbed you of your gold i was heartsick helpless and desperate when i would have robbed you of your love  the old man stirred not from his luxurious couch the newly found prodigal snored peacefully  i had no father i could claim i never knew a home but this i was tempted i have been happyvery happy  he rose and stood before the old man do not fear that i shall come between your son and his inheritance today i leave this place never to return the world is large sir and thanks to your kindness i now see the way by which an honest livelihood is gained good by you will not take my hand well well good by  he turned to go but when he had reached the door he suddenly came back and raising with both hands the grizzled head he kissed it once and twice  charles  there was no reply  charles  the old man rose with a frightened air and tottered feebly to the door it was open there came to him the awakened tumult of a great city in which the prodigals footsteps were lost forever     the romance of madrono hollow   the latch on the garden gate of the folinsbee ranch clicked twice the gate itself was so much in shadow that lovely night that old man folinsbee sitting on his porch could distinguish nothing but a tall white hat and beside it a few fluttering ribbons under the pines that marked the entrance whether because of this fact or that he considered a sufficient time had elapsed since the clicking of the latch for more positive disclosure i do not know but after a few moments hesitation he quietly laid aside his pipe and walked slowly down the winding path toward the gate at the ceanothus hedge he stopped and listened  there was not much to hear the hat was saying to the ribbons that it was a fine night and remarking generally upon the clear outline of the sierras against the blueblack sky the ribbons it so appeared had admired this all the way home and asked the hat if it had ever seen anything half so lovely as the moonlight on the summit the hat never had it recalled some lovely nights in the south in alabama in the south in ahlabahm was the way the old man heard it but then there were other things that made this night seem so pleasant the ribbons could not possibly conceive what the hat could be thinking about at this point there was a pause of which mr folinsbee availed himself to walk very grimly and craunchingly down the gravelwalk toward the gate then the hat was lifted and disappeared in the shadow and mr folinsbee confronted only the halffoolish halfmischievous but wholly pretty face of his daughter  it was afterward known to madrono hollow that sharp words passed between miss jo and the old man and that the latter coupled the names of one culpepper starbottle and his uncle colonel starbottle with certain uncomplimentary epithets and that miss jo retaliated sharply her fathers blood before her fathers face boiled up and proved her truly of his race quoted the blacksmith who leaned toward the noble verse of byron she saw the old mans bluff and raised him was the directer comment of the collegebred masters  meanwhile the subject of these animadversions proceeded slowly along the road to a point where the folinsbee mansion came in viewa long narrow white building unpretentious yet superior to its neighbors and bearing some evidences of taste and refinement in the vines that clambered over its porch in its french windows and the white muslin curtains that kept out the fierce california sun by day and were now touched with silver in the gracious moonlight culpepper leaned against the low fence and gazed long and earnestly at the building then the moonlight vanished ghostlike from one of the windows a material glow took its place and a girlish figure holding a candle drew the white curtains together to culpepper it was a vestal virgin standing before a hallowed shrine to the prosaic observer i fear it was only a fairhaired young woman whose wicked black eyes still shone with unfilial warmth howbeit when the figure had disappeared he stepped out briskly into the moonlight of the highroad here he took off his distinguishing hat to wipe his forehead and the moon shone full upon his face  it was not an unprepossessing one albeit a trifle too thin and lank and bilious to be altogether pleasant the cheekbones were prominent and the black eyes sunken in their orbits straight black hair fell slantwise off a high but narrow forehead and swept part of a hollow cheek a long black mustache followed the perpendicular curves of his mouth it was on the whole a serious even quixotic face but at times it was relieved by a rare smile of such tender and even pathetic sweetness that miss jo is reported to have said that if it would only last through the ceremony she would have married its possessor on the spot i once told him so added that shameless young woman but the man instantly fell into a settled melancholy and hasnt smiled since  a halfmile below the folinsbee ranch the white road dipped and was crossed by a trail that ran through madrono hollow perhaps because it was a near cutoff to the settlement perhaps from some less practical reason culpepper took this trail and in a few moments stood among the rarely beautiful trees that gave their name to the valley even in that uncertain light the weird beauty of these harlequin masqueraders was apparent their red trunksa blush in the moonlight a deep bloodstain in the shadowstood out against the silvery green foliage it was as if nature in some gracious moment had here caught and crystallized the gypsy memories of the transplanted spaniard to cheer him in his lonely exile  as culpepper entered the grove he heard loud voices as he turned toward a clump of trees a figure so bizarre and characteristic that it might have been a resident daphnea figure overdressed in crimson silk and lace with bare brown arms and shoulders and a wreath of honeysucklestepped out of the shadow it was followed by a man culpepper started to come to the point briefly he recognized in the man the features of his respected uncle colonel starbottle in the female a lady who may be briefly described as one possessing absolutely no claim to an introduction to the polite reader to hurry over equally unpleasant details both were evidently under the influence of liquor  from the excited conversation that ensued culpepper gathered that some insult had been put upon the lady at a public ball which she had attended that evening that the colonel her escort had failed to resent it with the sanguinary completeness that she desired i regret that even in a liberal age i may not record the exact and even picturesque language in which this was conveyed to her hearers enough that at the close of a fiery peroration with feminine inconsistency she flew at the gallant colonel and would have visited her delayed vengeance upon his luckless head but for the prompt interference of culpepper thwarted in this she threw herself upon the ground and then into unpicturesque hysterics there was a fine moral lesson not only in this grotesque performance of a sex which cannot afford to be grotesque but in the ludicrous concern with which it inspired the two men culpepper to whom woman was more or less angelic was pained and sympathetic the colonel to whom she was more or less improper was exceedingly terrified and embarrassed howbeit the storm was soon over and after mistress dolores had returned a little dagger to its sheath her garter she quietly took herself out of madrono hollow and happily out of these pages forever the two men left to themselves conversed in low tones dawn stole upon them before they separated the colonel quite sobered and in full possession of his usual jaunty selfassertion culpepper with a baleful glow in his hollow cheek and in his dark eyes a rising fire   the next morning the general ear of madrono hollow was filled with rumors of the colonels mishap it was asserted that he had been invited to withdraw his female companion from the floor of the assembly ball at the independence hotel and that failing to do this both were expelled it is to be regretted that in 1854 public opinion was divided in regard to the propriety of this step and that there was some discussion as to the comparative virtue of the ladies who were not expelled but it was generally conceded that the real casus belli was political is this a dashed puritan meeting had asked the colonel savagely its no pike county shindig had responded the floormanager cheerfully youre a yank had screamed the colonel profanely qualifying the noun get you border ruffian was the reply such at least was the substance of the reports as at that sincere epoch expressions like the above were usually followed by prompt action a fracas was confidently looked for  nothing however occurred colonel starbottle made his appearance next day upon the streets with somewhat of his usual pomposity a little restrained by the presence of his nephew who accompanied him and who as a universal favorite also exercised some restraint upon the curious and impertinent but culpeppers face wore a look of anxiety quite at variance with his usual grave repose the don dont seem to take the old mans setback kindly observed the sympathizing blacksmith praps he was sweet on dolores himself suggested the sceptical expressman  it was a bright morning a week after this occurrence that miss jo folinsbee stepped from her garden into the road this time the latch did not click as she cautiously closed the gate behind her after a moments irresolution which would have been awkward but that it was charmingly employed after the manner of her sex in adjusting a bow under a dimpled but rather prominent chin and in pulling down the fingers of a neatly fitting glove she tripped toward the settlement small wonder that a passing teamster drove his six mules into the wayside ditch and imperilled his load to keep the dust from her spotless garments small wonder that the lightning express withheld its speed and flash to let her pass and that the expressman who had never been known to exchange more than rapid monosyllables with his fellowman gazed after her with breathless admiration for she was certainly attractive in a country where the ornamental sex followed the example of youthful nature and were prone to overdress and glaring efflorescence miss jos simple and tasteful raiment added much to the physical charm of if it did not actually suggest a sentiment to her presence it is said that euchredeck billy working in the gulch at the crossing never saw miss folinsbee pass but that he always remarked apologetically to his partner that he believed he must write a letter home even bill masters who saw her in paris presented to the favorable criticism of that most fastidious man the late emperor said that she was stunning but a big discount on what she was at madrono hollow  it was still early morning but the sun with california extravagance had already begun to beat hotly on the little chip hat and blue ribbons and miss jo was obliged to seek the shade of a bypath here she received the timid advances of a vagabond yellow dog graciously until emboldened by his success he insisted upon accompanying her and becoming slobberingly demonstrative threatened her spotless skirt with his dusty paws when she drove him from her with some slight acerbity and a stone which haply fell within fifty feet of its destined mark having thus proved her ability to defend herself with characteristic inconsistency she took a small panic and gathering her white skirts in one hand and holding the brim of her hat over her eyes with the other she ran swiftly at least a hundred yards before she stopped then she began picking some ferns and a few wildflowers still spared to the withered fields and then a sudden distrust of her small ankles seized her and she inspected them narrowly for those burrs and bugs and snakes which are supposed to lie in wait for helpless womanhood then she plucked some golden heads of wild oats and with a sudden inspiration placed them in her black hair and then came quite unconsciously upon the trail leading to madrono hollow  here she hesitated before her ran the little trail vanishing at last into the bosky depths below the sun was very hot she must be very far from home why should she not rest awhile under the shade of a madrono  she answered these questions by going there at once after thoroughly exploring the grove and satisfying herself that it contained no other living human creature she sat down under one of the largest trees with a satisfactory little sigh miss jo loved the madrono it was a cleanly tree no dust ever lay upon its varnished leaves its immaculate shade never was known to harbor grub or insect  she looked up at the rosy arms interlocked and arched above her head she looked down at the delicate ferns and cryptogams at her feet something glittered at the root of the tree she picked it up it was a bracelet she examined it carefully for cipher or inscription there was none she could not resist a natural desire to clasp it on her arm and to survey it from that advantageous viewpoint this absorbed her attention for some moments and when she looked up again she beheld at a little distance culpepper starbottle  he was standing where he had halted with instinctive delicacy on first discovering her indeed he had even deliberated whether he ought not to go away without disturbing her but some fascination held him to the spot wonderful power of humanity far beyond jutted an outlying spur of the sierra vast compact and silent scarcely a hundred yards away a leaguelong chasm dropped its sheer walls of granite a thousand feet on every side rose up the serried ranks of pinetrees in whose closeset files centuries of storm and change had wrought no breach yet all this seemed to culpepper to have been planned by an allwise providence as the natural background to the figure of a pretty girl in a yellow dress  although miss jo had confidently expected to meet culpepper somewhere in her ramble now that he came upon her suddenly she felt disappointed and embarrassed his manner too was more than usually grave and serious and more than ever seemed to jar upon that audacious levity which was this giddy girls power and security in a society where all feeling was dangerous as he approached her she rose to her feet but almost before she knew it he had taken her hand and drawn her to a seat beside him this was not what miss jo had expected but nothing is so difficult to predicate as the exact preliminaries of a declaration of love  what did culpepper say nothing i fear that will add anything to the wisdom of the reader nothing i fear that miss jo had not heard substantially from other lips before but there was a certain conviction firespeed and fury in the manner that was deliciously novel to the young lady it was certainly something to be courted in the nineteenth century with all the passion and extravagance of the sixteenth it was something to hear amid the slang of a frontier society the language of knighterrantry poured into her ear by this lanternjawed darkbrowed descendant of the cavaliers  i do not know that there was anything more in it the facts however go to show that at a certain point miss jo dropped her glove and that in recovering it culpepper possessed himself first of her hand and then her lips when they stood up to go culpepper had his arm around her waist and her black hair with its sheaf of golden oats rested against the breast pocket of his coat but even then i do not think her fancy was entirely captive she took a certain satisfaction in this demonstration of culpeppers splendid height and mentally compared it with a former flame one lieutenant mcmirk an active but undersized hector who subsequently fell a victim to the incautiously composed and monotonous beverages of a frontier garrison nor was she so much preoccupied but that her quick eyes even while absorbing culpeppers glances were yet able to detect at a distance the figure of a man approaching in an instant she slipped out of culpeppers arm and whipping her hands behind her said theres that horrid man  culpepper looked up and beheld his respected uncle panting and blowing over the hill his brow contracted as he turned to miss jo you dont like my uncle  i hate him miss jo was recovering her ready tongue  culpepper blushed he would have liked to enter upon some details of the colonels pedigree and exploits but there was not time he only smiled sadly the smile melted miss jo she held out her hand quickly and said with even more than her usual effrontery dont let that man get you into any trouble take care of yourself dear and dont let anything happen to you  miss jo intended this speech to be pathetic the tenure of life among her lovers had hitherto been very uncertain culpepper turned toward her but she had already vanished in the thicket  the colonel came up panting ive looked all over town for you and be dashed to you sir who was that with you  a lady culpepper never lied but he was discreet  dm em all look yar culp ive spotted the man who gave the order to put me off the floor flo was what the colonel said the other night  who was it asked culpepper listlessly  jack folinsbee  who  why the son of that dashed niggerworshipping psalmsinging puritan yankee whats the matter now look yar culp you aint goin back on your blood ar ye you aint goin back on your word ye aint going down at the feet of this trash like a whipped hound  culpepper was silent he was very white presently he looked up and said quietly no   culpepper starbottle had challenged jack folinsbee and the challenge was accepted the cause alleged was the expelling of culpeppers uncle from the floor of the assembly ball by the order of folinsbee this much madrono hollow knew and could swear to but there were other strange rumors afloat of which the blacksmith was an able expounder you see gentlemen he said to the crowd gathered around his anvil i aint got no theory of this affair i only give a few facts as have come to my knowledge culpepper and jack meets quite accidental like in bobs saloon jack goes up to culpepper and says a word with you culpepper bows and steps aside in this way jack standing about here the blacksmith demonstrates the position of the parties with two old horseshoes on the anvil jack pulls a bracelet from his pocket and says do you know that bracelet culpepper says i do not quite coollike and easy jack says you gave it to my sister culpepper says still cool as you please i did not jack says you lie gd dmn you and draws his derringer culpepper jumps forward about here reference is made to the diagram and jack fires nobody hit its a mighty curos thing gentlemen continued the blacksmith dropping suddenly into the abstract and leaning meditatively on his anvilits a mighty curos thing that nobody gets hit so often you and me empties our revolvers sociably at each other over a little game and the room full and nobody gets hit thats what gets me  never mind thompson chimed in bill masters theres another and a better world where we shall know all that andbecome better shots go on with your story  well some grabs culpepper and some grabs jack and so separates them then jack tells em as how he had seen his sister wear a bracelet which he knew was one that had been given to dolores by colonel starbottle that miss jo wouldnt say where she got it but owned up to having seen culpepper that day then the most curos thing of it yet what does culpepper do but rise up and takes all back that he said and allows that he did give her the bracelet now my opinion gentlemen is that he lied it aint like that man to give a gal that he respects anything off of that piece dolores but its all the same now and theres but one thing to be done  the way this one thing was done belongs to the record of madrono hollow the morning was bright and clear the air was slightly chill but that was from the mist which arose along the banks of the river as early as six oclock the designated grounda little opening in the madrono grovewas occupied by culpepper starbottle colonel starbottle his second and the surgeon the colonel was exalted and excited albeit in a rather imposing dignified way and pointed out to the surgeon the excellence of the ground which at that hour was wholly shaded from the sun whose steady stare is more or less discomposing to your duellist the surgeon threw himself on the grass and smoked his cigar culpepper quiet and thoughtful leaned against a tree and gazed up the river there was a strange suggestion of a picnic about the group which was heightened when the colonel drew a bottle from his coattails and taking a preliminary draught offered it to the others cocktails sir he explained with dignified precision a gentleman sir should never go out without em keeps off the morning chill i remember going out in 53 with hank boompirater good ged sir the man had to put on his overcoat and was shot in it fact  but the noise of wheels drowned the colonels reminiscences and a rapidly driven buggy containing jack folinsbee calhoun bungstarter his second and bill masters drew up on the ground jack folinsbee leaped out gayly i had the jolliest work to get away without the governors hearing he began addressing the group before him with the greatest volubility calhoun bungstarter touched his arm and the young man blushed it was his first duel  if you are ready gentlemen said mr bungstarter we had better proceed to business i believe it is understood that no apology will be offered or accepted we may as well settle preliminaries at once or i fear we shall be interrupted there is a rumor in town that the vigilance committee are seeking our friends the starbottles and i believe as their fellowcountryman i have the honor to be included in their warrant  at this probability of interruption that gravity which had hitherto been wanting fell upon the group the preliminaries were soon arranged and the principals placed in position then there was a silence  to a spectator from the hill impressed with the picnic suggestion what might have been the popping of two champagne corks broke the stillness  culpepper had fired in the air colonel starbottle uttered a low curse jack folinsbee sulkily demanded another shot  again the parties stood opposed to each other again the word was given and what seemed to be the simultaneous report of both pistols rose upon the air but after an interval of a few seconds all were surprised to see culpepper slowly raise his unexploded weapon and fire it harmlessly above his head then throwing the pistol upon the ground he walked to a tree and leaned silently against it  jack folinsbee flew into a paroxysm of fury colonel starbottle raved and swore mr bungstarter was properly shocked at their conduct really gentlemen if mr culpepper starbottle declines another shot i do not see how we can proceed  but the colonels blood was up and jack folinsbee was equally implacable a hurried consultation ensued which ended by colonel starbottle taking his nephews place as principal bill masters acting as second vice mr bungstarter who declined all further connection with the affair  two distinct reports rang through the hollow jack folinsbee dropped his smoking pistol took a step forward and then dropped heavily upon his face  in a moment the surgeon was at his side the confusion was heightened by the trampling of hoofs and the voice of the blacksmith bidding them flee for their lives before the coming storm a moment more and the ground was cleared and the surgeon looking up beheld only the white face of culpepper bending over him  can you save him  i cannot say hold up his head a moment while i run to the buggy  culpepper passed his arm tenderly around the neck of the insensible man presently the surgeon returned with some stimulants  there that will do mr starbottle thank you now my advice is to get away from here while you can ill look after folinsbee do you hear  culpeppers arm was still round the neck of his late foe but his head had drooped and fallen on the wounded mans shoulder the surgeon looked down and catching sight of his face stooped and lifted him gently in his arms he opened his coat and waistcoat there was blood upon his shirt and a bullethole in his breast he had been shot unto death at the first fire     the poet of sierra flat   as the enterprising editor of the sierra flat record stood at his case setting type for his next weeks paper he could not help hearing the woodpeckers who were busy on the roof above his head it occurred to him that possibly the birds had not yet learned to recognize in the rude structure any improvement on nature and this idea pleased him so much that he incorporated it in the editorial article which he was then doubly composing for the editor was also printer of the record and although that remarkable journal was reputed to exert a power felt through all calaveras and a greater part of tuolumne county strict economy was one of the conditions of its beneficent existence  thus preoccupied he was startled by the sudden irruption of a small roll of manuscript which was thrown through the open door and fell at his feet he walked quickly to the threshold and looked down the tangled trail which led to the highroad but there was nothing to suggest the presence of his mysterious contributor a hare limped slowly away a greenandgold lizard paused upon a pine stump the woodpeckers ceased their work so complete had been his sylvan seclusion that he found it difficult to connect any human agency with the act rather the hare seemed to have an inexpressibly guilty look the woodpeckers to maintain a significant silence and the lizard to be consciencestricken into stone  an examination of the manuscript however corrected this injustice to defenceless nature it was evidently of human originbeing verse and of exceeding bad quality the editor laid it aside as he did so he thought he saw a face at the window sallying out in some indignation he penetrated the surrounding thicket in every direction but his search was as fruitless as before the poet if it were he was gone  a few days after this the editorial seclusion was invaded by voices of alternate expostulation and entreaty stepping to the door the editor was amazed at beholding mr morgan mccorkle a wellknown citizen of angelo and a subscriber to the record in the act of urging partly by force and partly by argument an awkward young man toward the building when he had finally effected his object and as it were safely landed his prize in a chair mr mccorkle took off his hat carefully wiped the narrow isthmus of forehead which divided his black brows from his stubby hair and with an explanatory wave of his hand toward his reluctant companion said a borned poet and the cussedest fool you ever seed  accepting the editors smile as a recognition of the introduction mr mccorkle panted and went on didnt want to come mister editor dont went to see me morg sez he milt sez i he do a borned poet like you and a gifted genius like he oughter come together sociable and i fetched him ah will yer the born poet had after exhibiting signs of great distress started to run but mr mccorkle was down upon him instantly seizing him by his long linen coat and settled him back in his chair taint no use stampeding yer ye are and yer ye stays for yer a borned poetef ye are as shy as a jackass rabbit look at im now  he certainly was not an attractive picture there was hardly a notable feature in his weak face except his eyes which were moist and shy and not unlike the animal to which mr mccorkle had compared him it was the face that the editor had seen at the window  knowed him for fower yearsince he war a boy continued mr mccorkle in a loud whisper allers the same bless you can jerk a rhyme as easy as turnin jack never had any eddication lived out in missooray all his life but hes chock full o poetry ony this mornin sez i to himhe camps along o memilt sez i are breakfast ready and he up and answers back quite peert and chipper the breakfast it is ready and the birds is singing free and its risin in the dawnin light is happiness to me when a man said mr mccorkle dropping his voice with deep solemnity gets off things like them without any call to do it and handlin flapjacks over a cookstove at the same timethat mans a borned poet  there was an awkward pause mr mccorkle beamed patronizingly on his protege the born poet looked as if he were meditating another flightnot a metaphorical one the editor asked if he could do anything for them  in course you can responded mr mccorkle thats jest it milt wheres that poetry  the editors countenance fell as the poet produced from his pocket a roll of manuscript he however took it mechanically and glanced over it it was evidently a duplicate of the former mysterious contribution  the editor then spoke briefly but earnestly i regret that i cannot recall his exact words but it appeared that never before in the history of the record had the pressure been so great upon its columns matters of paramount importance deeply affecting the material progress of sierra questions touching the absolute integrity of calaveras and tuolumne as social communities were even now waiting expression weeks nay months must elapse before that pressure would be removed and the record could grapple with any but the sternest of topics again the editor had noticed with pain the absolute decline of poetry in the foothills of the sierras even the works of byron and moore attracted no attention in dutch flat and a prejudice seemed to exist against tennyson in grass valley but the editor was not without hope for the future in the course of four or five years when the country was settled  what would be the cost to print this yer interrupted mr mccorkle quietly  about fifty dollars as an advertisement responded the editor with cheerful alacrity  mr mccorkle placed the sum in the editors hand yer see thets what i sez to milt milt sez i pay as you go for you are a borned poet hevin no call to write but doin it free and spontaneous like in course you pays thets why mr editor never printed your poetry  what name shall i put to it asked the editor  milton  it was the first word that the born poet had spoken during the interview and his voice was so very sweet and musical that the editor looked at him curiously and wondered if he had a sister  milton is that all  thets his furst name exclaimed mr mccorkle  the editor here suggested that as there had been another poet of that name  milt might be took for him thets bad reflected mr mccorkle with simple gravity well put down his hull namemilton chubbuck  the editor made a note of the fact ill set it up now he said this was also a hint that the interview was ended the poet and patron arm in arm drew towards the door in next weeks paper said the editor smilingly in answer to the childlike look of inquiry in the eyes of the poet and in another moment they were gone  the editor was as good as his word he straightway betook himself to his case and unrolling the manuscript began his task the woodpeckers on the roof recommenced theirs and in a few moments the former sylvan seclusion was restored there was no sound in the barren barnlike room but the birds above and below the click of the composingrule as the editor marshalled the types into lines in his stick and arrayed them in solid column on the galley whatever might have been his opinion of the copy before him there was no indication of it in his face which wore the stolid indifference of his craft perhaps this was unfortunate for as the day wore on and the level rays of the sun began to pierce the adjacent thicket they sought out and discovered an anxious ambushed figure drawn up beside the editors windowa figure that had sat there motionless for hours within the editor worked on as steadily and impassively as fate and without the born poet of sierra flat sat and watched him as waiting its decree   the effect of the poem on sierra flat was remarkable and unprecedented the absolute vileness of its doggerel the gratuitous imbecility of its thought and above all the crowning audacity of the fact that it was the work of a citizen and published in the county paper brought it instantly into popularity for many months calaveras had languished for a sensation since the last vigilance committee nothing had transpired to dispel the listless ennui begotten of stagnant business and growing civilization in more prosperous moments the office of the record would have been simply gutted and the editor deported at present the paper was in such demand that the edition was speedily exhausted in brief the poem of mr milton chubbuck came like a special providence to sierra flat it was read by campfires in lonely cabins in flaring barrooms and noisy saloons and declaimed from the boxes of stagecoaches it was sung in poker flat with the addition of a local chorus and danced as an unhallowed rhythmic dance by the pyrrhic phalanx of one horse gulch known as the festive stags of calaveras some unhappy ambiguities of expression gave rise to many new readings notes and commentaries which i regret to state were more often marked by ingenuity than delicacy of thought or expression  never before did poet acquire such sudden local reputation from the seclusion of mccorkles cabin and the obscurity of culinary labors he was haled forth into the glowing sunshine of fame the name of chubbuck was written in letters of chalk on unpainted walls and carved with a pick on the sides of tunnels a drink known variously as the chubbuck tranquillizer or the chubbuck exalter was dispensed at the bars for some weeks a rude design for a chubbuck statue made up of illustrations from circus and melodeon posters representing the genius of calaveras in brief skirts on a flying steed in the act of crowning the poet chubbuck was visible at keelers ferry the poet himself was overborne with invitations to drink and extravagant congratulations the meeting between colonel starbottle of siskyion and chubbuck as previously arranged by our boston late of roaring camp is said to have been indescribably affecting the colonel embraced him unsteadily i could not return to my constituents at siskyion sir if this hand which has grasped that of the gifted prentice and the lamented poe should not have been honored by the touch of the godlike chubbuck gentlemen american literature is looking up thank you i will take sugar in mine it was boston who indited letters of congratulations from h w longfellow tennyson and browning to mr chubbuck deposited them in the sierra flat postoffice and obligingly consented to dictate the replies  the simple faith and unaffected delight with which these manifestations were received by the poet and his patron might have touched the hearts of these grim masters of irony but for the sudden and equal development in both of the variety of weak natures mr mccorkle basked in the popularity of his protege and became alternately supercilious or patronizing toward the dwellers of sierra flat while the poet with hair carefully oiled and curled and bedecked with cheap jewelry and flaunting neckhandkerchief paraded himself before the single hotel as may be imagined this new disclosure of weakness afforded intense satisfaction to sierra flat gave another lease of popularity to the poet and suggested another idea to the facetious boston  at that time a young lady popularly and professionally known as the california pet was performing to enthusiastic audiences in the interior her specialty lay in the personation of youthful masculine character as a gamin of the street she was irresistible as a negrodancer she carried the honest miners heart by storm a saucy pretty brunette she had preserved a wonderful moral reputation even under the jovelike advances of showers of gold that greeted her appearance on the stage at sierra flat a prominent and delighted member of that audience was milton chubbuck he attended every night every day he lingered at the door of the union hotel for a glimpse of the california pet it was not long before he received a note from herin bostons most popular and approved female handacknowledging his admiration it was not long before boston was called upon to indite a suitable reply at last in furtherance of his facetious design it became necessary for boston to call upon the young actress herself and secure her personal participation to her he unfolded a plan the successful carrying out of which he felt would secure his fame to posterity as a practical humorist the california pets black eyes sparkled approvingly and mischievously she only stipulated that she should see the man firsta concession to her feminine weakness which years of dancing juba and wearing trousers and boots had not wholly eradicated from her wilful breast by all means it should be done and the interview was arranged for the next week  it must not be supposed that during this interval of popularity mr chubbuck had been unmindful of his poetic qualities a certain portion of each day he was absent from towna communin with natur as mr mccorkle expressed itand actually wandering in the mountain trails or lying on his back under the trees or gathering fragrant herbs and the brightcolored berries of the marzanita these and his company he generally brought to the editors office late in the afternoon often to that enterprising journalists infinite weariness quiet and uncommunicative he would sit there patiently watching him at his work until the hour for closing the office arrived when he would as quietly depart there was something so humble and unobtrusive in these visits that the editor could not find it in his heart to deny them and accepting them like the woodpeckers as a part of his sylvan surroundings often forgot even his presence once or twice moved by some beauty of expression in the moist shy eyes he felt like seriously admonishing his visitor of his idle folly but his glance falling upon the oiled hair and the gorgeous necktie he invariably thought better of it the case was evidently hopeless  the interview between mr chubbuck and the california pet took place in a private room of the union hotel propriety being respected by the presence of that archhumorist boston to this gentleman we are indebted for the only true account of the meeting however reticent mr chubbuck might have been in the presence of his own sex toward the fairer portion of humanity he was like most poets exceedingly voluble accustomed as the california pet had been to excessive compliment she was fairly embarrassed by the extravagant praises of her visitor her personation of boy characters her dancing of the champion jig were particularly dwelt upon with fervid but unmistakable admiration at last recovering her audacity and emboldened by the presence of boston the california pet electrified her hearers by demanding half jestingly half viciously if it were as a boy or a girl that she was the subject of his flattering admiration  that knocked him out o time said the delighted boston in his subsequent account of the interview but do you believe the dd fool actually asked her to take him with her wanted to engage in the company  the plan as briefly unfolded by boston was to prevail upon mr chubbuck to make his appearance in costume already designed and prepared by the inventor before a sierra flat audience and recite an original poem at the hall immediately on the conclusion of the california pets performance at a given signal the audience were to rise and deliver a volley of unsavory articles previously provided by the originator of the scheme then a select few were to rush on the stage seize the poet and after marching him in triumphal procession through town were to deposit him beyond its uttermost limits with strict injunctions never to enter it again to the first part of the plan the poet was committed for the latter portion it was easy enough to find participants  the eventful night came and with it an audience that packed the long narrow room with one dense mass of human beings the california pet never had been so joyous so reckless so fascinating and audacious before but the applause was tame and weak compared to the ironical outburst that greeted the second rising of the curtain and the entrance of the born poet of sierra flat then there was a hush of expectancy and the poet stepped to the footlights and stood with his manuscript in his hand  his face was deadly pale either there was some suggestion of his fate in the faces of his audience or some mysterious instinct told him of his danger he attempted to speak but faltered tottered and staggered to the wings  fearful of losing his prey boston gave the signal and leaped upon the stage but at the same moment a light figure darted from behind the scenes and delivering a kick that sent the discomfited humorist back among the musicians cut a pigeonwing executed a doubleshuffle and then advancing to the footlights with that inimitable look that audacious swagger and utter abandon which had so thrilled and fascinated them a moment before uttered the characteristic speech wot are you goin to hit a man fur when hes down saay  the look the drawl the action the readiness and above all the downright courage of the little woman had its effect a roar of sympathetic applause followed the act cut and run while you can she whispered hurriedly over her one shoulder without altering the others attitude of pert and saucy defiance toward the audience but even as she spoke the poet tottered and sank fainting upon the stage then she threw a despairing whisper behind the scenes ring down the curtain  there was a slight movement of opposition in the audience but among them rose the burly shoulders of yuba bill the tall erect figure of henry york of sandy bar and the colorless determined face of john oakhurst the curtain came down  behind it knelt the california pet beside the prostrate poet bring me some water run for a doctor stop clear out all of you  she had unloosed the gaudy cravat and opened the shirtcollar of the insensible figure before her then she burst into an hysterical laugh  manuela  her tiringwoman a mexican halfbreed came toward her  help me with him to my dressingroom quick then stand outside and wait if any one questions you tell them hes gone do you hear hes gone  the old woman did as she was bade in a few moments the audience had departed before morning so also had the california pet manuela andthe poet of sierra flat  but alas with them also had departed the fair fame of the california pet only a few and these it is to be feared of not the best moral character themselves still had faith in the stainless honor of their favorite actress it was a mighty foolish thing to do but itll all come out right yet on the other hand a majority gave her full credit and approbation for her undoubted pluck and gallantry but deplored that she should have thrown it away upon a worthless object to elect for a lover the despised and ridiculed vagrant of sierra flat who had not even the manliness to stand up in his own defence was not only evidence of inherent moral depravity but was an insult to the community colonel starbottle saw in it only another instance of the extreme frailty of the sex he had known similar cases and remembered distinctly sir how a wellknown philadelphia heiress one of the finest women that ever rode in her kerridge that gad sir had thrown over a southern member of congress to consort with a dd nigger the colonel had also noticed a singular look in the dogs eye which he did not entirely fancy he would not say anything against the lady sir but he had noticedand here haply the colonel became so mysterious and darkly confidential as to be unintelligible and inaudible to the bystanders  a few days after the disappearance of mr chubbuck a singular report reached sierra flat and it was noticed that boston who since the failure of his elaborate joke had been even more depressed in spirits than is habitual with great humorists suddenly found that his presence was required in san francisco but as yet nothing but the vaguest surmises were afloat and nothing definite was known  it was a pleasant afternoon when the editor of the sierra flat record looked up from his case and beheld the figure of mr morgan mccorkle standing in the doorway there was a distressed look on the face of that worthy gentleman that at once enlisted the editors sympathizing attention he held an open letter in his hand as he advanced toward the middle of the room  as a man as has allers borne a fair reputation began mr mccorkle slowly i should like if so be as i could mister editor to make a correction in the columns of your valooable paper  mr editor begged him to proceed  ye may not disremember that about a month ago i fetched here what so be as well call a young man whose name might be as it were miltonmilton chubbuck  mr editor remembered perfectly  thet same party id knowed better nor fower year two on em campin out together not that id known him all the time fur he war shy and strange at spells and had odd ways that i took war natral to a borned poet ye may remember that i said he was a borned poet  the editor distinctly did  i picked this same party up in st jo takin a fancy to his face and kinder calklating hed runnd away from homefor im a married man mr editor and hev children of my ownand thinkin belike he was a borned poet  well said the editor  and as i said before i should like now to make a correction in the columns of your valooable paper  what correction asked the editor  i said ef you remember my words as how he was a borned poet  yes  from statements in this yer letter it seems as how i war wrong  well  she war a woman     the christmas gift that came to rupert   a story for little soldiers   it was the christmas season in californiaa season of falling rain and springing grasses there were intervals when through driving clouds and flying scud the sun visited the haggard hills with a miracle and death and resurrection were as one and out of the very throes of decay a joyous life struggled outward and upward even the storms that swept down the dead leaves nurtured the tender buds that took their places there were no episodes of snowy silence over the quickening fields the farmers ploughshare hard followed the furrows left by the latest rains perhaps it was for this reason that the christmas evergreens which decorated the drawingroom took upon themselves a foreign aspect and offered a weird contrast to the roses seen dimly through the windows as the southwest wind beat their soft faces against the panes   now said the doctor drawing his chair closer to the fire and looking mildly but firmly at the semicircle of flaxen heads around him i want it distinctly understood before i begin my story that i am not to be interrupted by any ridiculous questions at the first one i shall stop at the second i shall feel it my duty to administer a dose of castoroil all around the boy that moves his legs or arms will be understood to invite amputation i have brought my instruments with me and never allow pleasure to interfere with my business do you promise  yes sir said six small voices simultaneously the volley was however followed by half a dozen dropping questions  silence bob put your feet down and stop rattling that sword flora shall sit by my side like a little lady and be an example to the rest fung tang shall stay too if he likes now turn down the gas a little there that will dojust enough to make the fire look brighter and to show off the christmas candles silence everybody the boy who cracks an almond or breathes too loud over his raisins will be put out of the room  there was a profound silence bob laid his sword tenderly aside and nursed his leg thoughtfully flora after coquettishly adjusting the pocket of her little apron put her arm upon the doctors shoulder and permitted herself to be drawn beside him fung tang the little heathen page who was permitted on this rare occasion to share the christian revels in the drawingroom surveyed the group with a smile that was at once sweet and philosophical the light ticking of a french clock on the mantel supported by a young shepherdess of bronze complexion and great symmetry of limb was the only sound that disturbed the christmaslike peace of the apartmenta peace which held the odors of evergreens new toys cedarboxes glue and varnish in an harmonious combination that passed all understanding  about four years ago at this time began the doctor i attended a course of lectures in a certain city one of the professors who was a sociable kindly manthough somewhat practical and hardheadedinvited me to his house on christmas night i was very glad to go as i was anxious to see one of his sons who though only twelve years old was said to be very clever i dare not tell you how many latin verses this little fellow could recite or how many english ones he had composed in the first place youd want me to repeat them secondly im not a judge of poetry latin or english but there were judges who said they were wonderful for a boy and everybody predicted a splendid future for him everybody but his father he shook his head doubtingly whenever it was mentioned for as i have told you he was a practical matteroffact man  there was a pleasant party at the professors that night all the children of the neighborhood were there and among them the professors clever son rupert as they called hima thin little chap about as tall as bobby there and as fair and delicate as flora by my side his health was feeble his father said he seldom ran about and played with other boys preferring to stay at home and brood over his books and compose what he called his verses  well we had a christmastree just like this and we had been laughing and talking calling off the names of the children who had presents on the tree and everybody was very happy and joyous when one of the children suddenly uttered a cry of mingled surprise and hilarity and said heres something for rupert and what do you think it is  we all guessed a desk a copy of milton a gold pen a rhyming dictionary no what then  a drum  a what asked everybody  a drum with ruperts name on it  sure enough there it was a goodsized bright new brassbound drum with a slip of paper on it with the inscription for rupert  of course we all laughed and thought it a good joke you see youre to make a noise in the world rupert said one heres parchment for the poet said another ruperts last work in sheepskin covers said a third give us a classical tune rupert said a fourth and so on but rupert seemed too mortified to speak he changed color bit his lips and finally burst into a passionate fit of crying and left the room then those who had joked him felt ashamed and everybody began to ask who had put the drum there but no one knew or if they did the unexpected sympathy awakened for the sensitive boy kept them silent even the servants were called up and questioned but no one could give any idea where it came from and what was still more singular everybody declared that up to the moment it was produced no one had seen it hanging on the tree what do i think well i have my own opinion but no questions enough for you to know that rupert did not come down stairs again that night and the party soon after broke up  i had almost forgotten those things for the war of the rebellion broke out the next spring and i was appointed surgeon in one of the new regiments and was on my way to the seat of war but i had to pass through the city where the professor lived and there i met him my first question was about rupert the professor shook his head sadly hes not so well he said he has been declining since last christmas when you saw him a very strange case he added giving it a long latin namea very singular case but go and see him yourself he urged it may distract his mind and do him good  i went accordingly to the professors house and found rupert lying on a sofa propped up with pillows around him were scattered his books and what seemed in singular contrast that drum i told you about was hanging on a nail just above his head his face was thin and wasted there was a red spot on either cheek and his eyes were very bright and widely opened he was glad to see me and when i told him where i was going he asked a thousand questions about the war i thought i had thoroughly diverted his mind from its sick and languid fancies when he suddenly grasped my hand and drew me toward him  doctor said he in a low whisper you wont laugh at me if i tell you something  no certainly not i said  you remember that drum he said pointing to the glittering toy that hung against the wall you know too how it came to me a few weeks after christmas i was lying half asleep here and the drum was hanging on the wall when suddenly i heard it beaten at first low and slowly then faster and louder until its rolling filled the house in the middle of the night i heard it again i did not dare to tell anybody about it but i have heard it every night ever since  he paused and looked anxiously in my face sometimes he continued it is played softly sometimes loudly but always quickening to a longroll so loud and alarming that i have looked to see people coming into my room to ask what was the matter but i think doctori think he repeated slowly looking up with painful interest into my face that no one hears it but myself  i thought so too but i asked him if he had heard it at any other time  once or twice in the daytime he replied when i have been reading or writing then very loudly as though it were angry and tried in that way to attract my attention away from my books  i looked into his face and placed my hand upon his pulse his eyes were very bright and his pulse a little flurried and quick i then tried to explain to him that he was very weak and that his senses were very acute as most weak peoples are and how that when he read or grew interested and excited or when he was tired at night the throbbing of a big artery made the beating sound he heard he listened to me with a sad smile of unbelief but thanked me and in a little while i went away but as i was going down stairs i met the professor i gave him my opinion of the casewell no matter what it was  he wants fresh air and exercise said the professor and some practical experience of life sir the professor was not a bad man but he was a little worried and impatient and thoughtas clever people are apt to thinkthat things which he didnt understand were either silly or improper  i left the city that very day and in the excitement of battlefields and hospitals i forgot all about little rupert nor did i hear of him again until one day meeting an old classmate in the army who had known the professor he told me that rupert had become quite insane and that in one of his paroxysms he had escaped from the house and as he had never been found it was feared that he had fallen in the river and was drowned i was terribly shocked for the moment as you may imagine but dear me i was living just then among scenes as terrible and shocking and i had little time to spare to mourn over poor rupert  it was not long after receiving this intelligence that we had a terrible battle in which a portion of our army was surprised and driven back with great slaughter i was detached from my brigade to ride over to the battlefield and assist the surgeons of the beaten division who had more on their hands than they could attend to when i reached the barn that served for a temporary hospital i went at once to work ah bob said the doctor thoughtfully taking the bright sword from the hands of the halffrightened bob and holding it gravely before him these pretty playthings are symbols of cruel ugly realities  i turned to a tall stout vermonter he continued very slowly tracing a pattern on the rug with the point of the scabbard who was badly wounded in both thighs but he held up his hands and begged me to help others first who needed it more than he i did not at first heed his request for this kind of unselfishness was very common in the army but he went on for gods sake doctor leave me here there is a drummerboy of our regimenta mere childdying if he isnt dead now go and see him first he lies over there he saved more than one life he was at his post in the panic this morning and saved the honor of the regiment i was so much more impressed by the mans manner than by the substance of his speech which was however corroborated by the other poor fellows stretched around me that i passed over to where the drummer lay with his drum beside him i gave one glance at his faceandyes bobyes my childrenit was rupert  well well it needed not the chalked cross which my brothersurgeons had left upon the rough board whereon he lay to show how urgent was the relief he sought it needed not the prophetic words of the vermonter nor the damp that mingled with the brown curls that clung to his pale forehead to show how hopeless it was now i called him by name he opened his eyeslarger i thought in the new vision that was beginning to dawn upon himand recognized me he whispered im glad you are come but i dont think you can do me any good  i could not tell him a lie i could not say anything i only pressed his hand in mine as he went on  but you will see father and ask him to forgive me nobody is to blame but myself it was a long time before i understood why the drum came to me that christmas night and why it kept calling to me every night and what it said i know it now the work is done and i am content tell father it is better as it is i should have lived only to worry and perplex him and something in me tells me this is right  he lay still for a moment and then grasping my hand said  hark  i listened but heard nothing but the suppressed moans of the wounded men around me the drum he said faintly dont you hear it the drum is calling me  he reached out his arm to where it lay as though he would embrace it  listen he went on its the reveille there are the ranks drawn up in review dont you see the sunlight flash down the long line of bayonets their faces are shiningthey present armsthere comes the general but his face i cannot look at for the glory round his head he sees me he smiles it is and with a name upon his lips that he had learned long ago he stretched himself wearily upon the planks and lay quite still   thats all no questions now never mind what became of the drum whos that snivelling bless my soul wheres my pillbox
