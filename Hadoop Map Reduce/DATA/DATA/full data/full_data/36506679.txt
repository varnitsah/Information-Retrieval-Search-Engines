36506679	the burgess animal book for children  thornton w burgess    to the cause of wild life in america especially the mammals many of which are seriously threatened with extinction this book is dedicated    preface  the cordial reception given the burgess bird book for children together with numerous letters to the author asking for information on the habits and characteristics of many of the mammals of america led to the preparation of this volume it is offered merely as an introduction to the fourfooted friends little and big which form so important a part of the wild life of the united states and canada  there has been no attempt to describe or classify subspecies that is for the scientist and student with specific interests the purpose of this book is to acquaint the reader with the larger groupsorders families and divisions of the latter so that typical representatives may be recognized and their habits understood  instead of the word mammal the word animal has been used throughout as having a better defined meaning to the average child  a conscientious effort to avoid technical terms and descriptions has been made that there may be nothing to confuse the young mind clarity and simplicity have been the objects kept constantly in view  at the same time the utmost care to be accurate in the smallest details has been exercised to this end the works of leading authorities on american mammals have been carefully consulted and compared no statements which are not confirmed by two or more naturalists of recognized standing have been made  in this research work the writings of audubon and bachman dr ew neson dr c hart merriam dr wt hornaday ernest thompson seton and others together with the bulletins of the biological survey of the department of agriculture at washington have been of the greatest value i herewith acknowledge my debt to these  whatever the text may lack in clearness of description will be amply compensated for by the wonderful drawings in color and blackanwhite by mr louis agassiz fuertes the artistnaturalist whoese hearty cooperation has been a source of great help to me these drawings were made especially for this book and add in no small degree to such value as it may possess  if the reading of these pages shall lead even a few to an active interest in our wild animals stimulating a desire to preserve and protect a priceless heritage from the past which a heedless present threatens through wanton and reckless waste to deny the future the labor will have been well worth while  only through intimate acquaintance may understanding of the animals in their relations to each other and to man be attained  to serve as a medium for this purpose this book has been written  as such i offer it to the children of america conscious of its shortcomings yet hopeful that it will prove of some value in acquainting them with their friends and minethe animals of field and wood of mountain and desert in the truest sense the

as sure as youre alive now peter rabbit some day i will catch you snarled reddy fox as he poked his black nose in the hole between the roots of the big hickorytree which grows close to the smiling pool  it is lucky for you that you were not one jump farther away from this hole  peter safe inside that hole didnt have a word to say or if he did he didnt have breath enough to say it  it was quite true that if he had been one jump farther from that hole reddy fox would have caught him  as it was the hairs on peters funny white tail actually had tickled reddys back as peter plunged frantically through the rootbound entrance to that hole  it had been the narrowest escape peter had had for a long long time you see reddy fox had surprised peter nibbling sweet clover on the bank of the smiling pond and it had been a lucky thing for peter that that hole dug long ago by johnny chucks grandfather had been right where it was  also it was a lucky thing that old mr chuck had been wise enough to make the entrance between the  roots of that tree in such a way that it could not be dug any larger  reddy fox was too shrewd to waste any time trying to dig it larger he knew there wasnt room enough for him to get between those roots so after trying to make peter as uncomfortable as possible by telling him what he reddy would do to him when he did catch him reddy trotted off across the green meadows  peter remained where he was for a long time when he was quite sure that it was safe to do so he crept out and hurried lippertylippertylip up to the old orchard  he felt that that would be the safest place for him because there were ever so many hiding places in the old stone wall along the edge of it  when peter reached the old orchard who should he see but jenny wren  jenny had arrived that very morning from the sunny south where she had spent the winter  tut tut tut tut tut exclaimed jenny as soon as she saw peter  if here isnt peter rabbit himself  how did you manage to keep out of the clutches of reddy fox all the long winter  peter chuckled  i didnt have much trouble with reddy during the winter said he but this very morning he so nearly caught me that it is a wonder that my hair is not snow white from fright then he told jenny all about his narrow escape  had it not been for that handy hole of grandfather chuck i couldnt possibly have escaped concluded peter  jenny wren cocked her pert little head on one side and her sharp little eyes snapped  why dont you learn to swim peter like your cousin down in the sunny south she demanded  if he had been in your place he would simply have plunged into the smiling pool and laughed at reddy fox  peter sat bolt upright with his eyes very wide open  in them was a funny look of surprise as he stared up at jenny wren  what are you talking about jenny wren he demanded  dont you know that none of the rabbit family swim unless it is to cross the laughing brook when there is no other way of getting to the other side or when actually driven into the water by an enemy from whom there is no other escape  i can swim a little if i have to but you dont catch me in the water when i can stay on land  what is more you wont find any other members of my family doing such a thing  tut tut tut tut peter exclaimed jenny wren in her sharp scolding voice  tut tut tut tut  for a fellow who has been so curious about the ways of his feathered neighbors you know very little about your own family  if i were in your place i would learn about my own relatives before i became curious about my neighbors  how many relatives have you peter  one replied peter promptly my big cousin jumper the hare  jenny wren threw back her head and laughed and laughed and laughed it was a most irritating and provoking laugh  finally peter began to lose patience  what are you laughing at he demanded crossly you know very well that jumper the hare is the only cousin i have  jenny wren laughed harder that ever  peter she gasped  peter you will be the death of me  why down in the sunny south where i spent the winter you have a cousin who is more closely related to you than jumper the hare and what is more he is almost as fond of the water as jerry muskrat  he was called the marsh rabbit or marsh hare and many a time i have watched him swimming about by the hour  i dont believe it declared peter angrily  i dont believe a word of it  you are simply trying to fool me jenny wren  there never was a rabbit and there never will be a rabbit who would go swimming for the fun of it  i belong to the cottontail branch of the hare family and it is a fine family if i do say so  my cousin jumper is a true hare and the only difference between us is that he is bigger has longer legs and ears changes the color of his coat in winter and seldom if ever goes into holes in the ground  the idea of trying to tell me i dont know about my own relatives  jenny wren suddenly became sober  peter said she very earnestly take my advice and go to school to old mother nature for awhile what i have told you is true every word of it  you have a cousin down in the sunny south who spends half his time in the water what is more i suspect that you and jumper have other relatives of whom youve never heard  such ignorance would be laughable if it were not to be pitied  this is what comes of never having traveled  go to school to old mother nature for a while peter it will pay you  with this jenny wren flew away to hunt for mr wren that they might decide where to make their home for the summer  peter tried to believe that what jenny wren had told him was nothing but a story but do what he would he couldnt rid himself of a little doubt  he tried to interest himself in the affairs of the other little people of old orchard but it was useless  that little doubt kept growing and growing  could it be possible that jenny wren had spoken the truth  could it be that he really didnt know what relatives he had or anything about them  of course old mother nature could tell him all he wanted to know  and he knew that whatever she might tell him would be true  finally that growing doubt together with the curiosity which has led poor peter to do so many queer things proved too much for him and he started for the green forest to look for old mother nature it didnt take long to find her  she was very busy for there is no time in all the year when old mother nature has quite so much to do as in the spring  if you please old mother nature said peter timidly but very politely ive some questions i want to ask you  old mother natures eyes twinkled in a kindly way  all right peter she replied  i guess i can talk and work at the same time  what is it you want to know  i want to know if it is true that there are any other members of the rabbit and the hare family besides my big cousin jumper who lives here in the green forest and myself  old mother natures eyes twinkled more than ever  why of course peter she replied  there are several other members  you ought to know that  but then i suppose you dont because you never have traveled  it is surprising how little some folks know about the very things they ought to know most about  peter looked very humble and as if he felt a little bit foolish isisis it true that way down in the sunny south i have a cousin who loves to spend his time in the water stammered peter  it certainly is peter replied old mother nature  he is called the marsh rabbit and he is more nearly your size and looks more like you than any of your other cousins  peter gulped as if he were swallowing something that went down hard  that is what jenny wren said but i didnt believe her replied peter meekly  she said she had often watched him swimming about like jerry muskrat  old mother nature nodded  quite true  quite true said she he is quite as much at home in the water as on land if anything a little more so  he is one member the family who takes to the water and he certainly does love it  is there anything else you want to know peter  peter shifted about uneasily and hesitated  what is it peter asked old mother nature kindly  there is nothing in the great world equal to knowledge and if i can add to your store of it i will be very glad to  peter took heart  ifif you please mother nature i would like to learn all about my family  may come to school to you every day  old mother nature laughed right out  certainly you may go to school to me old mr curiosity said she  it is a good idea a very good idea  im very busy as you can see but im never too busy to teach those who really want to learn  well have a lesson here every morning just at sunup  i cant be bothered any more today because it is late  run along home to the dear old briarpatch and think up some questions to ask me tomorrow morning  and by the way peter i will ask you some questions for one thing i shall ask you to tell me all you know about your own family  now scamper along and be here tomorrow morning at sunup  may i bring my cousin jumper the hare if he wants to come asked peter as he prepared to obey old mother nature  bring him along and any one else who wants to learn replied old mother nature kindly  peter bade her goodby in his most polite manner and then scampered as fast as he could go lippertylippertylip to the dear old briarpatch  there he spent the remainder of the day thinking up questions and also trying to find out how much he really did know about his own family    chapter ii  peter and jumper go to school  hardly had jolly round red mr sun thrown off his rosy blankets and begun his daily climb up in the blue blue sky when peter rabbit and his cousin jumper the hare arrived at the place in the green forest where peter had found old mother nature the day before  she was waiting for them ready to begin the first lesson  i am glad you are so prompt said she  promptness is one of the most important things in life  now i am very very busy these days as you know so we will begin school at once  before either of you ask any questions i am going to ask some myself  peter what do you look like  where do you live  what do you eat  i want to find out just how much you really know about yourself  peter scratched one ear with a long hind foot and hesitated as if he didnt know just how to begin  old mother nature waited patiently  finally peter began rather timidly  of course said he the only way i know how i look is by the way the other members of my family look for ive never seen myself  i suppose in a way i look like all the rest of the rabbit family  i have long hind legs and short front ones  i suppose this is so i can make long jumps when i am in a hurry  old mother nature nodded and peter taking courage continued  my hind legs are stout and strong but my front ones are rather weak i guess this is because i do not have a great deal of use for them except for running  my coat is a sort of mixture of brown and gray more brown in summer and more gray in winter  my ears are longer for my size than are those of most animals but really not very long after all not nearly as long for my size as my cousin jumpers are for his size  my tail doesnt amount to much because it is so short that it is hardly worth calling a tail  it is so short i carry it straight up  it is white like a little bunch of cotton and i suppose that that is why i am called a cottontail rabbit though i have heard that some folks  call me a gray rabbit and others a bush rabbit  i guess im  called bush rabbit because i like bushy country in which to live  i live in the dear old briarpatch and just love it  it is a mass of bushes and brambletangles and is the safest place i know of  i have cut little paths all through it just big enough for mrs peter and myself  none of our enemies can get at us there excepting shadow the weasel or billy mink  i have a sort of nest there where i spend my time when i am not running about  it is called a form and i sit in it a great deal  in summer i eat clover grass and other green things and i just love to get over into farmer browns garden  in winter i have to take what i can get and this is mostly bark from young trees buds and tender twigs of bushes and any green plants i can find under the snow  i can run fast for a short distance but only for a short distance  that is why i like thick brush and bramble tangles  there i can dodge  i dont know any one who can beat me at dodging  if reddy fox or bowser the hound surprises me away from the dear old briarpatch i run for the nearest hollow log or hole in the ground  sometimes in summer i dig a hole for myself but not often  it is much easier to use a hole somebody else has dug  when i want to signal my friends i thump the ground with my hind feet  jumper does the same thing  i forgot to say i dont like water  old mother nature smiled  you are thinking of that cousin of yours the marsh rabbit who lives way down in the sunny south said she  peter looked a wee bit foolish and admitted that he was jumper the hare was all interest at once  you see he had never heard of this cousin  that was a very good account of yourself peter said old mother nature  now take a look at your cousin jumper the hare and tell me how he differs from you  peter took a long look at jumper and then as before scratched one ear with a long hind foot  in the first place said he jumper is considerably bigger than i  he has very long hind legs and his ears are very long  in summer he wears a brown coat but in winter he is all white but the tips of those long ears and those are black  because his coat changes so he is called the varying hare  he likes the green forest where the trees grow close together especially those places where there are a great many young trees  hes the biggest member of our family  i guess thats all i know about cousin jumper  that is very good peter as far as it goes said old mother nature  you have made only one mistake  jumper is not the biggest of his family  both peter and jumper opened their eyes very wide with surprise also continued old mother nature you forgot to mention the fact that jumper never hides in hollow logs and holes in the ground as you do  why dont you jumper  i wouldnt feel safe there replied jumper rather timidly  i depend on my long legs for safety and the way i can dodge around trees and bushes  i suppose reddy fox may be fast enough to catch me in the open but he cant do it where i can dodge around trees and bushes  that is why i stick to the green forest  if you please mother nature what is this about a cousin who likes to swim  old mother natures eyes twinkled  well get to that later on said she  now each of you hold up a hind foot and tell me what difference you see  peter and jumper each held up a hind foot and each looked first at his own and then at the others  they look to me very much alike only jumpers is a lot longer and bigger than mine said peter  jumper nodded as if he agreed  whats the matter with your eyes demanded old mother nature dont you see that jumpers foot is a great deal broader than yours peter and that his toes are spread apart while yours are close together  peter and jumper looked sheepish for it was just as old mother nature had said  jumpers foot really was quite different from that of peter  peters was narrow and slim  that is a very important difference declared old mother nature can you guess why i gave you those big feet jumper  jumper slowly shook his head  not unless it was to make me different said he  im surprised said old mother nature  yes indeed im surprised  you ought to know by this time that i never give anybody anything without a purpose  what happens to those big feet of yours in the winter jumper  nothing that i know of excepting that the hair grows out long between my toes jumper replied  exactly snapped old mother nature  and when the hair does this you can travel over light snow without sinking in  it is just as if you had snowshoes  that is why you are often called a snowshoe rabbit  i gave you those big feet and make the hair grow out every winter because i know that you depend on your legs to get away from your enemies  you can run over the deep snow where your enemies break through  peter though he is small and lighter than you are cannot go where you can  but peter doesnt need to depend always on his legs to save his life  there is one thing more that i want you both to notice and that is that you both have quite a lot of short hairs on the soles of you feet  that is where you differ from that cousin of yours down in the sunny south  he has only a very few hairs on his feet  that is so he can swim better  if you please mother nature why is that cousin of ours so fond of the water piped up peter  because replied old mother nature he lives in marshy country where there is a great deal of water  he is very nearly the same size as you peter and looks very much like you  but his legs are not quite so long his ears are a little smaller and his tail is brownish instead of white  he is a poor runner and so in time of danger he takes to the water  for that matter he goes swimming for pleasure  the water is warm down there and he dearly loves to paddle about in it  if a fox chases him he simply plunges into the water and hides among the water plants with only his eyes and his nose out of water  does he make his home in the water like jerry muskrat asked peter innocently  mother nature smiled and shook her head  certainly not she replied  his home is on the ground  his babies are born in a nest made just as mrs peter makes her nest for your babies and mrs jumper makes a nest for jumpers babies  it is made of grass and lined with soft fur which mrs rabbit pulls from her own breast and it is very carefully hidden  by the way peter how do your babies differ from the babies of your cousin jumper  peter shook his head  i dont know said he  my babies dont have their eyes open when they are born and they havent any hair  jumper pricked up his long ears  whats that said he why my babies have their eyes open and have the dearest little fur coats  old mother nature chuckled  that is the difference said she i guess both of you have learned something  you said a little while ago that jumper isnt the biggest of our family said peter  if you please who is  there are several bigger than jumper replied old mother nature and smiled as she saw the funny look of surprise on the faces of peter and jumper  there is one way up the frozen north and there are two cousins way out in the great west  they are as much bigger than jumper as jumper is bigger than you peter  but i havent time to tell you about them now  if you really want to learn about them be here promptly at sunup tomorrow morning hello  here comes reddy fox and he looks to me as if a good breakfast would not come amiss  let me see what you have learned about taking care of yourselves  peter and jumper gave one startled look in the direction mother nature was pointing  sure enough there was reddy fox  not far away was a hollow log  peter wasted no time in getting to it in fact he left in such a hurry that he forgot to say goodby to old mother nature  but she didnt mind for she quite understood peters feelings and she laughed when she saw his funny little white tail disappear inside the hollow log  as for jumper he promptly took to his long legs and disappeared with great bounds reddy fox racing after him    chapter iii  more of peters longlegged cousins  at sunup the next morning peter rabbit and jumper the hare were on hand promptly for their next lesson  old mother nature smiled as she saw the eager curiosity shining in their eyes  she didnt wait for them to ask questions  yesterday said she i told you about your waterloving cousin the marsh rabbit  you have another relative down there in the sunny south who is almost as fond of the water  some folks call him the swamp rabbit  others call him the swamp hare  the latter is really the best name for him because he is a true hare  he lives in swamps instead of marshes but he is a splendid swimmer and fond of the water  when he is chased by an enemy he makes for the nearest point or stream  how big is he asked jumper  just about your size jumper replied old mother nature  if anything he is a little bit heavier  but because his hair lies much smoother than yours you probably would look a little bit bigger if you were sitting beside him  as with his cousin the marsh rabbit the hair on his feet is thin  his toes are rather long and he can spread them widely which is a great help in swimming  he doesnt have to take to the water as his little cousin does for he is a very good runner  but he does take to it as the easiest way of getting rid of those who are chasing him the marsh rabbit and the swamp hare are the only members of your family in all the great world who are fond of the water and who are at home in it  now who shall i tell you about  our biggest cousins cried peter and jumper together  the ones you told us yesterday are bigger than jumper added peter  it is hard to believe that there can be any much bigger than he  old mother natures eyes twinkled  it is often hard to believe things you know nothing about said she  compared with these other relatives jumper really isnt big at all  he seems big to you peter but if he should meet his cousin snow white the arctic hare who lives way up in the frozen north i am quite sure jumper would feel small  snow white looks very much like jumper in his winter coat for he is all white save the tips of his ears which are black  does he wear a white coat all year round asked peter eagerly  when he lives so far north that there is snow and ice for most of the year he does replied old mother nature  but when he lives far enough south for the snow to disappear for a little while in the summer he changes his white coat for one of gray  but how can he live so far north that the snow and ice seldom melt asked peter looking very much puzzled  what can he find to eat  even way up there there is moss growing under the snow  and in the short summer other plants grow  during the long winter snow white digs down through the snow to get these  he also eats the bark and twigs of little stunted trees  but big as he is you have a cousin who is still bigger the biggest of all the family  who is he jumper and peter cried together  he is called whitetailed jack replied old mother nature  and he lives chiefly on the great plains of the northwest though sometimes he is found in the mountains and forests  he is sometimes called the prairie hare  in winter his coat is white but in summer it is a light brown  summer or winter his tail is white wherein he is much like you peter  it is because of this that he is called whitetailed jack  is his tail as short as mine asked peter eagerly  old mother nature laughed right out  no peter she replied it wouldnt be called a long tail by any other animal but for a member of your family it really is long and when whitetailed jack is running he switches it from side to side  his hind legs are very long and powerful and he can make a single jump of twenty feet without half trying  not even old man coyote can catch him in a straightaway race  you think jumpers ears are long peter but they are short compared to the ears of whitetailed jack  not only are his ears long but they are very big  when he squats in his form and lays his ears back they reach way over his shoulders like the other members of the hare family he doesnt use holes in the ground or hollow logs  he trusts to his long legs and to his wonderful speed to escape from his enemies  among the latter are howler the wolf old man coyote eagles hawks and owls  he is so big that he would make five or six of you peter  peter drew a long breath  it is dreadfully hard to believe that i can have a cousin as big as that he exclaimed  but of course if you say it is so it is so he hastened to add  have i any other cousins anywhere near as big  old mother nature nodded  there are some others very like whitetailed jack only not quite as big said she  they have just such long hind legs and just such great ears but their coats are different and they live on the great plains farther south  some of them live so far south that it is warm all the year round  one of these latter is antelope jack whose home is in the southwest  tell us about him begged peter  to begin with replied old mother nature he is a member of the big jack rabbit or jack hare branch of your family  none of this branch should be called a rabbit  all the members are first cousins to jumper and are true hares  all have big ears long rather thin necks and long legs  even their front legs are comparatively long antelope jack is probably next in size to whitetailed jack  strange to say although he lives where it is warm for most of the year his coat is very largely white  his back is a yellowishbrown and so is his throat  but his sides are white  the surprising thing about him is that he has the power of making himself seem almost wholly white  he can make the white hair spread out at will by means of some special little muscles which i have given him so that the white of his sides at times almost seems to meet on his back  when he does this in the sun it makes flashes of white which can be seen a long way  by means of this antelope jack and his friends can keep track of each other when they are a long distance apart  there is only one other animal who can flash signals in this way and that is the antelope of whom i will tell you some other time  it is because jack flashes signals in this way that he is called antelope jack  in his habits he is otherwise much like the other members of his family  he trusts to his long legs and his wonderful powers of jumping to keep him out of danger  he is not as well known as his commoner cousin plain jack rabbit  everybody knows jack rabbit  peter shook his head  i dont said he very meekly  then it is time you did replied old mother nature  if you had ever been in the far west you would know him  everybody out there knows him  he isnt quite as big as antelope jack but still he is a big fellow  he wears a brownish coat much like jumpers and the tips of his long ears are black  his tail is longer than jumpers and when he runs he carries it down  i dont carry mine down peter piped up  old mother nature laughed right out  true enough peter true enough said she  you couldnt if you wanted to  it isnt long enough to carry any way but up  jack has more of a tail than you have just as he has longer legs  my how he can run  he goes with great bounds and about every tenth bound he jumps very high  this is so that he can get a good look around to watch out for enemies  who are his enemies asked peter  foxes coyotes hawks eagles owls weasels and men replied old mother nature  in fact he has about as many enemies as you have  i suppose when you say men you mean hunters said peter  old mother nature nodded  yes said she i mean those who hunt him for fun and those who hunt him to get rid of him  peter pricked up his ears  what do they want to get rid of him for  what harm does he do he asked  when he lives far away from the homes of men he does no harm replied old mother nature  but when he lives near the homes of men he gets into mischief just as you do when you visit farmer browns garden  old mother nature looked very severe when she said this and peter hung his head  i know i ought to keep away from that garden said peter very meekly but you have no idea what a temptation it is  the things in that garden do taste so good  old mother nature turned her head to hide the twinkle in her eyes when she turned toward peter again her face was severe as before that is no excuse peter rabbit said she  you should be sufficiently strongminded not to yield to temptation  yielding to temptation is the cause of most of the trouble in this world it has made man an enemy to jack rabbit  jack just cannot keep away from the crops planted by men  his family is very large and when a lot of them get together in a field of clover or young wheat or in a young orchard where the bark on the trees is tender and sweet they do so much damage that the owner is hardly to be blamed for becoming angry and seeking to kill them  yes i am sorry to say jack rabbit becomes a terrible nuisance when he goes where he has no business  now i guess you have learned sufficient about your longlegged cousins  ive a great deal to do so skip along home both of you  if you please mother nature may we come again tomorrow asked peter  what for demanded old mother nature  havent you learned enough about your family  yes replied peter but there are lots and lots of things i would like to know about other people  if you please i would like to come to school to you every day  you see the more i learn about my neighbors the better able i will be to take care of myself  all right mr curiosity replied old mother nature goodnaturedly come again tomorrow morning  i wouldnt for the world deny any one who is really seeking for knowledge  so peter and jumper politely bade her goodby and started for their homes    chapter iv  chatterer and happy jack join  peter rabbit on his way to school to old mother nature was trying to make up his mind about which of his neighbors he would ask  he had learned so many surprising things about his own family that he shrewdly suspected many equally surprising things were to be learned about his neighbors  but there were so many neighbors he couldnt decide which one to ask about first  but that matter was settled for him and in a funny way  hardly had he reached the edge of the green forest when he was hailed by a sharp voice  hello peter rabbit said this sharp voice  where are you bound at this hour of the morning  you ought to be heading for home in the dear old briarpatch  peter knew that voice the instant he heard it  it was the voice of happy jack the gray squirrel  happy jack was seated on the top of an old stump eating a nut  im going to school replied peter with a great deal of dignity  going to school  ho ho ho  going to school exclaimed happy jack  pray tell me to whom you are going to school and what for  im going to school to old mother nature retorted peter  ive been going for several days and so has my cousin jumper the hare weve learned a lot about our own family and now we are going to learn about the other little people of the green forest and the green meadows  pooh exclaimed happy jack  pooh i know all about my own family and i guess there isnt much worth knowing about my neighbors that i dont know  is that so mr knowitall retorted peter  i dont believe you even know all your own cousins  i thought i knew all mine but i found i didnt  what are you fellows talking about asked another voice a sharp scolding voice and chatterer the red squirrel jumped from one tree to another just above peters head  peter is trying to make me believe that i dont know as much as i might about our own family snapped happy jack indignantly  he is on his way to school to old mother nature and has advised me to join him  isnt that a joke  maybe it is and maybe it isnt retorted chatterer who isnt the best of friends with his cousin happy jack  if i dont know as much about the squirrel family as you do may i never find another nut as long as i live  but at that im not sure i know all there is to know  i think it would be fun to go to school for a while what do you say peter if i go along with you  peter said that he thought it would be a very fine thing and that chatterer never would regret it  chatterer winked at his cousin happy jack and followed peter only of course chatterer kept in the trees while peter was on the ground  happy jack hesitated a minute and then curiosity becoming too much for him he hastened after the others  hello exclaimed old mother nature as happy jack and chatterer appeared with peter rabbit  what are you frisky folks doing over here  happy jack and chatterer appeared to have lost their tongues something very unusual for them especially for chatterer  the fact is in the presence of old mother nature they felt bashful peter replied for them  theyve decided to come to school too said he  happy jack says he knows all about his own family but he has come along to find out if he really does  it wont take us long to find out said old mother nature softly and her eyes twinkled with amusement  how many cousins have you happy jack  happy jack thought for a moment  three he replied but he didnt say it in a very positive way  peter chuckled to himself for he knew that already doubt was beginning to grow in happy jacks mind  name them commanded old mother nature promptly  chatterer the red squirrel timmy the flying squirrel and striped chipmunk replied happy jack  hes forgotten rusty the fox squirrel shouted chatterer dancing about gleefully  happy jack looked crestfallen and gave chatterer an angry look  thats right chatterer said old mother nature  rusty is a very important member of the squirrel family  now suppose you name the others  whawhawhat others stammered chatterer  i dont know of any others  peter rabbit hugged himself with glee as he watched the faces of happy jack and chatterer  they dont know any more about their family than we did about ours he whispered in one of the long ears of jumper the hare  as for old mother nature she smiled indulgently  put on your thinkingcaps you two said she  you havent named half of them  you are not wholly to blame for that for some of them you never have seen but there is one member of the squirrel family whom both of you know very well yet whom neither of you named put on your thinkingcaps  chatterer looked at happy jack and happy jack looked at chatterer and each scratched his head  each wanted to be the first to think of that other cousin for each was jealous of the other  but though they scratched and scratched their heads they couldnt think who that other cousin could be  old mother nature waited a few minutes before she told them  then seeing that either they couldnt remember or didnt know she said you didnt mention johnny chuck  johnny chuck exclaimed chatterer and happy jack together and the look of surprise on their faces was funny to see  for that matter the looks on the faces of peter rabbit and jumper the hare were equally funny  old mother nature nodded  johnny chuck she repeated  he is a member of the squirrel family  he belongs to the marmot branch but he is a squirrel just the same  he is one of your cousins  hes a mighty funny looking squirrel said chatterer jerking his tail as only he can  that just shows your ignorance chatterer replied old mother nature rather sharply  im surprised at the ignorance of you two  she looked first at chatterer than at happy jack  it is high time you came to school to me for a while  youve got a lot to learn  for that matter so have peter and jumper  now which of you can tell me what order you all belong to  happy jack looked at chatterer chatterer looked at peter rabbit and peter looked at jumper the hare  on the face of each was such a funny puzzled expression that old mother nature almost laughed right out  finally peter rabbit found his tongue  if you please said he i guess we dont know what you mean by an order  i thought as much said old mother nature  i thought as much in the first place the animals of the great world are divided into big groups or divisions and then these groups are divided into smaller groups and these in turn into still smaller groups happy jack and chatterer belong to a group called the squirrel family and peter and jumper to a group called the hare family both of these families and several other families belong to a bigger group called an order and this order is the order of gnawers or rodents  peter rabbit fairly jumped up in the air he was so excited  then jumper and i must be related to happy jack and chatterer he cried  in a way you are replied old mother nature  it isnt a very close relationship still you are related  all of you are rodents so are all the members of the rat and mouse family the beaver family the porcupine family the pocket gopher family the pika family and the sewellel family  by this time peters eyes looked as if they would pop right out of his head  this is the first time ive ever heard of some of those families said he  my what a lot we have to learn  is it because all the members of all those families have teeth for gnawing that they are all sort of related  old mother nature looked pleased  peter said she i think you ought to go to the head of the class  that is just why  all the members of all the families i have named belong to the same order the order of rodents  all the members have big cutting front teeth  animals without such teeth cannot gnaw  now as you and jumper have learned about your family it is the turn of happy jack and chatterer to learn about their family  theirs is rather a large family and it is divided into three groups the first of which consists of the true squirrels to which group both happy jack and chatterer belong  the second group consists of the marmots and johnny chuck belongs to this  the third group timmy the flying squirrel has all to himself  where does striped chipmunk come in asked chatterer  im coming to that replied old mother nature  the true squirrels are divided into the tree squirrels rock squirrels and ground squirrels  of course chatterer and happy jack are tree squirrels  and striped chipmunk is a ground squirrel interrupted peter looking as if he felt very much pleased with his own smartness  old mother nature shook her head  you are wrong this time peter said she and peter looked as foolish as he felt  striped chipmunk is a rock squirrel  seek seek the spermophile who lives on the plains of the west and is often called gopher squirrel is the true ground squirrel  now i cant spend any more time with you little folks this morning because ive too much to do  tomorrow morning i shall expect chatterer to tell me all about happy jack and happy jack to tell me all about chatterer  now scamper along all of you and think over what you have learned this morning  so peter and jumper and chatterer and happy jack thanked old mother nature for what she had told them and scampered away  peter headed straight for the far corner of the old orchard where he was sure he would find johnny chuck  he couldnt get there fast enough for he wanted to be the first to tell johnny chuck that he was a squirrel you see he didnt believe that johnny knew it    chapter v  the squirrels of the trees  peter rabbit found johnny chuck sitting on his doorstep sunning himself  peter was quite out of breath because he had hurried so do you know that you are a squirrel johnny chuck he panted  johnny slowly turned his head and looked at peter as if he thought peter had suddenly gone crazy  what are you talking about peter rabbit  im not a squirrel im a woodchuck he replied  just the same you are a squirrel retorted peter  the woodchucks belong to the squirrel family  old mother nature says so and if she says so it is so  youd better join our school johnny chuck and learn a little about your own relatives  johnny chuck blinked his eyes and for a minute or two couldnt find a word to say  he knew that if peter were telling the truth as to what old mother nature had said it must be true that he was member of the squirrel family  but it was hard to believe  what is this school he finally asked  peter hastened to tell him  he told johnny all about what he and jumper the hare had learned about their family and all the surprising things old mother nature had told them about the squirrel family and he ended by again urging johnny chuck to join the school and promised to call for johnny the next morning  but johnny chuck is lazy and does not like to go far from his own doorstep so when peter called the next morning johnny refused to go despite all peter could say  peter didnt waste much time arguing for he was afraid he would be late and miss something when he reached the green forest he found his cousin jumper the hare and chatterer the red squirrel and happy jack the gray squirrel already there  as soon as peter arrived old mother nature began the morning lesson  happy jack said she you may tell us all you know about your cousin chatterer  to begin with he is the smallest of the tree squirrels said happy jack  he isnt so very much bigger than striped chipmunk and that means that he is less than half as big as myself  his coat is red and his waistcoat white his tail is about twothirds as long as his body and flat but not very broad  personally i dont think it is much of a tail  at once chatterers quick temper flared up and he began to scold but old mother nature silenced him and told happy jack to go on he spends more of his time in the trees than i do continued happy jack and is especially fond of pine trees and other conebearing trees  he likes the deeper parts of the green forest better than i do though he seems to feel just as much at home on the edge of the green forest especially if it is near a farm where he can steal corn  chatterer started to scold again but was silenced once more by old mother nature  i have to admit that chatterer is thrifty continued happy jack quite as if he hadnt been interrupted he is very fond of the seeds of conebearing trees  he cuts the cones from the trees just before they are ripe  then they ripen and open on the ground where he can get at the seeds easily  he often has a number of storehouses and stores up cone seeds acorns nuts and corn when he can get it  he builds a nest of leaves and strips of bark sometimes in a hollow tree and sometimes high up in the branches of an evergreen tree  he is a good jumper and jumps from tree to tree  he is a busybody and always poking his nose in where he has no business  he steals my stores whenever he can find them  you do the same thing to me when you have the chance which isnt often sputtered chatterer  happy jack turned his back to chatterer and continued he doesnt seem to mind cold weather at all as long as the sun shines  his noisy tongue is to be heard on the coldest days of winter  he is the sauciest most impudent fellow of the green forest and never so happy as when he is making trouble for others  he sauces and scolds everybody he meets and every time he opens his mouth he jerks his tail  hes quarrelsome  worse than that in the spring when the birds are nesting he turns robber  he goes hunting for nests and steals the eggs and what is even more dreadful he kills and eats the baby birds  all the birds hate him and i dont blame them  chatterer could contain himself no longer  his tongue fairly flew and he jerked his tail so hard and so fast that peter rabbit almost expected to see him break it right off  he called happy jack names all the bad names he could think of and worked himself up into such a rage that it was some time before old mother nature could quiet him  when at last he stopped from sheer lack of breath old mother nature spoke and her voice was very severe  im ashamed of you chatterer said she  unfortunately what happy jack has said about you is true  in  many ways you are a disgrace to the green forest  still i dont know how the green forest could get along without you  happy jack forgot to mention that you eat some insects at times  he also forgot to mention that sometimes you have a storehouse down in the ground  now tell us what you know about your cousin happy jack  for a few minutes chatterer sulked but he did not dare disobey old mother nature  i dont know much good about him he mumbled  and you dont know much bad about me either retorted happy jack sharply  old mother nature held up a warning hand  that will do said she  now chatterer go on  happy jack is more than twice as big as i but at that im not afraid of him said chatterer and glared at happy jack  he is gray all over except underneath where he is white  he has a tremendously big tail and is so proud of it he shows it off whenever he has a chance  when he sits up he has a way of folding his hands on his breast  i dont know what he does it for unless it is to keep them warm in cold weather  he builds a nest very much like mine  sometimes it is in a hollow tree but quite as often it is in the branches of a tree  he is a good traveler in the treetops but he spends a good deal of his time on the ground  he likes open woodland best especially where there are many nut trees  he has a storehouse where he stores up nuts for winter but he buries in the ground and under the leaves more than he puts in his storehouse  in winter when he is hungry he hunts for those buried nuts and somehow he manages to find them even when they are covered with snow  when he comes to stealing he is not better than i am  i have seen him steal birds eggs and i wouldnt trust him unwatched around one of my storehouses  it was happy jacks turn to become indignant  i may have taken a few eggs when i accidentally ran across them said he but i never go looking for them and i dont take them unless i am very hungry and cant find anything else  i dont make a business of robbing birds the way you do and you know it  if i find one of your storehouses and help myself i am only getting back what you have stolen from me  everybody loves me and that is more than you can say  thats enough declared old mother nature and her voice was very sharp  you two cousins never have agreed and i am afraid never will as long as you are neighbors i suspect you will quarrel  have you told us all you know about happy jack chatterer  chatterer nodded  he was still mumbling to himself angrily and wasnt polite enough to make a reply  old mother nature took no notice of this  what you have told us is good as far as it goes said she  you said that happy jack is all gray excepting underneath  usually the gray squirrel is just as chatterer has described him but sometimes a gray squirrel isnt gray at all but all black  peter rabbits ears stood straight up with astonishment  how can a gray squirrel be black he demanded  old mother nature smiled  that is a fair question peter said she  gray squirrel is simply the name of happy jacks family sometimes some of the babies are born with black coats instead of gray coats  of course they are just the same kind of squirrel only they look different  in some parts of the country there are numbers of these blackcoated squirrels and many think they are a different kind of squirrel  they are not  they are simply blackcoated members of happy jacks family  just remember this it is the same way in the family of rusty the fox squirrel  some members are rusty red some are a mixture of red and gray and some are as gray as happy jack himself  way down in the sunny south fox squirrels always have white noses and ears  in the north they never have white noses and ears  rusty the fox squirrel is just a little bigger than happy jack and has just such a handsome tail  he is the strongest and heaviest of the tree squirrels and not nearly as quick and graceful as happy jack  sometimes rusty has two nests in the same tree one in a hollow in a tree for bad weather and the other made of sticks and leaves outside in the branches for use in good weather  rustys habits are very much the same as those of happy jack the gray squirrel and therefore he likes the same kind of surroundings  like his cousin happy jack rusty is a great help to me  seeing how surprised everybody looked mother nature explained both happy jack and rusty bury a great many more nuts than they ever need said she and those they do not dig up sprout in the spring and grow in that way they plant ever so many trees without knowing it  just remember that chatterer the next time you are tempted to quarrel with your cousin happy jack  very likely happy jacks greatgreateversogreat grandfather planted the very tree you get your fattest and best hickory nuts from  way out in the mountains of the far west you have a cousin called the douglas squirrel who is really a true red squirrel and whose habits are very much like your own  some folks call him the pine squirrel  by the way chatterer happy jack forgot to say that you are a good swimmer  perhaps he didnt know it  by the expression of happy jacks face it was quite clear that he didnt know it  certainly i can swim said chatterer  i dont mind the water at all  i can swim a long distance if i have to  this was quite as much news to peter rabbit as had been the fact that a cousin of his own was a good swimmer and he began to feel something very like respect for chatterer  are there any other tree squirrels asked jumper the hare  yes replied old mother nature there are twothe handsomest of all the family  they live out in the southwest in one of the most wonderful places in all this great land a place called the grand canyon  one is called the abert squirrel and the other the kaibab squirrel  they are about the size of happy jack and rusty but have broader handsomer tails and their ears have long tufts of hair  the abert squirrel has black ears a brown back gray sides and white underneath  kaibab has brown ears with black tips and his tail is mostly white  both are very lovely but their families are small and so they are little known  with this old mother nature dismissed school for the day    chapter vi  striped chipmunk and his cousins  of course there couldnt be a school in the green forest without news of it spreading very fast  news travels quickly through the green forest and over the green meadows for the little people who live there are great gossips  so it was not surprising that striped chipmunk heard all about old mother natures school  the next morning just as the daily lesson was beginning striped chipmunk came hurrying up quite our of breath  well well  see whos here exclaimed old mother nature  what have you come for striped chipmunk  ive come to try to learn  will you let me stay mother nature replied striped chipmunk  of course ill let you stay cried old mother nature heartily i am glad you have come especially glad you have come today because todays lesson is to be about you and your cousins  now peter rabbit what are the differences between striped chipmunk and his cousins the tree squirrels  peter looked very hard at striped chipmunk as if he had never really seen him before  he is smaller than they are began peter  in fact he is the smallest squirrel i know  peter paused  old mother nature nodded encouragingly  go on said she  he wears a striped coat continued peter  the stripes are black and yellowishwhite and run along his sides a black stripe running down the middle of his back  the rest of his coat is reddishbrown above and light underneath  his tail is rather thin and flat  i never see him in the trees so i guess he cant climb  oh yes i can interrupted striped chipmunk  i can climb if i want to and i do sometimes but prefer the ground  go on peter said old mother nature  he seems to like old stone walls and rock piles continued peter and he is one of the brightest liveliest merriest and the most lovable of all my friends  thank you peter said striped chipmunk softly  i never have been able to find his home continued peter  that is one of his secrets  but i know it is in the ground  i guess this is all i know about him  i should say the chief difference between striped chipmunk and the tree squirrels is that he spends all his time on the ground while the others live largely in the trees  very good peter said old mother nature  but there are two very important differences which you have not mentioned  striped chipmunk has a big pocket on the inside of each cheek while his cousins of the trees have no pockets at all  of course cried peter  i dont see how i came to forget that ive laughed many times at striped chipmunk with those pockets stuffed with nuts or seeds until his head looked three times bigger than it does now  those pockets must be very handy  they are replied striped chipmunk  i couldnt get along without them  they save me a lot of running back and forth i can tell you  and the other great difference said old mother nature is that striped chipmunk sleeps nearly all winter just waking up occasionally to pop his head out on a bright day to see how the weather is  a great many folks call striped chipmunk a ground squirrel but more properly he is a rock squirrel because he likes stony places best  supposing striped chipmunk you tell us where and how you make your home  i make my home down in the ground replied striped chipmunk  i dig a tunnel just big enough to run along comfortably  down deep enough to be out of reach of jack frost i make a nice little bedroom with a bed of grass and leaves and i make another little room for a storeroom in which to keep my supply of seeds and nuts sometimes i have more than one storeroom  also i have some little side tunnels  but why is it i never have been able to find the entrance to your tunnel asked peter as full of curiosity as ever  because i have it hidden underneath the stone wall on the edge of the old orchard replied striped chipmunk  but even then i should think that all the sand you must have taken out would give your secret away cried peter  striped chipmunk chuckled happily  it was a throaty little chuckle pleasant to hear  i looked out for that said he  there isnt a grain of that sand around my doorway  i took it all out through another hole some distance away a sort of back door and then closed it up solidly  if you please mother nature if i am not a ground squirrel who is  your cousin seek seek the spermophile sometimes called gopher squirrel who lives on the open plains of the west where there are no rocks or stones  he likes best the flat open country  he is called spermophile because that means seedeater and he lives largely on seeds especially on grain  because of this he does a great deal of damage and is much disliked by farmers  seek seeks family are the true ground squirrels  please remember that they never should be called gophers for they are not gophers one of the smallest members of the family is just about your size striped chipmunk and he also wears stripes only he has more of them than you have and they are broken up into little dots  he is called the thirteenlined spermophile  he has pockets in his cheeks just as you have and he makes a home down in the ground very similar to yours  all the family do this and all of them sleep through the winter  while they are great seedeaters they also eat a great many insects and worms and some of them even are guilty of killing and eating the babies of birds that nest on the ground and also young mice  some members of the family are almost as big as happy jack the gray squirrel and have gray coats  they are called gray ground squirrels and sometimes gray gophers  one of the largest of these is the california ground squirrel  he has a big bushy tail very like happy jacks  he gets into so much mischief in the grain fields and in the orchards that he is quite as much disliked as is jack rabbit  this particular member of the family is quite as much at home among rocks and tree roots as in open ground  he climbs low trees for fruit and nuts but prefers to stay on the ground  now just remember that the chipmunks are rock squirrels and their cousins the spermophiles are ground squirrels  now who of you has seen timmy the flying squirrel lately  i havent said peter rabbit  i havent said striped chipmunk  i havent said happy jack  i havent said chatterer  i have spoke up jumper the hare  i saw him last evening just after jolly round red mr sun went to bed behind the purple hills and the black shadows came creeping through the green forest  my i wish i could fly the way he can  old mother nature shook her head disapprovingly  jumper said she what is wrong with your eyes  when did you ever see timmy fly  last night insisted jumper stubbornly  oh no you didnt retorted old mother nature  you didnt see him fly for the very good reason that he cannot fly any more than you can  you saw him simply jump  just remember that the only animals in this great land who can fly are the bats  timmy the flying squirrel simply jumps from the top of a tree and slides down on the air to the foot of another tree  if you had used your eyes you would have noticed that when he is in the air he never moves his legs or arms and he is always coming down never going up excepting for a little at the end of his jump as would be the case if he could really fly  he hasnt any wings  when hes flying i mean jumping he looks as if he had wings insisted jumper stubbornly  that is simply because i have given him a fold of skin between the front and hind leg on each side explained old mother nature when he jumps he stretches his legs out flat and that stretches out those two folds of skin until they look almost like wings this is the reason he can sail so far when he jumps from a high place  youve seen a bird after flapping its wings to get going sail along with them outstretched and motionless  timmy does the same thing only he gets going by jumping  you may have noticed that he usually goes to the top of a tree before jumping then he can sail down a wonderfully long distance  his tail helps him to keep his balance  if there is anything in the way he can steer himself around it  when he reaches the tree he is jumping for he shoots up a little way and lands on the trunk not far above the ground  then he scampers up that tree to do it all over again  but why dont we ever see him inquired striped chipmunk  because when the rest of you squirrels are out and about he is curled up in a little ball in his nest fast asleep  timmy likes the night especially the early evening and doesnt like the light of day  how big is he asked happy jack and looked a little sheepish as if he were a wee bit ashamed of not being acquainted with one of his own cousins  he is if anything a little smaller than striped chipmunk replied old mother nature  way out in the far west he grows a little bigger  his coat is a soft yellowishbrown above beneath he is all white  his fur is wonderfully soft  he has very large dark soft eyes especially suited for seeing at night  then he is very lively and dearly loves to play  by nature he is gentle and lovable  does he eat nuts like his cousins asked peter rabbit  he certainly does replied old mother nature  also he eats grubs and insects  he dearly loves a fat beetle  he likes meat when he can get it  where does he make his home peter inquired  usually in a hole in a tree said old mother nature  he is very fond of an old home of a woodpecker  he makes a comfortable nest of bark lining grass and moss or any other soft material he can find  occasionally he builds an outside nest high up in a fork in the branches of a tree  he likes to get into old buildings  does he have many enemies asked happy jack  the same enemies the rest of you have replied old mother nature but the one he has most reason to fear is hooty the owl and that is the one you have least reason to fear because hooty seldom hunts by day  does he sleep all winter piped up striped chipmunk  not as you do said old mother nature  in very cold weather he sleeps but if he happens to be living where the weather does not get very cold he is active all the year around  now i guess this is enough about the squirrel family  youve forgotten johnny chuck cried peter  old mother nature laughed  so i have said she  that will never do never in the world  johnny and his relatives the marmots certainly cannot be overlooked  we will take them for our lesson tomorrow  peter you tell johnny chuck to come over here tomorrow morning    chapter vii  johnny chuck joins the class  peter rabbit delivered mother natures message to johnny chuck johnny didnt seem at all pleased  he grumbled and growled to himself  he didnt want to go to school  he didnt want to learn anything about his relatives  he was perfectly satisfied with things as they were  the truth is johnny chuck was already beginning to get fat with good living and he is naturally lazy as a rule he can find plenty to eat very near his home so he seldom goes far from his own doorstep  peter left him grumbling and growling and chuckled to himself all the way back to the dear old briarpatch  he knew that johnny chuck would not dare disobey old mother nature  sure enough the next morning johnny chuck came waddling through the green forest just as old mother nature was about to open school he didnt look at all happy and he didnt reply at all to the greetings of the others  but when old mother nature spoke to him he was very polite  good morning johnny chuck said she  johnny bobbed his head and said good morning  i understand continued old mother nature that you are not at all interested in learning about your relatives  i am sorry for any one who doesnt want to learn  the more one knows the better fitted he is to take care of himself and do his part in the work of the great world  however it wasnt for your benefit that i sent word for you to be here this morning  it was for the benefit of your friends and neighbors  now sit up so that all can get a good look at you  johnny chuck obediently sat up and of course all the others stared at him  it made him feel quite uncomfortable  you remember said old mother nature how surprised you little folks were when i told you that johnny chuck is a member of the squirrel family happy jack you go sit beside johnny chuck and the rest of you look hard at happy jack and johnny and see if you do not see a family resemblance  seeing happy jack and johnny chuck sitting up side by side peter rabbit caught the resemblance at once  there was sort of family look about them  why  whyee  johnny chuck does look like a squirrel he exclaimed  of course he looks like a squirrel because he is one said old mother nature  johnny chuck is very much bigger and so stout in the body that he has none of the gracefulness of the true squirrels but you will notice that the shape of his head is much the same as that of happy jack  he has a squirrel face when you come to look at him closely  the woodchucks sometimes called ground hogs though why any one should call them this is more than i can understand belong to the marmot branch of the squirrel family and wherever found they look much alike  as you will notice johnny chucks coat is brownishyellow his feet are very dark brown almost black  his head is dark brown with light gray on his cheeks  beneath he is reddishorange including his throat  his tail is short for a member of the squirrel family and although it is bushy it is not very big  he has a number of whiskers and they are black  some woodchucks are quite gray and occasionally there is one who is almost or wholly black just as there are black gray squirrels  johnny here is not fond of the green forest but loves the old orchard and the green meadows  in some parts of the country there are members of his family who prefer to live just on the edge of the green forest  you will notice that johnny has stout claws  those are to help him dig for all the marmot family are great diggers what other use do you have for those claws johnny  they help me to climb replied johnny promptly  climb exclaimed peter rabbit  who ever heard of a woodchuck climbing  i can climb if i have to retorted johnny chuck indignantly  ive climbed up bushes and low trees lots of times and if i can get a good run first i can climb up the straight trunk of a tree with rough bark to the first branchesif they are not too far above ground  you ask reddy fox if i cant he knows  thats quite true johnny said old mother nature  you can climb a little but as a real climber you are not much of a success  you are better as a digger  he certainly is all right as a digger exclaimed peter rabbit my how he can make the sand fly  johnny chuck certainly is right at home when it comes to digging  you ought to be thankful that he is said old mother nature for the holes he has dug have saved your life more than once  by the way peter since you are so well acquainted with those holes suppose you tell us what kind of a home johnny chuck has  peter was delighted to air his knowledge  the last one i was in said he was a long tunnel slanting down for quite a distance and then straightening out  the entrance was quite large with a big heap of sand out in front of it  down a little way the tunnel grew smaller and then remained the same size all the rest of the way way down at the farther end was a nice little bedroom with some grass in it  there were one or two other little rooms and there were two branch tunnels leading up to the surface of the ground making side or back doorways  there was no sand around either of these and they were quite hidden by the long grass hanging over them  i dont understand how johnny made those doorways without leaving any sand on the doorsteps  huh interrupted johnny chuck  that was easy enough  i pushed all the sand out of the main doorway so that there would be nothing to attract the attention of any one passing near those back doorways those back doorways are very handy in time of danger  do you always have three doorways asked happy jack  no replied johnny chuck  sometimes i have only two and once in a while only one  but that isnt really safe and i mean always to have at least two  do you use the same house year after year piped up striped chipmunk  johnny shook his head  no said he  i dig a new hole each spring mrs chuck and i like a change of scene  usually my new home isnt very far from my old one because i am not fond of traveling sometimes however if we cannot find a place that just suits us we go quite a distance  are your babies born down in that little bedroom in the ground asked jumper the hare  of course replied johnny chuck  where else would they be born  i didnt know but mrs chuck might make a nest on the ground the way mrs peter and mrs jumper do replied jumper meekly  no siree replied johnny  our babies are born in that little underground bedroom and they stay down in the ground until they are big enough to hunt for food for themselves  how many do you usually have inquired chatterer the red squirrel  six or eight replied johnny chuck  mrs chuck and i believe in large families  do you eat nuts like the rest of our family inquired striped chipmunk  no replied johnny chuck  give me green food every time  there is nothing so good as tender sweet clover and young grass unless it be some of those fine vegetables farmer brown grows in his garden  peter rabbit nodded his head very emphatically as if he quite agreed  i suppose you are what is called a vegetarian then said happy jack to which johnny chuck replied that he supposed he was  and i suppose that is why you sleep all winter added happy jack  if i didnt i would starve responded johnny chuck promptly when it gets near time for jack frost to arrive i stuff and stuff and stuff on the last of the good green things until im so fat i can hardly waddle  then i go down to my bedroom curl up and go to sleep  cold weather snow and ice dont worry me a bit  i know spoke up striped chipmunk  i sleep most of the winter myself  of course i have a lot of food stored away down in my house and once in a while i wake up and eat a little  do you ever wake up in the winter johnny chuck  no replied johnny  i sleep right through thank goodness sometimes i wake up very early in the spring before the snow is all gone earlier than i wish i did  that is where my fat comes in handy  it keeps me warm and keeps me alive until i can find the first green plants  perhaps you have noticed that early in the spring i am as thin as i was fat in the fall  this is because i have used up the fat waiting for the first green things to appear  do you have many enemies asked peter rabbit who has so many himself that he is constantly thinking of them  not many but enough growled johnny chuck  reddy fox old man coyote men and dogs are the worst  of course when i was small i always had to be watching out for hawks and of course like all the rest of us little folks i am afraid of shadow the weasel reddy fox has tried to dig me out more than once but i can dig faster than he can  if he ever gets me cornered hell find that i can fight  a small dog surprised me once before i could get to my hole and i guess that dog never will tackle another woodchuck  time is up interrupted old mother nature  johnny chuck has a big cousin out in the mountains of the great west named whistler and on the prairies of the great west he has a smaller cousin named yap yap  they are quite important members of the marmot family and tomorrow ill tell you about them if you want me to   you need not come tomorrow johnny chuck unless you want to she added  johnny chuck hung his head for he was a little ashamed that he had been so unwilling to come that morning  if you please mother nature said he i think ill come  i didnt know i had any close relatives and i want to know about them  so it was agreed that all would be on hand at sunup the next morning and then everybody started for home to think over the things they had learned    chapter viii  whistler and yap yap  johnny chuck was the first one on hand the next morning  the fact is johnny was quite excited over the discovery that he had some near relatives  he always had supposed that the woodchucks were a family by themselves  now that he knew that he had some close relatives he was filled with quite as much curiosity as ever peter rabbit possessed  just as soon as old mother nature was ready to begin johnny chuck was ready with a question  if you please said he who are my nearest relatives  the marmots of the far west replied old mother nature  you know you are a marmot and these cousins of yours out there are a great deal like you in a general way  the biggest and handsomest of all is whistler who lives in the mountains of the northwest the fact is he is the biggest of all the marmot family  is he much bigger than johnny chuck asked peter rabbit  considerably bigger replied old mother nature nodding her head considerably bigger  i should think he would weight twice as much as johnny  johnnys eyes opened very wide  my he exclaimed i should like to see him  does he look like me  in his shape he does said old mother nature but he has a very much handsomer coat  his coat is a mixture of dark brown and white hairs which give him a grayish color  the upper part of his head his feet and nails are black and so are his ears  a black band runs from behind each ear down to his neck  his chin is pure white and there is white on his nose  underneath he is a light rusty color  his fur is thicker and softer than yours johnny this is because he lives where it is colder  his tail is larger somewhat bushier and is a blackishbrown  if you please why is he called whistler asked johnny chuck eagerly  because he has a sharp clear whistle which can be heard a very long distance replied old mother nature  he sits up just as you do if he sees danger approaching he whistles as a warning to all his relatives within hearing  i suppose it is foolish to ask if he lives in a hole in the ground as johnny chuck does spoke up peter rabbit  he does replied old mother nature  all marmots live in holes in the ground but whistler lives in entirely different country  he lives up on the sides of the mountains often so high that no trees grow there and the ground is rocky  he digs his hole down in between the rocks  it must be a nice safe hole said peter  i guess he doesnt have to worry about being dug out by reddy fox  you guessed quite right laughed old mother nature  nevertheless he has reason to fear being dug out  you see out where he lives grizzly the big cousin of buster bear also lives and grizzly is very fond of a marmot dinner when he can get one  he is so big and strong and has such great claws that he can pull the rocks apart and dig whistler out  by the way i forgot to tell you that whistler is also called the gray marmot and the hoary marmot  he lives on grass and other green things and like johnny chuck gets very fat in the fall and then sleeps all winter  there are one or two other marmots in the far west who live farther south than does whistler but their habits are much the same as those of whistler and johnny chuck  none of them are social  i mean by that you never find two marmot homes very close together  in this they differ from johnnys smaller cousin yap yap the prairie dog  yap yap wouldnt be happy if he didnt have close neighbors of his own kind  he has one of the most social natures of all my little people  tell us about him begged happy jack squirrel before johnny chuck who is naturally slow could ask for the same thing  yap yap is the smallest of the marmot family said old mother nature  in a way he is about as closely related to the ground squirrels as he is to the marmots  johnny chuck has only four claws on each front foot but yap yap has five just as the ground squirrels have  he looks very much like a small chuck dressed in light yellowbrown  his tail for the most part is the same color as his coat but the end is black though there is one member of the family whose tail has a white tip  in each cheek is a small pouch that is a small pocket and this is one of the things that shows how closely related to the spermophiles he is  as i said before yap yap is very social by nature  he lives on the great open plains of the west and southwest frequently where it is very dry and rain seldom falls  when you find his home you are sure to find the homes of many more prairie dogs very close at hand sometimes there are hundreds and hundreds of homes making a regular town  this is because the prairie dogs dearly love the company of their own kind  does yap yap dig the same kind of a hole that i do asked johnny chuck  in a way it is like yours replied old mother nature but at the same time it is different  in the first place it goes almost straight down for a long distance  in the second place there is no mound of sand in front of yap yaps doorway  instead of that the doorway is right in the very middle of the mound of sand  one reason for this is that when it does rain out where yap yap lives it rains very hard indeed so that the water stands on the ground for a short time  the ground being flat a lot of water would run down into yap yaps home and make him most uncomfortable if he did not do something to keep it out  so he brings the sand out and piles it all the way around his doorway and presses it down with his nose in that way he builds up a firm mound which he uses for two purposes one is to keep the water from running down the hole and the other is as a sort of watch tower  he sits on the top of his mound to watch for his enemies  his cousins with the white tail digs a hole more like yours  yap yap loves to visit his neighbors and to have them visit him they are lively little people and do a great deal of talking among themselves  the instant one of them sees an enemy he gives a signal then every prairie dog scampers for his own hole and dives in head first  almost at once he pops his head out again to see what the danger may be  how can he do that without going clear to the bottom to turn around demanded peter  i wondered if any of you would think of that question chuckled old mother nature  just a little way down from the entrance yap yap digs a little room at one side of his tunnel  all he has to do is to scramble into that turn around and then pop his head out as i said before his tunnel goes down very deep then it turns and goes almost equally far underground  down there he has a nice little bedroom  sometimes he has more than one  if it is so dry out where he lives how does he get water to drink asked happy jack  he doesnt have to drink replied old mother nature  some folks think that he digs down until he finds water way down underneath but this isnt so  he doesnt have to have water  he gets all the moisture he needs from the green things he eats  i suppose like the rest of us he has lots of enemies said peter  old mother nature nodded  of course said she  old man coyote and reddy fox are very fond of prairie dog  so are members of the hawk family  then in some places there is a cousin of shadow the weasel called the blackfooted ferret  he is to be feared most of all because he can follow yap yap down into his hole  there is a cousin of hooty the owl called the burrowing owl because it builds its home in a hole in the ground  you are likely to find many burrowing owls living in prairie dog villages  also you are apt to find buzztail the rattlesnake there  a lot of people believe that yap yap buzztail and the little burrowing owl are the best of friends and often live together in the same hole  this isnt so at all  buzztail is very fond of young prairie dog and so is the burrowing owl  rather than dig a hole for himself the owl will sometimes take possession of one of yap yaps deserted holes  if he should make a mistake and enter a hole in which yap yap was at home the chances are that yap yap would kill the owl for he knows that the owl is an enemy  buzztail the rattlesnake also makes use of prairie dog holes but it is safe to say that if there are any prairie dog babies down there they never live to see what the outside world is like  so buzztail and the burrowing owl are really enemies instead of friends of yap yap the prairie dog  why is he called a dog asked peter  old mother nature laughed right out  goodness knows said she  he doesnt look like a dog and he doesnt act like a dog so why people should call him a dog i dont know unless it is because of his habit of barking and even his bark isnt at all like a dogsnot nearly so much so as the bark of reddy fox  now i guess this will do for today  havent you little folks had enough of school  no cried peter rabbit and jumper the hare and happy jack and chatterer the red squirrel and striped chipmunk and johnny chuck we want to know about the rest of the members of the order of rodents or gnawers added peter  of course in a way they are sort of related to us and we want to know about them  old mother nature laughed goodnaturedly  all right said she come again tomorrow morning and well see what more we can learn    chapter ix  two queer little haymakers  there is nothing like a little knowledge to make one want more johnny chuck who had gone to school only because old mother nature had sent for him had become as full of curiosity as peter rabbit the discovery that he had a big handsome cousin whistler the marmot living in the mountains of the far west had given johnny something to think about  it seemed to johnny such a queer place for a member of his family to live that he wanted to know more about it  so johnny had a question all ready when old mother nature called school to order the next morning  if you please mother nature said he does my cousin whistler have any neighbors up among those rocks where he lives  he certainly does replied old mother nature nodding her head he has for a near neighbor one of the quaintest and most interesting little members of the big order to which you all belong  and that order is what she asked abruptly  the order of rodents replied peter rabbit promptly  right peter replied old mother nature smiling at peter  i asked that just to see if you really are learning  i wanted to make sure that i am not wasting my time with you little folks now this little neighbor of whistler is little chief hare  instantly peter rabbit and jumper the hare pricked up their long ears and became more interested than ever if that were possible i thought you had told us all about our family cried jumper but you didnt mention little chief  no said old mother nature i didnt and the reason i didnt was because little chief isnt a member of your family  he is called little chief hare but he isnt a hare at all although he looks much like a small rabbit with short hind legs and rounded ears  he has a family all to himself and should be called a pika some folks do call him that but more call him a cony and some call him the crying hare  this is because he uses his voice a great deal which is something no member of the hare family does in size he is just about as big as one of your halfgrown babies peter so you see he really is a very little fellow  his coat is grayishbrown  his ears are of good size but instead of being long are round  he has small bright eyes  his legs are short his hind legs being very little longer than his front ones  he has hair on the soles of his feet just like the members of the hare family  what about his tail piped up peter rabbit  you know peter is very much interested in tails  old mother nature smiled  he is worse off than you peter said she for he hasnt any at all  that is he hasnt any that can be seen  he lives way up among the rocks of the great mountains above where the trees grow and often is a very near neighbor to whistler  i suppose that means that he makes his home down in under rocks the same as whistler does spoke up johnny chuck  right replied old mother nature  he is such a little fellow that he can get through very narrow places and he has his home and barns way down in among the rocks  barns exclaimed happy jack squirrel  barns  what do you mean by barns  old mother nature laughed  i just call them barns said she because they are the places where he stores away his hay just as farmer brown stores away his hay in his barn  i suppose you would call them storehouses  at the mention of hay peter rabbit sat bolt upright and his eyes were wide open with astonishment  did you say hay he exclaimed where under the sun does he get hay way up there and what does he want of it  there was a twinkle in old mother natures eyes as she replied he makes that hay just as you see farmer brown make hay every summer  it is what he lives on in the winter and in bad weather little chief knows just as much about the proper way of making hay as farmer brown does  even way up among the rocks there are places where grass and peasvines and other green things grow  little chief lives on these in summer  but he is as wise and thrifty as any squirrel another way in which he differs from the hare family he cuts them when they are ready for cutting and spreads them out on the rocks to dry in the sun  he knows that if he should take them down into his barns while they are fresh and green they would sour and spoil so he never stores them away until they are thoroughly dry  then of course they are hay for hay is nothing but sundried grass cut before it has begun to die  when his hay is just as dry as it should be he takes it down and stores it away in his barns which are nothing but little caves down in among the rocks  there he has it for use in winter when there is no green food  little chief is so nearly the color of the rocks that it takes sharp eyes to see him when he is sitting still  he has a funny little squeaking voice and he uses it a great deal  it is a funny voice because it is hard to tell just where it comes from  it seems to come from nowhere in particular  sometimes he can be heard squeaking way down in his home under the rocks  like johnny chuck he prefers to sleep at night and be abroad during the day  because he is so small he must always be on the lookout for enemies  at the first hint of danger he scampers to safety in among the rocks and there he scolds whoever has frightened him  there is no more loveable little person in all my great family than this little haymaker of the mountains of the great west  that haymaking is a pretty good idea of little chiefs remarked peter rabbit scratching a long ear with a long hind foot  ive a great mind to try it myself  everybody laughed right out for everybody knew just how easygoing and thriftless peter was  peter himself grinned  he couldnt help it  that would be a very good idea peter said old mother nature by the way there is another haymaker out in those same great mountains of the far west  who demanded peter and johnny chuck and happy jack squirrel all in the same breath  stubtail the mountain beaver declared peter promptly  i suppose stubtail is his cousin  old mother nature shook her head  no said she  no  stubtail and paddy are no more closely related than the rest of you  stubtail isnt a beaver at all  his proper name is sewellel  sometimes he is called showtl and sometimes the boomer and sometimes the chehalis but most folks call him the mountain beaver  is it because he looks like paddy the beaver striped chipmunk asked  no replied old mother nature  he looks more like jerry muskrat than he does like paddy  he is about jerrys size and looks very much as jerry would if he had no tail  hasnt he any tail at all asked peter  yes he has a little tail a little stub of a tail but it is so small that to look at him you would think he hadnt any replied old mother nature  he is found out in the same mountains of the far west where whistler and little chief live but instead of living way up high among the rocks he is at home down in the valleys where the ground is soft and the trees grow thickly  stubtail has no use for rocks  he wants soft wet ground where he can tunnel and tunnel to his hearts content  in one thing stubtail is very like yap yap the prairie dog  what is that asked johnny chuck quickly for you know yap yap is johnnys cousin  in his social habits replied old mother nature  stubtail isnt fond of living alone  he wants company of his own kind  so wherever you find stubtail you are likely to find many of his family  they like to go visiting back and forth  they make little paths between their homes and all about through the thick ferns and they keep these little paths free and clear so that they may run along them easily  some of these little paths lead into long tunnels  these are made for safety  usually the ground is so wet that there will be water running in the bottoms of these little tunnels  what kind of a house does stubtail have inquired johnny chuck interestedly  a hole in the ground of course replied old mother nature  it is dug where the ground is drier than where the runways are made mrs stubtail makes a nest of dried ferns and close by they build two or three storehouses for stubtail and mrs stubtail are thrifty people  i suppose he fills them with hay for you said he is a haymaker remarked happy jack squirrel who is always interested in storehouses  yes replied old mother nature he puts hay in them  he cuts grasses ferns peavines and other green plants and carries them in little bundles to the entrance to his tunnel  there he piles them on sticks so as to keep them off he damp ground and so that the air can help dry them out  when they are dry he takes them inside and stores them away  he also stores other things  he likes the roots of ferns  he cuts tender young twigs from bushes and stores away some of these  he is fond of bark  in winter he is quite as active as in summer and tunnels about under the snow then he sometimes has peter rabbits bad habit of killing trees by gnawing bark all around as high up as he can reach  can he climb trees asked chatterer the red squirrel  just about as much as johnny chuck can replied old mother nature sometimes he climbs up in low bushes or in small lowbranching trees to cut off tender shoots but he doesnt do much of this sort of thing  his home is the ground  he is most active at night but where undisturbed is out more or less during the day  when he wants to cut off a twig he sits up like a squirrel and holds the twig in his hands while he bites it off with his sharp teeth  you didnt tell us what color his coat is said peter rabbit  i told you he looked very much like jerry muskrat replied old mother nature  his coat is brown much the color of jerrys but his fur is not nearly so soft and fine  i suppose he has enemies just as the rest of us little people have said peter  of course replied old mother nature  all little people have enemies and most big ones too for that matter  king eagle is one and yowler the bob cat is another  they are always watching for stubtail  that is why he digs so many tunnels  he can travel under the ground then  my goodness how time flies  scamper home all of you for i have too much to do to talk any more today    chapter x  prickly porky and grubby gopher  all the way to school the next morning peter rabbit wondered who they would learn about that day  he was so busy wondering that he was heedless  peter is apt to be heedless at times  the result was that as he hopped out of a brambletangle just within the edge of the green forest he all but landed in something worse than the worst brambles that ever grew  it was only by a wild side jump that he saved himself  peter had almost landed among the thousand little spears of prickly porky the porcupine  gracious exclaimed peter  why dont you look where you are going grunted prickly porky plainly he was rather peevish  it wouldnt be my fault if you had a few of my little spears sticking in you this very minute and it would serve you right  he waddled along a few steps then began talking again  i dont see why old mother nature sent for me this morning he grumbled  i hate a long walk  peter pricked up his long ears  i know he cried  youre going to school prickly porky  youre a rodent and we are going to learn all about you this morning  im not a rodent im a porcupine grunted prickly porky indignantly  youre a rodent just the same  youve got big gnawing teeth and any one with that kind of teeth is a rodent retorted peter  then at a sudden thought a funny look passed over his face  why that means that you and i are related in a way he added  dont believe it grunted prickly porky still shuffling along dont believe it  dont want to be related to anybody as heedless as you  what is this school anyway  dont want to go to school  know all i want to know  know how to get all i want to eat and how to make everybody get out of my way and leave me alone and thats enough to know  he rattled the thousand little spears hidden in his coat and peter shivered at the sound  it was a most unpleasant sound  well some folks do like to be stupid snapped peter and hurried on lippertylippertylip while prickly porky slowly shuffled and rattled along behind  all the others were there when peter arrived  prickly porky wasnt even in sight  old mother nature wasted no time  she has too much to do ever to waste time  she called the school to order at once  yesterday she began i told you about two little haymakers of the high mountains of the far west  who were they peter rabbit  little chief hare called the pika or cony and stubtail the mountain beaver or sewellel replied peter with great promptness  right said old mother nature now i am going to tell you of one of my little plowmen who also lives in the far west but prefers the great plains to the high mountains though he is sometimes found in the latter  he is grubby the gopher a member of the same order the rest of you belong to but of a family quite his own  he is properly called the pocket gopher and way down in the southeast where he is also found he is called a salamander though what for i havent the least idea  does he have pockets in his cheeks like mine asked striped chipmunk eagerly  he has pockets in his cheeks and that is why he is called pocket gopher replied old mother nature but they are not at all like yours striped chipmunk  yours are on the inside of your cheeks but his are on the outside  how funny exclaimed striped chipmunk  your pockets are small compared with those of grubby continued old mother nature  one of his covers almost the whole side of his head back to his short neck and it is lined with fur and remember he has two of them  grubby uses these for carrying food and never for carrying out earth when he is digging a tunnel as some folks think he does  he stuffs them full with his front feet and empties them by pressing them from the back with his feet the gopher family is quite large and the members range in size from the size of danny meadow mouse to that of robber the rat only these bigger members are stouter and heavier than robber some are reddishbrown and some are gray  but whatever his size and wherever he is found grubbys habits are the same  all this time peter rabbit had been fidgeting about  it was quite clear that peter had something on his mind  now as old mother nature paused peter found the chance he had been waiting for if you please why did you call him a plowman he asked eagerly  im coming to that all in due time replied old mother nature smiling at peters eagerness  grubby gopher spends most of his life underground very much like miner the mole whom you all know  he can dig tunnels just about as fast  his legs are short and his front legs and feet are very stout and strong  they are armed with very long strong claws and it is with these and the help of his big cutting teeth that grubby digs  he throws the earth under him and then kicks it behind him with his hind feet when he has quite a pile behind him he turns around and with his front feet and head pushes it along to a little side tunnel and then up to the surface of the ground  as soon as he has it all out he plugs up the opening and goes back to digging  the loose earth he has pushed out makes little mounds and he makes one of these mounds every few feet  grubby is a great worker  he is very industrious  since he is underground it doesnt make much difference to him whether it be night or day  in summer during the hottest part of the day he rests  his eyes are small and weak because he has little use for them coming out on the surface very seldom and then usually in the dusk  he has a funny little tail without any hair on it this is very sensitive and serves him as a sort of guide when he runs backward along his tunnel which he can do quite fast  a funny thing about those long claws on his front feet is that he folds them under when he is walking or running  do any of you know why farmer brown plows his garden  as she asked this old mother nature looked from one to another and each in turn shook his head  it is to mix the dead vegetable matter thoroughly with the earth so that the roots of the plants may get it easily explained old mother nature  by making those tunnels in every direction and bringing up the earth below to the surface grubby gopher does the same thing  that is why i call him my little plowman  he loosens up the hard packed earth and mixes the vegetable matter with it and so makes it easy for seeds to sprout and plants to grow  then he must be one of the farmers best friends spoke up happy jack squirrel  old mother nature shook her head  he has been in the past said she  he has done a wonderful work in helping make the land fit for farming  but where land is being farmed he is a dreadful pest i am sorry to say  you see he eats the crops the farmer tries to raise and the new mounds he is all the time throwing up bury a lot of the young plants and in the meadows make it very hard to use a mowing machine for cutting hay  then grubby gets into young orchards and cuts off all the tender roots of young trees  this kills them  you see he is fond of tender roots seeds stems of grass and grain and is never happier than when he can find a field of potatoes  being such a worker he has to have a great deal to eat  then too he stores away a great deal for winter for he doesnt sleep in winter as johnny chuck does  he even tunnels about under the snow  sometimes he fills these little snow tunnels with the earth he brings up from below and when the snow melts it leaves queer little earth ridges to show where the tunnels were  grubby is very neat in his habits and keeps his home and himself very clean  during the day he leaves one of his mounds open for a little while to let in fresh air  but it is only for a little while  then he closes it again  he doesnt dare leave it open very long for fear shadow the weasel or a certain big snake called the gopher snake will find it and come in after him  digger the badger is the only one of his enemies who can dig fast enough to dig him out but at night when he likes to come out for a little air or to cut grain and grass he must always watch for hooty the owl  old man coyote and members of the hawk family are always looking for him by day so you see he has plenty of enemies like the rest of you  he got the name gopher because that comes from a word meaning honeycomb and grubbys tunnels go in every direction until the ground is like honeycomb  he isnt a bit social and has rather a mean disposition  he is always ready to fight  on the plains he has done a great deal to make the soil fine and rich as i have already told you but on hillsides he does a great deal of harm the water runs down his tunnels and washes away the soil  because of this and the damage he does to crops man is his greatest enemy  but man has furnished him with new and splendid foods easy to get and so grubbys family increases faster than it used to in spite of traps and poison  hello  see whos here  it is about time  there was a shuffling and rattling and grunting and prickly porky climbed up on an old stump looking very peevish and much out of sorts  he had come to school much against his will    chapter xi  a fellow with a thousand spears  there said old mother nature pointing to prickly porky the porcupine is next to the largest member of your order which is  order of rodents piped up striped chipmunk  he is not only next to the largest but is the stupidest continued old mother nature  at least that is what people say of him though i suspect he isnt as stupid as he sometimes seems  anyway he manages to keep well fed and escape his enemies which is more than can be said for some others who are supposed to have quick wits  escaping his enemies is no credit to him  they are only too glad to keep out of his way he doesnt have to fear anybody said chatterer the red squirrel to his cousin happy jack  his remark didnt escape the keen ears of old mother nature  are you sure about that she demanded  now theres pekan the fisher  she was interrupted by a great rattling on the old stump  everybody turned to look  there was prickly porky backing down as fast as he could which wasnt fast at all and rattling his thousand little spears as he did so  it was really very funny  everybody had to laugh even old mother nature  you see it was plain that he was in a great hurry yet every movement was slow and clumsy  well prickly porky what does this mean  where are you going demanded old mother nature  prickly porky turned his dulllooking eyes towards her and in them was a troubled worried look  wheres pekan the fisher he asked and his voice shook a little with something very much like fear  old mother nature understood instantly  when she had said now theres pekan the fisher prickly porky had waited to hear no more  he had instantly thought that she meant that pekan was right there somewhere  its all right prickly porky said she pekan isnt anywhere around here so climb back on that stump and dont worry  had you waited for me to finish you would have saved yourself a fright  chatterer had just said that you didnt have to fear anybody and i was starting to explain that he was wrong that despite your thousand little spears you have reason to fear pekan the fisher  prickly porky shivered and this made the thousand little spears in his coat rattle  it was such a surprising thing to see prickly porky actually afraid that the other little folks almost doubted their own eyes  are you quite sure that pekan isnt anywhere around asked prickly porky and his voice still shook  quite sure replied old mother nature  if he were i wouldnt allow him to hurt you  you ought to know that  now sit up so that every one can get a good look at you  prickly porky sat up and the others gathered around the foot of the stump to look at him  he certainly is no beauty murmured happy jack squirrel  happy jack was quite right  he was anything but handsome  the truth is he was the homeliest clumsiestlooking fellow in all the green forest  he was a little bigger than bobby coon and his body was thick and heavylooking  his back humped up like an arch  his head was rather small for the size of his body short and rather round  his neck was even shorter  his eyes were small and very dull  it was plain that he couldnt see far or clearly unless what he was looking at was close at hand  his ears were small and nearly hidden in hair  his front teeth the gnawing teeth which showed him to be a rodent were very large and bright orange  his legs were short and stout  he had four toes on each front foot and five on each hind foot and these were armed with quite long stout claws  but the queerest thing and the most interesting thing about prickly porky was his coat  not one among the other little people of the green forest has a coat anything like his  most of them have a soft short under fur protected and more or less hidden by longer coarser hair  prickly porky had the long coarse hair and on his back it was very long and coarse brownishblack in color up to the tips which were white  under this long hair was some soft woolly fur but what that long hair hid chiefly was an array of wickedlooking little spears called quills  they were white to the tips which were dark and very very sharply pointed  all down the sides were tiny barbs so small as hardly to be seen but there just the same  on his head the quills were about an inch long but on his back they were four inches long becoming shorter towards the tail  the latter was rather short stout and covered with short quills  as he sat there on that old stump some of prickly porkys little spears could be seen peeping out from the long hair on his back but they didnt look particularly dangerous  peter rabbit suddenly made a discovery  why he exclaimed  he hasnt any little spears on the under side of him  i wondered who would be the first to notice that said old mother nature  no prickly porky hasnt any little spears underneath and pekan the fisher has found that out  he knows that if he can turn prickly porky on his back he can kill him without much danger from those little spears and he has learned how to do that very thing  that is why prickly porky is afraid of him  now prickly porky climb down off that stump and show these little folks what you do when an enemy comes near  grumbling and growling prickly porky climbed down to the ground then he tucked his head down between his front paws and suddenly the thousand little spears appeared all over him pointing in every direction until he looked like a giant chestnut burr  then he began to thrash his tail from side to side  what is he doing that for asked johnny chuck looking rather puzzled  go near enough to be hit by it and youll understand said old mother nature dryly  that is his one weapon  whoever is hit by that tail will find himself full of those little spears and will take care never to go near prickly porky again  once those little spears have entered the skin they keep working in deeper and deeper and more than one of his enemies has been killed by them on account of those tiny barbs they are hard to pull out and pulling them out hurts dreadfully  just try one and see  but no one was anxious to try so old mother nature paused only a moment  you will notice that he moves that tail quickly she continued  it is the only thing about him which is quick  when he has a chance in time of danger he likes to get his head under a log or rock instead of putting it between his paws as he is doing now  then he plants his feet firmly and waits for a chance to use that tail  is it true that he can throw those little spears at folks asked peter  old mother nature shook her head  there isnt a word of truth in it she declared  that story probably was started by some one who was hit by his tail and it was done so quickly that the victim didnt see the tail move and so thought the little spears were thrown at him  how does he make all those little spears stand up that way asked jumper the hare  he has a special set of muscles for just that purpose explained old mother nature  when those quills stick into some one they must pull out of prickly porkys own skin i should think that would hurt him spoke up striped chipmunk  not at all replied old mother nature  they are very loosely fastened in his skin and come out at the least little pull  new ones grow to take the place of those he loses  notice that he puts his whole foot flat on the ground just as buster bear and bobby coon do and just as those twolegged creatures called men do  very few animals do this and those that do are said to be plantigrade  now prickly porky tell us what you eat and where you make your home and that will end todays lesson  i eat bark twigs and leaves mostly grunted prickly porky ungraciously  i like hemlock best of all but also eat poplar pine and other trees for a change  sometimes i stay in a tree for days until i have stripped it of all its bark and leaves  i dont see any sense in moving about any more than is necessary  but that must kill the tree exclaimed peter rabbit  well what of it demanded prickly porky crossly  there are plenty of trees  in summer i like lily pads and always get them when i can  can you swim asked peter eagerly  of course grunted prickly porky  i never see you out on the green meadows said peter  and you never will retorted prickly porky  the green forest for me every time  summer or winter im at home there  dont you sleep through the cold weather the way buster bear and i do asked johnny chuck  what should i sleep for grumbled prickly porky  cold weather doesnt bother me  i like it  i have the green forest pretty much to myself then  i like to be alone  and as long as there are trees there is plenty to eat  i sleep a great deal in the daytime because i like night best  what about your home asked happy jack  home is wherever i happen to be most of the time but mrs porky has a home in a hollow log or a cave or under the roots of a tree where the babies are born  i guess thats all ive got to tell you  you might add that those babies are big for the size of their mother and have a full supply of quills when they are born said old mother nature  and you forgot to say how fond of salt you are and how often this fondness gets you into trouble around the camps of men  your fear of pekan the fisher we all saw  i might add that puma the panther is to be feared at times and when he is very hungry buster bear will take a chance on turning you on your back  by the way dont any of you call prickly porky a hedgehog  he isnt any thing of the kind  he is sometimes called a quill pig but his real name porcupine is best  he has no near relatives  tomorrow morning instead of meeting here well hold school on the shore of the pond paddy the beaver has made school is dismissed    chapter xii  a lumberman and engineer  johnny chuck and striped chipmunk were the only ones who were not on hand at the pond of paddy the beaver deep in the green forest at sunup the next morning  johnny and striped chipmunk were afraid to go so far from home  to the surprise of everybody prickly porky was there  he must have traveled all night to get here he is such a slowpoke said peter rabbit to his cousin jumper the hare  peter wasnt far from the truth  but how ever he got there there he was reaching for lily pads from an old log which lay half in the water and appearing very well satisfied with life  you know there is nothing like a good meal of things you like to make everything seem just as it should  old mother nature seated herself on one end of paddys dam and called the school to order  just as she did so a brown head popped out of the water close by and a pair of anxious eyes looked up at old mother nature  it is quite all right paddy said she softly  these little folks are trying to gain a little knowledge of themselves and other folks and we are going to have this mornings lesson right here because it is to be about you  paddy the beaver no longer looked anxious  there was a sparkle in his eyes  may i stay he asked eagerly  if there is a chance to learn anything i dont want to miss it  before old mother nature could reply peter rabbit spoke up  but the lesson is to be about you and your family  do you expect to learn anything about yourself he demanded and chuckled as if he thought that a great joke  it seems to me that some one named peter learned a great deal about his own family when he first came to school to me said old mother nature  peter had grace enough to hang his head and look ashamed of course you may stay paddy  in fact i want you to  there are some things i shall want you to explain  that is why we are holding school over here this morning  just come up here on your dam where we can all get a good look at you  paddy the beaver climbed out on his dam  it was the first time happy jack squirrel ever had seen him out of water and happy jack gave a little gasp of surprise  i had no idea he is so big he exclaimed  he is the biggest of all the rodents in this country and one of the biggest in all the great world  also he is the smartest member of the whole order said old mother nature  he doesnt look it said chatterer the squirrel with a saucy jerk of his tail  which means i suppose that you havent the least doubt that you are quite as smart as he said old mother nature quietly and chatterer looked both guilty and a little bit ashamed  ill admit that you are smart chatterer but often it is in a wrong way paddy is smart in the very best way  he is a lumberman builder and engineer  a lot of my little people are workers but they are destructive workers  the busier they are the more they destroy paddy the beaver is a constructive worker  that means that he is a builder instead of a destroyer  how about all those trees he cuts down  if that isnt destroying i dont know what is said chatterer and with each word jerked his tail as if somehow his tongue and tail were connected  so it is replied old mother nature goodnaturedly  but just think of the number of trees you destroy  i never have destroyed a tree in my life declared chatterer indignantly  yes you have retorted old mother nature  i never have contradicted chatterer quite forgetting to whom he was speaking  but old mother nature overlooked this  i dont suppose you ever ate a chestnut or a fat hickory nut or a sweet beechnut said she softly  of course retorted chatterer sharply  ive eaten ever and ever and ever so many of them  what of it  in the heart of each one was a little tree explained old mother nature  but for you very many of those little trees would have sprung up and some day would have made big trees  so you see for every tree paddy has destroyed you probably have destroyed a hundred  you eat the nuts that you may live  paddy cuts down the trees that he may live for the bark of those trees is his food like prickly porky he lives chiefly on bark  but unlike prickly porky he doesnt destroy a tree for the bark alone  he wastes nothing  he makes use of every bit of that tree  he does something for the green forest in return for the trees he takes  chatterer looked at happy jack and blinked in a puzzled way happy jack looked at peter rabbit and blinked  peter looked at jumper the hare and blinked  jumper looked at prickly porky and blinked  then all looked at paddy the beaver and finally at old mother nature and all blinked  old mother nature chuckled  dont you think the green forest is more beautiful because of this little pond she asked  everybody nodded  of course she continued  but there wouldnt be any little pond here were it not for paddy and the trees he has cut  he destroyed the trees in order to make the pond  that is what i meant when i called him a constructive worker  now i want you all to take a good look at paddy  then he will show us just how as a lumberman he cuts trees as a builder he constructs houses and dams and as an engineer he digs canals  as paddy sat there on his dam he looked rather like a giant member of the rat family though his head was more like that of a squirrel than a rat  his body was very thick and heavy and in color he was dark brown lighter underneath than above  squatting there on the dam his back was rounded  all together he was a very clumsylooking fellow  peter rabbit appeared to be interested in just one thing paddys tail  he couldnt keep his eyes off it  old mother nature noticed this  well peter said she what have you on your mind now  that tail replied peter  thats the queerest tail ive ever seen  i should think it would be heavy and dreadfully in the way  old mother nature laughed  if you ask him paddy will tell you that that tail is the handiest tail in the green forest said she there isnt another like it in all the great world and if youll be patient you will see just how handy it is  it was a queerlooking tail  it was broad and thick and flat oval in shape and covered with scales instead of hair  just then jumper the hare made a discovery  why he exclaimed paddy has feet like honker the goose  only my hind feet said paddy  they have webs between the toes just as honkers have  that is for swimming  but there are no webs between my fingers  he held up a hand for all to see  sure enough the fingers were free  now that everybody has had a good look at you paddy said old mother nature suppose you swim over to where you have been cutting trees  we will join you there and then you can show us just how you work  paddy slipped into the water where for a second or two he floated with just his head above the surface  then he quickly raised his broad heavy tail and brought it down on the water with a slap that sounded like the crack of a terrible gun  it was so loud and unexpected that every one save old mother nature and prickly porky jumped with fright  peter rabbit happened to be right on the edge of the dam and because he jumped before he had time to think he jumped right into the water with a splash  now peter doesnt like the water as you know and he scrambled out just as fast as ever he could  how the others did laugh at him  what did he do that for demanded peter indignantly  to show you one use he has for that handy tail replied old mother nature that is the way he gives warning to his friends whenever he discovers danger  did you notice how he used his tail to aid him in swimming  he turns it almost on edge and uses it as a rudder those big webbed hind feet are the paddles which drive him through the water  he can stay under water a long timeas much as five minutes  see he has just come up now  sure enough paddys head had just appeared clear across the pond almost to the opposite shore and he was now swimming on the surface old mother nature at once led the way around the pond to a small grove of poplar trees which stood a little way back from the water paddy was already there  now said old mother nature show us what kind of a lumberman you are  paddy picked out a small tree sat up much as happy jack squirrel does but with his big flat tail on the ground to brace him seized the trunk of the tree in both hands and went to work with his great orangecolored cutting teeth  he bit out a big chip then another and another  gradually he worked around the tree after a while the tree began to sway and crack  paddy bit out two or three more chips then suddenly slapped the ground with his tail as a warning and scampered back to a safe distance  he was taking no chances of being caught under that falling tree  the tree fell and at once paddy returned to work  the smaller branches he cut off with a single bite at the base of each the larger ones required a number of bites  then he set to work to cut the trunk up in short logs  at this point old mother nature interrupted  now show us said she what you do with the logs  paddy at once got behind a log and by pushing rolled it ahead of him until at last it fell with a splash in the water of a ditch or canal which led from near that grove of trees to the pond paddy followed into the water and began to push it ahead of him towards the pond  that will do spoke up old mother nature come out and show us how you take the branches  obediently paddy climbed out and returned to the fallen tree  there he picked up one of the long branches in his mouth grasping it near the butt twisted it over his shoulder and started to drag it to the canal  when he reached the latter he entered the water and began swimming still dragging the branch in the same way  once more old mother nature stopped him  youve shown us how you cut trees and move them so now i want you to answer a few questions said she  paddy climbed out and squatted on the bank  how did this canal happen to be here handy asked old mother nature  why i dug it of course replied paddy looking surprised  you see im rather slow and clumsy on land and dont like to be far from water  those trees are pretty well back from the pond so i dug this canal which brings the water almost to them  it makes it safer for me in case old man coyote or buster bear or yowler the bobcat happens to be looking for a beaver dinner  also it makes it very much easier to get my logs and branches to the pond  old mother nature nodded  just so said she  i want the rest of you to notice how well this canal has been dug  at the other end it is carried along the bottom of the pond where the water is shallow so as to give greater depth  now you will understand why i called paddy an engineer  what do you do with your logs and branches paddy  put them in my foodpile out there where the water is deep near my house replied paddy promptly  the bark i eat and the bare sticks i use to keep my house and dam in repair  in the late fall i cut enough trees to keep me in food all winter  when my pond is covered with ice i have nothing to worry about my food supply is below the ice  when i am hungry i swim out under the ice get a stick take it back into my house and eat the bark  then i take the bare stick outside to use when needed on my dam or house  how did you come to make this fine pond  asked old mother nature  oh i just happened to come exploring up the laughing brook and found there was plenty of food here and a good place for a pond replied paddy  i thought i would like to live here  down where my dam is the laughing brook was shallowjust the place for a dam  tell us why you wanted a pond and how you built that dam commanded old mother nature  why i had to have a pond if i was to stay here replied paddy as if every one must understand that  the laughing brook wasnt deep or big enough for me to live here safely  if it had been i would have made my home in the bank and not bothered with a house or dam  but it wasnt so i had to make a pond  it required a lot of hard work but it is worth all it cost  first i cut a lot of brush and young trees and placed them in the laughing brook in that shallow place with the butts pointing upstream  i kept them in place by piling mud and stones on them then i kept piling on more sticks and brush and mud  the water brought down leaves and floating stuff and this caught in the dam and helped fill it in  i dug a lot of mud in front of it and used this to fill in the spaces between the sticks  this made the water deeper in front of the dam and at the same time kept it from getting through  as the water backed up of course it made a pond i kept making my dam longer and higher and the longer and higher it became the bigger the pond grew  when it was big enough and deep enough to suit me i stopped work on the dam and built my house out there  everybody turned to look at paddys house the roof of which stood high out of water a little way from the dam  tell us how you built that said old mother nature quietly  oh i just made a big platform of sticks and mud out there where it was deep enough for me to be sure that the water could not freeze clear to the bottom even in the coldest weather replied paddy in a matteroffact tone  i built it up until it was above water  then i built the walls and roof of sticks and mud just as you see them there  inside i have a fine big room with a comfortable bed of shredded wood  i have two openings in the floor with a long passage leading from each down through the foundations and opening at the bottom of the pond  of course these are filled with water  some houses have only one passage but i like two  these are the only entrances to my house  every fall i repair my walls and roof adding sticks and mud and turf so that now they are very thick  late in the fall i sometimes plaster the outside with mud  this freezes hard and no enemy who may reach my house on the ice can tear it open  i guess thats all  peter rabbit drew a long breath  what dreadful lot of work said he  do you work all the time  paddy chuckled  no peter said he  and old mother nature nodded in approval  quite right said she  quite right  are there any more questions  do you eat nothing but bark  it was happy jack squirrel who spoke  oh no replied paddy  in summer i eat berries mushrooms grass and the leaves and stems of a number of plants  in winter i vary my fare with lily roots and the roots of alder and willow  but bark is my principal food  old mother nature waited a few minutes but as there were no more questions she added a few words  now i hope you understand why i am so proud of paddy the beaver and why i told you that he is a lumberman builder and engineer said she  for the next lesson we will take up the rat family    chapter xiii  a worker and a robber  now we come to the largest family of the rodent order the rat family which of course includes the mice said old mother nature after calling school to order at the old meetingplace  and the largest member of the family reminds me very much of the one we learned about yesterday  i know cried peter rabbit  you mean jerry muskrat  go to the head of the class peter said old mother nature smiling  jerry is the very one the largest member of the rat family  sometimes he is spoken of as a little cousin of paddy the beaver  probably this is because he looks something like a small beaver builds a house in the water as paddy does and lives in very much the same way  the truth is he is no more closely related to paddy than he is to the rest of you  he is a true rat  he is called muskrat because he carries with him a scent called musk  it is not an unpleasant scent like that of jimmy skunk and isnt used for the same purpose  jerry uses his to tell his friends where he has been  he leaves a little of it at the places he visits  some folks call him musquash but muskrat is better  jerry is seldom found far from the water and then only when he is seeking a new home  he is rather slow and awkward on land but in the water he is quite at home as all of you know who have visited the smiling pool  he can dive and swim under water a long distance though not as far as paddy the beaver  has he webbed hind feet like paddy piped up jumper the hare  yes and no replied old mother nature  they are not fully webbed as paddys are but there is a little webbing between some of the toes enough to be of great help in swimming  his tail is of greater use in swimming than is paddys  it is bare and scaly but instead of being flat top and bottom it is flattened on the sides and he uses it as a propeller moving it rapidly from side to side  like paddy he has a dark brown outer coat lighter underneath than on his back and sides and like paddy he has a very warm soft under coat through which the water cannot get and which keeps him comfortable no matter how cold the water is  you have all seen his house in the smiling pool  he builds it in much the same way that paddy builds his but instead of sticks he cuts and uses rushes  of course it is not nearly as large as paddys house because jerry is himself so much smaller  it is arranged much the same with a comfortable bedroom and one or more passages down to deep water  in winter jerry spends much of his time in this house going out only for food  then he lives chiefly on lily roots and roots of other water plants digging them up and taking them back to his house to eat  when the ice is clear you can sometimes see him swimming below  i know spoke up peter rabbit  once i was crossing the smiling pool on the ice and saw him right under me  jerry doesnt build dams but he sometimes digs little canals along the bottom where the water isnt deep enough to suit him continued old mother nature  sometimes in the winter jerry and mrs jerry share their home with two or three friends  if there is a good bank jerry usually has another home in that  he makes the entrance under water and then tunnels back and up for some distance where he builds a snug little bedroom just below the surface of the ground where it is dry  usually he has more than one tunnel leading to this and sometimes an opening from above this is covered with sticks and grass to hide it and provides an entrance for fresh air  jerry lives mostly on roots and plants but is fond of mussels or freshwater clams fish some insects and i am sorry to say young birds when he can catch them  jerry could explain where some of the babies of mr and mrs quack the ducks have disappeared to paddy the beaver doesnt eat flesh at all  jerry and mrs jerry have several families in a year and jerry is a very good father doing his share in caring for the babies he and mrs jerry are rather social and enjoy visiting neighbors of their own kind  their voices are a sort of squeak and you can often hear them talking among the rushes in the early evening that is the hour they like best though they are abroad during the day when undisturbed  man is their greatest enemy  he hunts and traps them for their warm coats  but they have to watch out for hooty the owl at night and for reddy fox and old man coyote whenever they are on land  billy mink also is an enemy at times perhaps the most to be dreaded because he can follow jerry anywhere  jerry makes little landings of mud and rushes along the edge of the shore  on these he delights to sit to eat his meals  he likes apples and vegetables and sometimes will travel quite a distance to get them  late in the summer he begins to prepare for winter by starting work on his house if he is to have a new one  he is a good worker  there isnt a lazy bone in him  all things considered jerry is a credit to his family  but if jerry is a credit to his family there is one of its members who is not and that iswho knows  robber the brown rat replied happy jack squirrel promptly  i have often seen him around farmer browns barn  ugh  he is an uglylooking fellow  and he is just as ugly as he looks replied old mother nature there isnt a good thing i can say for him not one  he doesnt belong in this country at all  he was brought here by man and now he is found everywhere  he is sometimes called the norway rat and sometimes the wharf rat and house rat  he is hated by all animals and by man  he is big being next in size to jerry muskrat savage in temper the most destructive of any animal i know and dirty in his habits  he is an outcast but he doesnt seem to care  he lives chiefly around the homes of men and all his food is stolen  that is why he is named robber  he eats anything he can find and isnt the least bit particular what it is or whether it be clean or unclean  he gnaws into grain bins and steals the grain  he gets into henhouses and sucks the eggs and kills young chickens  he would like nothing better than to find a nest of your babies peter rabbit  peter shivered  im glad he sticks to the homes of men said he  but he doesnt declared old mother nature  often in summer he moves out into the fields digging burrows there and doing great damage to crops and also killing and eating any of the furred and feathered folk he can catch  but he is not fond of the light of day  his deeds are deeds of darkness and he prefers dark places he has very large families sometimes ten or more babies at a time and several families in a year  that is why his tribe has managed to overrun the great world and why they cause such great damage worse than the harm they do with their teeth is the terrible harm they do to man by carrying dreadful diseases and spreading them diseases which cause people to die in great numbers  isnt robber afraid of any one asked peter  he certainly is replied old mother nature  he is in deadly fear of one whom every one of you fearsshadow the weasel  one good thing i can say for shadow is that he never misses a chance to kill a rat  wherever a rat can go he can go and once he finds a colony he hunts them until he has killed all or driven them away  when food becomes scarce robber and his family move on to where it is more plentiful  often they make long journeys a great number of them together and do not hesitate to swim a stream that may be in their path  ive never seen robber said peter  what kind of a tail does he have  i might have known you would ask that laughed old mother nature it is long and slim and has no hair on it  his fur is very coarse and harsh and is brown and gray  he has a close relative called the black rat  but the latter is smaller and has been largely driven out of the country by his bigger cousin  now i guess this is enough about robber  he is bad all bad and hasnt a single friend in all the great world  what a dreadful thingnot to have a single friend said happy jack  it is dreadful very dreadful replied old mother nature  but it is wholly his own fault  it shows what happens when one becomes dishonest and bad at heart  the worst of it is robber doesnt care tomorrow ill tell you about some of his cousins who are not bad    chapter xiv  a trader and a handsome fellow  way down in the sunny south began old mother nature lives a member of the rat family who though not nearly so bad as robber is none too good and so isnt thought well of at all  he is little robber the cotton rat and though small for a rat being only a trifle larger than striped chipmunk looks the little savage that he is  he has short legs and is rather thickbodied and appears much like an overgrown meadow mouse with a long tail the latter is not bare like robbers but the hair on it is very short and thin  in color he is yellowishbrown and whitish underneath  his fur is longer and coarser than that of other native rats  he lives in old fields along ditches and hedges and in similar places where there is plenty of cover in which he can hide from his enemies  he burrows in the ground and usually has his nest of dry grass there though often in summer it is the surface of the ground  he does not live in and around the homes of men like the brown rat but he causes a great deal of damage by stealing grain in the shock  he eats all kinds of grain many seeds and meat when he can get it  he is very destructive to eggs and young of groundnesting birds  he has a bad temper and will fight savagely mr and mrs cotton rat raise several large families in a year foxes owls and hawks are their chief enemies  but there are other members of the rat family far more interesting and quite worth knowing  one of these is trader the wood rat in some parts of the far west called the pack rat  among the mountains he is called the mountain rat  wherever found his habits are much the same and make him one of the most interesting of all the little people who wear fur  next to jerry muskrat he is the largest native rat that is of the rats which belong in this country  he is about two thirds as big as robber the brown rat but though he is of the same general shape so that you would know at once that he is related to robber he is in all other ways wholly unlike that outcast  his fur is thick and soft almost as soft as that of a squirrel  his fairly long tail is covered with hair  indeed some members of his branch of the family have tails almost as bushy as a squirrels  his coat is soft gray and a yellowishbrown above and underneath pure white or light buff  his feet are white  he has rounded ears and big black eyes with none of the ugliness in them that you always see in the eyes of robber  and he has long whiskers and plenty of them  but why is he called trader asked rabbit a bit impatiently  patience peter patience  im coming to that chided old mother nature  he is trader because his greatest delight is in trading he is a born trader if ever there was one  he doesnt steal as other members of his family but trades  he puts something back in place of whatever he takes  it may be little sticks or chips or pebbles or anything else that is handy but it is something to replace what he has taken  you see he is very honest  if trader finds something belonging to some one else that he wants he takes it but he tries to pay for it  next to trading he delights in collecting  his home is a regular museum  he delights in anything bright and shiny  when he can get into the camps of men he will take anything he can move  but being honest he tries to leave something in return  all sorts of queer things are found in his homebuckles cut from saddles spoons knives forks even money he has taken from the pockets of sleeping campers  whenever any small object is missed from a camp the first place visited in search of it is the home of trader  in the mountains he sometimes makes piles of little pebbles just for the fun of collecting them  he is found all over the west from the mountains to the deserts in thick forests and on sandy wastes  he is also found in parts of the east and in the sunny south  he is a great climber and is perfectly at home in trees or among rocks  he eats seeds grain many kinds of nuts leaves and other parts of plants  in the colder sections he lays up stores for winter  what kind of a home does he have asked happy jack  his home usually is a very remarkable affair replied old mother nature  it depends largely on where he is  when he is living in rocky country he makes it amongst the rocks  in some places he burrows in the ground  but more often it is on the surface of the grounda huge pile of sticks and thorns in the very middle of which is his snug soft nest  the sticks and thorns are to protect it from enemies  when he lives down where cactus grow those queer plants with long sharp spines he uses these and there are few enemies who will try to pull one of these houses apart to get at him  when he is alarmed or disturbed he has a funny habit of drumming on the ground with his hind feet in much the same way that peter rabbit and jumper the hare thump only he does it rapidly  sometimes he builds his house in a tree  when he finds a cabin in the woods he at once takes possession carrying in a great mass of sticks and trash  he is chiefly active at night and a very busy fellow he is trading and collecting  he has none of the mean disposition of robber the brown rat  mrs trader has two to five babies at a time and raises several families in a year  as i said before trader is one of the most interesting little people i know of and he does very very funny things  now we come to the handsomest member of the family longfoot the kangaroo rat so called because of his long hind legs and tail and the way in which he sits up and jumps  really he is not a member of the rat branch of the family but closely related to the pocket mice  you see he has pockets in his cheeks  like mine asked striped chipmunk quickly  no they are on the outside instead of the inside of his cheeks yours are inside  i think mine must be a lot handier asserted striped chipmunk nodding his head in a very decided way  longfoot seems to think his are quite satisfactory replied old mother nature  he really is handsome but he isnt a bit vain and is very gentle  he never tries to bite when caught and taken in a mans hand  but you havent told us how big he is or what he looks like protested impatient peter  when he sits up or jumps he looks like a tiny kangaroo  but that doesnt mean anything to you and you are no wiser than before for you never have seen a kangaroo replied old mother nature in the first place he is about the size of striped chipmunk that is his body is about the size of striped chipmunks but his tail is longer than his head and body together  my it must be some tail exclaimed peter rabbit admiringly  old mother nature smiled  it is said she  you would like that tail peter  his front legs are short and the feet small but his hind legs are long and the feet big  of course you have seen nimbleheels the jumping mouse peter  peter nodded  of course he replied  my how that fellow can jump  well longfoot is built on the same plan as nimbleheels and for the same purpose continued old mother nature  he is a jumper  then i know what that long tail is for cried peter  it is to keep him balanced when he is in the air so that he can jump straight  right again peter laughed old mother nature  that is just what it is for  without it he never would know where he was going to land when he jumped  as i told you he is a handsome little fellow his fur is very soft and silky  above it is a pretty yellowishbrown but underneath it is pure white  his cheeks are brown he is white around the ears and a white stripe crosses his hips and keeps right on along the sides of his tail  the upper and under parts of his tail are almost or quite black and the tail ends in a tuft of long hair which is pure white  his feet are also white  his head is rather large for his size and long  he has a long nose  longfoot has a number of cousins some of them much smaller than he but they all look very much alike  where do they live asked johnny chuck for johnny had been unable to stay away from school another day  in the dry sandy parts of the southwest places so dry that it seldom rains and water is to be found only long distances apart replied old mother nature  then how does longfoot get water to drink demanded chatterer the red squirrel  he gets along without drinking replied old mother nature  such moisture as he needs he gets from his food  he eats seeds leaves of certain plants and tender young plants just coming up  he burrows in the ground and throws up large mounds of earth  these have several entrances  one of these is the main entrance and during the day this is often kept closed with earth  under the mound he has little tunnels in all directions a snug little bedroom and storerooms for food  he is very industrious and dearly loves to dig  longfoot likes to visit his relatives sometimes and where there are several families living near together little paths lead from mound to mound  he comes out mostly at night probably because he feels it to be safer then  then too in that hot country it is cooler at night  the dusk of early evening is his favorite playtime  if longfoot has a quarrel with one of his relatives they fight hopping about each other watching for a chance to leap and kick with those long strong hind feet  longfoot sometimes drums with his hind feet after the manner of trader the wood rat  now i think this will do for this morning  if any of you should meet whitefoot the wood mouse tell him to come to school tomorrow morning  and you might tell danny meadow if you little folks want school to continue  we do cried peter rabbit and jumper the hare and happy jack squirrel and chatterer the red squirrel and striped chipmunk and johnny chuck as one    chapter xv  two unlike little cousins  whitefoot the wood mouse is one of the smallest of the little people who live in the green forest  being so small he is one of the most timid  you see by day and by night sharp eyes are watching for whitefoot and he knows it  never one single instant while he is outside where sharp eyes of hungry enemies may see him does he forget that they are watching for him  to forget even for one little minute might meanwell it might mean the end of little whitefoot but a dinner for some one with a liking for tender mouse  so whitefoot the wood mouse rarely ventures more than a few feet from a hiding place and safety  at the tiniest sound he starts nervously and often darts back into hiding without waiting to find out if there really is any danger  if he waited to make sure he might wait too long and it is better to be safe than sorry  if you and i had as many real frights in a year not to mention false frights as whitefoot has in a day we would i suspect lose our minds certainly we would be the most unhappy people in all the great world  but whitefoot isnt unhappy  not a bit of it  he is a very happy little fellow  there is a great deal of wisdom in that pretty little head of his  there is more real sense in it than in some very big heads  when some of his neighbors make fun of him for being so very very timid he doesnt try to pretend that he isnt afraid  he doesnt get angry  he simply says  of course im timid very timid indeed  im afraid of almost everything  i would be foolish not to be  it is because i am afraid that i am alive and happy right now  i hope i shall never be less timid than i am now for it would mean that sooner or later i would fail to run in time and would be gobbled up  it isnt cowardly to be timid when there is danger all around  nor is it bravery to take a foolish and needless risk  so i seldom go far from home  it isnt safe for me and i know it  this being the way whitefoot looked at matters you can guess how he felt when chatterer the red squirrel caught sight of him and gave him old mother natures message  hi there mr fraidy shouted chatterer as he caught sight of whitefoot darting under a log  hi there  ive got a message for you  slowly cautiously whitefoot poked his head out from beneath the old log and looked up at chatterer  what kind of a message he demanded suspiciously  a message youll do well to heed  it is from old mother nature replied chatterer  a message from old mother nature cried whitefoot and came out a bit more from beneath the old log  thats what i said a message from old mother nature and if you will take my advice you will heed it retorted chatterer  she says you are to come to school with the rest of us at sunup tomorrow morning  then chatterer explained about the school and where it was held each morning and what a lot he and his friends had already learned there  whitefoot listened with something very like dismay in his heart  that place where school was held was a long way off  that is it was a long way for him though to peter rabbit or jumper the hare it wouldnt have seemed long at all  it meant that he would have to leave all his hiding places and the thought made him shiver  but old mother nature had sent for him and not once did he even think of disobeying  did you say that school begins at sunup he asked and when chatterer nodded whitefoot sighed  it was a sigh of relief  im glad of that said he  i can travel in the night which will be much safer  ill be there  that is i will if i am not caught on the way  meanwhile over on the green meadows peter rabbit was looking for danny meadow mouse  dannys home was not far from the dear old briarpatch and he and peter were and still are very good friends so peter knew just about where to look for danny and it didnt take him long to find him  hello peter  you look as if you have something very important on your mind was the greeting of danny meadow mouse as peter came hurrying up  i have said peter  it is a message for you  old mother nature says for you to be on hand at sunup tomorrow when school opens over in the green forest  of course you will be there  of course replied danny in the most matteroffact tone  of course  if old mother nature really sent me that message  she really did interrupted peter  there isnt anything for me to do but obey finished danny  then his face became very sober  that is a long way for me to go peter said he  i wouldnt take such a long journey for anything or for anybody else  old mother nature knows and if she sent for me she must be sure i can make the trip safely  what time did you say i must be there  at sunup replied peter  shall i call for you on my way there  danny shook his head  then he began to laugh  what are you laughing at demanded peter  at the very idea of me with my short legs trying to keep up with you replied danny  i wish you would sit up and take a good look all around to make sure that old man coyote and reddy fox and redtail the hawk and black pussy that pesky cat from farmer browns are nowhere about  peter obligingly sat up and looked this way and looked that way and looked the other way  no one of whom he or danny meadow mouse need be afraid was to be seen  he said as much then asked why did you want to know danny  because i am going to start at once replied danny  start for where asked peter looking much puzzled  start for school of course replied danny rather shortly  but school doesnt begin until sunup tomorrow protested peter  which is just the reason i am going to start now retorted danny if i should put off starting until the last minute i might not get there at all  i would have to hurry and it is difficult to hurry and watch for danger at the same time  ive noticed that people who put things off to the last minute and then have to hurry are quite apt to rush headlong into trouble  the way is clear now so i am going to start  i can take my time and keep a proper watch for danger  ill see you over there in the morning peter  danny turned and disappeared in one of his private little paths though the tall grass  peter noticed that he was headed towards the green forest  when peter and the others arrived for school the next morning they found whitefoot the wood mouse and danny meadow mouse waiting with old mother nature  safe in her presence they seemed to have lost much of their usual timidity  whitefoot was sitting on the end of a log and danny was on the ground just beneath him  i want all the rest of you to look well at these two little cousins and notice how unlike two cousins can be said old mother nature whitefoot who is quite as often called deer mouse as wood mouse is one of the prettiest of the entire mouse family  i suspect he is called deer mouse because the upper part of his coat is such a beautiful fawn color  notice that the upper side of his long slim tail is of the same color while the under side is white as is the whole under part of whitefoot  also those dainty feet are white hence his name  see what big soft black eyes he has and notice that those delicate ears are of good size  his tail is covered with short fine hairs instead of being naked as is the tail of nibbler the house mouse of whom i will tell you later  whitefoot loves the green forest but out in parts of the far west where there is no green forest he lives on the brushy plains  he is a good climber and quite at home in the trees there he seems almost like a tiny squirrel  tell us whitefoot where you make your home and what you eat  my home just now replied whitefoot is in a certain hollow in a certain dead limb of a certain tree  i suspect that a member of the woodpecker family made that hollow but no one was living there when i found it  mrs whitefoot and i have made a soft warm nest there and wouldnt trade homes with any one  we have had our home in a hollow log on the ground in an old stump in a hole we dug in the ground under a rock and in an old nest of some bird  that was in a tall bush  we roofed that nest over and make a little round doorway on the under side  once we raised a family in a box in a dark corner of farmer browns sugar camp  i eat all sorts of thingsseeds nuts insects and meat when i can get it  i store up food for winter as all wise and thrifty people do  i suppose that means that you do not sleep as johnny chuck does in winter remarked peter rabbit  i should say not exclaimed whitefoot  i like winter  it is fun to run about on the snow  havent you ever seen my tracks peter  i have lots of times spoke up jumper the hare  also ive seen you skipping about after dark  i guess you dont care much for sunlight  i dont replied whitefoot  i sleep most of the time during the day and work and play at night  i feel safer then  but on dull days i often come out  it is the bright sunlight i dont like  that is one reason i stick to the green forest  i dont see how cousin danny stands it out there on the green meadows  now i guess it is his turn  every one looked at danny meadow mouse  in appearance he was as unlike whitefoot as it was possible to be and still be a mouse there was nothing pretty or graceful about danny  he wasnt dainty at all  his body was rather stout looking stouter than it really was because his fur was quite long  his head was blunt and he seemed to have no neck at all though of course he did have one his eyes were small like little black beads  his ears were almost hidden in his hair  his legs were short and his tail was quite short as if it had been cut off when half grown  no those two cousins didnt look a bit alike  danny felt most uncomfortable as the others compared him with pretty whitefoot  he knew he was homely but never before had he felt it quite so keenly  old mother nature saw and understood  it isnt how we look but what we are and what we do and how we fit into our particular places in life that count said she now danny is a homely little fellow but i know and i know that he knows that he is just fitted for the life he lives and he lives it more successfully for being just as he is  danny is a lover of the fields and meadows where there is little else but grass in which to hide  everything about him is just suited for living there  isnt that so danny  yesm i guess so replied danny  sometimes my tail does seem dreadfully short to look well  everybody laughed even danny himself  then he remembered how once reddy fox had so nearly caught him that one of reddys black paws had touched the tip of his tail  had that tail been any longer reddy would have caught him by it  dannys face cleared and he hastened to declare after all my tail suits me just as it is  wisely spoken danny said old mother nature  now it is your turn to tell how you live and what you eat and anything else of interest about yourself  i guess there isnt much interesting about me began danny modestly  im just one of the plain common little folks i guess everybody knows me so well there is nothing for me to tell  some of them may know all about you but i dont declared jumper the hare  i never go out on the green meadows where you live  how do you get about in all that tall grass  oh thats easy enough replied danny  i cut little paths in all directions  just the way i do in the dear old briarpatch interrupted peter rabbit  i keep those little paths clear and clean so that there never is anything in my way to trip me up when i have to run for safety continued danny  when the grass gets tall those little paths are almost like little tunnels  the time i dread most is when farmer brown cuts the grass for hay  i not only have to watch out for that dreadful mowing machine but when the hay has been taken away the grass is so short that it is hard work for me to keep out of sight  i sometimes dig a short burrow and at the end of it make a nice nest of dry grass  sometimes in summer mrs danny and i make our nest on the surface of the ground in a hollow or in a clump of tall grass especially if the ground is low and wet  we have several goodsized families in a year  all meadow mice believe in large families and that is probably why there are more meadow mice than any other mice in the country  i forgot to say that i am also called field mouse  and it is because there are so many of your family and they require so much to eat that you do a great deal of damage to grass and other crops spoke up old mother nature  you see she explained to the others danny eats grass clover bulbs roots seeds and garden vegetables  he also eats some insects  he sometimes puts away a few seeds for the winter but depends chiefly on finding enough to eat for he is active all winter  he tunnels about under the snow in search of food  when other food is hard to find he eats bark and then he sometimes does great damage in young orchards  he gnaws the bark from young fruit trees all the way around as high as he can reach and of course this kills the trees  he is worse than peter rabbit  danny didnt mention that he is a good swimmer and not at all afraid of the water  no one has more enemies than he and the fact that he is alive and here at school this morning is due to his everlasting watchfulness  this will do for today  tomorrow we will take up others of the mouse family    chapter xvi  dannys northern cousins and nimbleheels  whitefoot the wood mouse and danny meadow mouse had become so interested that they decided they couldnt afford to miss the next lesson  neither did either of them feel like making the long journey to his home and back again  so whitefoot found a hole in a stump near by and decided to camp out there for a few days  danny decided to do the same thing in a comfortable place under a pile of brush not far away  so the next morning both were on hand when school opened  i told you yesterday that i would tell you about some of dannys cousins began old mother nature just as chatterer the red squirrel who was late came hurrying up quite out of breath  way up in the far north are two of dannys cousins more closely related to him than to any other members of the mouse family  yet strange to say they are not called mice at all but lemmings  however they belong to the mouse family  bandy the banded lemming is the most interesting because he is the one member of the entire family who changes the color of his coat  in summer he wears beautiful shades of reddish brown and gray but in winter his coat is wholly white  he is also called the hudson bay lemming  danny meadow mouse thinks his tail is short but he wouldnt if he should see bandys tail  that is so short it hardly shows beyond his long fur  he is about dannys size but a little stouter and stockier and his long fur makes him appear even thickerbodied than he really is  he has very short legs and his ears are so small that they are quite hidden in the fur around them so that he appears to have no ears at all  in that same far northern country is a close relative called the brown lemming  he is very much like bandy save that he is all brown and does not change his coat in winter  both have the same general habits and these are much like the habits of danny meadow mouse they make short burrows in the ground leading to snug warm nests of grass and moss  in winter they make little tunnels in every direction under the snow with now and then an opening to the surface  there are many more brown lemmings than banded lemmings and their little paths run everywhere through the grass and moss  in that country there is a great deal of moss  it covers the ground just as grass does here  but the most interesting thing about these lemmings is the way they migrate  to migrate is to move from one part of the country to another  you know most of the birds migrate to the sunny south every autumn and back every spring  once in a while it happens that food becomes very scarce where the lemmings are  then very many of them get together just as migrating birds form great flocks and start on a long journey in search of a place where there is plenty of food  they form a great army and push ahead regardless of everything  they swim wide rivers and even lakes which may lie in their way  of course they eat everything eatable in their path  my exclaimed danny meadow mouse im glad i dont live in a country where i might have to make such long journeys  i dont envy those cousins up there in the far north a bit  im perfectly satisfied to live right on the green meadows  which shows your good common sense said old mother nature  by the way danny i suppose you are acquainted with nimbleheels the jumping mouse who also is rather fond of the green meadows  i ought to have sent word to him to be here this morning  hardly were the words out of old mother natures mouth when something landed in the leaves almost at her feet and right in the middle of school  instantly danny meadow mouse scurried under a pile of dead leaves  whitefoot the wood mouse darted into a knothole in the log on which he had been sitting  jumper the hare dodged behind a little hemlock tree  peter rabbit bolted for a hollow log  striped chipmunk vanished in a hole under an old stump  johnny chuck backed up against the trunk of a tree and made ready to fight  only happy jack the gray squirrel and chatterer the red squirrel and prickly porky the porcupine who were sitting in trees kept their places you see they felt quite safe  as soon as all those who had run had reached places of safety they peeped out to see what had frightened them so  just imagine how very very foolish they felt when they saw old mother nature smiling down at a little fellow just about the size of little whitefoot but with a much longer tail  it was nimbleheels the jumping mouse  well well well exclaimed old mother nature  i was just speaking of you and wishing i had you here  how did you happen to come  and what do you mean by scaring my pupils half out of their wits  her eyes twinkled  nimbleheels saw this and knew that she was only pretending to be severe  before he could reply johnny chuck began to chuckle  the chuckle became a laugh and presently johnny was laughing so hard he had to hold his sides  now as you know laughter is catching  in a minute or so everybody was laughing and no one but johnny chuck knew what the joke was  at last peter rabbit stopped laughing long enough to ask johnny what he was laughing at  at the idea of that little pinch of nothing giving us all such a fright replied johnny chuck  then all laughed some more  when they were through laughing nimbleheels answered old mother natures questions  he explained that he had heard about that school as by this time almost every one in the green forest and on the green meadows had  by chance he learned that danny meadow mouse was attending  he thought that if it was a good thing for danny it would be a good thing for him so he had come  just as i was almost here i heard a twig snap behind me or thought i did and i jumped so as to get here and be safe  i didnt suppose anyone would be frightened by little me he explained it was some jump exclaimed jumper the hare admiringly  he went right over my head and i was sitting up at that  it isnt much of a jump to go over your head replied nimbleheels you ought to see me when i really try to jump  i wasnt half trying when i landed here  im sorry i frightened all of you so it gives me a queer feeling just to think that i should be able to frighten anybody  if you please mother nature am i in time for todays lesson  not for all of it but you are just in time for the part i wanted you here for replied old mother nature  hop up on that log side of your cousin whitefoot where all can see you  nimbleheels hopped up beside whitefoot the wood mouse and as the two little cousins sat side by side they were not unlike in general appearance though of the two whitefoot was the prettier  the coat of nimbleheels was a dull yellowish darker on the back than on the sides  like whitefoot he was white underneath  his ears were much smaller than those of whitefoot  but the greatest differences between the two were in their hind legs and tails  the hind legs and feet of nimbleheels were long on the same plan as those of peter rabbit  from just a glance at them any one would know that he was a born jumper and a good one  whitefoot possessed a long tail but the tail of nimbleheels was much longer slim and tapering  there said old mother nature is the greatest jumper for his size among all the animals in this great country  when i say this i mean the greatest ground jumper  timmy the flying squirrel jumps farther but timmy has to climb to a high place and then coasts down on the air  i told you what wonderful jumps jack rabbit can make but if he could jump as high and far for his size as nimbleheels can jump for his size the longest jump jack has ever made would seem nothing more than a hop  by the way both nimbleheels and whitefoot have small pockets in their cheeks tell us where you live nimbleheels  i live among the weeds along the edge of the green meadows replied nimbleheels though sometimes i go way out on the green meadows  but i like best to be among the weeds because they are tall and keep me well hidden and also because they furnish me plenty to eat  you see i live largely on seeds though i am also fond of berries and small nuts especially beechnuts  some of my family prefer the green forest especially if there is a laughing brook or pond in it personally i prefer as i said before the edge of the green meadows  do you make your home under the ground asked striped chipmunk  for winter yes replied nimbleheels  in summer i sometimes put my nest just a few inches under ground but often i hide it under a piece of bark or in a thick clump of grass just as danny meadow mouse often does his  in the fall i dig a deep burrow deep enough to be beyond the reach of jack frost and in a nice little bedroom down there i sleep the winter away  i have little storerooms down there too in which i put seeds berries and nuts then when i do wake up i have plenty to eat  i might add said old mother nature that when he goes to sleep for the winter he curls up in a little ball with his long tail wrapped around him and in his bed of soft grass he sleeps very sound indeed  like johnny chuck he gets very fat before going to sleep  now nimbleheels show us how you can jump  nimbleheels hopped down from the log on which he had been sitting and at once shot into the air in such a high long beautiful jump that everybody exclaimed  this way and that way he went in great leaps  it was truly wonderful  that long tail is what balances him explained old mother nature if he should lose it he would simply turn over and over and never know where or how he was going to land  his jumping is done only in times of danger  when he is not alarmed he runs about on the ground like the rest of the mouse family  this is all for today tomorrow i will tell you still more about the mouse family    chapter xvii  three little redcoats and some others  with whitefoot the wood mouse danny meadow mouse and nimbleheels the jumping mouse attending school the mouse family was well represented but when school opened the morning after nimbleheels had made his sudden and startling appearance there was still another present  it was piney the pine mouse  whitefoot who knew him had hunted him up and brought him along  i thought you wouldnt mind if piney came explained whitefoot  im glad he has come replied old mother nature  it is much better to see a thing than merely to be told about it and now you have a chance to see for yourselves the differences between two cousins very closely related danny meadow mouse and piney the pine mouse  what difference do you see happy jack squirrel  piney is a little smaller than danny though he is much the same shape was the prompt reply  true said old mother nature  now striped chipmunk what difference do you see  the fur of pineys coat is shorter finer and has more of a shine then too it is more of a reddishbrown than dannys replied striped chipmunk  and what do you say peter rabbit asked old mother nature  piney has a shorter tail declared peter and everybody laughed  trust you to look at his tail first said old mother nature these are the chief differences as far as looks are concerned their habits differ in about the same degree  as you all know danny cuts little paths through the grass  piney doesnt do this but makes little tunnels just under the surface of the ground very much as miner the mole does  he isnt fond of the open green meadows or of damp places as danny is but likes best the edge of the green forest and brushy places  he is very much at home in a poorly kept orchard where the weeds are allowed to grow and in young orchards he does a great deal of damage by cutting off the roots of young trees and stripping off the bark as high up as he can reach tell us piney how and where you make your home  piney hesitated a little for he was bashful  i make my home under ground he ventured finally  i dig a nice little bedroom with several entrances from my tunnels and in it i make a fine nest of soft grass  close by i dig one or more rooms in which to store my food and these usually are bigger than my bedroom  when i get one filled with food i close it up by filling the entrance with earth  what do you put in your storerooms asked peter rabbit  short pieces of grass and pieces of roots of different kinds replied piney  i am very fond of tender roots and the bark of trees and bushes  and he dearly loves to get in a garden where he can tunnel along a row of potatoes or other root crops added old mother nature because of these habits he does a great deal of damage and is much disliked by man  striped chipmunk mentioned his reddishbrown coat there is another cousin with a coat so red that he is called the redbacked mouse  he is about the size of danny meadow mouse but has larger ears and a longer tail  this little fellow is a lover of the green forest and he is quite as active by day as by night  he is pretty especially when he sits up to eat holding his food in his paws as does happy jack squirrel he makes his home in a burrow the entrance to which is under an old stump a rock or the root of a tree  his nest is of soft grass or moss  sometimes he makes it in a hollow log or stump instead of digging a bedroom under ground  he is thrifty and lays up a supply of food in underground rooms hollow logs and similar places  he eats seeds small fruits roots and various plants  because of his preference for the green forest and the fact that he lives as a rule far from the homes of men he does little real damage  there is still another little redcoat in the family and he is especially interesting because while he is related to danny meadow mouse he lives almost wholly in trees  he is called the rufous tree mouse  rufous means reddishbrown and he gets that name because of the color of his coat  he lives in the great forests of the far west where the trees are so big and tall that the biggest tree you have ever seen would look small beside them  and it is in those great trees that the rufous tree mouse lives  just why he took to living in trees no one knows for he belongs to that branch of the family known as ground mice  but live in them he does and he is quite as much at home in them as any squirrel  chatterer the red squirrel was interested right away  does he build a nest in a tree like a squirrel he asked  he certainly does replied old mother nature and often it is a most remarkable nest  in some sections he places it only in big trees sometimes a hundred feet from the ground  in other sections it is placed in small trees and only a few feet above the ground the high nests often are old deserted nests of squirrels enlarged and built over  some of them are very large indeed and have been used year after year  each year they have been added to  one of these big nests will have several bedrooms and little passages running all through it  it appears that mrs rufous usually has one of these big nests to herself rufous having a small nest of his own out on one of the branches  the big nest is close up against the trunk of the tree where several branches meet  does rufous travel from one tree to another or does he live in just one tree asked happy jack squirrel  wherever branches of one tree touch those of another and you know in a thick forest this is frequently the case he travels about freely if he wants to  but those trees are so big that i suspect he spends most of his time in the one in which his home is replied old mother nature  however if an enemy appears in his home tree he makes his escape by jumping from one tree to another just as you would do  what i want to know is where he gets his food if he spends all his time up in the trees spoke up danny meadow mouse  old mother nature smiled  where should he get it but up where he lives she asked  rufous never has to worry about food  it is all around him  you see so far as known he lives wholly on the thick parts of the needles which you know are the leaves of fir and spruce trees and on the bark of tender twigs  so you see he is more of a tree dweller than any of the squirrel family while rufous has the general shape of danny and his relatives he has quite a long tail  now i guess this will do for the nearest relatives of danny meadow mouse  he certainly has a lot of them remarked whitefoot the wood mouse then he added a little wistfully of course in a way they are all cousins of mine but i wish i had some a little more closely related  you have replied old mother nature and whitefoot pricked up his big ears  one of them bigear the rock mouse who lives out in the mountains of the far west  he is as fond of the rocks as rufous is of the trees  sometimes he lives in brush heaps and in brushy country but he prefers rocks and that is why he is known as the rock mouse  he is a pretty little fellow if anything a trifle bigger than you whitefoot and he is dressed much like you with a yellowishbrown coat and white waistcoat  he has just such a long tail covered with hair its whole length  but you should see his ears  he has the largest ears of any member of the whole family  that is why he is called bigear  he likes best to be out at night but often comes out on dull days  he eats seeds and small nuts and is especially fond of juniper seeds  he always lays up a supply of food for winter  often he is found very high up on the mountains  another of your cousins whitefoot lives along the seashore of the east down in the sunny south  he is called the beach mouse in general appearance he is much like you having the same shape long tail and big ears but he is a little smaller and his coat varies  when he lives back from the shore in fields where the soil is dark his upper coat is dark grayishbrown but when he lives on the white sands of the seashore it is very light  his home is in short burrows in the ground  now dont you little people think you have learned enough about the mouse family  you havent told us about nibbler the house mouse yet  and you said you would protested peter rabbit  and when we were learning about longfoot the kangaroo rat you said he was most closely related to the pocket mice  what about them said johnny chuck  old mother nature laughed  i see said she that you want to know all there is to know  be on hand tomorrow morning  i guess we can finish up with the mouse family then and with them the order of rodents to which all of you belong    chapter xviii  mice with pockets and others  pockets are very handy things for little people who are thrifty and who live largely on small seeds  without pockets in which to carry the seeds i am afraid some of them would never be able to store up enough food for winter began old mother nature as soon as everybody was on hand the next morning  i wouldnt be without my pockets for any thing spoke up striped chipmunk  old mother nature smiled  you certainly do make good use of yours said she  but there are others who have even greater need of pockets and among them are the pocket mice  of course it is because of their pockets that they are called pocket mice  all of these pretty little fellows live in the dry parts of the far west and southwest in the same region where longfoot the kangaroo rat lives  they are close neighbors and relatives of his  midget the silky pocket mouse is one of the smallest animals in all the great world so small that whitefoot the wood mouse is a giant compared with him  he weighs less than an ounce and is a dear little fellow  his back and sides are yellow and beneath he is white  he has quite long hind legs and a long tail and these show at once that he is a jumper  in each cheek is a pocket opening from the outside and these pockets are lined with hair he is called silky pocket mouse because of the fineness and softness of his coat  he has some larger cousins one of them being a little bigger than nibbler the house mouse  neighbors and close relatives are the spiny pocket mice  do they have spines like prickly porky demanded peter rabbit  old mother nature laughed  i dont wonder you ask said she i think it is a foolish name myself for they havent any spines at all  their fur isnt as fine as that of midget and it has all through it long coarse hairs almost like bristles and from these they get their name  the smallest of the spiny pocket mice is about the size of nibbler the house mouse and the largest is twice as big  they are more slender than their silky cousins and their tails are longer in proportion to their size and have little tufts of hair at the ends  of course they have pockets in their cheeks  in habits all the pocket mice are much alike  they make burrows in the ground often throwing up a little mound with several entrances which lead to a central passageway connecting with the bedroom and storerooms  by day the entrances are closed with earth from inside for the mice are active only at night sometimes the burrows are hidden under bushes and sometimes they are right out in the open  living as they do in a hot dry country the pocket mice have learned to get along without drinking water  their food consists mainly of a variety of small seeds  another mouse of the west looks almost enough like whitefoot to be a member of his branch of the family  he has a beautiful yellowishbrown coat and white waistcoat and his feet are white but his tail is short in comparison with whitefoots and instead of being slim is quite thick  his fur is like velvet  he is called the grasshopper mouse  is that because he eats grasshoppers asked peter rabbit at once  youve guessed it laughed old mother nature  he is very very fond of grasshoppers and crickets  he eats many kinds of insects moths flies cutworms beetles lizards frogs and scorpions because of his fondness for the latter he is called the scorpion mouse in some sections  he is fond of meat when he can get it he also eats seeds of many kinds  he is found all over the west from well up in the north to the hot dry regions of the southwest when he cannot find a convenient deserted burrow of some other animal he digs a home for himself and there raises several families each year  in the early evening he often utters a fine shrill whistling call note  another little member of the mouse family found clear across the country is the harvest mouse  he is never bigger than nibbler the house mouse and often is much smaller  in fact he is one of the smallest of the entire family  in appearance he is much like nibbler but his coat is browner and there are fine hairs on his tail  he loves grassy weedy or brushy places  as a rule he does little harm to man for his food is chiefly seeds of weeds small wild fruits and parts of wild plants of no value to man  once in a while his family becomes so large that they do some damage in grain fields  but this does not happen often  the most interesting thing about this little mouse is the way he builds his home  sometimes he uses a hole in a tree or post and sometimes a deserted birds nest but more frequently he builds a nest for himselfa little round ball of grass and other vegetable matter  this is placed in thick grass or weeds close to the ground or in bushes or low trees several feet from the ground  they are wellbuilt little houses and have one or more little doorways on the under side when they are in bushes or trees  inside is a warm soft bed made of milkweed or cattail down the very nicest kind of a bed for the babies  no one has a neater home than the harvest mouse  he is quite as much at home in bushes and low trees as happy jack squirrel is in bigger trees  his long tail comes in very handy then for he often wraps it around a twig to make his footing more secure  now this is all about the native mice andwhat is it peter  youve forgotten nibbler the house mouse replied peter  how impatient some little folks are and how fearful that their curiosity will not be satisfied remarked old mother nature  as i was saying this is all about our native mice that is the mice who belong to this country  and now we come to nibbler the house mouse who like robber the brown rat has no business here at all but who has followed man all over the world and like robber has become a pest to man  peter rabbit looked rather sheepish when he discovered that old mother nature hadnt for gotten and resolved that in the future he would hold his tongue  have any of you seen nibbler asked old mother nature  i have replied danny meadow mouse  once i was carried to farmer browns barn in a shock of corn and i found nibbler living in the barn  it is a wonder he wasnt living in farmer browns house said old mother nature  probably other members of his family were he is perfectly at home in any building put up by man just as is robber the rat  because of his small size he can go where robber cannot  he delights to scamper about between the walls being a true rodent he is forever gnawing holes in the corners of rooms and opening on to pantry shelves so that he may steal food  he eats all sorts of food but spoils more for man by running about over it than he eats  in barns and henhouses he gets into the grain bins and steals a great deal of grain  it is largely because of robber the rat and nibbler that men keep the cats you all hate so  a cat is nibblers worst enemy  nibbler is slender and graceful with a long hairless tail and ears of good size  he is very timid ready to dart into his hole at the least sound  he raises from four to nine babies at a time and several sets of them in a year  if mr and mrs nibbler are living in a house their nest is made of scraps of paper cloth wool and other soft things stolen from the people who live in the house  in getting this material they often do great damage  if they are living in a barn they make their nest of hay and any soft material they can find  while nibbler prefers to live in or close to the homes of men he sometimes is driven out and then takes to the fields especially in summer  there he lives in all sorts of hiding places and isnt at all particular what the place is if it promises safety and food can be obtained close by  im sorry nibbler ever came to this country  man brought him here and now he is here to stay and quite as much at home as if he belonged here the way the rest of you do  this finishes the lessons on the order of rodents the animals related by reason of having teeth for the purpose of gnawing  i suspect these are the only ones in whom you take any interest and so you will not care to come to school any more  am i right  no marm answered happy jack the gray squirrel who you remember had laughed at peter rabbit for wanting to go to school  no marm there are ever so many other people of the green forest and the green meadows we want to know more about than we now know  isnt that so  happy jack turned to the others and every one nodded even prickly porky  there is one little fellow living right near here who looks to me as if he must be a member of the mouse family but he isnt like any of the mice you have told us about continued happy jack  he is so small he can hide under a leaf  im sure he must be a mouse  you mean teeny weeny the shrew replied old mother nature smiling at happy jack  he isnt a mouse  he isnt even a rodent  ill try to have him here tomorrow morning and we will see what we can find out about him and his relatives    chapter xix  teeny weeny and his cousin  of course old mother nature knows but just the same it is hard for me not to believe that teeny weeny is a member of the mouse family said happy jack squirrel to peter rabbit as they scampered along to school  i never have had a real good look at him but ive had glimpses of him lots of times and always supposed him a little mouse with a short tail  it is hard to believe that he isnt  i hope old mother nature will put him where we can get a good look at him replied peter  perhaps when you really see him he wont look so much like a mouse  when all had arrived old mother nature began the morning lesson at once  you have learned about all the families in the order of rodents said she so now we will take up another and much smaller order called insectivora  i wonder if any of you can guess what that means  it sounds said peter rabbit as if it must have something to do with insects  that is a very good guess peter replied old mother nature smiling at him  it does have to do with insects  the members of this order live very largely on insects and worms and the name insectivora means insecteating  there are two families in this order the shrew family and the mole family  then teeny weeny and miner the mole must be related spoke peter quickly  right again peter was the prompt reply  the shrews and the moles are related in the same way that you and happy jack squirrel are related  and isnt teeny weeny the shrew related to the mice at all asked happy jack  not at all said old mother nature  many people think he is and often he is called shrew mouse  but this is a great mistake it is the result of ignorance  it seems strange to me that people so often know so little about their near neighbors  she looked at happy jack squirrel as she said this and happy jack looked sheepish  he felt just as he looked  all this time the eyes of every one had been searching this way that way every way for teeny weeny for old mother nature had promised to try to have him there that morning  but teeny weeny was not to be seen  now and then a leaf on the ground close by old mother natures feet moved but the merry little breezes were always stirring up fallen leaves and no one paid any attention to these  old mother nature understood the disappointment in the faces before her and her eyes began to twinkle  yesterday i told you that i would try to have teeny weeny here said she  a leaf moved stooping quickly she picked it up  and here he is she finished  sure enough where a second before the dead brown leaf had been was a tiny little fellow so tiny that that leaf had covered him completely and it wasnt a very big leaf  it was teeny weeny the shrew also called the common shrew the longtailed shrew and the shrew mouse one of the smallest animals in all the great world he started to dart under another leaf but old mother nature stopped him  sit still she commanded sharply  you have nothing to fear i want everybody to have a good look at you for it is high time these neighbors of yours should know you  i know just how nervous and uncomfortable you are and ill keep you only a few minutes now everybody take a good look at teeny weeny  this command was quite needless for all were staring with all their might  what they saw was a mite of a fellow less than four inches long from the tip of his nose to the tip of his tail and of this total length the tail was almost half  he was slender had short legs and mouselike feet  his coat was brownish above and grayish beneath and the fur was very fine and soft  but the oddest thing about teeny weeny was his long pointed head ending in a long nose  no mouse has a head like it  the edges of the ears could be seen above the fur but the eyes were so tiny that peter rabbit thought he hadnt any and said so  old mother nature laughed  yes he has eyes peter said she look closely and you will see them  but they dont amount to muchlittle more than to tell daylight from darkness  teeny weeny depends on his nose chiefly  he has a very wonderful little nose flexible and very sensitive  of course with such poor eyes he prefers the dark when there are fewer enemies abroad  all this time teeny weeny had been growing more and more uneasy old mother nature saw and understood  now she told him that he might go  hardly were the words out of her mouth when he vanished darting under some dead leaves  hidden by them he made his way to an old log and was seen no more  doesnt he eat anything but insects and worms asked striped chipmunk  yes replied old mother nature  he is very fond of flesh and if he finds the body of a bird or animal that has been killed he will tear it to pieces  he is very hottempered as are all his family and will not hesitate to attack a mouse much bigger than himself  he is so little and so active that he has to have a great deal of food and probably eats his own weight in food every day  of course that means he must do a great deal of hunting and he does  he makes tiny little paths under the fallen leaves and in swampy placeslittle tunnels through the moss  he is especially fond of old rotted stumps and logs and brush piles for in such places he can find grubs and insects  at the same time he is well hidden he is active by day and night but in the daytime takes pains to keep out of the light  he prefers damp to dry places  in winter he tunnels about under the snow  in summer he uses the tunnels and runways of meadow mice and others when he can  he eats seeds and other vegetable food when he cannot find insects or flesh  how about his enemies asked chatterer the red squirrel  he has plenty replied old mother nature but is not so much hunted as the members of the mouse family  this is because he has a strong unpleasant scent which makes him a poor meal for those at all particular about their food  some of the hawks and owls appear not to mind this and these are his worst enemies  has he any near relatives asked jumper the hare  several was the prompt response  blarina the shorttailed shrew also called mole shrew is the best known  he is found everywhere in forests old pastures and along grassy banks but seldom far from water  he prefers moist ground  he is much larger and thicker than teeny weeny and has a shorter tail people often mistake him for miner the mole because of the thick fine fur which is much like miners and his habit of tunneling about just beneath the surface but if they would look at his fore feet they would never make that mistake  they are small and like the feet of the mouse family not at all like miners big shovels  moreover he is smaller than miner and his tunnels are seldom in the earth but just under the leaves and grass  his food is much the same as that of teeny weenyworms insects flesh when he can get it and seeds  he is fond of beechnuts  he is quite equal to killing a mouse of his own size or bigger and does not hesitate to do so when he gets the chance  he makes a soft comfortable nest under a log or in a stump or in the ground and has from four to six babies at a time  teeny weeny sometimes has as many as ten  the senses of smell and hearing are very keen and make up for the lack of sight  his eyes like those of other shrews are probably of use only in distinguishing light from darkness  his coat is dark brownishgray  another of the shrew family is the marsh shrew also called water shrew and blackand white shrew  he is longer than either of the others and as you have guessed is a lover of water  he is a good swimmer and gets much of his food in the waterwater beetles and grubs and perhaps tadpoles and minnows  now who among you knows miner the mole  i do  that is i have seen him replied peter rabbit  very well peter tomorrow morning we will see how much you know about miner replied old mother nature    chapter xx  four busy little miners  scampering along on his way to school and thinking of nothing so uninteresting as watching his steps peter rabbit stubbed his toes yes sir peter stubbed his toes  with a little exclamation of impatience he turned to see what he had stumbled over  it was a little ridge where the surface of the ground had been raised a trifle since peter had passed that way the day before  peter chuckled  now isnt that funny he demanded of no one at all for he was quite alone  then he answered himself  it certainly is said he  here i am on my way to learn something about miner the mole and i trip over one of the queer little ridges he is forever making  it wasnt here yesterday so that means that he is at work right around here now  hello i thought so  peter had been looking along that little ridge and had discovered that it ended only a short distance from him  now as he looked at it again he saw the flat surface of the ground at the end of the ridge rise as if being pushed up from beneath and that little ridge became just so much longer  peter understood perfectly  out of sight beneath the surface miner the mole was at work  he was digging a tunnel and that ridge was simply the roof to that tunnel  it was so near the surface of the ground that miner simply pushed up the loose soil as he bored his way along and this made the little ridge over which peter had stumbled  peter watched a few minutes then turned and scampered lipperty lippertylip for the green forest  he arrived at school quite out of breath the last one  old mother nature was about to chide him for being late but noticing his excitement she changed her mind  well peter said she  what is it now  did you have a narrow escape on your way here  peter shook his head  no he replied  no i didnt have a narrow escape but i discovered something  happy jack squirrel snickered  peter is always discovering something said he  he is a great little discoverer  probably he has just found out that the only way to get anywhere on time is to start soon enough  no such thing declared peter indignantly  you  never mind him peter interrupted old mother nature soothingly what was it you discovered  that the very one we are to learn about is only a little way from here this very minute  miner the mole is at work on the green meadow close to the edge of the green forest cried peter eagerly i thought perhaps you would want to  have this mornings lesson right there where we can at least see his works if not himself interrupted old mother nature again that is fine peter  we will go over there at once  it is always better to see things than to merely hear about them  so peter led the way to where he had stumbled over that little ridge on his way to school  it was longer than when he had left it but even as the others crowded about to look the earth was pushed up and it grew in length  old mother nature stooped and made a little hole in that ridge  then she put her lips close to it and commanded miner to come out  she spoke softly pleasantly but in a way that left no doubt that she expected to be obeyed  she was  almost at once a queer long sharp nose was poked out of the little hole she had made and a squeaky voice asked fretfully do i have to come way out  you certainly do replied old mother nature  i want some of your friends and neighbors to get a good look at you and they certainly cant do that with only that sharp nose of yours to be seen  now scramble out here  no one will hurt you  i will keep you only a few minutes  then you can go back to your everlasting digging  out with you now  while the others gathered in a little circle close about that hole there scrambled into view one of the queerest little fellows in all the great world  few of them had ever seen him close to before he was a stout little fellow with the softest thickest gray coat imaginable  he was about six inches long and had a funny short pinkishwhite naked tail that at once reminded peter of an angleworm  his head seemed to be set directly on his shoulders so that there was no neck worth mentioning  his nose was long and sharp and extended far beyond his mouth  neither ears nor eyes were to be seen  striped chipmunk at once wanted to know how miner could see  he doesnt see as you do replied old mother nature  he has very small eyes tiny things which you might find if you should part the fur around them but they are of use only to distinguish light from darkness  miner hasnt the least idea what any of you look like  you see he spends his life under ground and of course has no use for eyes there  they would be a nuisance for the dirt would be continually getting in them if they were any larger than they are or were not protected as they are  if you should feel of miners nose you would find it hard  that is because he uses it to bore with in the earth  just notice those hands of his  at once everybody looked at miners hands  no one ever had seen such hands before  the arms were short but looked very strong the hands also were rather short but what they lacked in length they made up in width and they were armed with long stout claws but the queer thing about them was the way he held them  he held them turned out  his hind feet were not much different from the hind feet of the mouse family  miner was plainly uncomfortable  he wriggled about uneasily and it was very clear that he was there only because old mother nature had commanded him to be there and that the one thing he wanted most was to get back into his beloved ground  old mother nature saw this and took pity on him  she picked him up and placed him on the ground where there was no opening near  now miner said she your friends and neighbors have had a good look at you and i know just how uncomfortable you feel there is but one thing more ill ask of you  it is that you will show us how you can dig  johnny chuck thinks he is a pretty good digger  just show him what you can do in that line  miner didnt wait to be told twice  the instant old mother nature stopped speaking he began to push and bore into the earth with his sharp nose  one of those great spadelike hands was slipped up past his face and the claws driven in beside his nose  then it was swept back and the loosened earth with it  the other hand was used in the same way  it was quite plain to everybody why they were turned out in the way they were  there was nothing slow about the way miner used that boring nose and those shoveling hands peter rabbit had hardly time for half a dozen long breaths before miner the mole had disappeared  some digging exclaimed peter  never again as long as i live will i boast of my digging declared johnny chuck admiringly  from the point where miner had entered the ground a little ridge was being pushed up and they watched it grow surprisingly fast as the little worker under the sod pushed his tunnel along in the direction of his old tunnels  it was clear that he was in a hurry to get back where he could work in peace  what a queer life exclaimed happy jack squirrel  he cant have much fun  i should think it would be awful living in the dark that way all the time  you forget that he cannot see as you can and so prefers the dark replied old mother nature  as for fun he gets that in his work  he is called miner because he lives in the ground and is always tunneling  what does he eat the roots of plants asked jumper the hare  old mother nature shook her head  a lot of people think that said she and often miner is charged with destroying growing crops eating seed corn etc  that is because his tunnels are found running along the rows of plants  the fact is miner has simply been hunting for grubs and worms around the roots of those plants  he hasnt touched the plants at all  i suspect that danny meadow mouse or one of his cousins could explain who ate the seed corn and the young plants  they are rather fond of using miners tunnels when he isnt about  danny hung his head and looked guilty but didnt say anything the only harm miner does is sometimes to tunnel so close to garden plants that he lets air in around the tender roots and they dry out continued old mother nature  his food consists almost wholly of worms grubs and insects and he has to have a great many to keep him alive  that is why he is so active  those tunnels of his which seem to be without any plan are made in his search for food  he is especially fond of angleworms  as a matter of fact he is a useful little fellow  the only time he becomes a nuisance to man is when he makes his little ridges across smooth lawns  even then he pays for the trouble by destroying the grubs in the grass roots grubs that in their turn would destroy the grass  when you see his ridges you may know that his food is close to the surface  when in dry or cold weather the worms go deep in the ground miner follows and then there is no trace of his tunnels on the surface  night and day are all the same to him  he works and sleeps when he chooses  in winter he tunnels below the frost line  you all noticed how dense his fur is  that is so the sand cannot work down in it  his home is a snug nest of grass or leaves in a little chamber under the ground in which several tunnels offer easy means of escape in case of sudden danger  has miner any near relatives asked peter rabbit  several replied old mother nature  all are much alike in habits  one who lives a little farther north is called brewers mole or the hairytailed mole  his tail is a little longer than miners and is covered with fine hair  the largest and handsomest member of the family is the oregon mole of the northwest  his coat is very dark and his fur extremely fine  his ways are much the same as those of miner whom you have just met excepting that when he is tunneling deep in the ground he pushes the earth to the surface after the manner of grubby gopher and his mounds become a nuisance to farmers  when he is tunneling just under the surface he makes ridges exactly like these of his eastern cousin  but the oddest member of the mole family is the starnosed mole he looks much like miner with the exception of his nose and tail his nose has a fringe of little fleshy points twentytwo of them like a manypointed star  from this he gets his name  his tail is a little longer than miners and is hairy  during the late fall and winter this becomes much enlarged  this funny little fellow with the starlike nose is especially fond of moist places swamps damp meadows and the banks of streams  he is not at all afraid of the water and is a good swimmer  sometimes he may be seen swimming under the ice in winter  he is seldom found where the earth is dry  for that matter none of the family are found in those sections where there are long dry periods and the earth becomes baked and hard  the fur of miner and his cousins will lay in either direction which keeps it smooth no matter whether the wearer is going forward or backward  otherwise it would be badly mussed up most of the time  altogether these little underground workers are most interesting little people when you know them  but that is something few people have a chance to do  now just remember that the shrews and the moles belong to the order of insectivora meaning eaters of insects and are the only two families in that order  and dont despise either of them for they do a great deal of good in the great world more than some right here whom i might name but will not  school is dismissed    chapter xxi  flitter the bat and his family  in the dusk of early evening as peter rabbit sat trying to make up his mind whether to spend that night at home in the dear old briarpatch with timid little mrs peter or go over to the green forest in search of adventure a very fine squeaky voice which came right out of the air above him startled him for a moment  better stay at home peter rabbit  better stay at home tonight said the thin squeaky voice  hello flitter exclaimed peter as he stared up at a little dark form darting this way twisting that way now up now down almost brushing peters head and then flying so high he could hardly be seen  why should i stay at home  because i saw old man coyote sneaking along the edge of the green forest reddy fox is hunting on the green meadows and hooty the owl is on watch in the old orchard replied flitter the red bat of course it is no business of mine what you do peter rabbit but were i in your place i certainly would stay at home  gracious im glad i can go where i please when i please  you ought to fly peter  you ought to fly  there is nothing like it  i wish i could sighed peter  well dont say i didnt warn you squeaked flitter and darted away in the direction of farmer browns house  peter wisely decided that the dear old briarpatch was the best place for him that night so he remained at home to the joy of timid little mrs peter and spent the night eating dozing and wondering how it would seem to be able to fly like flitter the bat  flitter was still in his mind when he started for school the next morning and by the time he got there he was bubbling over with curiosity and questions  he could hardly wait for school to be called to order  old mother nature noticed how fidgety he was  what have you on your mind peter she asked  didnt you tell us that the shrew family and the mole family are the only families in this country in the order of insecteaters asked peter  i certainly did was the prompt reply  doesnt flitter the bat live on insects asked peter  old mother nature nodded  he does said she  in fact he lives altogether on insects  then why isnt he a member of that order demanded peter  old mother nature smiled for she was pleased that peter had thought of this  that question does you credit peter said she  the reason is that he and his relatives are so very different from other animals that they have been placed in an order of their own  it is called the chiroptera which means winghanded  how many of you know flitter the bat  ive often seen him declared jumper the hare  so have i said chatterer the red squirrel  each of the others said the same thing  there wasnt one who hadnt watched and envied flitter darting about in the air just at dusk of early evening or as the black shadows were stealing away in the early morning  old mother nature smiled  seeing him isnt knowing him said she  who is there who knows anything about him and his ways save that he flies at night and catches insects in the air  she waited a minute or two but no one spoke  the fact is there was not one who really knew anything about flitter  it is one of the strange things of life said she that people often know nothing about the neighbors whom they see every day  but in this case it is not to be wondered at  i suspect none of you has seen flitter excepting in the air and then he moves so rapidly that there is no chance to get a good look at him  i think this is just the time and place for you to really make the acquaintance of flitter the red bat  she stepped over to a bush and parted the leaves  hanging from a twig was what appeared at first glance to be a rumpled reddish brown dead leaf  she touched it lightly  at once it came to life stirring uneasily  a thin squeaky voice peevishly demanded to know what was wanted  you have some callers a few of your friends who want to get really acquainted with you  suppose you wake up for a few minutes explained old mother nature pleasantly  flitter for that is just who it was yawned once or twice sleepily shook himself then grinned down at the wondering faces of his friends crowded about just under him  hello folks said he in that thin squeaky voice of his  the sunlight fell full on him but he seemed not to mind it in the least  in fact he appeared to enjoy its warmth  he was hanging by his toes head down his wings folded  he was about four inches long and his body was much like that of a mouse  his fur was fine and thick a beautiful orangered  for his size his ears were large  instead of the long head and sharp nose of the mouse family flitter had a rather round head and blunt nose  almost at once peter rabbit made a discovery  it was that flitter possessed a pair of bright little snapping eyes and didnt seem in the least bothered by the bright light  where did that saying blind as a bat ever come from demanded peter  old mother nature laughed  goodness knows i dont said she there is nothing blind about flitter  he sleeps through the day and does his hunting in the dusk of evening or early morning but if he is disturbed and has to fly during the day he has no trouble in seeing  flitter stretch out one of your wings so that everybody can see it  obediently flitter stretched out one of his wings  everybody gasped for it was the first time any of them ever had seen one of those wings near enough to know just what it was like flitters arm was long especially from his elbow to his hand but the surprising thing was the length of his three fingers each finger appeared to be about as long as the whole arm  from his shoulder a thin rubbery skin was stretched to the ends of the long fingers then across to the ankle of his hind foot on that side and from there across to the tip of his tail  a little short thumb with a long curved claw stuck up free from the edge of the wing  now you can see just why he is called winghanded explained old mother nature as flitter folded the wing  in a minute he began to clean it  everybody laughed for it was funny to watch him he would take the skin of the wing in his mouth and pull and stretch it as if it were rubber  he washed it with his tiny tongue  then he washed his fur  you see flitter is very neat  with the little claw of his thumb he scratched his head and combed his hair  all the time he remained hanging head down clinging to the twig with his toes  where is mrs flitter asked old mother nature  dont know replied flitter beginning on the other wing  shes quite equal to looking after herself so i dont worry about her  nor about your babies  flitter im ashamed of you  you are a poor kind of father declared old mother nature severely  if you dont know where to find your family ill show you  she stepped over to the very next tree parted the leaves and there sure enough hung mrs flitter fast asleep  and clinging to her were three of the funniest babies in all the great world all were asleep and old mother nature didnt awaken them  as for flitter he seemed to take not the slightest interest in his family but went right on with his toilet  flitter the red bat is one of the best known of the whole family in this country said old mother nature as they left flitter to resume his nap  he is found from the east to the far west from ocean to ocean  like the birds he migrates when cold weather comes returning in the early summer  although like all bats he sleeps all day as a rule he doesnt mind the sunlight as you have just seen for yourselves  sometimes on dull dark days he doesnt wait for evening but flies in the afternoon  usually he is the first of the bat family to appear in the evening often coming out while it is still light enough to show the color of his red coat no other member of his family has a coat of this color  some people call him the tree bat  after seeing him hanging over there i think you can guess why  he rarely goes to a cave for his daytime sleep as most of his relatives do but hangs by his toes from a twig of a tree or bush frequently not far from the ground just as he is right now  as all of you who have watched him know flitter is a swift flier this is because his wings are long and narrow  they are made for speed  i want you to know that the bats are among the most wonderful of all my little people  few if any birds can equal them in the air because of their wonderful ability to twist and turn they are masters of the art of flying  moreover they make no sound with their wings something which only the owls among birds can boast of  you all saw the three babies clinging to mrs flitter  most bats have but two babies at a time occasionally only one but the red bat and his larger cousin the hoary bat have three or four  mrs flitter carries her babies about with her until they are quite big when they are too large to be carried she leaves them hanging in a tree while she hunts for her meals  flitter has many cousins  one of these is the little brown bat one of the smallest members of the family and found all over the country  he is brown all over  he is sometimes called the cave bat because whenever a cave is to be found he sleeps there sometimes great numbers of these little bats are found crowded together in a big cave  when there is no cave handy a barn or hollow tree is used  often he will creep behind the closed blinds of a house to spend the day  very like this little fellow in color is his cousin the big brown bat called the house bat and the carolina bat  he is especially fond of the homes of men  he is a little bigger than the red bat while the latter is one of the first bats to appear in the evening the former is one of the last coming out only when it is quite dark  he also found all over the country  the silvery bat is of nearly the same size and in many places is more common than any its cousins  the fur is dark brown or black with white tips especially in the young  from this it gets its name  one of the largest and handsomest of the bat cousins and one of the rarest is the hoary bat  his fur is a mixture of dark and light brown tipped with white  he is very handsome  his wings are very long and narrow and he is one of the most wonderful of all fliers  he is a lover of the green forest and does his hunting high above the treetops making his appearance late in the evening  like the red bat he spends the hours of daylight hanging in a tree  down in the southeast is a member of the family with ears so big that he is called the bigeared bat  he is a little chap smaller than little brown bat and his ears are half as long his head and body together  what do you think of that  for his size he has the biggest ears of any animal in all this great country  a relative in the southwest is the bigeared bat  all members of the bat family are drinkers and usually the first thing they do when they start out at dusk is to seek water  all live wholly on insects and for this reason they are among the very best friends of man  they eat great numbers of mosquitoes  they do no harm whatever which is more than can be said for some of the rest of you little folks  now who shall we learn about next    chapter xxii  an independent family  just as old mother nature asked who they should learn about next happy jack squirrel spied some one coming down the lone little path  see whos coming cried happy jack  everybody turned to look down the lone little path  there ambling along in the most matteroffact and unconcerned way imaginable came a certain small person who was dressed wholly in black and white  hello jimmy skunk cried chatterer the red squirrel  what are you doing over here in the green forest  jimmy skunk looked up and grinned  it was a slow goodnatured grin  hello everybody said he i thought i would just amble over here and see your school i suppose all you fellows are getting so wise that pretty soon you will think you know all there is to know  have any of you seen any fat beetles around here  just then jimmy noticed old mother nature and hastened to bow his head in a funny way  please excuse me mother nature he said i thought school was over  i dont want to interrupt  old mother nature smiled  the fact is old mother nature is rather fond of jimmy skunk  you arent interrupting said she  the fact is we had just ended the lesson about flitter the bat and his relatives and were trying to decide who to study about next i think you came along at just the right time  you belong to a large and rather important order one that all these little folks here ought to know about  how many cousins have you jimmy  jimmy skunk looked a little surprised at the question  he scratched his head thoughtfully  let me see said he i have several close cousins in the skunk branch of the family but i presume you want to know who my cousins are outside of the skunk branch  they are shadow the weasel billy mink and little joe otter  these are the only ones i can think of now  how about digger the badger asked old mother nature  a look of surprise swept over jimmy skunks face  digger the badger he exclaimed  digger the badger is no cousin of mine  tut tut tut chided old mother nature  tut tut tut jimmy skunk  it is high time you came to school  digger the badger is just as much a cousin of yours as is shadow the weasel  you are members of the same order and it is a rather large order  it is called the carnivora which means flesheating  you are a member of the marten or weasel family and that family is called the mustelidae  digger the badger is also a member of that family  that means that you two are cousins  you and digger and glutton the wolverine belong to the stoutbodied branch of the family  billy mink little joe otter shadow the weasel pekan the fisher and spite the marten belong to its slimbodied branch but all are members of the same family despite the difference in looks and thus of course are cousins  seeing that you are here jimmy i think we will find out just how much these little folks know about you  peter rabbit tell us what you know about jimmy skunk  i know one thing about him declared peter and thats that he is the most independent fellow in the world  he isnt afraid of anybody i saw buster bear actually step out of his way the other day  jimmy skunk grinned  buster always treats me very politely said jimmy  i have noticed that everybody does even farmer browns boy spoke up happy jack squirrel  it is easy enough to be independent when everybody is afraid of you sputtered chatterer the red squirrel  just why is everybody afraid of jimmy skunk  asked old mother nature  they are afraid of that little scent gun he carries spoke up peter rabbit i wish i had one just like it  old mother nature shook her head  it wouldnt do peter to trust you with a gun like jimmy skunks said she  you are altogether too heedless and careless  if you had a scent gun like jimmys i am afraid there would be trouble in the green forest and on the green meadow all the time  i suspect that you would drive everybody else away  jimmy is never heedless or careless  he never uses that little scent gun unless he is in real danger or thinks he is  usually he is pretty sure that he is before he uses it  ill venture to say that not one of you has seen jimmy use that little scent gun  peter looked at jumper the hare  jumper looked at chatterer  chatterer looked at happy jack  happy jack looked at danny meadow mouse  danny looked at striped chipmunk  striped looked at johnny chuck  johnny looked at whitefoot the wood mouse  then all looked at old mother nature and shook their heads  i thought as much said she  jimmy is wonderfully well armed but for defense only  he never makes the mistake of misusing that little scent gun  but everybody knows he has it so nobody interferes with him  now peter what more do you know about jimmy  hes lazy replied peter  im not lazy retorted jimmy skunk  im no more lazy than you are  you call me lazy just because i dont hurry  i dont have to hurry and i never can see any good in hurrying when one doesnt have to  that will do interposed old mother nature  go on peter with what you know about jimmy  he is goodnatured said peter and grinned at jimmy  jimmy grinned back  thank you peter said he  he is one of the bestnatured people i know continued peter  i guess it is a lucky thing for the rest of us that he is  i have noticed that fat people are usually goodnatured and jimmy is nearly always fat  in fact i dont think i have seen him what you would call really thin excepting very early in the spring  he eats beetles and grubs and grasshoppers and crickets and insects of all sorts  i am told that he steals eggs when he can find them  yes and he catches members of my family when he can spoke up danny meadow mouse  i never feel safe with jimmy skunk very near  jimmy didnt look at all put out  i might as well confess that tender mouse is rather to my liking said he and i might add that i also enjoy a frog now and then or a lizard or a fish  also you might mention that young birds dont come amiss when you can get them spoke up chatterer the red squirrel maliciously  jimmy looked up at chatterer  thats a case of the pot calling the kettle black said he and chatterer made a face at him  but chatterer said nothing more for he knew that all the others knew that what jimmy said was true chatterer had robbed many a nest of young birds  is that all you know about jimmy asked old mother nature of peter  i guess it is replied peter excepting that he lives in a hole in the ground and i seldom see him out in winter  i rather think he sleeps all winter the same as johnny chuck does  youve got another think coming peter said jimmy  i sleep a lot during the winter but i dont go into winter quarters until well after snow comes and i dont sleep the way johnny chuck does sometimes i go out in winter and hunt around a little  do you dig your house asked old mother nature  jimmy shook his head  not when i can help myself said he it is too much work  if i have to i do but i would much rather use one of johnny chucks old houses  his houses suit me first rate  i want you all to look at jimmy very closely said old mother nature  you will notice that he is about the size of black pussy the cat from farmer browns and that his coat is black with broad white stripes  but not all skunks are marked alike  i dare say that no two of jimmys children would be exactly alike i suspect that one or more might be all black with perhaps a little bit of white on the tail  notice that jimmys front feet have long sharp claws  he uses these to dig out grubs and insects in the ground and for pulling over sticks and stones in his search for beetles  also notice that he places his feet on the ground very much as does buster bear  that big bushy tail of his is for the purpose of warning folks  jimmy never shoots that little scent gun without first giving warning  when that tail of his begins to go up in the air wise people watch out  a lot of people make the mistake of thinking that jimmy skunk and his family do a great deal of harm  the truth is they do a great deal of good to man  once in a while they will make the mistake of stealing chickens or eggs but it is only once in a while  they make up for all they take in this way by the pests they destroy jimmy and mrs skunk have a large family each year usually from six to ten  mrs skunk usually is living by herself when the babies are born but when they are big enough to walk their father rejoins the family and you may see them almost any pleasant evening starting out together to hunt for grasshoppers beetles and other things  often the whole family remains together the whole winter not breaking up until spring  jimmy is one of the neatest of all my little people and takes the best of care of his handsome coat he isnt afraid of water and can swim if it is necessary  he does most of his hunting at night sleeping during the day  he is one of the few little wild people who havent been driven away by man and often makes his home close to mans home  jimmy has own cousins in nearly all parts of this great country way down in the southwest is one called the hognosed skunk one of the largest of the family  he gets his name because of the shape of his nose and the fact that he roots in the ground the same as a hog  he is also called the badger skunk because of the big claws on his front feet and the fact that he is a great digger  his fur is not so fine as that of jimmy skunk but is rather coarse and harsh  he is even more of an insect eater than is jimmy  the smallest of jimmys own cousins is the little spotted skunk he is only about half as big as jimmy and his coat instead of being striped with white like jimmys is covered with irregular white lines and spots making it appear very handsome  he lives in the southern half of the country and in habits is much like jimmy but he is much livelier  occasionally he climbs low trees like jimmy he eats almost anything he can find  and it goes without saying that like jimmy he carries a little scent gun by the way jimmy what do you do when you are angry  show us  jimmy began to growl a queersounding little growl and at the same time to stamp the ground with his front feet  old mother nature laughed  when you see jimmy do that said she it is best to pretend you dont see him and keep out of his way  hasnt jimmy any enemies at all asked peter rabbit  that depends on how hungry some folks get replied old mother nature  hooty the owl doesnt seem to mind jimmys little scent gun but this is the only one i can think of who doesnt  some of the bigger animals might take him if they were starving but even then i think they would think twice  who knows where digger the badger is living  i do replied peter rabbit  he is living out on the green meadows over near the old pasture  all right peter replied old mother nature suppose you run over and pay him a visit and tomorrow morning you can tell us about it    chapter xxiii  digger and his cousin glutton  well peter said old mother nature did you visit digger the badger yesterday  yesm replied peter i visited him but i didnt find out much hes a regular old grouch  he isnt the least bit neighborly  it took me a long time to find him  he has more holes than anybody i ever knew and i couldnt tell which one is his home  when i did find him he gave me a terrible scare  i didnt see him until i was right on top of him and if i hadnt jumped and jumped quickly i guess i wouldnt be here this morning  he was lying flat down in the grass and he was so very flat that i just didnt see him  when i told him that i wanted to know all about him and his ways he replied that it was none of my business how he lived or what he did and that was all i could get out of him  i sat around awhile and watched him but he didnt do much except take a sun bath  he certainly is a queerlooking fellow to be a member of the weasel family  theres nothing about him that looks like a weasel that i could see  of course he isnt as broad as he is long but he looks almost that when he is lying flat down and that long hair of his is spread out on both sides  he really has a handsome coat when you come to look at it  it is silvery gray and silky looking  it seems to be parted right down the middle of his back  his tail is rather short but stout and hairy  his head and face are really handsome  his cheeks chin and a broad stripe from his nose right straight back over his head are white  on each cheek is a bar of black  the back part of each ear is black and so are his feet  he has rather a sharp nose  somehow when he is walking he makes me think of a little flattenedout bear with very short legs  and such claws as he has on his front feet  i dont know any one with such big strong claws for his size  i guess that must be because he is such a digger  thats a very good guess peter said old mother nature  has any one here ever seen him dig  i did once replied peter  i happened to be over near where he lives when farmer browns boy came along and surprised digger some distance from one of his holes  digger didnt try to get to one of those holes he simply began to dig  my gracious how the sand did fly  he was out of sight in the ground before farmer browns boy could get to him  johnny chuck is pretty good at digging but he simply isnt in the same class with digger the badger  no one is that i know of unless it is miner the mole  i guess this is all i know about him excepting that he is a great fighter  once i saw him whip a dog almost twice his size  i never heard such hissing and snarling and growling  he wouldnt tell me anything about how he lives  very good peter very good replied old mother nature thats as much as i expected you would be able to find out  digger is a queer fellow  his home is on the great plains and in the flat open country of the middle west and far west where gophers and ground squirrels and prairie dogs live  they furnish him with the greater part of his food  all of them are good diggers but they dont stand any chance when he sets out to dig them out  digger spends most of his time under ground during daylight seldom coming out except for a sun bath  but as soon as jolly round red mr sun goes to bed for the night digger appears and travels about in search of a dinner  his legs are so short and he is so stout and heavy that he is slow and rather clumsy but he makes up for that by his ability to dig  he doesnt expect to catch any one on the surface unless he happens to surprise a meadow mouse within jumping distance he goes hunting for the holes of ground squirrels and other burrowers and when he finds one promptly digs  he eats grasshoppers beetles and small snakes as well as such small animals as he catches  it was well for you peter that you jumped when you did for i suspect that digger would have enjoyed a rabbit dinner  very little is known of diggers family life but he is a good husband  in winter he sleeps as johnny chuck does coming out soon after the snow disappears in the spring  of all my little people none has greater courage  when he is cornered he will fight as long as there is a breath of life in him  his skin is very tough and he is further protected by his long hair  his teeth are sharp and strong and he can always give a good account of himself in a fight  he is afraid of no one of his own size  man hunts him for his fur but man is very stupid in many things and this is an example  you see digger is worth a great deal more alive than dead because of the great number of destructive rodents he kills  the only thing that can be brought against him is the number of holes he digs  mr and mrs digger have two to five babies late in the spring or early in the summer  they are born under ground in a nest of grass  as you may guess just by looking at digger he is very strong  if he once gets well into the ground a strong man pulling on his tail cannot budge him  as peter has pointed out he isnt at all sociable  mr and mrs digger are quite satisfied to live by themselves and be left alone  so he is rarely seen in daytime but probably is out oftener than is supposed  peter has told how he nearly stepped on digger before seeing him  it is diggers wise habit to lie perfectly still until he is sure he has been seen so people often pass him without seeing him at all or if they see him they take him for a stone  while digger the badger is a lover of the open country and doesnt like the green forest at all he has a cousin who is found only in the green forest and usually very deep in the green forest at that this is glutton the wolverine the largest and ugliest member of the family  none of you have seen him because he lives almost wholly in the great forests of the north  he hasnt a single friend that i know of but that doesnt trouble him in the least  glutton has several names  he is called carcajou in the far north and out in the far west is often called skunkbear  the latter name probably is given him because in shape and color he looks a good deal as though he might be half skunk and half bear he is about three feet long with a tail six inches long and is thickset and heavy  his legs are short and very stout  his hair including that on the tail is long and shaggy  it is blackish brown becoming grayish on the upper part of his head and cheeks his feet are black  when he walks he puts his feet flat on the ground as a bear does  being so short of leg and heavy of body he is slow in his movements but what he lacks in this respect he makes up in strength and cunning you think reddy fox and old man coyote are smart but neither begins to be as smart as glutton the wolverine  he is a great traveler and in the far north where the greater part of the fur of the world is trapped he is a pest to the trappers  he will follow a trapper all day long keeping just out of sight  no matter how carefully a trapper hides a trap glutton will find it and steal the bait without getting caught  sometimes he even tears up the traps and takes them off and hides them in the woods  if he comes on a trap in which some other animal has been caught he will eat the animal  his strength is so great that often he will tear his way into the cabins of hunters while they are absent and then eat or destroy all their food  his appetite is tremendous and it is because of this that he is called glutton what he cannot eat or take away he covers with filth so that no other animal will touch it  he is of ugly disposition and is hated alike by the animals and by man  his fur is of considerable value but he is hunted more for the purpose of getting rid of him than for his fur  sometimes when caught in a trap he will pick it up and carry it for miles  mrs glutton has two or three babies in the spring  they live in a cave but if a cave cannot be found they use a hole in the ground which mrs glutton digs  it is usually well hidden and seldom has been found by man  glutton will eat any kind of flesh and seems not to care whether it be freshly killed or so old that it is decayed the only way that hunters can protect their supplies is by covering them with great logs  even then glutton will often tear the logs apart to get at the supplies  because of his great cunning the indians think he is possessed of an evil spirit  i think this will do for today  tomorrow we will take up another branch of the family some members of which all of you know  i wonder if it wouldnt be a good plan to have shadow the weasel here  such a look of dismay as swept over the faces of all those little people with the exception of jimmy skunk and prickly porky  if ifif you please i dont think ill come tomorrow morning said danny meadow mouse  iii think i shall be too busy at home and will have to miss that lesson said striped chipmunk  old mother nature smiled  dont worry little folks said she you ought to know that if i had shadow here i wouldnt let him hurt one of you  but i am afraid if he were here you would pay no attention to me so i promise you that shadow will not be anywhere near    chapter xxiv  shadow and his family  every one was on hand when school opened the next morning despite the fear that the mere mention of shadow the weasel had aroused in all save jimmy skunk and prickly porky  you see all felt they must be there so that they might learn all they possibly could about one they so feared  it might help them to escape should they discover shadow hunting them sometime  striped chipmunk said old mother nature you know something about shadow the weasel tell us what you know  i know i hate him declared striped chipmunk and all the others nodded their heads in agreement  i dont know a single good thing about him he continued but i know plenty of bad things  he is the one enemy i fear more than any other because he is the one who can go wherever i can  any hole i can get into he can  ive seen him just twice in my life and i hope i may never see him again  what did he look like asked old mother nature  like a snake on legs declared striped chipmunk  anyway that is what he made me think of because his body was so long and slim and he twisted and turned so easily  he was about as long as chatterer the red squirrel but looked longer because of his slim body and long neck  he was brown above and white below  his front feet were white and his hind feet rather whitish but not clear white  his short round tail was black at the end  somehow his small head and sharp face made me think of a snake  ugh  i dont like to think about him  i saw him once and he wasnt brown at all  striped chipmunk is all wrong excepting about the end of his tail interrupted jumper the hare  he was all white every bit of him but the end of his tail that was black  striped chipmunk is quite right and so are you declared old mother nature  striped chipmunk saw him in summer and you saw him in winter he changes his coat according to season just as you do yourself jumper  in winter he is trapped for his fur and he isnt called weasel then at all but ermine  oh said jumper and looked as if he felt a wee bit foolish  what was he doing when you saw him asked old mother nature turning to striped chipmunk  hunting replied striped chipmunk and shivered  he was hunting me  he had found my tracks where i had been gathering beechnuts and he was following them with his nose just the way bowser the hound follows reddy fox  i nearly died of fright when i saw him  you are lucky to be alive declared chatterer the red squirrel  i know it replied striped chipmunk and shivered again  i know it  i guess i wouldnt be if reddy fox hadnt happened along just then and frightened shadow away  ive had a kindlier feeling for reddy fox ever since  i never ran harder in my life than the time i saw him spoke up jumper the hare  he was hunting me just the same way running with his nose in the snow and following every twist and turn i had made  but for that blacktipped tail i wouldnt have seen him until too late  pooh exclaimed jimmy skunk  the idea of a big fellow like you running from such a little fellow as my cousin shadow  im not ashamed of running declared jumper  i may be ever so much bigger but he is so quick i wouldnt stand the least chance in the world  when i suspect shadow is about i go somewhere else the farther the better  if i could climb a tree like chatterer it would be different  no it wouldnt interrupted chatterer  no it wouldnt  that fellow can climb almost as well as i can  the only thing that saved me from him once was the fact that i could make a long jump from one tree to another and he couldnt  he had found a hole in a certain tree where i was living and it was just luck that i wasnt at home when he called  i was just returning when he popped out  i ran for my life  he is the most awful fellow in all the great world declared whitefoot the wood mouse  jimmy skunk chuckled right out  a lot you know about the great world he said  why you are farther from home now than youve ever been in your life before yet i could walk to it in a few minutes  how do you know shadow is the most awful fellow in the great world  i just know thats all retorted whitefoot in a very positive though squeaky voice  he hunts and kills just for the love of it and no one no matter how big he is can do anything more awful than that  i have a lot of enemies  sometimes it seems as if almost every one of my neighbors is looking for a mouse dinner but all but shadow the weasel hunt me when they are hungry and need food  i can forgive them for that  every one must eat to live  but shadow hunts me even when his stomach is so full he cannot eat another mouthful  that fellow just loves to kill he takes pleasure in it  that is what makes him so awful  whitefoot is right declared old mother nature and she spoke sadly  if shadow was as big as buster bear or puma the panther or even tufty the lynx he would be the most terrible creature in all the great world because of this awful desire to kill which fills him  he is hotblooded quicktempered and fearless  even when cornered by an enemy against whom he has no chance he will fight to the last gasp  i am sorry to say that there is no kindness nor gentleness in him towards any save his own family outside of that he hasnt a friend in the world not one  hasnt he any enemies asked peter rabbit  oh yes replied old mother nature  reddy fox old man coyote hooty the owl and various members of the hawk family have to be watched for by him  but they do not worry him much  you see he moves so quickly dodging out of sight in a flash that whoever catches him must be quick indeed  then too he is almost always close to good cover  he delights in old stone walls stone piles brushgrown fences piles of rubbish and barns and old buildings the places that mice delight in  in such places there is always a hole to dart into in time of danger  he hunts whenever he feels like it be it day or night and often covers considerable ground though nothing to compare with his big brown waterloving cousin billy mink  it is because of his wonderful ability to disappear in an instant that he is called shadow  shadow is known as the common weasel shorttailed weasel brown weasel bonaparte weasel and ermine and is found all over the forested parts of the northern part of the country  a little farther south in the east is a cousin very much like him called the new york weasel  on the great plains of the west is a larger cousin with a longer tail called the longtailed weasel large ermine or yellowbellied weasel  his smallest cousin is the least weasel the latter is not much longer than a mouse  in winter he is all white even the tip of his tail  in summer he is a purer white underneath than his larger cousins  all of the weasels are alike in habits  when running they bound over the ground much as peter rabbit does  in that part of the west where yap yap the prairie dog lives is a relative called the blackfooted ferret who looks like a large weasel  he is about the size of billy mink but instead of the rich dark brown of billys coat his coat is a creamy yellow  his feet are black and so is the tip of his tail  his face is whitish with a dark band across the eyes  he is most frequently found in prairie dog towns and lives largely on yap yap and his friends his ways are those of shadow and his cousins  there is no one yap yap fears quite as much  the one good thing shadow the weasel does is to kill robber the rat whenever they meet  robber as you know is big and savage and always ready for a fight when cornered  but all the fight goes out of him when shadow appears  perhaps it is because he knows how hopeless it is  when shadow finds a barn overrun with rats he will sometimes stay until he has killed or driven out the last one  then perhaps he spoils it all by killing a dozen chickens in a night  it is a sad thing not to be able to speak well of any one but shadow the weasel like robber the rat has by his ways made himself hated by all the little people of the green forest and the green meadows and by man  there is not one to say a good word for him  now tomorrow we will meet on the bank of the smiling pool instead of here    chapter xxv  two famous swimmers  the bank of the smiling pool was a lovely place to hold school at that hour of the day which you know was just after sunup everybody who could get there was on hand and there were several who had not been to school before  one of these was grandfather frog who was sitting on his big green lily pad  another was jerry muskrat whose house was out in the smiling pool  spotty the turtle was also there not to mention longlegs the heron  you see they hadnt come to school but the school had come to them for that is where they live or spend most of their time  good morning jerry muskrat said old mother nature pleasantly as jerrys brown head appeared in the smiling pool  have you seen anything of billy mink or little joe otter  little joe went down to the big river last night replied jerry muskrat  i dont know when he is coming back but i wouldnt be surprised to see him any minute  billy mink was here last evening and said he was going up the laughing brook fishing  he is likely to be back any time  one never can tell when that fellow will appear  he comes and goes continually  i dont believe he can keep still five minutes  who is that cant keep still five minutes demanded a new voice and there was billy mink himself just climbing out on the big rock  jerry was speaking of you replied old mother nature  this will be a good chance for you to show him that he is mistaken  i want you to stay here for a while and to stay right on the big rock  i may want to ask you a few questions  just then billy mink dived into the smiling pool and a second later his brown head popped out of the water and in his mouth was a fat fish  he scrambled back on the big rock and looked at old mother nature a bit fearfully as he laid the fish down  ii didnt mean to disobey he mumbled  i saw that fish and dived for him before i thought  i hope you will forgive me mother nature  i wont do it again  acting before thinking gets people into trouble sometimes replied old mother nature  however i will forgive you this time  the fact is you have just shown your friends here something  go ahead and eat that fish and be ready to answer questions  as billy mink sat there on the big rock every one had a good look at him  one glance would tell any one that he was a cousin of shadow the weasel  he was much larger than shadow but of the same general shape being long and slender  his coat was a beautiful dark brown darkest on the back  his chin was white  his tail was round covered with fairly long hair which was so dark as to be almost black  his face was like that of shadow the weasel  his legs were rather short  as he sat eating that fish his back was arched  old mother nature waited until he had finished his feast  now then billy said she i want you to answer a few questions which do you like best night or day  it doesnt make any particular difference to me replied billy i just sleep when i feel like it whether it be night or day and then when i wake up i can hunt  it all depends on how i feel  when you go hunting what do you hunt asked old mother nature  billy grinned  anything that promises a good meal said he  im not very particular  a fat mouse a tender young rabbit a chipmunk a frog tadpoles chickens eggs birds fish whatever happens to be easiest to get suits me  i am rather fond of fish and thats one reason that i live along the laughing brook and around the smiling pool  but i like a change of fare and so often i go hunting in the green forest  sometimes i go up to farmer browns for a chicken  in the spring i hunt for nests of birds on the ground  in winter if peter rabbit should happen along here when i was hungry i might be tempted to sample peter  billy snapped his bright eyes wickedly and peter shivered  if jerry muskrat were not my friend i am afraid i might be tempted to sample him continued billy mink  pooh exclaimed peter rabbit  you wouldnt dare tackle jerry muskrat  wouldnt i replied billy  just ask jerry how he feels about it  one look at jerrys face showed everybody that jerry big as he was was afraid of billy mink  how do you hunt when you are on land asked old mother nature  the way every good hunter should hunt with eyes nose and ears replied billy  there may be folks with better ears than ive got but i dont know who they are  i wouldnt swap noses with anybody as for my eyes well they are plenty good enough for me  in other words you hunt very much as does your cousin shadow the weasel said old mother nature  billy nodded  i suppose i do said he but theres one thing he does which i dont do and thats hunt just for the love of killing  once in a while i may kill more than i can eat but i dont mean to i hunt for food while he hunts just for the love of killing  you all saw how billy catches fish said old mother nature now billy i want you to swim over to the farther bank and show us how you run  billy obeyed  he slipped into the water dived swam under water for a distance then swam with just his head out  when he reached the bank he climbed out and started along it  he went by a series of bounds his back arched sharply between each leap  then he disappeared before their very eyes only to reappear as suddenly as he had gone  so quick were his movements that it was impossible for one of the little people watching to keep their eyes on him it seemed sometimes as though he must have vanished into the air of course he didnt  he was simply showing them his wonderful ability to take advantage of every little stick stone and bush  billy is a great traveler said old mother nature  he really loves to travel up and down the laughing brook even for long distances  wherever there is plenty of driftwood and rubbish billy is quite at home being so slender he can slip under all kinds of places and into all sorts of holes  quick as he is on land he is not so quick as his cousin shadow and good swimmer as he is he isnt so good as his bigger cousin little joe otter but being equally at home on land and in water he has an advantage over his cousins  billy is much hunted for his fur and being hunted so much has made him very keenwitted  mrs billy makes her home nest in a hole in the bank or under an old stump or under a pile of driftwood and you may be sure it is well hidden there the babies are born and they stay with their mother all summer  incidentally billy can climb readily  billy is found all over this great country of ours  when he lives in the far north his fur is finer and thicker than when he lives in the south i wish little joe otter were here  i hoped he would be  here he comes now cried jerry muskrat  i rather expected he would be back  jerry pointed towards where the laughing brook left the smiling pool on its way to the big river  a brown head was moving rapidly towards them  there was no mistaking that head it could belong to no one but little joe otter  straight on to the big rock he came and climbed up  he was big being one of the largest members of his family  he was more than three feet long  but no one looking at him could mistake him for any one but a member of the weasel family  his legs were short very short for the length of his body  his tail was fairly long and broad  his coat was a rich brown all over a little lighter underneath than on the back  whats going on here asked little joe otter his eyes bright with interest  we are holding a session of school here today explained old mother nature  and we were just hoping that you would appear hold up one of your feet and spread the toes little joe  little joe otter obeyed though there was a funny puzzled look on his face  whyee exclaimed peter rabbit  his toes are webbed like those of paddy the beaver  of course theyre webbed said little joe  i never could swim the way i do if they werent webbed  can you swim better than paddy the beaver asked peter  i should say i can  if i couldnt i guess i would go hungry most of the time replied little joe  why should you go hungry  paddy doesnt retorted peter  paddy doesnt live on fish replied little joe  i do and thats the difference  i can catch a fish in a tailend race and thats going some  you might show us how you can swim suggested old mother nature  little joe slipped into the water  the smiling pool was very still and the little people sitting on the bank could look right down and see nearly to the bottom  they saw little joe as he entered the water and then saw little more than a brown streak  a second later his head popped out on the other side of the smiling pool  phew im glad im not a fish exclaimed peter and everybody laughed  you may well be glad said old mother nature  you wouldnt stand much chance with little joe around  like billy mink little joe is a great traveler especially up and down the laughing brook and the big river  sometimes he travels over land but he is so heavy and his legs are so short that traveling on land is slow work  when he does cross from one stream or pond to another he always picks out the smoothest going  sometimes in winter he travels quite a bit then when he comes to a smooth hill he slides down it on his stomach  by the way little joe havent you a slippery slide somewhere around here  little joe nodded  ive got one down the laughing brook where the bank is steep said he  mrs otter and i and our children slide every day  what do you mean by a slippery slide asked happy jack squirrel who was sitting in the big hickorytree which grew on the bank of the smiling pool  old mother nature smiled  little joe otter and his family are quite as fond of play as any of my children said she  they get a lot of fun out of life  one of their ways of playing is to make a slippery slide where the bank is steep and the water deep  in winter it is made of snow but in summer it is made of mud  there they slide down splash into the water then climb up the bank and do it all over again  in winter they make their slippery slide where the water doesnt freeze and they get just as much fun in winter as they do in summer  i suppose that means that little joe doesnt sleep in winter as johnny chuck does said peter  i should say not exclaimed little joe  i like the winter too i have such a warm coat that i never get cold  there are always places where the water doesnt freeze  i can swim for long distances under ice and so i can always get plenty of food  do you eat anything but fish asked peter rabbit  oh sometimes replied little joe  once in a while i like a little fresh meat for a change and sometimes when fish are scarce i eat frogs but i prefer fish especially salmon and trout  how many babies do you have at a time asked happy jack squirrel  usually one to three replied little joe and only one family a year  they are born in my comfortable house which is a burrow in the bank  there mrs otter makes a large soft nest of leaves and grass  now if you dont mind i think i will go on up the laughing brook  mrs otter is waiting for me up there  old mother nature told little joe to go ahead  as he disappeared she sighed  im very fond of little joe otter said she and it distresses me greatly that he is hunted by man as he is  that fur coat of his is valuable and man is forever hunting him for it  the otters were once numerous all over this great country but now they are very scarce and i am afraid that the day isnt far away when there will be no little joe otter  i think this will do for today  there are two other members of the weasel family and these like little joe and billy mink are continually being hunted for their fur coats  i will tell you about them tomorrow    chapter xxvi  spite the marten and pekan the fisher  the two remaining members of the weasel family none of you have ever seen began old mother nature when she opened school at the old meeting place in the green forest the morning after their visit to the smiling pool  you have never seen them because they live in the deep forests of the far north  but were you living up there you would know them and the dread of them would seldom be out of your mind  one is called spite the marten and the other pekan the fisher  spite the marten is also called the pine marten and the american sable and he is one of the handsomest members of the weasel family shadow the weasel can climb but he spends most of his time on the ground  jimmy skunk and digger the badger are not climbers at all little joe otter spends most of his time in the water  but spite the marten is a lover of the tree tops and is quite as much at home there as chatterer the red squirrel  when he is moving about in the trees he looks much like a very large squirrel while on the ground he might be mistaken for a young fox  his coat is a rich dark yellowishbrown becoming almost black on the tail and legs  his throat usually is yellow though sometimes it is almost white  the sides of his face are grayish and his goodsized ears are grayishwhite on the inside his tail is about half as long as his body and is covered with long hair but isnt bushy like a squirrels  while his general shape is that of shadow the weasel his body is much heavier in proportion to his size  chatterer you and your cousin happy jack may well be thankful that spite the marten doesnt live about here for he is very fond of squirrels and delights to hunt them  he can leap from tree to tree quite as easily as either of you and the only possible means of escape for a squirrel he is hunting is a hole too small for spite to get into  no squirrel is more graceful in the trees than is spite  but he by no means confines himself to the trees  he is quite at home on the ground and there he moves with much of the quickness of shadow the weasel  he delights to hunt rabbits and he covers great distances being even more of a traveller than billy mink he doesnt kill for the love of killing but merely for food  if he kills more than he can eat at a meal he buries it and when he is hungry again he returns to it  like all the other members of his family he is a great hunter of mice  also he catches many birds especially those birds which nest on the ground  birds eggs frogs toads some insects and fish vary his bill of fare but unlike his smaller cousins he eats some other things besides flesh including certain nuts berries and honey  he isnt in the least social with his own kind but prefers to live alone and is always ready to fight if he meets another marten  being so great a traveler he has several dens  mrs spite makes her nest of grass and moss in a hollow tree as a rule occasionally in a hole in the ground  she has from one to five babies in the spring  spite is not a good father for he has nothing to do with his family  as i told you in the beginning he is found only in the great forests of the north  the darker and deeper they are the better it suits him  his own cousin pekan the fisher and tufty the lynx are probably the only natural enemies he has much cause to fear  his one great enemy is man  his coat is one of the most highly prized of all furs and he is persistently hunted and trapped  in fact his coat is one of the chief prizes of the fur trappers  in this same deep dark forest clear across the northern part of the country lives pekan the fisher also called the pennant marten and blackcat  he is larger and heavier than spite the marten and his coat is a brownishblack light on the sides and browner below his nose ears feet and tail are black  he gets his name of blackcat from his resemblance to a cat with a bushy tail though on the ground he looks more like a black fox  like his cousin spite the marten he lives in the pine and spruce forests and prefers to be near swamps he is a splendid climber but spends quite as much time on the ground however he is even livelier in the trees than is spite the marten spite can catch a squirrel in the tree tops but pekan can catch spite and often does  he isnt afraid of leaping to the ground from high up in a tree and often when coming down a tree he comes down headfirst he is very fond of hunting the cousins of jumper the hare and is so tireless that he can run them down  he is very clever and like his cousin glutton the wolverine makes no end of trouble for trappers by stealing the baits from their traps  you all remember how frightened prickly porky was when i merely mentioned pekan the fisher  it was because pekan is almost the only one prickly porky has reason to fear  if pekan is hungry he doesnt hesitate to dine on porcupine  he has learned how to turn a porcupine on his back and as you have already found out the under part of the porcupine is unprotected  just why pekan should be called fisher i dont know  true he eats fish when he can get them but he isnt a water animal and doesnt go fishing as do billy mink and little joe otter  his food is much the same as that of spite the marten  he is especially fond of rabbit and hare  he is so strong and savage that he can kill a fox and often does  bobby coon is a good fighter and much bigger and heavier than pekan but he is no match for pekan  probably all of you have guessed that being a true marten pekans coat is highly prized by the fur trappers  he hates the presence of man and with good cause  now this ends the weasel family but thats only one family of the order of carnivora or flesh eaters  there is one family you all know so well that i think we will take that up next  it is the family to which reddy fox and old man coyote belong and it is called the dog family  tomorrow morning when you get here i may have a surprise for you    chapter xxvii  reddy fox joins the school  when school was called to order the following morning not one was missing  you see with the exception of jimmy skunk and prickly porky there was not one in whose life reddy fox did not have a most important part  even happy jack the gray squirrel and chatterer the red squirrel tree folk though they were had many times narrowly missed furnishing reddy with a dinner  as for johnny chuck and peter rabbit and jumper the hare and striped chipmunk and danny meadow mouse and whitefoot the wood mouse there were few hours of day or night when they did not have reddy in mind knowing that to forget him even for a few minutes might mean the end of them  just imagine the feelings of these little people when just as they had comfortably seated themselves for the morning lesson reddy himself stepped out from behind a tree  never before was a school so quickly broken up  in the winking of an eye old mother nature was alone save for reddy fox jimmy skunk and in the trees prickly porky the porcupine and happy jack and chatterer  reddy fox looked as if he felt uncomfortable  i didnt mean to break up your school said he to old mother nature  i wouldnt have thought of coming if you hadnt sent for me  old mother nature smiled  i didnt tell any one that i was going to send for you reddy said she for i was afraid that if i did no one would come this morning  i promised them a surprise but it is clear that no one guessed what that surprise was to be  go over by that old stump near the lone little path and sit there reddy  then old mother nature called each of the little people by name commanding each to return at once  she spoke sternly very sternly indeed  one by one they appeared from all sorts of hiding places glancing fearfully towards reddy fox yet not daring to disobey old mother nature  when at last all were crowded about her as closely as they could get old mother nature spoke and this time her voice was soft  i am ashamed of you said she  truly i am ashamed of you  how could you think that i would allow any harm to come to you  reddy fox is here because i sent for him but he is going to sit right where he is until i tell him he can go and not one of you will be harmed by him  to begin with i am going to tell you one or two facts about reddy and then i am going to find out just how much you have learned about him yourselves  it may seem queer to you that reddy fox belongs to the same family as bowser the hound but it is true  both are members of the dog family and thus are quite closely related  howler the wolf and old man coyote are also members of the family so all are cousins look closely at reddy and you will see at once that he looks very much like a small dog with a beautiful red coat white waistcoat black feet and bushy tail  now peter you probably know as much about reddy as any one here  at least you should  tell us what you have learned in your efforts to keep out of his clutches  peter scratched a long ear thoughtfully and glanced sideways at reddy fox  i certainly ought to know something about him he began  he was the very first person my mother warned me to watch for because she said he was especially fond of young rabbits and was the slyest smartest and most to be feared of all my enemies since then i have found out that she knew just what she was talking about  johnny chuck danny meadow mouse and whitefoot the wood mouse nodded as if they quite agreed  then peter continued reddy lives chiefly by hunting and in his turn he is hunted so he needs to have sharp wits  when he isnt hunting me he is hunting danny meadow mouse or whitefoot or striped chipmunk or mrs grouse or bob white or is trying to steal one of farmer browns chickens or is catching frogs along the edge of the smiling pool or grasshoppers out in the green meadows  so far as i can make out anything reddy can catch furnishes him with food  i guess he doesnt eat anything but such things as these  your guess is wrong peter spoke up reddy fox who had been listening with a grin on his crafty face  i am rather fond of certain kinds of fruits  you didnt know that did you peter  no i didnt replied peter  im glad to know it  i think it is dreadful to live entirely by killing others  you might add remarked reddy that i like a meal of fish occasionally and eggs are always welcome  i am not particular what i eat so long as i can get my stomach full  reddy fox hunts with ears eyes and nose continued peter  many a time ive watched him listening for the squeak of danny meadow mouse or watching for the grass to move and show where danny was hiding and many a time he has found my scent with his wonderful nose and followed me just as bowser the hound follows him  i guess there isnt much going on that reddys eyes ears and nose dont tell him  but it is reddys quick wits that the rest of us fear most  we never know what new trick he will try  lots of enemies are easy to fool but reddy isnt one of them  sometimes i think he knows more about me than i know about myself  i guess it is just pure luck that he hasnt caught me with some of those smart tricks of his  reddy hunts both day and night but i think he prefers night  i guess it all depends on how hungry he is  more than once ive seen him bringing home a chicken but i am told that he is smart enough not to steal chickens near his home but always to go some distance to get them  also ive been told that he is too clever to go to the same chicken yard two nights in succession  so far as i know he isnt afraid of any one except a hunter with a terrible gun  he doesnt seem to mind being chased by bowser the hound at all  i dont spoke up reddy  i rather enjoy it  it gives me good exercise  any time i cant fool bowser by breaking my trail so he cant find it again i deserve to be caught  i am not even so terribly afraid of a hunter with a gun  you see usually i can guess what a hunter will do better than he can what i will do  old mother nature nodded  that sounds like boasting said she but it isnt  reddy fox is one of the few animals who has succeeded in holding his own against man and he has done it simply by using his wits  there is no other animal as large as reddy fox who has succeeded as he has in living close to the homes of men it is simply because he has made the most of the senses i have given him  he has learned to use his eyes ears and nose at all times and to understand and make the most of the information they bring him reddy has always been hunted by man and it is this very thing which has so sharpened his wits  it is seldom that he is guilty of making the same mistake twice  all of you little people fear reddy and i suspect some of you hate him  but always remember that he never kills for the love of killing and only when he must have food there would be something sadly missing in the green forest and on the green meadows were there no reddy fox  reddy where do you and mrs reddy make your home  and how do you raise your babies  this year our home is up in the old pasture replied reddy  we have the nicest kind of a house dug in the ground underneath a big rock  it has only one entrance but this is because there is no need of any other  no one could possibly dig us out there  last year our home was on the green meadows and there were three doorways to that  the year before we dug our house in a gravelly bank just within the edge of the green forest  the babies are born in a comfortable bedroom deep underground  sometimes we have a storeroom in addition to the bedroom there mrs reddy and i can keep food when there is more than can be eaten at one meal  when the babies are first born in the spring and mrs reddy cannot leave them i take food to her  when the youngsters are big enough to use their sharp little teeth we take turns hunting food for them  usually we hunt separately but sometimes we hunt together  you know often two can do what one cannot  if bowser the hound happens to find the trail of mrs reddy when there are babies at home she leads him far away from our home  then i join her and take her place so that she can slip away and go back to the babies  bowser never knows the difference  our children are well trained if i do say it  we teach them how to hunt how to fool their enemies and all the tricks we have learned no one has a better training than a young fox  here is a conundrum for you little folks said old mother nature when is a red fox not a red fox  everybody blinked  most of them looked as if they thought old mother nature must be joking but suddenly chatterer the red squirrel whose wits are naturally quick remembered how old mother nature had told them that there were black gray squirrels  when he is some other color cried chatterer  thats the answer said old mother nature  once in a while a pair of red foxes will have a baby who hasnt a red hair on him he will be all black with perhaps just the tip of his tail white or his fur will be all black just tipped with white  then he is called a black fox or silver fox  he is still a red fox yet there is nothing red about him  sometimes the fur is only partly marked with black and then he is called a cross fox  a great many people have supposed that the black or silver fox and the cross fox were distinct kinds  they are not  they are simply red foxes with different coats  the fur of the silver fox is considered by man to be one of the choicest of all furs and tremendous prices are paid for it  this means of course that a young fox whose coat is black will need to be very smart indeed if he would live to old age for once he has been seen by man he will be hunted unceasingly  reddy fox had been listening intently and now mother nature noticed a worried look on his face  what is it reddy said she  you look anxious  i am anxious said he  what you have just said has worried me you see one of my cubs at home is all black  now that i have learned that his fur is so valuable mrs reddy and i will have to take special pains to teach him all we know  i want you all to know that reddy fox and mrs reddy mate for life said old mother nature  reddy is the best of fathers and the best of mates  theres one thing i do envy reddy spoke up peter rabbit and that is that big tail of his  it is a wonderful tail  i wish i had one like it  how everybody laughed as they tried to picture peter rabbit with a big tail like that of reddy fox  i am afraid you wouldnt get far if you had to carry that around said old mother nature  even reddy finds it rather a burden in wet weather when it becomes heavy with water  that is one reason you do not find him abroad much when it is raining or in winter when the snow is soft and wet  reddy fox is at home all over the northern half of this country and everywhere he is the same sly clever fellow whom you all know so well  in the south and some parts of the east and west reddy has a cousin of about his own size whose coat is gray with red on the sides of his neck ears and across his breast  the under part of his body is reddish his throat and the middle of his breast are white  he is called the gray fox  he prefers the green forest to the open country for he is not nearly as smart as his cousin reddy he is if anything a better runner but his wits are slower and he cannot so well hold his own against man  instead of making his home in a hole in the ground he usually chooses a hollow treetrunk or hollow log  the babies are born in a nest of leaves in the bottom of a hollow tree  in some parts of the west this fox is called the tree fox because often he climbs up in low trees  the gray fox of the south is not the only cousin of reddys continued old mother nature  in certain parts of the great west on the plains lives one of the smallest of reddys cousins called the kit fox or swift  he is no larger than black pussy farmer browns cat and gets his name of swift from his great speed in running  he is a prairie animal and lives in burrows in the ground as most prairie animals do  his back is of a grayish color while his sides are yellowish red  beneath he is white the upper side of his tail is yellowishgray below it is yellowish and the tip is black  in general appearance he is more like the gray fox than reddy  he lacks the quick wit of reddy fox and is easily trapped  in the hot dry regions of the southwest where the kangaroo rats and pocket mice live is another cousin closely related to the kit fox  this is called the desert fox  like most of the little people who live on the desert he is seldom seen by day  he is very swift of foot  he digs a burrow with several entrances and his food consists largely of pocket mice kangaroo rats ground squirrels and such other small animals as are found in that part of the country  like his cousin the kit fox he is not especially quickwitted  neither the kit fox nor the desert fox are considered very valuable for their coats and so are not hunted and trapped as much as are reddy fox and his two cousins of the great north the arctic fox and the blue fox  the arctic or white fox lives in the far north in the land of snow and ice  he is a little fellow bigger than the kit fox but only about two thirds the size of reddy fox and very beautiful way up in the far north his entire coat is snowy white the year round  the fur is long very thick and soft  his tail is very large and handsome  when he lives a little farther south he changes his coat in the summer to one of a bluishbrown  but just as soon as winter approaches he resumes his white coat  the young are born in a burrow in the ground if the parents happen to be living far enough south for the ground to be free of snow in the far north their home is a burrow in a snow bank and there the babies are born  the white coats of the arctic foxes who live in a world of white are of great help to them when hunting or when trying to escape from enemies  it is difficult to see them against their white surroundings  in summer their food consists very largely of ducks and other wild fowl which nest in great numbers in the far north  in the winter they hunt for lemmings arctic hares and a cousin of mrs grouse called the ptarmigan who lives up there  they pick the bones left by polar bears and wolves  getting a living in winter is not easy and so the arctic fox is a great traveler  the blue fox is really only a colored white fox just as the black fox is a black red fox and his habits are of course just the same as the habits of the white fox  there are some islands in the far north called the pribilof islands and on them live many blue foxes  both the white and the blue foxes are much hunted for their coats which are considered very valuable by man  certainly they are very beautiful  while these cousins of reddys are clever hunters they do not begin to be as quickwitted as reddy and so are much more easily trapped  now i think this will do for reddy fox and his relatives  reddy is going to stay right here with me until the rest of you have had a chance to get home  after that you will have to watch out for yourselves as usual  just remember that reddy has become the quickwitted person he is because he has been so much hunted  if you are as smart as reddy you will understand that the more he hunts you the quickerwitted you also will become  tomorrow we will take up reddys big cousins the wolves    chapter xxviii  old man coyote and howler the wolf  of course you all know to what branch of the dog family old man coyote belongs said old mother nature and looked expectantly at the circle of little folks gathered around her  no one answered well well well exclaimed old mother nature i am surprised i am very much surprised  i supposed that all of you knew that old man coyote is a member of the wolf branch of the family  do you mean that he is really a true wolf asked striped chipmunk timidly  of course replied old mother nature  he is all wolf and nothing but wolf  he is the prairie wolf so called because he is a lover of the great open plains and not of the deep forests like his big cousin howler the timber wolf  reddy fox is smart but sometimes i believe old man coyote is smarter  you have got to get up very early indeed to get ahead of old man coyote  old man coyote varies in size from not so very much bigger than reddy fox to almost the size of his big cousin howler the timber wolf  also he varies in color from a general brownishgray to a yellowishbrown being whitish underneath  his face is rather longer than that of reddy fox  he has a brushy tail but it is not as thick as reddys  in his habits old man coyote is much like reddy but being larger and stronger he is able to kill larger animals and has won the hate of man by killing young pigs lambs newly born calves and poultry because of this he has been and is continually hunted and trapped but like reddy fox the more he is hunted the smarter he becomes and he is quite capable of taking care of himself  he is one of the swiftest of all runners  many people think him cowardly because he is always ready to run away at the least hint of danger  he isnt cowardly however he is simply smarttoo smart to run any unnecessary risk  old man coyote believes absolutely in safety first a very wise rule for everybody  the result is that he is seldom led into the mistake of simply thinking a thing is all right  he makes sure that it is all right  because of this he is very hard to trap  no matter how hungry he may be he will turn his back on a baited trap even when the trap is so cunningly hidden that he cannot see it  old man coyote is a good father and husband and a good provider for his family  he and mrs coyote have a large family every year sometimes as many as ten babies  their home is in the ground and is very similar to that of reddy fox  they eat almost everything eatable including such animals and birds as they can catch frogs toads snakes and insects dead bodies they may find and even some fruits  mr and mrs coyote often hunt together  sometimes when the children are fullgrown they all hunt together  when they do this they can pull down lightfoot the deer  old man coyote has one of the strangest voices to be heard anywhere and he delights to use it especially at night  it is like many voices shouting together and one who hears it for the first time cannot believe that all that sound comes from one throat  his big cousin howler the gray wolf sometimes called timber wolf is found now only in the forests of the north and the mountains of the great west  once he roamed over the greater part of this great country  howler is as keenwitted as and perhaps keenerwitted than reddy fox or old man coyote and added to this he has great strength and courage  he is one of the most feared of all the people of the green forest  in summer when food is plentiful howler and mrs wolf devote themselves to the bringing up of their family and are careful not to be overbold  but when winter comes howler and his friends get together and hunt in packs  with their wonderful noses they can follow lightfoot the deer and run him down they kill sheep and young cattle  the harder the winter the bolder they become and they have been known to attack man himself  in the far north they grow especially large and because of the scarcity of food there in winter they become exceedingly fierce  they can go an astonishingly long time without food and still retain their strength but hunger makes them merciless  they  will not attack each other but if one in the pack becomes injured the others will turn upon him and kill and eat him at once  howler and mrs wolf mate for life and each is at all times loyal to the other  they are the best of parents and the little wolves are carefully trained in all that a wolf should know  always the hand of man has been against them and this fact has developed their wits and cunning to a wonderful degree  man in his effort to destroy them has used poison cleverly hiding it in pieces of meat left where howler and his friends could find them  howler soon found out that there was something wrong with pieces of meat left about and now it is seldom that any of his family come to harm in that way  he is equally cunning in discovering traps even traps buried in one of his trails  sometimes he will dig them up and spring them without being caught  when wolves hunt in packs they have a leader usually the strongest or the smartest among them and this leader they obey  in all the great forests there is no more dreadful sound than the howling of a pack of wolves  there is something in it that strikes terror to the hearts of all who hear it  the color of howlers coat usually is brownishgray and that is why he is called the gray wolf but sometimes it is almost black and in the far north it becomes snowy white  howler is very closely related to the dogs which men keep as pets  they are really first cousins  few dogs dare meet howler in battle  my exclaimed peter rabbit i am glad howler doesnt live around here  you well may be said old mother nature  he would make just about one bite of you peter  peter shivered  are old man coyote and howler friends asked peter  i wouldnt call them exactly friends replied old mother nature old man coyote takes pains to keep out of howlers way but he is clever enough to know that when howler has made a good kill there may be some left after howler has filled his own stomach  so when howler is hunting in old man coyotes neighbor hood the latter keeps an eye and ear open to what is going on  in the longago days when thunderfoot the bison was lord of the prairies howlers family lived on the prairies as well as in the forests but now howler sticks pretty closely to the forests and mountains leaving the prairies and brushy plains to old man coyote  all branches of the dog family do one thing they walk on their toes  they never put the whole foot down flat as does buster bear and as you have already discovered all branches of the dog family are very smart  they are intelligent  hello there is black pussy the cat from farmer browns coming down the lone little path  i suspect it will be well for some of you smallest ones to get out of sight before she arrives  she doesnt belong over here in the green forest but she has a cousin who does yowler the bob cat shall i tell you about yowler and his cousins tomorrow  wed love to have you cried happy jack speaking for all then as black pussy was drawing near they separated and went their several ways    chapter xxix  yowler and his cousin tufty  jumper the hare arrived at school a little late and quite out of breath from hurrying  his big soft eyes were shining with excitement  you look as though you had had an adventure jumper said old mother nature  i have replied jumper it is a wonder i am here at all i came to near furnishing yowler the bob cat a breakfast that it makes me shiver just to think of it  i guess if i hadnt been thinking about him he would have caught me  tell us all about it demanded old mother nature  seeing black pussy over here yesterday and knowing that todays lesson was to be about yowler i couldnt get cats out of my mind all day yesterday began jumper  black pussy doesnt worry me but i must confess that if there is any one i fear it is yowler the bob cat  just thinking about him make me nervous  the more i tried not to think about him the more i did think about him and the more i thought about him the more nervous i got  then just before dark on the bank of the laughing brook i found some tracks in the mud  those tracks were almost round and that fact was enough to tell me who had made them  they were yowlers footprints and they hadnt been made very long  of course seeing those footprints made me more nervous than ever and every time i saw a leaf move i jumped inside  my heart felt as if it were up in my throat most of the time  i had a feeling that yowler wasnt far away  i hate that cat  i hate the way he hunts  he goes sneaking about without making a sound or else he lies in wait ready to spring without warning on the first one who happens along  a fellow never knows where to watch out for yowler  i spent nearly all night sitting under a little hemlock tree with branches very close to the ground  i sat there because i didnt dare do anything else  as long as i stayed there i felt reasonably safe because yowler would have to find me and to do that he would have to cross an open place where i could see him  i knew that if i went roaming about i might walk right into his clutches  it was lucky i had sense enough to stay there  you know the moon was very bright last night  it made that open place in front of where i was hiding almost as light as day  once i closed my eyes for just a minute  when i opened them there was yowler sneaking across that open place  where he had come from i dont know  he hadnt made a sound  not a leaf rustled under his big feet  right in the middle of that open place where the moonlight was brightest he stopped to listen and i simply held my breath  tell us how he looked prompted old mother nature  he looked just like what he isa big cat with a short tail replied jumper  just to look at him any one would know he was own cousin to black pussy  he had a round head rather long legs and was about twice as big as black pussy  his feet looked big even for him  on the tips of his ears were a few long black hairs his coat was yellowish to reddishbrown with dark spots on it his chin and throat were white and underneath he was white spotted with black  there were spots all down his legs  he didnt have enough of a tail to call it a tail  it was whitish on the under side and had black stripes on the upper side and all the time he kept twitching it just the way black pussy twitches her tail when she is out hunting  all of a sudden he opened his mouth and gave such a yell that it is a wonder i didnt jump out of my skin  it frightened me so that i couldnt have moved if i had wanted to which was a lucky thing for me  the instant he yelled he cocked his head on one side and listened  that yell must have wakened somebody and caused them to move for yowler turned suddenly and crept swiftly and without a sound out of sight  a minute later i heard a jump and then i heard a fluttering  i think he caught one of the grouse family  yelling that way is one of yowlers tricks explained old mother nature  he does it for the same reason hooty the owl hoots  he hopes that it will startle some sleeper so that they will move if they do his keen ears are sure to hear it  was that all of your adventure jumper  no replied jumper  i remained right where i was for the rest of the night  just as daylight was beginning to steal through the green forest i decided that it was safe to leave my hiding place and come over here  halfway here i stopped for a few minutes in a thick clump of ferns  i was just about to start on again when i caught sight of something moving just back of an old stump  it was that foolish looking tail of yowlers  had he kept it still i wouldnt have seen him at all but he was twitching it back and forth  he was crouched down close to the ground with all four feet drawn close together under him  there he crouched and there i sat for the longest time  i didnt move and he didnt move save that foolish looking tail of his  i had begun to think that i would have to stay in that clump of ferns all day when suddenly yowler sprang like a flash  there was a little squeak and then i saw yowler trot away with a mouse in his mouth  i guess he must have seen that mouse go in a hole and knew that if he waited long enough it would come out again  as soon as yowler disappeared i hurried over here  thats all  that was a splendid account of yowler and his way of hunting said old mother nature  he does most of his hunting in just that way sneaking about on the chance of surprising a rabbit bird or mouse or else patiently watching and waiting beside a hole in which he knows some one has taken refuge  he hunts in the green forest exactly as black pussy farmer browns cat hunts mice in the barn or birds in the old orchard  in the spring yowler destroys many eggs and young birds not only those found in nests on the ground but also those in nests in trees for he is a splendid climber  yowler is found in nearly all of the swampy brushy and wooded parts of the whole country excepting in the great forests of the far north where his cousin tufty the lynx lives  yowler is himself a lynx the bay lynx  in some places he is called simply wild cat  in others he is called the catamount  he is not so fond of the thick forests as he is of swamps brushgrown hillsides old pastures and places where there are great masses of briars rocky ledges where there are caves in which to hide and plenty of brush also suit him  he is a coward but when cornered will fight though he will run from a little dog half his size and take to a tree  in the south he is quite common and there often steals chickens and turkeys even young pigs  he prefers to hunt at night but sometimes is seen in broad daylight  mrs yowlers kittens are born in a cave or in a hollow tree  despite the fact that he is an expert climber yowler spends most of his time on the ground and is one of the worst enemies of rabbits mice squirrels and ground birds  in the great forests of the far north lives yowlers cousin tufty the canada lynx also called loup cervier and lucivee  he is nearly a third larger than yowler  from the tip of each ear long tufts of black hair stand up  on each side of his face is a ruff of long hair  his tail is even shorter than yowlers and the tip of it is always wholly black  his general color is gray mottled with brown his face ruff is white with black border  yowlers feet are large but tuftys are immense for his size  this is because tufty lives where the snow lies deep for many months and these big broad feet enable him to travel about on the snow without breaking through  he can travel with ease where reddy fox not half his size and weight would break through at every step  tuftys ways are much like those of his cousin yowler save that he is a dweller in the deep woods anything he can catch is food for tufty but his principal food is the northern hare  the color of his coat blends with the shadows so that he seems like a living shadow himself  in summer food is plentiful and tufty lives well but in winder tufty has hard work to get enough rarely does he know what a full stomach means then  like howler he can go a surprising length of time without food and still retain his strength  at that time of year he is a great traveler  he has to be in order to live  there is no fiercer looking animal in all the green forest than tufty the lynx but despite this he is like most cats cowardly only when cornered will he fight  he is possessed of a lively curiosity and often he will stealthily follow a hunter or trapper for miles  the fur of his coat is very long and handsome and he is hunted and trapped for this  as he lives for the most part far from the homes of men he does less damage to man than does his cousin yowler the bob cat  tufty must depend wholly for his living on the little people of the green forest  sometimes he will attack a fox  the pretty little spotted babies of lightfoot the deer are victims whenever he can find them  the darker and deeper the green forest the better tufty likes it  he makes his den under great tangles of fallen trees or similar places  mr and mrs tufty often hunt together and in early winter the whole family often join in the hunt  yowler and tufty are the only members of the cat family now found in the eastern part of the country  formerly their big cousin puma the panther lived in the east but he has been so hunted by man that now he is found only in the mountains of the far west and in a few of the wildest places in the south  i will tell you about him tomorrow    chapter xxx  some big and little cat cousins  puma the panther began old mother nature is the largest member of the cat family in this country with the exception of one which is found only in the extreme southwest  puma is also called mountain lion cougar and painter  you all know how black pussy looks  if black pussy could grow to be over eight feet long and be given a yellowishbrown coat whitish underneath she would look very much like puma the panther  unlike yowler the bob cat and tufty the lynx puma has a long tailjust such a round tail as black pussy has being so large puma is of great strength and he has all the grace and quickness in movement of a true cat  as i told you yesterday there was a time when puma lived in the east  in fact he was once in nearly all parts of this great country where there were forests but as the country became settled by man puma was driven out and now his home is chiefly in the great mountains of the far west  being so big he must have much food  instead of depending for his living on small animals and birds puma hunts the large animals  he is so big and so strong that he can kill lightfoot the deer without trouble and there is no one lightfoot dreads more than puma  he is especially fond of horse flesh and in certain sections where herds of horses are pastured he has killed so many young horses that he has won the undying hate of man  big as he is he is a coward and will run from a barking dog when desperate with hunger he has been known to attack man but such occasions have been very very rare  the fact is he fears man and will slink sway at his approach  like the true cat that he is he is wonderfully softfooted and despite his great size moves silently  he makes his home among the ledges high up in the mountains  at night he goes forth to hunt  once in a while he is seen hunting in daytime but not often  sometimes he may be seen basking in the sun high up on the ledges  he is a good climber like most cats  he never shows himself boldly but slinks about through the forest and among the rocks the picture of stealth this habit has won for him another namethat of sneak cat sometimes he sneaks up on his prey to within jumping distance again he lies in wait beside a path which certain animals are in the habit of using  he is capable of leaping a long distance and when he strikes his prey his great weight added to the force of his spring is almost certain to knock it down even though it be much bigger than puma himself  men hunt him with dogs for as i have already told you he will run from a barking dog  usually he doesnt run far before taking to a tree  the hunters follow and shoot him there  were it not that he can be hunted in this way with dogs he would have little to fear from man for he is so keen of sight and hearing and can move so swiftly and silently that it is rarely man can surprise him sometimes he will follow a man just as tufty the lynx does but usually for the same reasoncuriosity  despite the fact that he is a sneak and coward he is so big and fiercelooking that he is feared by most men  only those who really know him do not fear him  there is one other member of the cat family in all this great land larger than puma and this is jaguar also called el tigre  he is found only in a small part of the extreme southwest for he really belongs in the hot country to the south of this  not only is he the largest but he is the handsomest of all the cat family  his coat is a beautiful deep yellow covered with spots and rosettes of black  beneath he is white with large black spots  he also has a fairly long tail  he is thick and heavy and is not as long as puma but is stouter and heavier  he can kill horses mules and cattle with ease but of course the principal part of his food consists of the wild animals about him  he is so savage in appearance that the mere sight of him always awakens fear  his method of hunting is much the same as that of the other members of the cat family  most of his hunting is done at night  while puma the panther sometimes screams jaguar roars and it is a very terrifying sound  all the little people and most of the big ones within hearing shiver when they hear it  jaguars head is large and he is tremendously strong in the jaws  occasionally jaguar is all black instead of being yellow and spotted  in this same part of the great southwest lives a smaller cousin named ocelot often called tiger cat  ocelot is only a little bigger than black pussy whom you all know and in shape is very like her  he also has a lovely coat  it is yellow not a deep rich yellow like jaguars but a light yellow thickly covered with black spots  on his cheeks and the back of his neck are black lines and his tail is ringed with black  he likes best country where the brush is very thick and thorny for there he can hunt in safety with little fear of being hunted by man  because of his smaller size he lives chiefly on small animals birds and reptiles  he sometimes kills and eats big snakes  when he happens to live near man he robs the hen roosts just as yowler does  in all his ways he is like the other members of the cat family  a neighbor of his in that same country is the queerest looking member of the cat family  he is called the jaguarundi cat or eyra  sometimes he is dressed in dull gray and sometimes in rusty red  his body is shaped more like that of little joe otter than of any one else and he has short legs and a long tail  he is a little larger than little joe and his head is rather small and somewhat flattened not so round as the heads of most of the other members of the cat family  he likes to be in the vicinity of water and is a good swimmer  not very much is known by man about his habits but he is a true cat and the habits of all cats are much the same    chapter xxxi  bobby coon arrives  old mother nature was just about to open school when a slight noise up the lone little path drew all eyes in that direction  there shuffling down the lone little path was a queer looking fellow no one needed more than one look at that funny sharp black and white face of his to recognize him  bobby coon shouted peter rabbit  are you coming to join our school bobby  bobby shuffled along a little nearer then sat up and blinked at them sleepily  no one needed to be told that bobby had been out all night  he rubbed his eyes and yawned  hello everybody said he  i wish i felt as bright and lively as all of you look id like to join your school but im afraid if i did i would go to sleep right in the middle of the lesson  i ought to have been home an hour ago  so i guess ill have to be excused  old mother nature pointed an accusing finger at bobby coon bobby said she youve been getting in mischief  now own up youve been stealing some of that sweet milky corn from farmer browns cornfield  bobby coon hung his head  iii dont think it was stealing he mumbled  that corn just grows and i dont see why i shouldnt have my share of it  i help myself to other things so why shouldnt i help myself to that  ill tell you why replied old mother nature  farmer brown planted that corn and took care of it  if he hadnt planted it there wouldnt have been any corn there  that makes it his corn if it grew wild you would have a perfect right to it  as it is you havent any right to it at all  now take my advice bobby and keep away from that cornfield  if you dont you will get in trouble one of these fine nights bowser the hound will find you there and you will have to run for your life  keep away from temptation  but that corn is so good sighed bobby coon smacking his lips there is nothing i like better than sweet milky corn and if i dont get it from farmer browns cornfield i cant get it at all for it doesnt grow wild  hell never miss the little i take  old mother nature shook her head and looked very grave  bobby said she that is no excuse at all  mark what i say if you keep on you certainly will get in trouble  if you would be satisfied to take just an ear or two i dont believe farmer brown would care but you know very well that you spoil many times what you eat  you sample one ear then think that probably the next ear will be better and sweeter and you try that  by the time you get through you have spoiled a lot and eaten only a little  i think ill punish you a little myself by keeping you here a while  if you think you cant keep awake just go over and sit down there by prickly porky hell keep you awake  ii think i can keep awake stammered bobby and opened his eyes very wide as if he were trying to stretch his eyelids so as to make them stay open  ill help you by asking you a few questions replied old mother nature  who is it that people sometimes call you the little cousin of  bobby grinned buster bear said he  thats right replied old mother nature  of course being a raccoon you are not a bear but you are related to the bear family  i want you all to notice bobbys footprints over yonder  you will see that the print of his hind foot shows the whole foot heels and toes and is a lot like buster bears footprint on a small scale  bobby shuffles along in much the same way that buster walks  no one ever mistakes bobby coon for any one else  there is no danger that any one ever will as long as he carries that big bushy tail with its broad black and gray rings there is only one other in all this great country with a tail so marked and that is a relative of bobbys of whom i will tell you later  and there is no other face like bobbys with its black cheeks  you will notice that bobby is rather small around the shoulders but is big and heavy around the hips  that gives him a clumsy look but he is anything but clumsy  despite the fact that his legs are not very long bobby is a very good runner however he doesnt do any running unless he has to  bobby where were you before you went over to farmer browns cornfield  once more bobby hung his head  it was quite clear that bobby didnt want to answer that question  but old mother nature insisted and finally bobby blurted it out  i was up to farmer browns hen house said he  what for asked old mother nature  oh just to look around replied bobby  to look around for what insisted old mother nature  well said bobby i thought one of those hens up there might have dropped an egg that she didnt really care about  bobby said old mother nature sternly why dont you own up that you went over there to try to steal eggs  or did you think you might catch a tender young chicken  where were you night before last  over at the laughing brook and the smiling pool replied bobby promptly evidently glad the subject had been changed  well you didnt find sweet corn or eggs or chickens over there did you said old mother nature  no but i caught three of the sweetest tasting little fish in a little pool in the laughing brook and i got some of the tenderest clams ive ever eaten replied bobby smacking his lips  i raked them out of the mud and opened them  down at the smiling pool i had a lot of fun catching young frogs  i certainly do like frogs it is great sport to catch them and they are fine eating  i suppose you have had an eye on the beech trees and the wild grapevines said old mother nature slyly  bobbys face brightened  indeed i have said he  there will be splendid crops of beechnuts and grapes this fall  my but they will taste good  old mother nature laughed  there is small danger that you will go hungry said she  when you cant find enough to eat times must be very hard indeed  for the benefit of the others you might add that in addition to the things mentioned you eat other fruits including berries insects of various kinds birds when you can catch them mice turtles in fact almost anything that can be eaten  you are not at all fussy about the kind of food  but you have one habit in regard to your food which it would be well if some of these other little folks followed  do you know what it is  bobby shook his head  no said he not unless you mean the habit i have of washing my food  if there is any water near i always like to take what i am going to eat over to it and wash it somehow it tastes better  just so replied old mother nature  more than once ive seen you in the moonlight beside the laughing brook washing your food and it has always pleased me for there is nothing like cleanliness and neatness  did you raise a family this year bobby  mrs coon did  we had four of the finest youngsters you have ever seen over in a certain big hollow tree  they are getting big and lively now and go out with their mother every night  i do hope the hunters will leave them alone this fall  i hate to think of anything happening to them  if they can just get through the hunting season safely ill enjoy my winter sleep better and i know mrs coon will  at this johnny chuck pricked up his ears  do you sleep all winter bobby he asked eagerly  not all winter but a good part of it replied bobby  i dont turn in until the weather gets pretty cold and it is hard to find anything to eat  but after the first snow im usually ready to sleep  then i curl up in a warm bed of leaves in a certain big hollow tree and dont care how cold or stormy the weather is sometimes i wake up once or twice when the weather is mild and take a little walk around for exercise  but i dont go far and soon return to sleep  what do you do when bowser the hound gets after you asked peter rabbit  run till i get out of breath replied bobby  and if by that time i havent been able to fool him so that he loses my trail i take to a tree  thank goodness he cant climb a tree  sometimes i climb from the top of one tree into the top of another and sometimes into a third and then a fourth when they are near enough together that fools the hunters if they follow bowser  have you any relatives bobby asked old mother nature  i didnt know i had until you mentioned that fellow with the ringed tail you said you would tell us about  i didnt know there was anybody with a tail like mine and i would like to know about it replied bobby  he isnt exactly a raccoon but he is more nearly related to you than any one else replied old mother nature  his tail shows that  aside from this he is nothing like you at all  he is called the ringtailed cat  but he doesnt look any more like a cat than he does like you and he isnt related to the cat family at all  he has several names  he is called the bassaris the civet cat ringtailed cat coon cat and cacomixtle  instead of being thick and clumsylooking as is bobby here he is long and rather slender with a yellowishbrown coat somewhat grayish on the back and whitish underneath  his head is rather small long and beautifully shaped  his ears are of good size and very pretty in some ways he looks like reddy fox  but the really beautiful thing about him is his tail  it is nearly as long as his body thick and beautifully marked with black and white bands  he is quick and graceful in his movements and like bobby prefers to be abroad at night  also like bobby he eats about everything that he can findflesh reptiles fruit nuts and insects  he lives in the far southwest and also in some of the mountains of the far west  why he should be called civet cat is more than i can guess for he is neither a civet nor a cat  he is very clever at catching mice and sometimes he is kept as a pet just as farmer brown keeps black pussy to catch the mice about the homes of men  now bobby you can trot along home and i hope all that green corn you have eaten will not give you the stomach ache  tomorrow we will see what we can find out about buster bear    chapter xxxii  buster bear nearly breaks up school  has buster bear a tail asked old mother nature and her eyes twinkled  no declared whitefoot the wood mouse promptly  yes contradicted chatterer the red squirrel  what do you say prickly porky old mother nature asked  i dont think he has any if he has ive never seen it said prickly porky  thats because youve got poor eyes spoke up jumper the hare he certainly has a tail  it isnt much of a one but it is a tail  i know because ive seen it many times  woof woof said a deep rumbly grumbly voice  whats going on here  who is it hasnt any tail  at the sound of that deep rumbly grumbly voice it looked for a few minutes as if school would be broken up for that day  there was the same mad scrambling to get away that there had been the morning reddy fox unexpectedly appeared  however there was this difference when reddy appeared most of the little people sought safe hiding places but now they merely ran to safe distances and there turned to stare with awe and great respect at the owner of that deep rumbly grumbly voice  it was great big buster bear himself  buster stood up on his hind legs like a man and his small eyes for they are small for his size twinkled with fun as he looked around that awe filled circle  dont let me interrupt said he  i heard about this school and i thought i would just pay a friendly visit  there is nothing for you to fear  i have just had my breakfast and i couldnt eat another mouthful to save me not even such a tender morsel as whitefoot the wood mouse  whitefoot hurriedly ran a little farther away and buster bear chuckled  then he looked over at old mother nature  wont you tell them that im the bestnatured and most harmless fellow in all the great world he asked  old mother nature smiled  that depends on the condition of your stomach said she  if it is as full as you say it is and i know you wouldnt tell me an untruth not even timid whitefoot has anything to fear from you  then she told all the little people to put aside their fears and return  buster seeing that some of the more timid were still fearful backed off a short distance and sat down on his haunches  what was that about a tail i overheard as i came up he asked  it was a little discussion as to whether or not you have a tail replied old mother nature  some say you have and some say you havent  whitefoot thinks you havent  once more buster bear chuckled way down deep in his throat whitefoot never in his life looked at me long enough to know whether ive got a tail or not said he  i never yet have seen him until now when he wasnt running away as fast as his legs could take him  so with me always behind him how could he tell whether or not i have a tail  well have you demanded peter rabbit bluntly  what do you think asked buster  i think you have said peter  but if you have you are sitting down on it and i cant tell  it cant be much of a one anyhow  again buster chuckled  quite right peter quite right said he  ive got a tail but hardly enough of a one to really call it a tail  as buster sat there every one had a splendid chance to see just how he looked  his coat was all black in fact he was black all over with the exception of his nose which was brown  his fur was long and rather shaggy  his ears were round  his paws were big and armed with strong wicked looking claws  you all see what a black coat buster has said old mother nature now im going to tell you something which may surprise you  just as there are red foxes that are black so there are black bears that are brown  whats that grunted buster with the funniest look of surprise on his face  its a fact buster said old mother nature  a great many of your family live out in the mountains of the far west and there quite often there will be one who is all brown  people used to think that these brown bears were a different kind of bear and called them cinnamon bears  it was a long long time before it was found out that those brown bears are really black bears sometimes one of the twin babies will be all black and the other all brown  sometimes one of busters family will have a white spot on his breast  busters branch of the family is found in nearly all of the wooded parts of the entire country  in the sunny south they live in the swamps and do not grow as big as in the north  buster there is a soft spot on the ground i want you to walk across it so that these little folks can see your footprints  goodnaturedly buster dropped on all fours and walked across the soft spot  right away every one understood why old mother nature had asked buster to do this  the prints of his hind feet were very like the prints of farmer browns boy when barefooted only of course very much larger  you see they showed the print of the heel as well as the rest of the foot  you see said old mother nature buster puts his whole foot on the ground while all members of the dog and cat families walk wholly on their toes  animals that put the whole foot down are called plantigrade  how big do you think buster was when he was born  of course im only guessing said chatterer the red squirrel but he is such a big fellow that i think he must have been a bouncing big baby  old mother nature smiled  i dont wonder you think so said she the fact is however buster was a very tiny and very helpless little chap  he was just about the size of one of prickly porkys babies  he was no bigger than a rat  he was born in the middle of winter and didnt get his eyes open for forty days  it was two months before he poked his head outside the den in which he was born to find out what the great world was like  at that time he wasnt much bigger than peter rabbit and he and his twin sister were as lively a pair of youngsters and as full of mischief as any bears the green forest has ever seen  you might tell us buster what you live on  busters eyes snapped i live on anything i can eat and i can eat most everything  i suppose a lot of people think i live almost wholly on the little people who are my neighbors but that is a mistake  i do catch mice when i am lucky enough to find them where i can dig them out and they certainly are good eating  at this whitefoot the wood mouse and danny meadow mouse hastily scurried farther away and busters eyes twinkled with mischief of course i dont mind a rabbit either if i am lucky enough to catch one said he and peter rabbit quickly backed off a few steps  in fact i like meat of any kind continued buster  but the greater part of my food isnt meat at all  in the spring i dig up roots of different kinds and eat tender grass shoots and some bark and twigs from young trees  when the insects appear they help out wonderfully  i am very fond of ants  i pull over all the old logs and tear to pieces all the old stumps i can find and lick up the ants and their eggs that i am almost sure to find there  almost any kind of insect tastes good to me if there are enough of them  i love to find and dig open the nests of wasps that make their homes in the ground and of course i suppose you all know that there is nothing in the world i like better than honey  if i can find a bee nest i am utterly happy  for the sake of the honey i am perfectly willing to stand all the stinging the bees can give me  i like fish and i love to hunt frogs  when the berry season begins i just feast  in the fall i get fat on beechnuts and acorns  the fact is there isnt much i dont like  ive been told you sleep all winter said johnny chuck  that depends on the winter replied buster bear  i dont go to sleep until i have to  i dont have to as long as i can find enough to eat  if the winter begins early with bad weather i make a comfortable bed of leaves in a cave or under a big pile of fallen trees or even in a hollow log if i can find one big enough  then i go to sleep for the rest of the winter  but if the winter is mild and open and there is a chance of finding anything to eat i sleep only in the really bad weather  do you try to get fat before going to sleep the way i do asked johnny chuck  buster grinned  yes johnny i try said he and usually i succeed  you see i need to be fat in order to keep warm and also to have something to live on in the spring just the same as you do  ive been told that you can climb but as i dont live in the green forest i have never seen you climb  i should think it would be slow work for such a big fellow as you to climb a tree said johnny chuck  buster looked up at happy jack squirrel and winked  then he walked over to the tree in which happy jack was sitting stood up and suddenly began to scramble up the tree  there was nothing slow about the way buster bear went up that tree  happy jack squealed with sudden fright and started for the top of that tree as only happy jack can climb  then he made a flying jump to the next tree halfway up buster stopped  then he began to come down  he came down tail first  when he was within ten feet of the ground he simply let go and dropped  i did that just to show you how i get out of a tree when i am really in a hurry explained buster  i dont climb trees much now unless it is for honey but when i was a little fellow i used to love to climb trees  suddenly buster sat up very straight and pointed his nose up in the wind  an anxious look crept into his face  he cocked his ears as if listening with all his might  that is just what he was doing presently he dropped down to all fours  excuse me said he i think i had better be going  farmer brown is coming down the lone little path  buster turned and disappeared at a speed that was simply astonishing in such a clumsylooking fellow  old mother nature laughed busters eyes are not very good said she but there is nothing the matter with his nose or with his ears  if buster says that farmer brown is coming down the lone little path there is no doubt that he is although he may be some distance away yet  buster has been smart enough to learn that he has every reason to fear man and he promptly takes himself out of the way at the first hint that man is near  it is a funny thing but most men are as afraid of buster as buster is of them and they havent the least need of being afraid at all  where man is concerned there isnt one of you little people more timid than buster bear  the faintest smell of man will make him run  if he should be wounded or cornered he would fight  mrs bear would fight to protect her babies but these are the only conditions under which a black bear will face a man you think buster is big and he is but buster has relatives very much bigger than he  he has one beside whom he would look actually small  ill tell you a little about these cousins of buster    chapter xxxiii  buster bears big cousins  buster bear had been right about the coming of farmer brown  it was only a few minutes after busters disappearance that farmer browns footsteps were heard coming down the lone little path and of course that ended school for that morning  but the next morning all were on hand again at sunup for every one wanted to hear about buster bears big cousins  way out in the mountains of the far west where whistler the marmot and little chief the pika live is a big cousin of buster bear began old mother nature  he is silvertip the grizzly bear and in the past no animal in all this great country was so feared by man as he  but times have changed and silvertip has been so hunted with terrible guns that he has learned to fear man quite as much as buster does  he is larger than buster and possessed of tremendous strength instead of a black coat he has a coat which varies from yellowish brown to almost black  the tips of the hairs usually are lighter giving him a frosted appearance and this is what has given him his name  his claws are longer and more curved than those of buster in fact those claws are so big that they look very terrible because they are so long silvertip cannot climb trees  but if they prevent him climbing trees they are the finest kind of tools for digging out marmots and ground squirrels  even when whistler the marmot makes his home down in among the rocks he is not safe silvertips strength is so great that he can pull over and roll aside great rocks  he is a great traveler and covers a wide range of country in his search for food  sometimes he visits the cattle ranges and kills cattle  so great is his strength that he can kill a cow with ease clumsy looking as he is he is a very fast runner and only a fast horse can outrun him  like buster he lives on anything he can find that is eatable  he has been so hunted by man that he has become very cunning and in all the great mountains where he lives there is no one with quicker wits  at certain seasons of the year great numbers of a fish called salmon come up the rivers in that country and then silvertip lives high  he watches beside a pool until a salmon swims within reach then with a swift movement of one paw he scoops the fish on to the bank  or he finds a place where the water is so shallow that the fish have difficulty in getting across and there he seizes them as they struggle up the river  in winter he sleeps just as buster does usually in a wellhidden cave  mrs silvertip is a splendid mother  usually the cubs of which as a rule there are two remain with her until they are a year old both buster bear and silvertip have a queer habit of standing up against a tree and biting it as high up as they can reach  the next bear who comes along that way sees the mark and makes his own on the same tree  silvertip knows every inch of that part of the country in which he lives and always picks out the best way of getting from one place to another  he is one of the finest animals in this country and it is a matter for sadness that his splendid race will soon come to an end unless man makes laws to protect him from the hunters  in very many places where he used to be found he lives no longer  silvertip is not so goodnatured as buster but all he asks is to be left alone  of course when he turns cattle killer he is getting into the worst possible kind of mischief and man cannot be blamed for hunting him  but it is only now and then that one of silvertips family turns cattle killer  the others do no harm  i told you yesterday that buster bear has one cousin beside whom he would look small  this is bigfoot the alaska or great brown bear who lives in the extreme northwest part of the continent even silvertip would look small beside him  he is a giant the largest flesheating animal in all the great world  his coat is dark brown  when he stands up on his hind legs he is almost half again as tall as a tall man  he stands very high at the shoulders and his head is very large  like the other members of the bear family he eats all sorts of things  he hunts for mice and other small animals digs up roots stuffs himself with berries and at times grazes on a kind of wild grass just as cattle might do  he is a great fish eater for fish are very plentiful in the streams in the country where he lives  big as he is he has learned to fear man just as silvertip has  occasionally when surprised he has been known to attack man and kill him but as a rule he will run at the first hint of mans approach  the last of the bear cousins is snow king the polar bear  snow king is king of the frozen north  he lives in the region of snow and ice and his coat is all white  he also is a big bear and of somewhat different shape from his cousins  he is longer and has a much longer neck and a long head  his ears are rather small and close to his head  snow king lives the year round where it would seem that no animal could live and he manages to live well though his home is in the coldest part of the great world he does not mind the cold at all  more than any other member of the bear family snow king is a flesh eater  this is because only in certain places and then only for a few weeks in midsummer is there any plant life  he is a great fisherman and fish furnish him a great deal of his food  in that far northern country are great numbers of animals who live in the ocean but come ashore to rest and bask in the sun and to have their babies there  they are seals sea lions and walruses  i will tell you about them later  on these snow king depends for much of his food  he is himself a wonderful swimmer and often swims far out in the icy water  up there there are great fields of floating ice and snow king swims from one to another in search of seals for they often climb out on these ice fields just as they do on shore sometimes mrs bear takes her cubs for long swims  when they become tired one will climb on her back and the other will seize her tail so she will carry one and tow the other  snow kings babies are born in a house of snow  early in the winter mrs bear finds a sheltered place where the snow will drift over her  there she goes to sleep and the snow drifts and drifts over her until she is buried deep  you might think she would be cold but she isnt for the snow keeps her warm  her breath melts a little hole up through the snow so that she always has air there the babies are born and there they remain just as buster bears remain in their home until they are big enough to follow their mother about  then she breaks her way out in the spring and leads her cubs forth to teach them how to take care of themselves snow king himself does not sleep through the winter but roams about just as in the summer  snow king is fearless and has not yet learned to dread man as have his cousins  he will not hesitate to attack man and is terrible to meet at close quarters  because he lives in that far cold country he is not hunted as much as other bears are  besides the seals and fish he sometimes catches an arctic hare  in the summer great numbers of ducks and other sea birds nest in that far northern country and their eggs and young add to snow kings bill of fare  his white coat is so in keeping with his surroundings that it is of the greatest aid to him in his hunting  it is a very beautiful coat and makes him the most beautiful of all the bear family  now this is all about the bears and also it is all about the order of flesh eaters or carnivora  i think that next we will see what we can find out about a certain little friend of yours who though he eats flesh is not a member of the flesheating order at all but belongs to an order of which he is the only member in this country i will leave you to guess who it is    chapter xxxiv  unc billy and old mrs possum  all the way home from school peter rabbit did his best to think who it could be who ate flesh yet wasnt a member of the order of flesh eaters  every few hops he would stop to think but all his stopping and all his thinking were in vain and when he started for school the next morning he was as puzzled as ever  on his way through the green forest he passed a certain tree  he was just past and no more when a familiar voice hailed him  morning brer rabbit said the voice  whats yo hurry  peter stopped abruptly and looked up in that tree  there peering down at him from a hole high up in the trunk was a sharp whitishgray face with a pair of twinkling black eyes  hello unc billy cried peter  how are you and ol mrs possum  poly peter poly  weuns havent had breakfast yet so weuns are feeling poly replied unc billy with a grin  a sudden thought popped into peters head  unc billy cried peter excitedly are you a carnivora  unc poked his head a little farther out and put his hand behind his ear as if he were a little hard of hearing  whats that brer rabbit  am i a what he demanded  are you a carnivora repeated peter  ah reckons ah might be if ah knew what it was but as long as ah dont ah reckons i aint retorted unc billy  ah reckons ahm just plain possum  when ah wants to be real uppity ah puts on an o  then ah am mister opossum  but peter wasnt listening  the fact is peter had started lippertylippertylip for school without even being polite enough to say goodby  he arrived at school quite out of breath  i know he panted  i know  what do you know asked old mother nature  i know who it is who eats flesh yet doesnt belong to the order of flesh eaters  its unc billy possum cried peter  right you are replied old mother nature  however did you find it out  i didnt exactly find it out i guessed it replied peter  on my way here i saw unc billy and it popped into my head right away that he was one we havent heard about and must be the one but if he eats flesh i dont see why he isnt a member of the order of flesh eaters  it is because he belongs to a group which has something which makes them entirely different from all other animals and for this reason they have been given an order of their own explained old mother nature  they belong to the order of marsupials which means pouched animals  it is because the mothers have big pockets in which they carry their babies  old mrs possum has just such a pocket  of course exclaimed peter  ive seen those babies poking their heads out of that pocket  they look too funny for anything  the opossums are the only marsupials in this country continued old mother nature  now have i made it quite clear why although they eat flesh unc billy and ol mrs possum are not members of the same big order as buster bear and the other flesh eaters  everybody nodded  just then chatterer the red squirrel shouted here comes unc billy ol mrs possum and all the little possums  sure enough down the lone little path came the possum family and a funny looking sight they were  unc billy was whitishgray his face whiter than the rest of him  he looked as if he had just gotten out of bed and forgotten to brush his hair it pointed every which way  his legs were dark his feet black and his toes white his ears were without any hair at all and were black for the lower half the rest being white  he had a long whitish tail without any hair on it  altogether with his sharp face and naked tail he looked a great deal as though he might be a giant rat  but if unc billy was a funnylooking fellow ol mrs possum was even more funnylooking  she seemed to have heads and tails all over her  you see she had brought along her family and ol mrs possum is one of those who believe in large families  there were twelve youngsters and they were exactly like their parents only small  they were clinging all over ol mrs possum  some were on her back some were clinging to her sides and a couple were in the big pocket where they had spent their babyhood  weall done thought wed come to school explained unc billy with a grin  im glad you did replied old mother nature  you see the rest of your friends here are a little curious about the possum family  meanwhile ol mrs possum was climbing a tree and when she had reached a comfortable crotch the little possums left her and began to play about in the tree  it was then that it appeared what handy things those naked little tails were  when the little possums crawled out where the branches were small they simply wrapped their tails around the twigs to keep from falling  my exclaimed peter  those certainly are handy tails  handiest tails ever was declared unc billy  dont know what ah ever would do without mah tail  suppose you climb a tree unc billy and show your friends here how you manage to get the eggs from a nest that you cannot reach by crawling along the branch on which it is placed said old mother nature  unc billy grinned and goodnaturedly started up a tree  he crept out on a branch that overhung another branch  way out where the branch was small crept unc billy  then he wrapped the end of his tail around the branch and swung himself off keeping hold of the branch only with his tail and one hind foot then stretching down full length he could just reach the branch below him you see he explained if there was a nest on this branch down here ah could get those eggs without any trouble  ah wish there was a nest  just speaking of eggs makes mah mouth water  again unc billy grinned and then pulled himself back to the other branch  old mother nature shook her head reprovingly  unc billy said she you are a bad old rascal to steal eggs  whats more it doesnt matter to you much whether you find eggs or young birds in a nest  it is a wonder that between you and chatterer the red squirrel any of the birds succeed in raising families around here  have you visited farmer browns hen house lately  unc billy shook his head  not lately said he ah done got a dreadful scare the last time ah was up there and ah reckons ahll stay away from there for a while  what else do you eat asked old mother nature  anything replied unc billy  ah reckons ah aint no ways particularinsects roots frogs toads small snakes lizards berries fruits nuts young rats and mice corn any old meat that has been left lying around  ah reckon ah could find a meal most any time most anywhere  do you always have as big a family as you have there asked peter rabbit  not always replied unc billy  but sometimes mrs possum has to tote around a still bigger family we believe in chillun and lots of them we reckon on havin two or three big families every year  where is your home asked johnny chuck  i know said peter rabbit  its up in a big hollow tree  unc billy looked down at peter  tisnt at all necessary to tell anybody where that hollow tree is brer rabbit said he  are possums found anywhere except around here inquired happy jack  yes indeed replied old mother nature  they are found all down through the sunny south and in the warmer parts of the middle west unc billy and his relatives are not fond of cold weather  they prefer to be where they can be reasonably warm all the year round  some folks think unc billy isnt smart but those folks dont know unc billy  he learned a long time ago that he cant run as fast as some others so he has learned to depend on his wits in time of danger  what do you think he does  i know cried peter i saw him do it once  farmer browns boy surprised unc billy and unc billy just fell right over dead  pooh  thats a story peter rabbit  how could unc billy have fallen over dead and be alive up in that tree this very minute cried happy jack  i didnt mean he was really dead but that he looked as if he were dead explained peter  and he did too  he was the deadest looking thing i ever saw  i thought he was dead myself  i was watching from a bramble tangle where i was hiding and i certainly thought the life had been scared right out of unc billy  i guess farmer browns boy thought so too  he picked unc billy up by the tail and looked him all over and said you poor little thing i didnt mean to hurt you  unc billy didnt so much as wink an eye farmer browns boy went off up the path carrying unc billy by the tail  by and by he laid unc billy down on an old stump while he went to look at a nest of blacky the crow  when he came back unc billy wasnt there  i never did see unc billy hurry as he did the minute farmer browns boys back was turned  he came to life as suddenly as he had dropped dead  very good peter said old mother nature  some other smart little people try that trick sometimes but none of them can do it as well as unc billy possum  pretending to be dead in order to remain alive is the cleverest thing unc billy does  now how about lightfoot the deer for the next lesson  splendid cried all together and prepared to start for their homes    chapter xxxv  lightfoot blacktail and forkhorn  of all the people who live in the green forest none is more admired than lightfoot the deer  so perhaps you can guess how delighted every one was when just as the morning lesson was to begin lightfoot himself stepped daintily out from a thicket and bowed to old mother nature  i heard said he that my little friends here are to learn something about my family this morning and thought you would not mind if i joined them  i should say not exclaimed peter rabbit forgetting that lightfoot had spoken to old mother nature  all laughed even old mother nature  you see peter was so very much in earnest and at the same time so excited that it really was funny  peter has spoken for all of us said old mother nature  you are more than welcome lightfoot  i had intended to send for you but it slipped my mind  i am delighted to have you here and i know that the others are  i suspect you will be most comfortable if you lie down but before you do this i want everybody to have a good look at you  just stand for a few minutes in that little open space where all can see you  lightfoot walked over to the open space where the sun fell full on him and there he stood a picture of grace and beauty with just enough honest pride in his appearance to give him an air of noble dignity  there was more than one little gasp of admiration among his little neighbors  there began old mother nature is one of the most beautiful of all my children and the knowledge that he is beautiful does not spoil him  lightfoot belongs to the deer family as you all know and this in turn is in the order called ungulata which means hoofed  peter rabbit abruptly sat up and his ears stood up like exclamation points  farmer browns cows have those funny feet called hoofs are they related to lightfoot he asked eagerly  they belong to another family but it is in the same order  so they are distant cousins of lightfoot replied old mother nature  and farmer browns pigs what about them asked chatterer the red squirrel  they also belong to that order and so are related explained old mother nature  huh exclaimed chatterer  if i were in lightfoots place i never never would acknowledge any such homely stupid creatures as those as relatives of mine  dont forget that prickly porky the porcupine and robber the rat are members of the same order to which you belong retorted old mother nature softly and chatterer hung his head  lightfoot she continued is the whitetailed or virginia deer and is in some ways the most beautiful of the deer family  you have only to look at him to know that those slim legs of his are meant for speed he can go very fast but not for long distances without stopping like peter rabbit he is a jumper rather than a true runner and travels with low bounds with occasional high ones when alarmed he can make very long and high jumps and this is one reason he prefers to live in the green forest where there are fallen trees and tangles of old logs  if frightened he can leap over them whereas his enemies must crawl under or climb over or go around them  ordinary fences such as farmer brown has built around his fields do not bother lightfoot in the least  he can leap over them as easily as peter rabbit can jump over that little log he is sitting beside  just now because it is summer lightfoots coat is decidedly reddish in color and very handsome  but in winter it is wholly different  i know spoke up chatterer the red squirrel  it is gray then ive often seen lightfoot in winter and there isnt a red hair on him at that season  quite right agreed old mother nature  his red coat is for summer only  notice that lightfoot has a black nose  that is the tip of it is black  beneath his chin is a black spot  a band across his nose the inside of each ear and a circle around each eye is whitish  his throat is white and he is white beneath  now peter you are so interested in tails tell me without looking what color lightfoots tail is  white snowy white replied peter promptly  i suppose that is why he is called the whitetailed deer  huh grunted johnny chuck who happened to be sitting a little back of lightfoot i dont call it white  it has a white edge but mostly it is the color of his coat  now while lightfoot had been standing there his tail had hung down and it was as johnny chuck had said  but at johnnys remark up flew lightfoots tail showing only the under side  it was like a pointed white flag  with it held aloft that way no one behind lightfoot would suspect that his whole tail was not white  notice how long and fluffy the hair on that tail is said old mother nature  mrs lightfoots is just like it and this makes it very easy for her babies to follow her in the dark  when lightfoot is feeding or simply walking about he carries it down but when he is frightened and bounds away up goes that white flag  now look at his horns  they are not true horns  the latter are hollow while these are not  farmer browns cows have horns  lightfoot has antlers  just remember that  the socalled horns of all the deer family are antlers and are not hollow notice how lightfoots curve forward with the branches or tines on the back side  of course everybody looked at lightfoots crown as he held his head proudly  what is the matter with them asked whitefoot the wood mouse  they look to me as if they are covered with fur  i always supposed them to be hard like bone  so they will be a month from now explained old mother nature smiling down at whitefoot  that which you call fur will come off he will rub it off against the trees until his antlers are polished and there is not a trace of it left  you see lightfoot has just grown that set this summer  do you mean those antlers asked danny meadow mouse looking very much puzzled  didnt he have any before  how could things like those grow anyway  dont you know that he loses his horns i mean antlers every year demanded jumper the hare  i thought every one knew that his old ones fell off late last winter  i know for i saw him just afterward and he looked sort of ashamed  anyway he didnt carry his head as proudly as he does now  he looked a lot like mrs lightfoot you know she hasnt any antlers  but how could hard bony things like those grow persisted danny meadow mouse  i think i will have to explain said old mother nature  they were not hard and bony when they were growing  just as soon as lightfoots old antlers dropped off the new ones started  they sprouted out of his head just as plants sprout out of the ground and they were soft and very tender and filled with blood just as all parts of your body are  at first they were just two round knobs  then these pushed out and grew and grew  little knobs sprang out from them and grew to make the branches you see now all the time they were protected by a furry skin which looks a great deal like what men call velvet  when lightfoots antlers are covered with this they are said to be in the velvet state  when they had reached their full size they began to shrink and harden so that now they are quite hard and very soon that velvet will begin to come off  when they were growing they were so tender that lightfoot didnt move about any more than was necessary and kept quite by himself  he was afraid of injuring those antlers by the time cool weather comes lightfoot will be quite ready to use those sharp points on anybody who gets in his way  as jumper has said mrs lightfoot has no antlers  otherwise she looks much like lightfoot save that she is not quite as big  have any of you ever seen her babies  i have declared jumper who as you know lives in the green forest just as lightfoot does  they are the dearest little things and look like their mother only they have the loveliest spotted coats  that is to help them to remain unseen by their enemies explained old mother nature  when they lie down where the sun breaks through the trees and spots the ground with light they seem so much like their surroundings that unless they move they are not often seen even by the sharpest eyes that may pass close by  they lie with their little necks and heads stretched flat on the ground and do not move so much as a hair  you see they usually are very obedient and the first thing their mother teaches them is to keep perfectly still when she leaves them  when they are a few months old and able to care for themselves a little the spots disappear  as a rule mrs lightfoot has two babies each spring  once in a while she has three but two is the rule  she is a good mother and always on the watch for possible danger  while they are very small she keeps them hidden in the deepest thickets  by the way do you know that lightfoot and mrs lightfoot are fine swimmers  happy jack squirrel looked the surprise he felt  i dont see how under the sun any one with little hoofed feet like lightfoots can swim said he  nevertheless lightfoot is a good swimmer and fond of the water replied old mother nature  that is one way he has of escaping his enemies  when he is hard pressed by wolves or dogs he makes for the nearest water and plunges in  he does not hesitate to swim across a river or even a small lake  lightfoot prefers the green forest where there are close thickets with here and there open places  he likes the edge of the green forest where he can come out in the open fields yet be within a short distance of the protecting trees and bushes  he requires much water and so is usually found not far from a brook pond or river  he has a favorite drinking place and goes to drink early in the morning and just at dusk  during the day he usually sleeps hidden away in a thicket or under a windfall coming out late in the afternoon  he feeds mostly in the early evening  he eats grass and other plants beechnuts and acorns leaves and twigs of certain trees lily pads in summer and i am sorry to say delights to get into farmer browns garden where almost every green thing tempts him  like so many others he has a hard time in winter particularly when the snows are deep  then he and mrs lightfoot and their children live in what is called a yard  of course it isnt really a yard such as farmer brown has  it is simply a place where they keep the snow trodden down in paths which cross and cross and is made where there is shelter and food  the food is chiefly twigs and leaves of evergreen trees  as the snow gets deeper and deeper they become prisoners in the yard until spring comes to melt the snow and set them free  lightfoot depends for safety more on his nose and ears than on his eyes  his sense of smell is wonderful and when he is moving about he usually goes up wind that is in the direction from which the wind is blowing  this is so that it will bring to him the scent of any enemy that may be ahead of him  he is very clever and cunning  often before lying down to rest he goes back a short distance to a point where he can watch his trail so that if any one is following it he will have warning  his greatest enemy is the hunter with his terrible gun  how any one can look into those great soft eyes of lightfoot and then even think of trying to kill him is more than i can understand  dogs are his next worst enemies when he lives near the homes of men when he lives where wolves panthers and bears are found he has to be always on the watch for them  tufty the lynx is ever on the watch for lightfoots babies  the whitetailed deer is the most widely distributed of all the deer family  he is found from the sunny south to the great forests of the northeverywhere but in the vast open plains of the middle of this great country  that is he used to be  in  many places he has been so hunted by man that he has disappeared  when he lives in the sunny south he never grows to be as big as when he lives in the north  in the great mountains of the far west lives a cousin blacktail also called columbian blacktailed deer and another cousin forkhorn the mule deer  blacktail is nearly the size of lightfoot  he is not quite so graceful his ears are larger being much like those of forkhorn the mule deer to whom he is closely related and his tail is wholly black on the upper surface  it is from this he gets his name  his antlers vary sometimes being much like those of lightfoot and again like those of forkhorn  he is a lover of dense forests and is not widely distributed  he is not nearly so smart as lightfoot in outwitting hunters  forkhorn the mule deer sometimes called jumping deer is larger than lightfoot and much more heavily built  his big ears much like those of a mule have won for him the name of mule deer  his face is a dull white with a black patch on the forehead and a black band under the chin  his tail is rather short and is not broad at the base like lightfoots  it is white with a black tip  because of this he is often called blacktailed deer but this is wrong because that name belongs to his cousin the true blacktail  forkhorns antlers are his glory  they are even finer than lightfoots  the prongs or tines are in pairs like the letter y instead of in a row as are those of lightfoot and usually there are two pairs on each antler  forkhorn prefers rough country and there he is very much at home his powers of jumping enabling him to travel with ease where his enemies find it difficult to follow like blacktail he is not nearly so clever as lightfoot the whitetail and so is more easily killed by hunters  all these members of the deer family belong to the roundhorn branch and are very much smaller than the members of the flathorn branch  but there is one who in size makes all the others look small indeed  it is bugler the elk or wapiti of whom i shall tell you tomorrow    chapter xxxvi  bugler flathorns and wanderhoof  lightfoot the deer was the first one on hand the next morning  in fact he arrived before sunup and lying down in a little thicket close at hand made himself very comfortable to wait for the opening of school  you see not for anything would he have missed that lesson about his big cousins  there the others found him when they arrived  the deer family began old mother nature is divided into two branchesthe roundhorned and the flathorned  i have told you about the roundhorned deer with the exception of the largest and noblest bugler the elk  he is commonly called elk but his right name is wapiti  bugler is found only in the great mountains of the far west but once before hunters with terrible guns came elk were found in nearly all parts of this country excepting the far south and the far northeven on the great plains  now bugler lives only in the forests of the great mountains  how big is he asked lightfoot  so big that beside him you would look very small replied old mother nature  have you ever seen farmer browns horse  lightfoot nodded  well bugler stands as high as that horse replied old mother nature  he isnt as heavy for his body is of different shape not so big around but at that he weighs three times as much as you do  in summer his coat is a light yellowish brown becoming very dark on his neck and underneath  his legs are dark brown  the hair on his neck is long and coarse  his tail is very small and around it is a large patch so light in color as to be almost whitish  in winter his coat becomes dark gray  buglers crowning glory are his antlers  they are very large and widespreading sweeping backward and upward the long prongs or tines curving upward from the front instead of from the back as in the case of lightfoots antlers  above each eye is a long sharp prong  so big are these antlers that bugler looks almost as if he were carrying a small bare tree on his head  big as these antlers are they are grown in a few months for bugler is like his small cousins in that he loses his antlers at the end of every winter and must grow a new pair  while they are growing he hides in the wildest places he can find high up on the mountains  mrs bugler is at that time down in a valley with her baby or babies  usually she has one but sometimes twins she has no antlers  in the fall when his antlers have hardened bugler moves down to join his family  the bigger and stronger he is the bigger his family is for he has a number of wives and they all live together in a herd or band of which bugler is lord and master  he is ready and eager to fight for them and terrible battles take place when another disputes his leadership  at this season he has a habit of stretching his neck out and emitting a farreaching trumpetlike sound from which he gets the name of bugler  it is a warning that he is ready to fight  when the snows of winter come many families get together and form great bands  then they move down from the mountains in search of shelter and food  when a winter is very bad many starve to death for man has fenced in and made into farms much of the land where the elk once found ample food for winter  but big as is bugler the elk there is a cousin who is bigger the biggest of all the deer family  it is flathorns the moose  as you must guess by his name he is a member of the flathorned branch of the family  his antlers spread widely and are flattened instead of being round  from the edges of the flattened part many sharp points spring out  flathorns wearing his crown of great spreading antlers is a noble appearing animal because of his great size but when his antlers have dropped he is a homely fellow  mrs flathorns who has no antlers is very homely  as i have said flathorns is the biggest member of the deer family  he is quite as big as farmer browns horse and stands much higher at the shoulders  indeed his shoulders are so high that he has a decided hump there for they are well above the line of his back  his neck is very short large and thick and his head is not at all like the heads of other members of the deer family  instead of the narrow pointed face of other members of the deer family he has a broad long face rather more like that of a horse  towards the nose it humps up and the great thick upper lip overhangs the lower one  his nose is very broad and for his size his eyes are small  his ears are large  from his throat hangs a hairy fold of skin called a bell  he has a very short tail so short that it is hardly noticeable  his legs are very long and rather large  his hoofs are large and rounded more like those of bossy the cow than like those of lightfoot the deer  seen at a little distance in the woods he looks to be almost black but really is for the most part dark brown  his legs are gray on the inside  flathorns lives in the great northern forests clear across the country and is especially fond of swampy places  he is fond of the water and is a good swimmer  in summer he delights to feed on the pads stems and roots of water lilies and his long legs enable him to wade out to get them  for the most part his food consists of leaves and tender twigs of young trees such as striped maple aspen birch hemlock alder and willow  his great height enables him to reach the upper branches of young trees  when they are too tall for this he straddles them and bends or breaks them down to get at the upper branches  his front teeth are big broad and sharpedged  with these he strips the bark from the larger branches  he also eats grass and moss  because of his long legs and short neck he finds it easiest to kneel when feeding on the ground  big as he is he can steal through thick growth without making a sound  he does not jump like other deer but travels at an awkward trot which takes him over the ground very fast  in the winter when snow is deep the moose family lives in a yard such as i told you lightfoot makes  the greatest enemy of flathorns is the hunter and from being much hunted flathorns has learned to make the most of his ears eyes and nose  he is very smart and not easily surprised when wounded he will sometimes attack man and occasionally when not wounded  then he strikes with his sharpedged front hoofs and they are terrible weapons  altogether he is a wonderful animal and it is a matter for sorrow that man persists in hunting him merely to get his wonderful head  in parts of these same northern forests lives another big member of the deer family wanderhoof the woodland caribou  he is bigger than lightfoot the deer but smaller than bugler the elk rather an awkwardlooking fellow  his legs are quite long but stout  his neck is rather short and instead of carrying his head proudly as does lightfoot he carries it stretched out before him or hanging low  the hair on the lower part of his neck is long  wanderhoof wears a coat of brown  his neck being much lighter or almost gray  he has an undercoat which is very thick and woolly in winter his whole coat becomes grayish and his neck white  above each hoof is a band of white  his tail is very short and white on the under side  his antlers are wonderful being very long and both round and flat  that is parts of them are round and parts flattened  they have more prongs than those of any other deer  his hoofs are very large deeply slit and cupshaped  when he walks they make a snapping or clicking sound  these big feet were given him for a purpose  he is very fond of boggy ground and because of these big feet and the fact that the hoofs spread when he steps he can walk safely where others would sink in  this is equally true in snow when they serve as snowshoes  as a result he is not forced to live in yards as are lightfoot and flathorns when the snow is deep but goes where he pleases  he is very fond of the water and delights to splash about in it and is a splendid swimmer  his hair floats him so that when swimming he is higher out of water than any other member of the family  in winter he lives in the thickest parts of the forest among the hemlocks and spruces and feeds on the mosses and lichens which grow on the trees  in summer he moves to the open boggy ground around shallow lakes where moss covers the ground and on this he lives  he is a great wanderer hence his name wanderhoof  mrs caribou has antlers wherein she differs from mrs lightfoot mrs flathorns and mrs bugler  wanderhoof is fond of company and usually is found with many companions of his own kind  when they are moving from their summer home to their winter home or back again they often travel in very large bands  in the far north beyond the great forests wanderhoof has a cousin who looks very much like him called the barren ground caribou the name comes from the fact that way up there little excepting moss grows and on this the caribou lives  in summer this caribou is found almost up to the arctic ocean moving southward in great herds as the cold weather approaches  no other animals of today get together in such great numbers  in the extreme north is another caribou called pearys caribou whose coat is wholly white  the caribou are close cousins of the reindeer and look much like them  all male members of the smaller deer are called bucks the female members are called does and the young are called fawns  all male members of the big deer such as bugler the elk flathorns the moose and wanderhoof the caribou are called bulls  the females are called cows and the young are called calves  all members of the deer family with the exception of the barren ground caribou are forestloving animals and are seldom seen far from the sheltering woods  this i think will do for the deer family  tomorrow i shall tell you about thunderfoot the bison fleetfoot the antelope and longcoat the musk ox    chapter xxxvii  thunderfoot fleetfoot and longcoat  who remembers the name of the order to which all members of the deer family belong asked old mother nature  i remember what it means but not the name spoke up happy jack squirrel  it means hoofed  it is ununungu began peter rabbit and then stopped  for the life of him he couldnt think of the rest  ungulata old mother nature finished for him  and happy jack has the meaning right  it is the order to which all hoofed animals belong  there are several families in the order one of which you already have learned aboutthe deer family  now comes the family of cattle and sheep  it is called the bovidae family and the biggest and most important member is thunderfoot the bison commonly called buffalo  thunderfoot is more closely related to bossy farmer browns cow than are the members of the deer family for he has true horns not antlers  these are hollow and are not dropped each year but are carried through life  mrs thunderfoot has them also  the horns grow out from the sides of the forehead and then curve upward and inward and are smooth and sharp  they are never branched  thunderfoot is a great heavy fellow the size of farmer browns ox and has a great hump on his shoulders  he carries his head low and from his throat hangs a great beard  his head is large and is so covered with thick curly hair that it appears much larger than it really is  his tail is rather short and ends in a tassel of hair  the hair on his body and hind quarters is short and light brown but on his shoulders and neck and his fore legs to the knees it is long and shaggy dark brown above and almost black below  he must be a queer looking fellow spoke up chatterer the red squirrel  he is replied old mother nature  the front half of him looks so much bigger than the rear half that it almost seems as if they didnt belong together  what does he eat asked jumper the hare  grass replied old mother nature promptly  he grazes just as does bossy  when the weather becomes hot his thick coat although much of it has been shed becomes most uncomfortable  also he is tormented by flies  then he delights in rolling in mud until he is plastered with it from head to feet  many years ago there were more bison than any other large animal in this country and they were found in nearly all parts of it some lived in the woods and were called wood buffaloes but the greatest number lived on the great plains and prairies where the grass was plentiful  i have told you about the great herd of barren ground caribou but this is nothing to the great herds of bison that used to move north or south according to the season across the great prairies  in the fall they moved south  in the spring they moved north following the new grass as it appeared when they galloped the noise of their feet was like thunder  but the hunters with terrible guns came and killed them for their skins killed them by hundreds of thousands and in just a few years those great herds became only a memory  thunderfoot once lord of the prairies was driven out of all his great kingdom and the bison from being the most numerous of all large animals is today reduced to just a few hundreds and most of these are kept in parks by man barely in time did man make laws to protect thunderfoot  without this protection he would not exist today  a close neighbor of thunderfoots in the days when he was lord of the prairies was fleetfoot the antelope  fleetfoot is about the size of a small deer and in his graceful appearance reminds one of lightfoot for he has the same trim body and long slim legs he is built for speed and looks it  from just a glance at him you would know him for a runner just as surely as a look at jumper the hare would tell you that he must travel in great bounds  the truth is fleetfoot is the fastest runner among all my children in this country  not one can keep up with him in a race  fleetfoots coat is a light yellowishbrown on the back and white underneath  his forehead is brown and the sides of his face white his throat and under side of his neck are white crossed by two bands of brown  his hoofs horns and eyes are black and there is a black spot under each ear  near the end of his nose he is also black and down the back of his neck is a black line of stiff longer hairs  a large white patch surrounds his short tail  who remembers what i told you about antelope jack the big jack hare of the southwest  i do cried peter rabbit and jumper the hare together  what was it jumper asked old mother nature  you said that he has a way of making the white of his sides seem to grow so that he seems almost all white and can signal his friends in this way replied jumper  quite right replied old mother nature  i am glad to find that you remember so well  fleetfoot does the same thing with this white patch around his tail  the hairs are quite long and he can make them spread out so that that white patch becomes much larger and when he is running it can be seen flashing in the sun long after he is so far away that nothing else of him can be seen  his eyes are wonderfully keen so by means of these white patches he and his friends can signal each other when they are far apart  fleetfoot has true horns but they are unlike any other horns in that they are shed every year just like the antlers of the deer family  they grow straight up just over the eyes are rather short and fork  one branch is much shorter than the other and the longer one is turned over at the end like a hook  from these horns he gets the name of pronghorn  when running from danger he carries his head low and makes long leaps  when not frightened he trots and holds his head high and proudly  he prefers flat open country and there is no more beautiful sight on all the great plains of the west than a band of fleetfoot and his friends  he is social and likes the company of his own kind  the time was when these beautiful creatures were almost as numerous as the bison but like the latter they have been killed until now there is real danger that unless man protects them better than he is doing there will come a day when the last antelope will be killed and one of the most beautiful and interesting of all my children will be but a memory  there was a note of great sadness in old mother natures voice for a few minutes no one spoke  all were thinking of the terrible thing that had happened at the hands of man to the great hosts of two of the finest animals in all this great land the bison and antelope and there was bitterness in the heart of each one for there was not one there who did not himself have cause to fear man  old mother nature was the first to break the silence  now said she i will tell you of the oddest member of the cattle and sheep family  it is longcoat the musk ox and he appears to belong wholly neither to the cattle nor the sheep branch of the family but to both  he connects the two branches in appearance reminding one somewhat of a small bison and at the same time having things about him very like a sheep  longcoat the musk ox lives in the farthest north the land of snow and ice  he has been found very near the arctic ocean and how he finds enough to eat in the long winter is a mystery to those who know that snowcovered land  he is a heavily built roundbodied animal with short stout legs shoulders so high that they form a hump a lowhung head and sheeplike face heavy horns which are flat and broad at the base and meet at the center of the forehead sweeping down on each side of the head and then turning up in sharp points  his tail is so short that it is hidden in the long hair which covers him  this hair is so long that it hangs down on each side so that often it touches the snow and hides his legs nearly down to his feet  in color it is very darkbrown almost black and on his sides is straight  but on his shoulders it is curly  in the middle of the back is a patch of shorter dullgray hair  underneath this coat of long hair is another coat of woolly fine lightbrown hair so close that neither cold nor rain can get through it  it is this warm coat that makes it possible for him to live in that terribly cold region  he is about twice as heavy as a big deer at times he gives off a musky odor and it is from this that he gets his name of musk ox  longcoat is seldom found alone but usually with a band of his friends  this is partly for protection from his worst enemies the wolves  when the latter appear longcoat and his friends form a circle with their heads out and it is only a desperately hungry wolf that will try to break through that line of sharppointed horns  in rough rocky country he is as surefooted as a sheep  in the short summer of that region he finds plenty to eat but in winter he has to paw away the snow to get at the moss and other plants buried beneath it  practically all other animals living so far north have white coats but longcoat retains his dark coat the year through  my how time flies  this is all for today  tomorrow i will tell you of two wonderful mountain climbers who go with ease where even man cannot follow    chapter xxxviii  two wonderful mountain climbers  peter you have been up in the old pasture many times so you must have seen the sheep there said old mother nature turning to peter rabbit  certainly of course replied peter  they seem to me rather stupid creatures  anyway they look stupid  then you know the leader of the flock the big ram with curling horns continued old mother nature  peter nodded and old mother nature went on  just imagine him with a smooth coat of grayishbrown instead of a white woolly one and immense curling horns many times larger than those he now has give him a large whitish or very lightyellowish patch around a very short tail  then you will have a very good idea of one of those mountain climbers i promised to tell you about one of the greatest mountain climbers in all the great worldbighorn the mountain sheep also called rocky mountain bighorn and rocky mountain sheep  bighorn is a true sheep and lives high up among the rocks of the highest mountains of the far west  like all members of the order to which he belongs his feet are hoofed but they are hoofs which never slip and he delights to bound along the edges of great cliffs and in making his way up or down them where it looks as if it would be impossible for even chatterer the red squirrel to find footing to say nothing of such a big fellow as bighorn  the mountains where he makes his home are so high that the tops of many of them are in the clouds and covered with snow even in summer above the line where trees can no longer grow bighorn spends his summers coming down to the lower hills only when the snow becomes so deep that he cannot paw down through it to get food  his eyesight is wonderful and from his high lookout he watches for enemies below and small chance have they of approaching him from that direction  when alarmed he bounds away gracefully as if there were great springs in his legs and his great curled horns are carried as easily as if they were nothing at all  down rock slopes so steep that a single misstep would mean a fall hundreds of feet he bounds as swiftly and easily as lightfoot the deer bounds through the woods leaping from one little jutting point of rock to another and landing securely as if he were on level ground he climbs with equal ease where man would have to crawl and cling with fingers and toes or give up altogether  mrs bighorn does not have the great curling horns  instead she is armed with short sharppointed horns like spikes  her young are born in the highest most inaccessible place she can find and there they have little to fear save one enemy king eagle  only such an enemy one with wings can reach them there  bighorn and mrs bighorn because of their size nothing to dread from these great birds but helpless little lambs are continually in danger of furnishing king eagle with the dinner he prizes  only when driven to the lower slopes and hills by storms and snow does bighorn have cause to fear fourfooted enemies  then puma the panther must be watched for and lower down howler the wolf  but bighorns greatest enemy and one he fears most is the same one so many others have sad cause to fearthe hunter with his terrible gun  the terrible gun can kill where man himself cannot climb and bighorn has been persistently hunted for his head and wonderful horns  some people believe that bighorn leaps from cliffs and alights on those great horns but this not true  whenever he leaps he alights on those sure feet of his not on his head  way up in the extreme northwest corner of this country in a place called alaska is a close cousin whose coat is all white and whose horns are yellow and more slender and wider spreading  he called the dall mountain sheep  farther south but not as far south as the home of bighorn is another cousin whose coat is so dark that he is sometimes called the black mountain sheep  his proper name is stones mountain sheep  in the mountains between these two is another cousin with a white head and dark body called fannins sheep  all these cousins are closely related and in their habits are much alike  of them all bighorn the rocky mountain sheep is the best known  i should think said peter rabbit that way up there on those high mountains bighorn would be very lonesome  old mother nature laughed  bighorn doesnt care for neighbors as you do peter said she  but even up in those high rocky retreats among the clouds he has a neighbor as surefooted as himself one who stays winter as well as summer on the mountain tops  it is billy the rocky mountain goat  billy is as awkwardlooking as he moves about as bighorn is graceful but he will go where even bighorn will hesitate to follow  his hoofs are small and especially planned for walking in safety on smooth rock and icecovered ledges  in weight he is about equal to lightfoot the deer but he doesnt look in the least like him  in the first place he has a hump on his shoulders much like the humps of thunderfoot the bison and longcoat the musk ox  of course this means that he carries his head low  his face is very long and from beneath his chin hangs a white beard  from his forehead two rather short slim black horns stand up with a little curve backward his coat is white and the hair is long and straight  under this long white coat he wears a thick coat of short woolly yellowishwhite fur which keeps him warm in the coldest weather  he seldom leaves his beloved mountaintops even in the worst weather of winter as bighorn sometimes does but finds shelter among the rocks  the result is that he has practically no enemies save man to fear  often he spends the summer where the snow remains all the year through and his white coat is a protection from the keenest eyes you see when not moving he looks in the distance for all the world like a patch of snow on the rocks  not having a handsome head or wonderful horns he has not been hunted by man quite so much as has bighorn and therefore is not so alert and wary  both he and bighorn are more easily approached from above than from below because they do not expect danger from above and so do not keep so sharp a watch in that direction  the young are sometimes taken by king eagle but otherwise billy goats family has little to fear from enemies always excepting the hunter with his terrible gun  i have now told you of the members of the cattle and sheep family what they look like and where they live and how  there is still one more member of the order ungulata and this one is in a way related to another member of farmer browns barnyard  i will leave you to guess which one  what is it peter  if you please in just what part of the far west are the mountains where billy goat lives replied peter  chiefly in the northern part replied old mother nature  in the northwest these mountains are very close to the ocean and billy does not appear to mind in the least the fogs that roll in and seems to enjoy the salt air  sometimes there he comes down almost to the shore  are there any more questions  there were none so school was dismissed for the day  peter didnt go straight home  instead he went up to the old pasture for another look at the old ram there and tried to picture to himself just what bighorn must look like  especially he looked at the hoofs of the old ram  it is queer muttered peter how feet like those can be so safe up on those slippery rocks old mother nature told us about  anyway it seems queer to me  but it must be so if she says it is  my my my what a lot of strange people there are in this world  and what a lot there is to learn    chapter xxxix  piggy and hardshell  all the way to school the next morning peter rabbit did his best to guess who it might be that they were to learn about that day  old mother nature said that he is related to some one who lives in farmer browns barnyard said peter to himself  now who can it be  but try as he would peter couldnt think of any one  he asked jumper the hare if he had guessed who it could be  jumper shook his head  i havent the least idea said he  you know i seldom leave the green forest and i never have been over to that barnyard in my life so of course i dont know who lives there  danny meadow mouse and whitefoot the wood mouse were no wiser nor was johnny chuck  but chatterer the red squirrel it was plain to see was quite sure he knew who it was  chatterer had been over to farmer browns so often to steal corn from the corn crib that he knew all about that barnyard and who lived there  but though peter and the others teased him to tell them he wouldnt  so when old mother nature asked who had guessed to whom she had referred chatterer was the only one to reply  i think you must have meant the pig who is always rooting about and grunting in that barnyard said he  your guess is right chatterer she replied smiling at the little redcoated rascal and this morning i will tell you a little about a relative of his who doesnt live in a barnyard but lives in the forest as free and independent as you are  it is piggy the peccary known as the collared peccary also called wild pig muskhog texas peccary and javelina  he is a true pig and in shape resembles that lazy fat fellow in farmer browns barnyard when he was little  you would know him for a pig right away if you should see him  but in every other way excepting his habit of rooting up the ground with his nose he is a wholly different fellow  for one thing his legs though short are more slender and he is a fast runner  there isnt a lazy bone in him and he is too active to grow fat  his head is large and his nose long and his tail is almost no tail at all it is just a little rounded knob as if he had at one time had a tail and it had been cut off  his hair is coarse and stiff the kind of hair called bristles  from the back of his head along his back the bristles are long and stout  they are black at the tips so that he appears to have a black back  when piggy is angry he raises these long bristles so that they stand straight up and this gives him a very fierce appearance  his color is so dark a gray that at a distance he appears black indeed he is black on many parts of him  just back of the neck a whitish band crosses the shoulders and this is why he is called the collared peccary  you see he seems to be wearing a collar on each jaw are two great pointed teeth called tusks the two upper ones so long that they project beyond the lips  these tusks are piggys weapons and very good ones they are  the home of piggy the peccary is in the hot southwestern part of this country where live jaguar and ocelot the beautiful spotted members of the cat family  they are two of his enemies  he never likes to be alone but lives with a band of his friends and they roam about together  he is found on the plains and among low hills in swamps and dense forests and among the thickets of cactus and other thorny plants that grow in dry regions  plenty of food and shelter from the hot sun seem to be the main things with piggy  what does he eat asked peter rabbit  old mother nature laughed  it would be easier peter to tell you what he doesnt eat said she  he eats everything eatable nuts fruits seeds roots and plants of various kinds insects frogs lizards snakes and any small animals he can catch  sometimes he does great damage to gardens and crops planted by man  he delights to root in the earth with his nose and often turns over much ground in this way searching for roots good to eat  on the lower part of his back he carries a little bag of musky scent and from this he gets the name of muskhog  while as a rule he wisely runs from danger he is no coward and will fight fiercely when cornered  his friends at once rush to help him and surround the enemy who is usually glad to climb a tree to escape their gnashing tusks  however he is not the fierce animal he has been reported to be ready to attack unprovoked  he will run away if he can  mr and mrs peccary have two babies at a time  this is the last of the hoofed animals and the last but one of the land animals of this great country so you see we are almost to the end of school  this last one is perhaps the queerest of all  it is hardshell the armadillo and belongs to the order of edentata which means toothless  do you men to say that there are animals with no teeth at all asked happy jack squirrel looking as if he couldnt believe such a thing  old mother nature nodded  that is just what i mean said she there are animals without any teeth though not in this country and others with so few teeth that they have been put in the same order with the wholly toothless ones  hardshell the armadillo is one of these  he has no teeth at all in the front of his mouth and such teeth as he has got do not amount to much  but why do you call him hardshell asked peter impatiently  because instead of a coat of fur he wears a coat of shell replied old mother nature and then laughed right out at the funny expressions on the faces before her  it was quite clear that peter and his friends were having hard work to believe she was in earnest  they suspected her of joking  dodo you mean that he lives in a sort of house that he carries with him like spotty the turtle ventured peter  it is a shell but not like that of spotty explained old mother nature spottys shell is all one piece but the armadillos shell is jointed so that he can roll up like a ball  spotty isnt a mammal as are all of you and all those we have been learning about but is a reptile  hardshell the armadillo on the other hand is a true mammal  well all i can say is that he must be a mighty queer looking fellow declared peter  he is replied old mother nature  he is about the size of unc billy possum and if you can imagine a pig of about that size with very short legs a long tapering tail feet with toes and long claws and a shell covering his whole body the front of his face and even his tail you will have something of an idea what he looks like  he lives down in the hot southwest where piggy the peccary lives his coat of shell is yellowish in color and is divided in the middle of his body into nine narrow bands or joints  because of this he is called the ninebanded armadillo  in the countries to the south of this he has a cousin with three bands and another with six  hardshells head is very long and he carries it pointed straight down  his small eyes are set far back and at the top of his head are rather large upright ears  the shell of his tail is divided into many jointed rings so that he can move it at will  his tongue is long and sticky  this is so that he can run it out for some distance and sweep up the ants and insects on which he largely lives  his eyesight and hearing are not very good and having such a heavy stiff coat he is a poor runner  but he is a good digger  this means of course that he makes his home in a hole in the ground  when frightened he makes for this but if overtaken by an enemy he rolls up into a ball and is safe from all save those with big and strong enough teeth to break through the joints of his shell  he eats some vegetable matter and is accused of eating the eggs of groundnesting birds and of dead decayed flesh he may find  however his food consists chiefly of ants insects of various kinds and worms  he is a harmless little fellow and interesting because he is so queer  he is sometimes killed and eaten by man and his flesh is considered very good he has from four to eight babies in the early spring  the baby armadillo has a soft tough skin instead of a shell and as it grows it hardens until by the time it is fully grown it has become a shell  now this finishes the lessons about the land animals or mammals there are other mammals who live in the ocean which is the salt water which surrounds the land and which i guess none of you have ever seen  some of these come on shore and some never do tomorrow i will tell you just a little about them so that you will know something about all the animals of this great country which is called north america  that is i will if you want me to  we do  of course we do cried peter rabbit and it is plain that he spoke for all    chapter xl  the mammals of the sea  it was the last day of old mother natures school in the green forest and when jolly round bright mr sun had climbed high enough in the blue blue sky to peep down through the trees he found not one missing of the little people who had been learning so much about themselves their relatives neighbors and all the other animals in every part of this great country  you see not for anything in the world would one of them willingly have missed that last lesson  i told you yesterday began old mother nature that the land is surrounded by water salt water sometimes called the ocean and sometimes the sea  in this live the largest animals in all the great world and many others some of which sometimes come on land and others which never do  one of those which come on land is first cousin to little joe otter and is named the sea otter  he lives in the cold waters of the western ocean of the far north he much resembles little joe otter whom you all know but has finer handsomer fur  in fact so handsome is his fur that he has been hunted for it until now  he is among the shyest and rarest of all animals and has taken to living in the water practically all the time rarely visiting land  he lies on his back in the water and gets his food from the bottom of the sea  it is chiefly clams and other shellfish  he rests on floating masses of sea plants  he is very playful and delights to toss pieces of seaweed from paw to paw as he lies floating on his back  of course he is a wonderful swimmer and diver  otherwise he couldnt live in the sea  another who comes on land but only for a very short distance from the water is called the walrus  he belongs to an order called finnipedia which means finfooted  instead of having legs and feet for walking members of this order have limbs designed for swimming these are more like fins or paddles than anything else and are called flippers  the walrus is so big that i can give you no idea how big he is excepting to say that he will weight two thousand pounds  he is simply a great mass of living flesh covered with a rough very thick skin without hair  from his upper jaw two immense ivory tusks hang straight down and with these he digs up shellfish at the bottom of the sea  it is a terrible effort for him to move on shore and so he is content to stay within a few feet of the water  he also lives in the cold waters of the far north amidst floating ice  on this he often climbs out to lie for hours  his voice is a deep grunt or bellowing roar  the young are born on land close to the water  the sea lions belong to this same finfooted order  the best known of these are the california sea lion and the fur seal which is not a true seal  the california sea lion is also called the barking sea lion because of its habit of barking and is the best known of the family  it is frequently seen on the rocks along the shore and on the islands off the western coast  these sea lions are sleek animals exceedingly graceful in the water  they have long necks and carry their heads high  they are covered with short coarse hair and have small sharppointed ears  their front flippers have neither hair nor claws but their hind flippers have webbed toes  they are able to move about on land surprisingly well for animals lacking regular legs and feet and can climb on and over rocks rapidly  naturally they are splendid swimmers  the largest member of the family is the steller sea lion who sometimes grows to be almost as big as a walrus  he is not sleek and graceful like his smaller cousin but has an enormously thick neck and heavy shoulders  his voice is a roar rather than a bark the head of an old sea lion is so much like that of a true lion that the name sea lion has been given this family  the most valuable member of the family so far as man is concerned is the fur seal also called sea bear  it is very nearly the size and form of the california sea lion but under the coarse outer hair which is gray in color is a wonderful soft fine brown fur and for this the fur seal has been hunted so persistently that there was real danger that soon the very last one would be killed  now wise and needed laws protect the fur seals on their breeding grounds which are certain islands in the far north  the young of all members of this family are born on shore but soon take to the water  the fur seal migrates just as the birds do but always returns to the place of its birth  man and the polar bear are its enemies on land and ice and the killer whale in the water  mr fur seal always has many wives and this is true of the other members of the sea lion family and of the walrus  the males are three or four times the size of the females  among themselves the males are fierce fighters  the true seals are shortnecked thickbodied and have rather round heads with no visible ears  the walrus and sea lions can turn their hind flippers forward to use as feet on land but this the true seals cannot do  therefore they are more clumsy out of water  their front flippers are covered with hair  the one best known is the harbor or leopard seal  it is found along both coasts often swimming far up big rivers  it is one of the smallest members of the family  sometimes it is yellowish gray spotted with black and sometimes dark brown with light spots  the ringed seal is about the same size or a little smaller than the harbor seal and is found as far north as it can find breathing holes in the ice  you know all these animals breathe air just as land animals do  this seal looks much like the harbor seal but is a little more slender  another member of the family is the harp saddleback or greenland seal  he is larger than the other two and has a black head and gray body with a large black ring on the back  the female is not so handsome being merely spotted  the handsomest seal is the ribbon seal  he is about the size of his cousin the harbor seal  he is also called the harlequin seal sometimes his coat is blackishbrown and sometimes yellowishgray but always he has a band of yellowishwhite like a broad ribbon from his throat around over the top of his head and another band which starts on his chest and goes over his shoulder curves down and finally goes around his body not far above the hind flippers only the male is so marked  this seal is rather rare  like most of the others it lives in the cold waters of the far north  the largest of the seals is the elephant seal once numerous but killed by man until now there are few members of this branch of the family  he is a tremendous fellow and has a movable nose which hangs several inches below his mouth  the queerestlooking member of the family is the hooded seal  mr seal of this branch of the family is rather large and on top of his nose he carries a large bag of skin which he can fill with air until he looks as if he were wearing a queer hood or bonnet  the seals complete the list of animals which live mostly in the water but come out on land or ice at times  now i will tell you of a true mammal warmblooded just as you are and airbreathing but which never comes on land  this is the manatee or sea cow  it lives in the warm waters of the sunny south coming up from the sea in the big rivers  it is a very large animal sometimes growing as big as a mediumsized walrus  the head is round somewhat like that of a seal  the lips are thick and big the upper one split in the middle  the eyes are small  it has but two flippers and these are set in at the shoulders  instead of hind flippers such as the seals and sea lions have the manatee has a broad flattened and rounded tail which is used as a propeller just as fish use their tails the neck is short and large  in the water the manatee looks black the skin is almost hairless  this curious animal lives on water plants  sometimes it will come close to a river bank and with head and shoulders out of water feed on the grasses which hang down from the bank  the babies are of course born in the water as the manatee never comes on shore now i think this will end todays lesson and the school  peter rabbit hopped up excitedly  you said that the largest animals in the world live in the sea and you havent told us what they are he cried  true enough peter replied old mother nature pleasantly  the largest living animal is a whale a true mammal and not a fish at all as some people appear to think  there are several kinds of whales some of them comparatively small and some the largest animals in the world so large that i cannot give you any idea of how big they are  beside one of these the biggest walrus would look like a baby  but the whales do not belong just to this country so i think we will not include them  now we will close school  i hope you have enjoyed learning as much as i have enjoyed teaching and i hope that what you have learned will be of use to you as long as you live  the more knowledge you possess the better fitted for your part in the work of the great world you will be  dont forget that and never miss a chance to learn  and so ended old mother natures school in the green forest  one by one her little pupils thanked her for all she had taught them and then started for home  peter rabbit was the last  i know ever and ever so much more than i did when i first came to you but i guess that after all i know very little of all there is to know said he shyly which shows that peter really had learned a great deal  then he started for the dear old briarpatch lippertylippertylip
