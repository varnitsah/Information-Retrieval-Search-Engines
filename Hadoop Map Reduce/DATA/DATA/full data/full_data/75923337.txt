    illustration the lands end cornwall      new edition     london   richard bentley new burlington street   publisher in ordinary to her majesty   1861       dedicated to    the companion of my walk through cornwall    henry c brandling       preface    to    the present edition   i visited cornwall for the first time in the summer and autumn of 1850 and in the winter of the same year i wrote this book  at that time the title attached to these pages was strictly descriptive of the state of the county when my companion and i walked through it but when little more than a year afterwards a second edition of this volume was called for the allconquering railway had invaded cornwall in the interval and had practically contradicted me on my own titlepage  to rechristen my work was out of the questioni should simply have destroyed its individuality ladies may and do often change their names for the better but books enjoy no such privilege in this embarrassing position i ended by treating the illtimed intrusion of the railway into my literary affairs as a certain abbé who was also an author once treated the overthrow of the swedish constitution in the reign of gustavus the third having written a profound work to prove that the constitution as at that time settled was secure from all political accidents the abbé was surprised in his study one day by the appearance of a gentleman who disturbed him over the correction of his last proofsheet sir said the gentleman i have looked in to inform you that the constitution has just been overthrown to which the abbé repliedsir they may overthrow the constitution but they cant overthrow my bookand he quietly went on with his work  on precisely similar principles i quietly went on with my titlepage  so much for the name of the book for the book itself as published in its present form i have a last word to say before these prefatory lines come to an end  cornwall no longer offers the same comparatively untrodden road to the literary traveller which it presented when i went there many writers have made the journey successfully since my time mr walter white in his londoners walk to the lands end has followed me and rivalled me on my own ground mr murray has published the handbook to cornwall and devonand detached essays on cornish subjects too numerous to reckon up have appeared in various periodical forms under this change of circumstances it is not the least of the debts which i owe to the encouraging kindness of my readers that they have not forgotten rambles beyond railways and that the continued demand for the book is such as to justify the appearance of the present edition i have as i believe to thank the unambitious purpose with which i originally wrote for thus keeping me in remembrance all that my book attempts is frankly to record a series of personal impressions and as a necessary consequencethough my title is obsolete and my pedestrian adventures are oldfashionedi have a character of my own still left which readers can recognise and the homely travelling narrative which i brought from cornwall eleven years since is not laid on the shelf yet  i have spared no pains to make these pages worthy of the approval of new readers the book has been carefully revised throughout and certain hastilywritten passages which my better experience condemns as unsuited to the main design have been removed altogether two of the lithographic illustrations now no longer in existence with which my friend and fellowtraveller mr brandling adorned the previous editions have been copied on wood as accurately as circumstances would permit and a postscript has been added which now appears in connexion with the original narrative for the first time  the little supplementary sketch thus presented describes a cruise to the scilly islands taken five years after the period of my visit to cornwall and completes the round of my travelling experiences in the far west of england these newlyadded pages are written i am afraid in a tone of somewhat boisterous gaietywhich i have not however had the heart to subdue because it is after all the genuine offspring of the harumscarum high spirits of the time the cruise of the tomtit was from first to last a practical burlesque and the goodnatured reader will i hope not think the worse of me if i beg him to stand on no ceremony and to laugh his way through it as heartily as he can   harley street london   march 1861     contents                                                       page       i a letter of introduction

 i  a letter of introduction     dear reader  when any friend of yours or mine in whose fortunes we take an interest is about to start on his travels we smooth his way for him as well as we can by giving him a letter of introduction to such connexions of ours as he may find on his line of route we bespeak their favourable consideration for him by setting forth his good qualities in the best light possible and then leave him to make his own way by his own meritsatisfied that we have done enough in procuring him a welcome under our friends roof and giving him at the outset a claim to our friends estimation  will you allow me reader if our previous acquaintance authorizes me to take such a liberty to follow the custom to which i have just adverted and to introduce to your notice this book as a friend of mine setting forth on his travels in whose wellbeing i feel a very lively interest he is neither so bulky nor so distinguished a person as some of the predecessors of his race who may have sought your attention in years gone by under the name of quarto and in magnificent clothing of morocco and gold all that i can say for his outside is that i have made it as neat as i canhaving had him properly thumped into wearing his present coat of decent cloth by the most competent booktailor i could find as for his intrinsic claims to your kindness he has only two that i shall venture to advocate in the first place he is able to tell you something about a part of your own country which is still too rarely visited and too little known he will speak to you of one of the remotest and most interesting corners of our old english soil he will tell you of the grand and varied scenery the mighty druid relics the quaint legends the deep dark mines the venerable remains of early christianity and the pleasant primitive population of the county of cornwall you will inquire can we believe him in all that he says this brings me at once to his second qualificationhe invariably speaks the truth if he describes scenery to you it is scenery that he saw and noted on the spot and if he adds some little sketches of character i answer for him on my own responsibility that they are sketches drawn from the life  have i said enough about my friend to interest you in his fortunes when you meet him wandering hither and thither over the great domain of the republic of lettersor must i plead more warmly in his behalf i can only urge on you that he does not present himself as fit for the top seats at the library tableas aspiring to the company of those above himof classical statistical political philosophical historical or antiquarian high dignitaries of his class of whom he is at best but the poor relation treat him not as you treat such illustrious guests as these toss him about anywhere from hand to hand as goodnaturedly as you can stuff him into your pocket when you get into the railway take him to bed with you and poke him under the pillow present him to the rising generation to try if he can amuse them give him to the young ladies who are always predisposed to the kind side and may make something of him introduce him to my young masters when they are idling away a dull morning over their cigars nay advance him if you will to the notice of the elders themselves but take care to ascertain first that they are people who only travel to gratify a hearty admiration of the wonderful works of nature and to learn to love their neighbour better by seeking him at his own homeregarding it at the same time as a peculiar privilege to derive their satisfaction and gain their improvement from experiences on english ground take care of this and who knows into what high society you may not be able to introduce the bearer of the present letter in spite of his habit of rambling from subject to subject in his talk much as he rambled from place to place in his travels he may actually find himself one day basking on folio classics beneath the genial approval of a doctor of divinity or trembling among statutes and reports under the learned scrutiny of a sergeant at law    w c    harley street london    march 1861     ii  a cornish fishing town   the time is ten oclock at nightthe scene a bank by the roadside crested with young firtrees and affording a temporary place of repose to two travellers who are enjoying the cool night air picturesquely extended flat on their backsor rather on their knapsacks which now form part and parcel of their backs these two travellers are the writer of this book and an artist friend who is the companion of his rambles they have long desired to explore cornwall together on foot and the object of their aspirations has been at last accomplished in the summertime of the year eighteen hundred and fifty  in their present position the travellers are to speak geographically bounded towards the east by a long road winding down the side of a rocky hill towards the west by the broad halfdry channel of a tidal river towards the north by trees hills and upland valleys and towards the south by an old bridge and some houses near it with lights in their windows faintly reflected in shallow water in plainer words the southern boundary of the prospect around them represents a place called looea fishingtown on the south coast of cornwall which is their destination for the night  they had by this time accomplished their initiation into the process of walking under a knapsack with the most complete and encouraging success you who in these days of vehement bustle business and competition can still find time to travel for pleasure aloneyou who have yet to become emancipated from the thraldom of railways carriages and saddlehorsespatronize i exhort you that first and oldestestablished of all conveyances your own legs think on your tender partings nipped in the bud by the railway bell think of crabbed crossroads and broken carriagesprings think of luggage confided to extortionate porters of horses casting shoes and catching colds of cramped legs and numbed feet of vain longings to get down for a moment here and to delay for a pleasant half hour therethink of all these manifold hardships of riding at your ease and the next time you leave home strap your luggage on your shoulders take your stick in your hand set forth delivered from a perfect paraphernalia of incumbrances to go where you will how you willthe free citizen of the whole travelling world thus independent what may you not accomplishwhat pleasure is there that you cannot enjoy are you an artistyou can stop to sketch every point of view that strikes your eye are you a philanthropistyou can go into every cottage and talk to every human being you pass are you a botanist or geologistyou may pick up leaves and chip rocks wherever you please the livelong day are you a valetudinarianyou may physic yourself by natures own simple prescription walking in fresh air are you dilatory and irresoluteyou may dawdle to your hearts content you may change all your plans a dozen times in a dozen hours you may tell boots at the inn to call you at six oclock may fall asleep again ecstatic sensation five minutes after he has knocked at the door and may get up two hours later to pursue your journey with perfect impunity and satisfaction for to you what is a timetable but wastepaperand a booked place but a relic of the dark ages you dread perhaps blisters on your feetsponge your feet with cold vinegar and water change your socks every ten miles and show me blisters after that if you can you strap on your knapsack for the first time and five minutes afterwards feel an aching pain in the muscles at the back of your neckwalk on and the aching will walk off how do we overcome our first painful cuticular reminiscences of first getting on horsebackby riding again apply the same rule to carrying the knapsack and be assured of the same successful result again i say it thereforewalk and be merry walk and be healthy walk and be your own masterwalk to enjoy to observe to improve as no riders canwalk and you are the best peripatetic impersonation of holiday enjoyment that is to be met with on the surface of this workaday world  how much more could i not say in praise of travelling on our own neglected legs but it is getting late dark nightclouds are marching slowly over the sky to the whistling music of the wind we must leave our bank by the roadside pass one end of the old bridge walk along a narrow winding street and enter our hospitable little inn where we are welcomed by the kindest of landladies and waited on by the fairest of chambermaids if looe prove not to be a little seashore paradise tomorrow then is there no virtue in the good omens of tonight                                       the first point for which we made in the morning was the old bridge and a most picturesque and singular structure we found it to be its construction dates back as far as the beginning of the fifteenth century it is three hundred and eightyfour feet long and has fourteen arches no two of which are on the same scale the stout buttresses built between each arch are hollowed at the top into curious triangular places of refuge for pedestrians the roughly paved roadway being just wide enough to allow the passage of one cart at a time on some of these buttresses towards the middle once stood an oratory or chapel dedicated to st anne but no vestiges of it now remain the old bridge however still rises sturdily enough on its ancient foundations and whatever the point from which its silvergrey stones and quaint arches of all shapes and sizes may be beheld forms no mean adjunct to the charming landscape around it  looe is known to have existed as a town in the reign of edward i and it remains to this day one of the prettiest and most primitive places in england the river divides it into east and west looe and the view from the bridge looking towards the two little colonies of houses thus separated is in some respects almost unique  at each side of you rise high ranges of beautifully wooded hills here and there a cottage peeps out among the trees the winding path that leads to it being now lost to sight in the thick foliage now visible again as a thin serpentine line of soft grey midway on the slopes appear the gardens of looe built up the acclivity on stone terraces one above another thus displaying the veritable garden architecture of the mountains of palestine magically transplanted to the side of an english hill here in this soft and genial atmosphere the hydrangea is a common flowerbed ornament the fuchsia grows lofty and luxuriant in the poorest cottage garden the myrtle flourishes close to the seashore and the tender tamarisk is the wild plant of every farmers hedge looking lower down the hills yet you see the houses of the town straggling out towards the sea along each bank of the river in mazes of little narrow streets curious old quays project over the water at different points coasttrade vessels are being loaded and unloaded built in one place and repaired in another all within view while the prospect of hills harbour and houses thus quaintly combined together is beautifully closed by the english channel just visible as a small strip of blue water pent in between the ridges of two promontories which stretch out on either side to the beach  such is looe as beheld from a distance and it loses none of its attractions when you look at it more closely there is no such thing as a straight street in the place no martinet of an architect has been here to drill the old stone houses into regimental regularity sometimes you go down steps into the ground floor sometimes you mount an outside staircase to get to the bedrooms never were such places devised for hide and seek since that exciting nursery pastime was first invented no house has fewer than two doors leading into two different lanes some have three opening at once into a court a street and a wharf all situated at different points of the compass the shops too have their diverting irregularities as well as the town here you might call a man a jack of all trades as the best and truest compliment you could pay himfor here one shop combines in itself a drugmongering cheesemongering stationery grocery and oil and italian line of business to say nothing of such cosmopolitan miscellanies as wrinkled apples dusty nuts cracked slate pencils and flyblown mock jewellery the moral good which you derive in the first pane of a window from the contemplation of memoirs of murdered missionaries and serious tracts against intemperance and tightlacing you lose in the second before such worldly temptations as gingerbread shirtstuds and fascinating white hats for sunday wear at two and ninepence apiece let no man rashly say he has seen all that british enterprise can do for the extension of british commerce until he has carefully studied the shopfronts of the tradesmen of looe  then when you have at last threaded your way successfully through the streets and have got out on the beach you see a pretty miniature bay formed by the extremity of a green hill on the right and by fine jagged slaterocks on the left before this seaward quarter of the town is erected a strong bulwark of rough stones to resist the incursion of high tides here the idlers of the place assemble to lounge and gossip to look out for any outwardbound ships that are to be seen in the channel and to criticise the appearance and glorify the capabilities of the little fleet of looe fishingboats riding snugly at anchor before them at the entrance of the bay  the inhabitants number some fourteen hundred and are as goodhumoured and unsophisticated a set of people as you will meet with anywhere the fisheries and the coast trade form their principal means of subsistence the women take a very fair share of the hard work out of the mens hands you constantly see them carrying coals from the vessels to the quay in curious handbarrows they laugh scream and run in each others way incessantly but these little irregularities seem to assist rather than impede them in the prosecution of their tasks as to the men one absorbing interest appears to govern them all the whole day long they are mending boats painting boats cleaning boats rowing boats or standing with their hands in their pockets looking at boats the children seem to be children in size and children in nothing else they congregate together in sober little groups and hold mysterious conversations in a dialect which we cannot understand if they ever do tumble down soil their pinafores throw stones or make mud pies they practise these juvenile vices in a midnight secrecy which no strangers eye can penetrate  in that second period of the dark ages when there were high tories and rotten boroughs in the land looe containing at that time nothing like the number of inhabitants which it now possesses sent four members to parliament the ceremony by which two of these members were elected as it was described to me by a man who remembered witnessing it must have been an impressive sight indeed to any foreigner interested in studying the representative system of this country on the morning of the poll one division of the borough sent six electors and another four to record their imposing aggregate of votes in favour of any two smiling civil gentlemen who came properly recommended to ask for them this done the ten electors walked quietly home in one direction and the two members walked quietly off in another to perform the fatiguing duty of representing their constituents interests in imperial parliament the election was quite a snug little family affair in these good old times the ten gentlemen who voted and the other two gentlemen who took their votes just made up a comfortable compact dozen all together  but this state of things was too harmonious to last in such a world of discord as ours the day of innovation came turbulent whigs and radicals laid uncivil hands on the looe pollingbooth and politically annihilated the pleasant party of twelve since that disastrous period the town has sent no members to parliament at all and very little indeed do the townspeople appear to care about so serious a deprivation in case the reader should be disposed to attribute this indifference to municipal privileges to the supineness rather than the philosophy of the inhabitants i think it necessary to establish their just claims to be considered as possessing public spirit prompt decision and wise fertility of resource in cases of emergency by relating in this place the true story of how the people of looe got rid of the rats  about a mile out at sea to the southward of the town rises a green triangular shaped eminence called looe island here many years ago a ship was wrecked not only were the sailors saved but several free passengers of the rat species who had got on board nobody knew how where or when were also preserved by their own strenuous exertions and wisely took up permanent quarters for the future on the terra firma of looe island in process of time and in obedience to the laws of nature these rats increased and multiplied exceedingly and being confined all round within certain limits by the sea soon became a palpable and dangerous nuisance destruction was threatened to the agricultural produce of all the small patches of cultivated land on the islandit seemed doubtful whether any man who ventured there by himself might not share the fate of bishop hatto and be devoured by rats under these pressing circumstances the people of looe determined to make one united and vehement effort to extirpate the whole colony of invaders ordinary means of destruction had been tried already and without effect it was said that rats left for dead on the ground had mysteriously revived faster than they could be picked up and skinned or flung into the sea rats desperately wounded had got away into their holes and become convalescent and increased and multiplied again more productively than ever the great problem was not how to kill the rats but how to annihilate them so effectually as to place the reappearance even of one of them altogether out of the question this was the problem and it was solved in the following manner  all the available inhabitants of the town were called to join in a great hunt the rats were caught by every conceivable artifice and once taken were instantly and ferociously smothered in onions the corpses were then decently laid out on clean china dishes and straightway eaten with vindictive relish by the people of looe never was any invention for destroying rats so complete and so successful as this every man woman and child who could eat could swear to the extirpation of all the rats they had eaten the local returns of dead rats were not made by the bills of mortality but by the bills of fare it was getting rid of a nuisance by the unheardof process of stomaching a nuisance day after day passed on and rats disappeared by hundreds never to return what could all their cunning and resolution avail them now they had resisted before and could have resisted still the ordinary force of dogs ferrets traps sticks stones and guns arrayed against them but when to these engines of assault were added as auxiliaries smothering onions scalding stewpans hungry mouths sharp teeth good digestions and the gastric juice what could they do but give in swift and sure was the destruction that now overwhelmed themeverybody who wanted a dinner had a strong personal interest in hunting them down to the very last in a short space of time the island was cleared of the usurpers cheeses remained entire ricks rose uninjured and this is the true story of how the people of looe got rid of the rats  it will not much surprise any reader who has been goodnatured enough to peruse the preceding pages with some attention to hear that we idly delayed the day of departure from the pleasant fishingtown on the south coast which was now the place of our sojourn the smiles of our fair chambermaid and the cookery of our excellent hostess addressed us in siren tones of allurement which we had not the virtue to resist then it was difficult to leave unexplored any of the numerous walks in the neighbourhoodall delightfully varied in character and each possessing its own attractive point of view even when we had made our determination and fixed our farewell day a great boatrace and a great teadrinking which everybody declared was something that everybody else ought to see interfered to detain us we delayed yet once more to partake in the festivities and found that they supplied us with all the necessary resolution to quit looe which we had hitherto wanted we had remained to take part in a social failure on a very large scale  as in addition to the boatrace there was to be a bazaar on the beach and as fine weather was therefore an essential requisite on the occasion it is scarcely necessary to premise that we had an unusually large quantity of rain in the forenoon however the sun shone with treacherous brilliancy and all the women in the neighbourhood fluttered out in his beams gay as butterflies what dazzling gowns what flaring parasols what joyous cavalcades on carthorses did we see on the road that led to the town what a mixture of excitement confusion anxiety and importance possessed everybody what frolic and felicity attended the popular gatherings on the beach until the fatal moment when the gun fired for the first race then as if at that signal the clouds began to muster in ominous blackness the deceitful sunlight disappeared the rain came down for the daya steady noiseless malicious rain that at once forbade all hope of clear weather dire was the discomfiture of the poor ladies of looe they ran hither and thither for shelter in lank wet muslin and under dripping parasols displaying in the lamentable emergency of the moment all sorts of interior contrivances for expanding around them the exterior magnificence of their gowns which we never ought to have seen deserted were the stalls of the bazaar for the parlours of the alehouses unapplauded and unobserved strained at the oar the stout rowers in the boatrace everybody ran to cover except some seafaring men who cared nothing for weather some inveterate loungers who would wander up and down in spite of the rain and three unhappy german musicians who had been caught on their travels and pinned up tight against the outer wall of a house in a sort of cage of canvas boards and evergreens which hid every part of them but their heads and shoulders nobody interfered to release these unfortunates there they sat hemmed in all round by dripping leaves blowing grimly and incessantly through instruments of brass if the reader can imagine the effect of three phlegmatic men with long bottle noses looking out of a circle of green bushes and playing waltzes unintermittingly on long horns in a heavy showerhe will be able to form a tolerably correct estimate of the large extra proportion of gloom which the german musicians succeeded in infusing into the disastrous proceedings of the day  the teadrinking was rather more successful the room in which it was held was filled to the corners and exhaled such an odour of wet garments and bread and butter to say nothing of an incessant clatter of china and bawling of voices that we found ourselves as uninitiated strangers unequal to the task of remaining in it to witness the proceedings descending the steps which led into the street from the doorto the great confusion of a string of smartly dressed ladies who encountered us rushing up with steaming teakettles and craggy lumps of plumcakewe left the inhabitants to conclude their festivities by themselves and went out to take a farewell walk on the cliffs of looe  we ascended the heights to the westward losing sight of the town among the trees as we went and then walking in a southerly direction through some cornfields approached within a few hundred yards of the edge of the cliffs and looked out on the sea the sky had partially cleared and the rain had ceased but huge fantastic masses of cloud tinged with lurid coppercolour by the setting sun still towered afar off over the horizon and were reflected in a deeper hue on the calm surface of the sea with a perfectness and grandeur that i never remember to have witnessed before not a ship was in sight but out on the extreme line of the wilderness of grey waters there shone one red fiery sparkthe beacon of the eddystone lighthouse before us the green fields of looe island rose high out of the oceanhere partaking the red light on the clouds there half lost in cold shadow closer yet on the mainland a few cattle were feeding quietly on a long strip of meadow bordering the edge of the cliff and now and then a gull soared up from the sea and wheeled screaming over our heads the faint sound of the small shorewaves invisible to us in the position we occupied beating dull and at long intervals on the beach augmented the dreary solemnity of the evening prospect light shade and colour were all before us arranged in the grandest combinations and expressed by the simplest forms if michael angelo had painted landscape he might have represented such a scene as we now beheld  this was our last excursion at looe the next morning we were again on the road walking inland on our way to the town of liskeard     iii  holy wells and druid relics   fresh from the quaint old houses the delightfully irregular streets and the fragrant terracegardens of looe we found ourselves on entering liskeard suddenly introduced to that abomination of desolation a large agricultural country town modern square houses barren of all outer ornament wide dusty deserted streets misanthropicallooking shopkeepers clad in rusty black standing at their doors to gaze on the solitude around themgreeted our eyes on all sides such samples of the population as we accidentally encountered were not promising we were unlucky enough to remark in the course of two streets a nonagenarian old woman with a false nose and an idiot shaking with the palsy  but harder trials were in reserve for us we missed the best of the many inns at liskeard and went to the very worst what a place was our house of public entertainment for a great sinner to repent in or for a melancholy recluse to retreat to not a human being appeared in the street where this tavern of despair frowned amid congenial desolation nobody welcomed us at the doorthe sign creaked dolefully as the wind swung it on its rusty hinges we walked in and discovered a lowspirited little man sitting at an empty bar and hiding himself as it were from all mortal inspection behind the full sheet of a dirty provincial newspaper doleful was our petition to this secluded publican for shelter and food and doubly doleful was his answer to our appeal beds he believed he hadfood there was none in the house saving a piece of corned beef which the family had dined on and which he proposed that we should partake of before it got quite cold having said thus much he suddenly retired behind his newspaper and spoke no word more  in a few minutes the landlady appeared looking very thin and careworn and clad in mourning weeds she smiled sadly upon us and desired to know how we liked corned beef we acknowledged a preference for fresh meat especially in large market towns like liskeard where butchers shops abounded the landlady was willing to see what she could get and in the meantime begged to be allowed to show us into a private room she succeeded in incarcerating us in the most thoroughly private room that could be found out of a model prison it was situated far away at the back of the house and looked out upon a very small yard entirely circumscribed by empty stables the one little window was shut down tight and we were desired not to open it for fear of a smell from these stables the ornaments of the place consisted of hymnbooks spellingbooks and a china statue of napoleon in a light green waistcoat and a skyblue coat there was not even a fly in the room to intrude on us in our privacy there were no cocks and hens in the yard to cackle on us in our privacy nobody walked past the outer passage or made any noise in any part of the house to startle us in our privacy and a steady rain was falling propitiously to keep us in our privacy we dined in our retired situation on some rugged lumps of broiled flesh which the landlady called chops and the servant steaks we broke out of prison after dinner and roamed the streets we returned to solitary confinement in the evening and were instantly conducted to another cell  this second private apartment appeared to be about forty feet long six immense wooden tables painted of a ghastly yellow colour were ranged down it side by side nothing was placed on any of themthey looked like dissectingtables waiting for subjects there was yet another and a seventh tablea round one half lost in a corner to which we retreated for refugeit was covered with crape and bombazine half made up into mourning garments proper to the first and intensest stage of grief the servant brought us one small candle to cheer the scene and desired to be informed whether we wanted two sheets apiece to our beds or whether we could do with a sheet at top and a blanket at bottom as other people did this question cowed us at once into gloomy submission to our fate we just hinted that we had contracted bad habits of sleeping between two sheets and left the rest to chance reckless how we slept or where we slept whether we passed the night on the top of one of the six dissectingtables or with a blanket at bottom as other people passed it soon the servant returned to tell us that we had got our two sheets each and to send us to bedsnatching up the landladys mourning garments while she spoke with a scared suspicious look as if she thought that the next outrageous luxury we should require would be a nightgown apiece of crape and bombazine  reflecting on our lamentable situation the last thing at night we derived some consolation from remembering that we should leave our quarters early the next morning it was not liskeard that we had come to see but the country around liskeardthe famous curiosities of nature and art that are to be found some six or eight miles away from the town accordingly we were astir betimes on the morrow the sky was fair the breeze was exhilarating once past the doleful doorway of the inn we found ourselves departing under the fairest auspices for a pilgrimage to the ruins of st cleers well and to the granite piles and druid remains now entitled the cheesewring and hurler rocks  on leaving the town our way lay to the northward up rising ground for the first two miles the scenery differed little from what we had already beheld in cornwall the lanes were still sunk down between high banks like dry ditches all varieties of ferns grew in exquisite beauty and luxuriance on either side of us the trees were small in size and thickly clothed with leaves and the views were generally narrowed to a few wellcultivated fields with sturdy little granitebuilt cottages now and then rising beyond it was only when we had reached what must have been a considerable elevation that any change appeared in the face of the country five minutes more of walking and a single turn in the road brought us suddenly to the limits of trees meadows and cottages and displayed before us with almost startling abruptness the magnificent prospect of a cornish moor  the expanse of open plain that we now beheld stretched away uninterruptedly on the right hand as far as the distant hills towards the left the view was broken and varied by some rough stone walls a narrow road and a dip in the earth beyond wherever we looked far or near we saw masses of granite of all shapes and sizes heaped irregularly on the ground among dark clusters of heath an old furzecutter was the only human figure that appeared on the desolate scene approaching him to ask our way to st cleers wellno signs of which could be discerned on the wilderness before uswe found the old fellow though he was eighty years of age working away with all the vigour of youth on this wild moor he had lived and laboured from childhood and he began to talk proudly of its great length and breadth and of the wonderful sights that were to be seen on different parts of it the moment we addressed him he described to us in his own homely forcible way the awful storms that he had beheld the fearful rattling and roaring of thunder over the great unsheltered plain before usthe hail and sleet driven so fiercely before the hurricane that a man was halfblinded if he turned his face towards it for a momentthe forked lightning shooting from pitchdark clouds leaping and running fearfully over the level ground blackening splitting tearing from their places the stoutest rocks on the moor three masses of granite lay heaped together near the spot where we had haltedthe furzecutter pointed to them with his billhook and told us that what we now looked on was once one great rock which he had seen riven in an instant by the lightning into the fragmentary form that it now presented if we mounted the highest of these three masses he declared that we might find out our own way to st cleers well by merely looking around us we followed his directions towards the east far away over the magnificent sweep of moorland and on the slope of the hill that bounded it appeared the tall chimneys and enginehouses of the great caraton copper minethe only objects raised by the hand of man that were to be seen on this part of the view towards the west much nearer at hand four grey turrets were just visible beyond some rising ground these turrets belonged to the tower of st cleers church and the well was close by it  taking leave of the furzecutter we followed the path at once that led to st cleers half an hours walking brought us to the village a straggling picturesque place hidden in so deep a hollow as to be quite invisible from any distance all the little cottagegirls whom we met carrying their jugs and pitchers of water curtseyed and wished us good morning with the prettiest air of bashfulness and good humour imaginable one of them a rosy beautiful child who proudly informed us that she was six years old put down her jug at a cottagegate and ran on before to show us the way delighted to be singled out from her companions for so important an office we passed the grey walls of the old church walked down a lane and soon came in sight of the well the position of which was marked by a ruined oratory situated on some open ground close at the side of the public pathway  st cleer oras the name is generally spelt out of cornwallst clare the patron saint of the well was born in italy in the twelfth centuryand born to a fair heritage of this worlds honours and this worlds possessions but she voluntarily abandoned at an early age all that was alluring in the earthly career awaiting her to devote herself entirely to the interests of her religion and the service of heaven she was the first woman who sat at the feet of st francis as his disciple who humbly practised the selfmortification and resolutely performed the vow of perpetual poverty which her preceptors harshest doctrines imposed on his followers she soon became abbess of the benedictine nuns with whom she was associated by the saint and afterwards founded an order of her ownthe order of poor clares the fame of her piety and humility of her devotion to the cause of the sick the afflicted and the poor spread far and wide the most illustrious of the ecclesiastics of her time attended at her convent as at a holy shrine pope innocent the fourth visited her as a testimony of his respect for her virtues and paid homage to her memory when her blameless existence had closed by making one among the mourners who followed her to the grave her name had been derived from the latin word that signifies purity and from first to last her life had kept the promise of her name  poor st clare if she could look back with the thoughts and interests of the days of her mortality to the world that she has quitted for ever how sadly would she now contemplate the holy well which was once hallowed in her name and for her sake but one arched wall thickly overgrown with ivy still remains erect in the place that the old oratory occupied fragments of its roof its cornices and the mouldings of its windows lie scattered on the ground half hidden by the grasses and ferns twining prettily around them a double cross of stone stands sloping towards the earth at a little distance offsoon perhaps to share the fate of the prostrate ruins about it how changed the scene here since the time when the rural christening procession left the church to proceed down the quiet pathway to the holy wellwhen children were baptized in the pure spring and vows were offered up under the roof of the oratory and prayers were repeated before the sacred cross these were the pious usages of a past age these were the ceremonies of an ancient church whose innocent and reverent custom it was to connect closer together the beauty of nature and the beauty of religion by such means as the consecration of a spring or the erection of a roadside cross there has been something of sacrifice as well as of glory in the effort by which we in our time have freed ourselves from what was superstitious and tyrannical in the faith of the times of oldit has cost us the loss of much of the better part of that faith which was not superstition and of more which was not tyranny the spring of st clare is nothing to the cottager of our day but a place to draw water from the village lads now lounge whistling on the fallen stones once the consecrated arches under which their humble ancestors paused on the pilgrimage or knelt in prayer wherever the eye turns all around it speaks the melancholy language of desolation and decayall but the water of the holy well still the little pool remains the fitting type of its patron saintpure and tranquil as in the bygone days when the name of st clare was something more than the title to a village legend and the spring of st clare something better than a sight for the passing tourist among the cornish moors1  we happened to arrive at the well at the period when the villagers were going home to dinner after the first quarter of an hour we were left almost alone among the ruins the only person who approached to speak to us was a poor old woman bent and tottering with age who lived in a little cottage hard by she brought us a glass thinking we might wish to taste the water of the spring and presented me with a rose out of her garden such small scraps of information as she had gathered together about the well she repeated to us in low reverential tones as if its former religious uses still made it an object of veneration in her eyes after a time she too quitted us and we were then left quite alone by the side of the spring  it was a bright sunshiny day a pure air was abroad nothing sounded audibly but the singing of birds at some distance and the rustling of the few leaves that clothed one or two young trees in a neighbouring garden unoccupied though i was the minutes passed away as quickly and as unheeded with me as with my companion who was busily engaged in sketching the ruins of the ancient oratory viewed amid the pastoral repose of all things around them began imperceptibly to exert over me that mysterious power of mingling the impressions of the present with the memories of the past which all ruins possess while i sat looking idly into the water of the well and thinking of the groups that had gathered round it in years long gone by recollections began to rise vividly on my mind of other ruins that i had seen in other countries with friends some scattered some gone nowof pleasant pilgrimages in boyish days along the storied shores of baiæ or through the desolate streets of the dead city under vesuviusof happy sketching excursions to the aqueducts on the plains of rome or to the temples and villas of tivoli during which i had first learned to appreciate the beauties of nature under guidance which in this world i can never resume and had seen the lovely prospects of italian landscape pictured by a hand now powerless in death remembrances such as these of pleasures which remembrance only can recall as they were made time fly fast for me by the brink of the holy well i could have sat there all day and should not have felt at night that the day had been ill spent  but the sunlight began to warn us that noon was long past we had some distance yet to walk and many things more to see shortly after my friend had completed his sketch therefore we reluctantly left st clares well and went on our way briskly up the little valley and out again on the wide surface of the moor  it was now our object to steer a course over the wide plain around us leading directly to the cheesewring rocks so called from their supposed resemblance to a cornish cheesepress or wring on our road to this curiosity about a mile and a half from st clares well we stopped to look at one of the most perfect and remarkable of the ancient british monuments in cornwall it is called trevethey stone and consists of six large upright slabs of granite overlaid by a seventh which covers them in the form of a rude slanting roof these slabs are so irregular in form as to look quite unhewn they all vary in size and thickness the whole structure rises to a height probably of fourteen feet and standing as it does on elevated ground in a barren country with no stones of a similar kind erected near it presents an appearance of rugged grandeur and aboriginal simplicity which renders it an impressive almost a startling object to look on antiquaries have discovered that its name signifies the place of graves and have discovered no more no inscription appears on it the date of its erection is lost in the darkest of the dark periods of english history  our path had been gradually rising all the way from st clares well and when we left trevethey stone we still continued to ascend proceeding along the tramway leading to the caraton mine soon the scene presented another abrupt and extraordinary change we had been walking hitherto amid almost invariable silence and solitude but now with each succeeding minute strange mingled unintermitting noises began to grow louder and louder around us we followed a sharp curve in the tramway and immediately found ourselves saluted by an entirely new prospect and surrounded by an utterly bewildering noise all about us monstrous wheels were turning slowly machinery was clanking and groaning in the hoarsest discords invisible waters were pouring onward with a rushing sound high above our heads on skeleton platforms iron chains clattered fast and fiercely over iron pulleys and huge steam pumps puffed and gasped and slowly raised and depressed their heavy black beams of wood far beneath the embankment on which we stood men women and children were breaking and washing ore in a perfect marsh of coppercoloured mud and coppercoloured water we had penetrated to the very centre of the noise the bustle and the population on the surface of a great mine  when we walked forward again we passed through a thick plantation of young firs and then the sounds behind us became slowly and solemnly deadened the further we went on when we had arrived at the extremity of the line of trees they ceased softly and suddenly it was like a change in a dream  we now left the tramway and stood again on the mooron a wilder and lonelier part of it than we had yet beheld the cheesewring and its adjacent rocks were visible a mile and a half away on the summit of a steep hill wherever we looked the horizon was bounded by the long dark undulating edges of the moor the ground rose and fell in little hillocks and hollows tufted with dry grass and furze and strewn throughout with fragments of granite the whole plain appeared like the site of an ancient city of palaces overthrown and crumbled into atoms by an earthquake here and there some cows were feeding and sometimes a large crow winged his way lazily before us lessening and lessening slowly in the open distance until he was lost to sight no human beings were discernible anywhere the majestic loneliness and stillness of the scene were almost oppressive both to eye and ear above us immense fleecy masses of brilliant white cloud winddriven from the atlantic soared up grandly higher and higher over the bright blue sky everywhere the view had an impressively stern simple aboriginal look here were tracts of solitary country which had sturdily retained their ancient character through centuries of revolution and change plains pathless and desolate even now as when druid processions passed over them by night to the place of the secret sacrifice and skinclad warriors of old britain halted on them in council or hurried across them to the fight  on we went up and down in a very zigzag course now looking forward towards the cheesewring from the top of a rock now losing sight of it altogether in the depths of a hollow by the time we had advanced about half way over the distance it was necessary for us to walk we observed towards the left hand a wide circle of detached upright rooks these we knew from descriptions and engravings to be the hurlersso we turned aside at once to look at them from a nearer point of view  there are two very different histories of these rocks the antiquarian account of them is straightforward and practical enough simply asserting that they are the remains of a druid temple the whole region about them having been one of the principal stations of the druids in cornwall the popular account of the hurlers from which their name is derived is very different it is contended on the part of the people that once upon a time nobody knows how long ago these rocks were cornish men who profanely went out nobody knows from what place to enjoy the national sport of hurling the ball on one fine sabbath morning and were suddenly turned into pillars of stone as a judgment on their own wickedness and a warning to all their companions as well  having to choose between the antiquarian hypothesis and the popular legend on the very spot to which both referred a common susceptibility to the charms of romance at once determined us to pin our faith on the legend looking at the hurlers therefore in the peculiar spirit of the story attached to them as really and truly petrified ballplayers we observed with great interest that some of them must have been a little above and others a little below our own height in their lifetime that some must have been very corpulent and others very thin persons that one of them having a protuberance on his head remarkably like a nightcap in stone was possibly a sluggard as well as a sabbathbreaker and might have got out of his bed just in time to hurl that another with some faint resemblance left of a fat grinning human face leaned considerably out of the perpendicular and was in all probability a hurler of intemperate habits at some distance off we remarked a high stone standing entirely by itself which in the absence of any positive information on the subject we presumed to consider as the petrified effigy of a tall man who ran after the ball in the opposite direction other stones were dotted about irregularly which we could only imagine to represent certain misguided wretches who had attended as spectators of the sports and had therefore incurred the same penalty as the hurlers themselves these humble results of observations taken on the spot may possibly be useful as tending to offer some startling facts from ancient history to the next pious layman in the legislature who gets up to propose the next series of sabbath prohibitions for the benefit of the profane laymen in the nation  abandoning any more minute observation of the hurlers than that already recorded in order to husband the little time still left to us we soon shaped our course again in the direction of the cheesewring we arrived at the base of the hill on which it stands in a short time and without any difficulty and beheld above us a perfect chaos of rocks piled up the entire surface of the eminence all the granite we had seen before was as nothing compared with the granite we now looked on the masses were at one place heaped up in great irregular cairnsat another scattered confusedly over the ground poured all along in close craggy lumps flung about hither and thither as if in reckless sport by the hands of giants above the whole rose the weird fantastic form of the cheesewring the wildest and most wondrous of all the wild and wondrous structures in the rock architecture of the scene  if a man dreamt of a great pile of stones in a nightmare he would dream of such a pile as the cheesewring all the heaviest and largest of the seven thick slabs of which it is composed are at the top all the lightest and smallest at the bottom it rises perpendicularly to a height of thirtytwo feet without lateral support of any kind the fifth and sixth rocks are of immense size and thickness and overhang fearfully all round the four lower rocks which support them all are perfectly irregular the projections of one do not fit into the interstices of another they are heaped up loosely in their extraordinary topheavy form on slanting ground halfway down a steep hill look at them from whatever point you choose there is still all that is heaviest largest strongest at the summit and all that is lightest smallest weakest at the base when you first see the cheesewring you instinctively shrink from walking under it beholding the tons on tons of stone balanced to a hairs breadth on the mere fragments beneath you think that with a pole in your hand with one push against the top rocks you could hurl down the hill in an instant a pile which has stood for centuries unshaken by the fiercest hurricane that ever blew rushing from the great void of an ocean over the naked surface of a moor  of course theories advanced by learned men are not wanting to explain such a phenomenon as the cheesewring certain antiquaries have undertaken to solve this curious problem of nature in a very offhand manner by asserting that the rocks were heaped up as they now appear by the druids with the intention of astonishing their contemporaries and all posterity by a striking exhibition of their architectural skill if any of these antiquarian gentlemen be still living i would not recommend them to attempt a practical illustration of their theory by building miniature cheesewrings out of the contents of their coalscuttles the second explanation of the extraordinary position of the rocks is a geological explanation and is apparently the true one it is assumed on this latter hypothesis that the cheesewring and all the adjacent masses of stone were once covered or nearly covered by earth and were thus supported in an upright form that the wear and tear of storms gradually washed away all this earth from between the rocks down the hill and then left such heaps of stones as were accidentally complete in their balance on each other to stand erect and such as were not to fall flat on the surface of the hill in all the various positions in which they now appear accepting this theory as the right one it still seems strange that there should be only one cheesewring on the hillbut so it is plenty of rocks are to be seen there piled one on another but none of them are piled in the same extraordinary manner as the cheesewring which stands alone in its grandeur a curiosity that even science may wonder at a sight which is worth a visit to cornwall if cornwall presented nothing else to see  besides the astonishment which the rock scenery on the hill was calculated to excite we found in its neighbourhood an additional cause for surprise of a very different description just as we were preparing to ascend the eminence the silence of the great waste around us was broken by a long and hearty cheer the hurlers themselves if they had suddenly returned to a state of flesh and blood and resumed their interrupted game could hardly have made more noise or exhibited a greater joviality of disposition than did some three or four tradesmen of the town of liskeard who had been enjoying a picnic under the cheesewring had seen us approaching over the plain and now darted out of their ambush to welcome us flourishing porterbottles in their hands as olive branches of peace amity and goodwill my companion skilfully contrived to make his escape but i was stopped and surrounded in an instant one benevolent stranger held a glass in a very slanting position while a brother philanthropist violently uncorked a bottle and directed half of its contents in a magnificent jet of light brown froth all over everybody before he found the way into the tumbler it was of no use to decline imbibing the remainder of the light brown froththere was the cheesewring cried all the benevolent strangers in chorus and here was the porteri must drink all their good healths and they would all drink minethis was cornish hospitality and cornish hospitality was notoriously the finest thing in the world as for my friend there who was drawing they bore him no illwill because he wouldnt drinkthey would buy his drawing and one of the commercial gentlemen who was a stationer would publish a hundred two hundred five hundred a thousand copies of it on sheets of letterpaper price one penny what had i got to say to thatif that wasnt hospitality what the devil was  all this might have been very amusing and our new friends might have proved excellent companions under a different set of circumstances but as things were we neither of us felt at all sorry when their manners subsequently exhibited a slight change under the influence of further potations of porter soon they began to look stolid and suspicioussuddenly they discovered that we were not quite such good company as they had thought us at firstfinally they took their departure in solemn silence leaving us free at last to mount the hill and look out uninterruptedly on the glorious view from the summit which extended over a circumference of a hundred miles  turning our faces towards the northeast and standing now on the topmost rock of one of the most elevated situations in cornwall we were able to discern the sea on either side of us two faint lines of the softest haziest blue indicated the bristol channel on the one hand and the english channel on the other before us lay a wide region of downs and fields all mapped out in every variety of form by their different divisions of wall and hedgerowwhile farther away yet darker and more indefinite appeared the dartmoor forest and the dartmoor hills it was just that hour before the evening at which the atmosphere acquires a more mellow purity a more perfect serenity and warmth than at earlier periods of the day the shadows of great clouds lay in vast lovely shapes of purple blue over the whole visible tract of country contrasting in exquisite beauty with the sunny glimpses of landscape shining between them beneath us the picturesque confusion of rocks topped by the quaint form of the cheesewring seemed to fade away mysteriously into the grass of the moorland beyond which high up where the hills rose again a little lake called dosmery pool shone in the sunlight with dazzling diamond brightness in the opposite direction towards the west the immediate prospect was formed by the rugged granite ridges towering one behind the other of sharp torr and kilmarththe long hazy outlines of the plains and hilltops of southern and inland cornwall closing grandly the distant view  all that we had hitherto seen on and around the spot where we now stood had not yet exhausted its objects of attraction for strangers descending the rocks in a new direction after taking a last look at the noble prospect visible from their summit we proceeded to a particular spot near the base of the hill where the granite was scattered in remarkable abundance our purpose here was to examine some stones which are well known to all the quarrymen in the district as associated with an extraordinary story and an extraordinary man  during the earlier half of the last century there lived in one of the villages on the outskirts of the moor on which the cheesewring stands a stonecutter named daniel gumb this man was noted among his companions for his taciturn eccentric character and for his attachment to mathematical studies such leisure time as he had at his command he devoted to pondering over the problems of euclid he was always drawing mysterious complications of angles triangles and parallelograms on pieces of slate and on the blank leaves of such few books as he possessed but he made very slow progress in his studies poverty and hard work increased with the increase of his family and obliged him to give up his mathematics altogether he laboured early and laboured late he hacked and hewed at the hard material out of which he was doomed to cut a livelihood with unremitting diligence but times went so ill with him that in despair of ever finding them better he took a sudden resolution of altering his manner of living and retreating from the difficulties that he could not overcome he went to the hill on which the cheesewring stands and looked about among the rocks until he found some that had accidentally formed themselves into a sort of rude cavern he widened this recess he propped up a great wide slab to make its roof he cut out in a rock that rose above this what he called his bedrooma mere longitudinal slit in the stone the length and breadth of his body into which he could roll himself sideways when he wanted to enter it after he had completed this last piece of work he scratched the date of the year of his extraordinary labours 1735 on the rock and then removed his wife and family from their cottage and lodged them in the cavity he had madenever to return during his lifetime to the dwellings of men  here he lived and here he worked when he could get work he paid no rent now he wanted no furniture he struggled no longer to appear to the world as his equals appeared he required no more money than would procure for his family and himself the barest necessaries of life he suffered no interruptions from his fellowworkmen who thought him a madman and kept out of his way andmost precious privilege of his new positionhe could at last shorten his hours of labour and lengthen his hours of study with impunity having no temptations to spend money no hard demands of an inexorable landlord to answer he could now work with his brains as well as his hands he could toil at his problems scratching them upon the tops of rocks under the open sky amid the silence of the great moor henceforth nothing moved nothing depressed him the storms of winter rushed over his unsheltered dwelling but failed to dislodge him he taught his family to brave solitude and cold in the cavern among the rocks as he braved them in the cell that he had scooped out for his wife the roof of which has now fallen in some of his children died and others were born they point out the rock where he used to sit on calm summer evenings absorbed over his tattered copy of euclid a geometrical puzzle traced by his hand still appears on the stone when he died what became of his family no one can tell nothing more is known of him than that he never quitted the wild place of his exile that he continued to the day of his death to live contentedly with his wife and children amid a civilized nation under such a shelter as would hardly serve the first savage tribes of the most savage countryto live starving out poverty and want on a barren wild forsaking all things enduring all things for the love of knowledge which he could still nobly follow through trials and extremities without encouragement of fame or profit without vantage ground of station or wealth for its own dear sake beyond this nothing but conjecture is left the cell the bedplace the lines traced on the rocks the inscription of the year in which he hewed his habitation out of them are all the memorials that remain of daniel gumb  we lingered about the wild habitation of the stonemason and his family until sunset long shadows of rocks lay over the moor the breeze had freshened and was already growing chill when we set forth at last to trace our way back to liskeard it was too late now to think of proceeding on our journey and sleeping at the next town on our line of route  returning in a new direction we found ourselves once more walking on a high road just as the sun had gone down and the grey twilight was falling softly over the landscape stopping near a lonely farmhouse we went into a field to look at another old british monument to which our attention had been directed we saw a square stone columnnow broken into two piecesornamented with a curiously carved pattern and exhibiting an inscription cut in irregular mysterious characters those who have deciphered them have discovered that the column is nearly a thousand years old that it was raised as a sepulchral monument over the body of dungerth king of cornwall and that the letters carved on it form some latin words which may be thus translatedpray for the soul of dungerth seen in the dim light of the last quiet hour of evening there was something solemn and impressive about the appearance of the old tombstonesimple though it was after leaving it we soon entered once more into regions of fertility cottages cornfields and trees surrounded us again we passed through pleasant little valleys over brooks crossed by quaint wooden bridges up and down long lanes where tall hedges and clustering trees darkened the waywhere the stagbeetle flew slowly by winding his small but sullen horn and glowworms glimmered brightly in the long dewy grass by the roadside the moon rising at first red and dull in a misty sky brightened as we went on and lighted us brilliantly along all that remained of our nightwalk back to the town  i have only to add that when we arrived at liskeard the lachrymose landlady of the inn benevolently offered us for supper the identical piece of cold corned beef which she had offered us for dinner the day before and further proposed that we should feast at our ease in the private dungeon diningroom at the back of the house but one mode of escape was leftwe decamped at once to the large and comfortable hotel of the town and there our pleasant days pilgrimage to the moors of cornwall concluded as agreeably as it had begun  footnotes  1 i visited st cleers well for the second time ten years after the above lines were written and i am happy to say that two gentlemen interested in this beautiful ruin are about to restore itusing the old materials for the purpose and exactly following the original design march 1861     iv  cornish people   it is my purpose in this place to communicate some few facts relating to the social condition of the inhabitants of cornwall which were kindly furnished to me by friends on the spot adding to the statement thus obtained such anecdotes and illustrations of popular character as i collected from my own observations in the capacity of a tourist on foot  if the reader desires to compare at a glance the condition of the cornish people with the condition of their brethren in other parts of england one small particle of practical information will enable him to do so at once in the government tables of mortality for cornwall there are no returns of death from starvation  many causes combine to secure the poor of cornwall from that last worst consequence of poverty to which the poor in most of the other divisions of england are more or less exposed the number of inhabitants in the county is stated by the last census at 341269the number of square miles that they have to live on being 13272this will be found on proper computation and comparison to be considerably under the average population of a square mile throughout the rest of england thus the supply of men for all purposes does not appear to be greater than the demand in cornwall the remote situation of the county guarantees it against any considerable influx of strangers to compete with the natives for work on their own ground we met a farmer there who was so far from being besieged in harvest time by claimants for labour on his land that he was obliged to go forth to seek them himself at a neighbouring town and was doubtful whether he should find men enough left him unemployed at the mines and the fisheries to gather in his crops in good time at two shillings a day and as much victuals and drink as they cared to have  another cause which has contributed in some measure to keep cornwall free from the burthen of a surplus population of working men must not be overlooked emigration has been more largely resorted to in that county than perhaps in any other in england out of the population of the penzance union alone nearly five per cent left their native land for australia or new zealand in 1849 the potatoblight was at that time assigned as the chief cause of the readiness to emigrate for it damaged seriously the growth of a vegetable from the sale of which at the london markets the cornish agriculturalists derived large profits and on which with their fish the cornish poor depend as a staple article of food  it is by the mines and fisheries of both of which i shall speak particularly in another place that cornwall is compensated for a soil too barren in many parts of the county to be ever well cultivated except at such an expenditure of capital as no mere farmer can afford from the inexhaustible mineral treasures in the earth and from the equally inexhaustible shoals of pilchards which annually visit the coast the working population of cornwall derive their regular means of support where agriculture would fail them at the mines the regular rate of wages is from forty to fifty shillings a month but miners have opportunities of making more than this by what is termed working on tribute that is agreeing to excavate the mineral lodes for a per centage on the value of the metal they raise some of them have been known to make as much as six and even ten pounds each in a month when they are unlucky in their working speculations or perhaps thrown out of employment altogether by the shutting up of a mine they still have a fair opportunity of obtaining farm labour which is paid for out of harvest time at the rate of nine shillings a week but this is a resource of which they are rarely obliged to take advantage a plot of common ground is included with the cottages that are let to them and the cultivation of this helps to keep them and their families in bad times until they find an opportunity of resuming work when they may perhaps make as much in one month as an agricultural labourer can in twelve  the fisheries not only employ all the inhabitants of the coast but in the pilchard season many of the farm workpeople as well ten thousand personsmen women and childrenderive their regular support from the fisheries which are so amazingly productive that the drift or deepsea fishing in mounts bay alone is calculated to realize on the average 30000l per annum  to the employment thus secured for the poor in the mines and fisheries is to be added as an advantage the cheapness of rent and living in cornwall good cottages are let at from fifty shillings to between three and four pounds ayearturf for firing grows in plenty on the vast tracts of common land overspreading the countryall sorts of vegetables are abundant and cheap with the exception of potatoes which so decreased in 1849 in consequence of the disease that the winter stock was imported from france belgium and holland the early potatoes however grown in may and june are cultivated in large quantities and realize on exportation a very high price corn generally sells a little above the average fish is always within the reach of the poorest people in a good season a dozen pilchards are sold for one penny happily for themselves the poor in cornwall do not partake the senseless prejudice against fish so obstinately adhered to by the poor in many other parts of england a cornishmans national pride is in his pilchardshe likes to talk of them and boast about them to strangers and with reason for he depends for the main support of life on the tribute of these little fish which the sea yields annually in almost countless shoals  the workhouse system in cornwall is said by those who are well qualified to form an opinion on the subject to be generally well administered the unions in the eastern part of the county being the least stringent in their regulations and the most liberal in giving outofdoor relief  such briefly but i think not incorrectly stated is the condition of the poor in cornwall in relation to their means of subsistence as a class looking to the fact that the number of labourers there is not too much for the labour comparing the rate of wages with rent and the price of provisions setting the natural advantages of the county fairly against its natural disadvantages it is impossible not to conclude that the cornish poor suffer less by their poverty and enjoy more opportunities of improving their social position than the majority of their brethren in many other counties of england the general demeanour and language of the people themselves amply warrant this conclusion the cornish are essentially a cheerful contented race the views of the working men are remarkably moderate and sensiblei never met with so few grumblers anywhere  my opportunities of correctly estimating the state of education among the people were not sufficiently numerous to justify me in offering to the reader more than a mere opinion on the subject such few observations as i was able to make inclined me to think that in education the mass of the population was certainly below the average in england with one exceptionthat of the classes employed in the mines all of these men with whom i held any communication would not have been considered badlyinformed persons in a higher condition of life they possessed much more than a common mechanical knowledge of their own calling and even showed a very fair share of information on the subject of the history and antiquities of their native county as usual the agricultural inhabitants appeared to rank lowest in the scale of education and general intelligence among this class and among the fishermen the strong superstitious feelings of the ancient days of cornwall still survive and promise long to remain handed down from father to son as heirlooms of tradition gathered together in a remote period and venerable in virtue of their antiquity the notion for instance that no wound will fester as long as the instrument by which it was inflicted is kept bright and clean still prevails extensively among them but a short time since a boy in cornwall was placed under the care of a medical man who related the anecdote to me for a wound in the back from a pitchfork his relativescottagers of respectabilityfirmly believe that his cure was accelerated by the pains they took to keep the prongs of the pitchfork in a state of the highest polish night and day throughout the whole period of his illness and down to the last hour of his complete restoration to health  another and a more remarkable instance of the superstitions prevailing among the least educated classes of the people was communicated to me by the same informanta gentleman whose life had been passed in cornwall and who was highly and deservedly respected by all those among whom he resided3  a small farmer living in one of the most western districts of the county died some years back of what was supposed at the time to be english cholera a few weeks after his decease his wife married again this circumstance excited some attention in the neighbourhood it was remembered that the woman had lived on very bad terms with her late husband that she had on many occasions exhibited strong symptoms of possessing a very vindictive temper and that during the farmers lifetime she had openly manifested rather more than a platonic preference for the man whom she subsequently married suspicion was generally excited people began to doubt whether the first husband had died fairly at length the proper order was applied for and his body was disinterred on examination enough arsenic to have poisoned three men was found in his stomach the wife was accused of murdering him was tried convicted on the clearest evidence and hanged very shortly after she had suffered capital punishment horrible stories of a ghost were widely circulated certain people declared that they had seen a ghastly resemblance of the murderess robed in her windingsheet with the black mark of the rope round her swollen neck standing on stormy nights upon her husbands grave and digging there with a spade in hideous imitation of the actions of the men who had disinterred the corpse for medical examination this was fearful enoughnobody dared go near the place after nightfall but soon another circumstance was talked of in connexion with the poisoner which affected the tranquillity of peoples minds in the village where she had lived and where it was believed she had been born more seriously than even the ghoststory itself  near the church of this village there was a well celebrated among the peasantry of the district for one remarkable propertyevery child baptized in its water with which the church was duly supplied on christening occasions was secure from ever being hanged no one doubted that all the babies fortunate enough to be born and baptized in the parish though they might live to the age of methuselah and might during that period commit all the capital crimes recorded in the newgate calendar were still destined to keep quite clear of the summary jurisdiction of jack ketchno one doubted this until the story of the apparition of the murderess began to be spread abroad then awful misgivings arose in the popular mind a woman who had been born close by the magical well and who had therefore in all probability been baptized in its water like her neighbours of the parish had nevertheless been publicly and unquestionably hanged however probability was not always trutheverybody determined that the baptismal register of the poisoner should be sought for and that it should be thus officially ascertained whether she had been christened with the well water or not after much trouble the important document was discoverednot where it was first looked after but in a neighbouring parish vestry a mistake had been made about the womans birthplaceshe had not been baptized in the local church and had therefore not been protected by the marvellous virtue of the local water unutterable was the joy and triumph of this discovery throughout the villagethe wonderful character of the parish well was wonderfully vindicatedits celebrity immediately spread wider than ever the peasantry of the neighbouring districts began to send for the renowned water before christenings and many of them actually continue to this day to bring it corked up in bottles to their churches and to beg particularly that it may be used whenever they present their children to be baptized  such instances of superstition as thisand others equally true might be quotedafford perhaps of themselves the best evidence of the low state of education among the people from whom they are produced it is however only fair to state that children in cornwall are now enabled to partake of advantages which were probably not offered to their parents good national schools are in operation everywhere and areas far as my own inquiries authorize me to reportwell attended by pupils recruited from the ranks of the poorest classes  of the social qualities of the cornish all that can be written may be written conscientiously in terms of the highest praise travelling as my companion and i didin a manner which whatever it may be now was ten years since perfectly new to the majority of the peoplewe found constant opportunities of studying the popular character in its every day aspects we perplexed some we amused others here we were welcomed familiarly by the people as travelling pedlars with our packs on our backs there we were curiously regarded at an awful distance and respectfully questioned in circumlocutory phrases as to our secret designs in walking through the country thus viewing us sometimes as their equals sometimes as mysteriously superior to them the peasantry unconsciously exhibited many of their most characteristic peculiarities without reserve we looked at the spectacle of their social life from the most searching point of view for we looked at it from behind the scenes  the manners of the cornish of all ranks down to the lowest are remarkably distinguished by courtesya courtesy of that kind which is quite independent of artificial breeding and which proceeds solely from natural motives of kindness and from an innate anxiety to please few of the people pass you without a salutation civil questions are always answered civilly no propensity to jeer at strangers is exhibitedon the contrary great solicitude is displayed to afford them any assistance that they may require and displayed moreover without the slightest appearance of a mercenary motive thus if you stop to ask your way you are not merely directed for a mile or two on and then told to ask again but directed straight to the end of your destination no matter how far off turnings to the right and turnings to the left short cuts across moors five miles away churches that you must keep on this hand and rocks that you must keep on that are impressed upon your memory with the most laborious minuteness and shouted after you over and over again as long as you are within hearing if the utmost anxiety to give the utmost quantity of good advice could always avail against accident or forgetfulness no traveller in cornwall who asks his way as he goes need ever lose himself  when people possess the virtue of natural courtesy they are seldom found wanting in other higher virtues that are akin to it household affection ready hospitality and great gratitude for small rewards of services rendered are all to be found among the cornish peasantry their fondness for their children is very pleasant to see a word of inquiry or praise addressed to the mother makes her face glow with delight and sends her away at once in search of the missing members of her little family who are ranged before you triumphantly with smoothed hair and carefully wiped faces ready to be reviewed in a row both father and mother often wish you at parting a good wife and a large family if you are not married already just as they wish you a pleasant journey and a prosperous return home again  of cornish hospitality we experienced many proofs one of which may be related as a sample arriving late at a village in the far west of the county we found some difficulty in arousing the people of the inn while we were waiting at the door we heard a man who lived in a cottage near at hand and of whom we had asked our way on the road inquiring of some female member of his family whether she could make up a spare bed we had met this man proceeding in our direction and had so far outstripped him in walking that we had been waiting outside the inn about a quarter of an hour before he got home when the woman answered his question in the negative he directed her to put clean sheets on his own bed and then came out to tell us that if we failed to obtain admission at the publichouse a lodging for the night was ready for us under his own roof we found on inquiry afterwards that he had looked out of window after getting home while we were still disturbing the village by a continuous series of assaults on the inn door had recognised us in the moonlight and had thereupon not only offered us his bed but had got out of it himself to do so when we finally succeeded in gaining admittance to the inn he declined an invitation to sup with us and wishing us a good nights rest returned to his home i should mention at the same time that another bed was offered to us at the vicarage by the clergyman of the parish and that after this gentleman had himself seen that we were properly accommodated by our landlady he left us with an invitation to breakfast with him the next morning thus is hospitality practised in cornwalla county where it must be remembered a stranger is doubly a stranger in relation to provincial sympathies where the national feeling is almost entirely merged in the local feeling where a man speaks of himself as cornish in much the same spirit as a welshman speaks of himself as welsh  in like manner another instance drawn from my own experience will best display the anxiety which we found generally testified by the cornish poor to make the best and most grateful return in their power for anything which they considered as a favour kindly bestowed such little anecdotes as i here relate in illustration of popular character cannot i think be considered trifling for it is by trifles after all that we gain our truest appreciation of the marking signs of good or evil in the dispositions of our fellowbeings just as in the beating of a single artery under the touch we discover an indication of the strength or weakness of the whole vital frame  on the granite cliffs at the lands end i met with an old man seventytwo years of age of whom i asked some questions relative to the extraordinary rocks scattered about this part of the coast he immediately opened his whole budget of local anecdotes telling them in a quavering hightreble voice which was barely audible above the dash of the breakers beneath and the fierce whistling of the wind among the rocks around us however the old fellow went on talking incessantly hobbling along before me up and down steep paths and along the very brink of a fearful precipice with as much coolness as if his sight was as clear and his step as firm as in his youth when he had shown me all that he could show and had thoroughly exhausted himself with talking i gave him a shilling at parting he appeared to be perfectly astonished by a remuneration which the reader will doubtless consider the reverse of excessive thanked me at the top of his voice and then led me in a great hurry and with many mysterious nods and gestures to a hollow in the grass where he had spread on a clean pockethandkerchief a little stockintrade of his own consisting of barnacles bits of rock and ore and specimens of dried seaweed pointing to these he told me to take anything i liked as a present in return for what i had given him he would not hear of my buying anything he was not he said a regular guide and i had paid him more already than such an old man was worthwhat i took out of his handkerchief i must take as a present only i saw by his manner that he would be really mortified if i contested the matter with him so as a present i received one of his pieces of rocki had no right to deny him the pleasure of doing a kind action because there happened to be a few more shillings in my pocket than in his  nothing can be much better adapted to show how simple and unsophisticated the cornish character still remains in many respects than cornish notions of organizing a public festival and cornish enjoyment of that festival when it is organized we had already seen how they managed a public boatrace at looe and we saw again how they conducted the preparations for the same popular festival on a larger scale at the coast town of fowey  in the first place the dormant public enthusiasm was stimulated by music at an uncomfortably early hour in the morning two horn players and a clarionet player a fat musician who blew through a very small fife and kept time with his head and a withered little man who beat furiously on a mighty drumdrew up in martial array one behind the other before the principal inn two boys staring about them in a stolidly important manner and carrying flags which bore a suspicious resemblance to india pocket handkerchiefs sewn together formed in front of the musicians two corpulent solemn elderly gentlemen in black belonging apparently to the churchwardentype of the human species formed in their turn on each side of the boysand then the procession started walking briskly up and down and in and out and round and round the same streets over and over again the musicians playing on all their instruments at once drum included without a moments intermission on the part of any one of them nothing could exceed the gravity and silence of the popular concourse which followed this grotesque procession the solemn composure on the countenances of the two corpulent civil officers who went before it was reflected on the features of the smallest boy who followed humbly behind profound musical amateurs in attendance at a classical quartet concert could have exhibited no graver or more breathless attention than that displayed by the inhabitants of fowey as they marched at the heels of the peripatetic town band  but while the music was proceeding another adjunct to the dignity of the festival was in course of preparation which appealed more strongly to popular sympathy even than the band and procession a quantity of young treesmiserable little saplings cut short in their early infancywere brought into the town curiously sharpened at the stems holes were rapidly drilled in the ground here there and everywhere for their reception at corners of house walls while men outside set them up women in a high state of excitement appeared at firstfloor windows with long pieces of string which they fastened to the branches to steady the trees at the top hauling them about this way and that most unmercifully during the operation and then vanishing to tie the loose ends of the lines to bars of grates and legs of tables mazes of long tight strings ran all across our room at the inn broken twigs and drooping leaves peered in sadly at us through the three windows that lighted it we were driven about from corner to corner out of the way of this rigging by an imperious old woman who fastened and fettered the wretched trees with as fierce an air as if they were criminals whom she was handcuffing and who at last fairly told us that she thought we had better leave the room and see how beautiful things looked from the outside on obeying this intimation we found that the trees had absorbed the whole public attention to themselves the band marched by playing furiously but the boys deserted it the people from the country hastening into the town hot and eager paused reckless of the music reckless of the flags reckless of the procession to look forth upon the streets with verdure clad the popularity of the sons of apollo was a thing of the past already nothing can well be imagined more miserably ugly than the appearance of the trees standing strung into unnatural positions and looking half dead already but they evidently inspired the liveliest public satisfaction women returned to the windows to give a last perfecting tug to their branches men patted approvingly with spades the loose earth round their stems spectators one by one took a near view and a distant view and then walked gently by and took an occasional view and lastly gathered together in little groups and took a general view as connoisseurs look at their pictures as mothers look at their children as lovers look at their mistressesso did the people of fowey assemble with one accord and look at their trees  after all however i shall perhaps best illustrate the simplicity of character displayed by the cornish countrypeople if i leave the less amusing preparations for inaugurating the fowey boatrace untold and describe some of the peculiarities of behaviour and remark which the appearance of my companion and myself called forth in all parts of cornwall the mere sight of two strangers walking with such appendages as knapsacks strapped on their shoulders seemed of itself to provoke the most unbounded wonder we were stared at with almost incredible pertinacity and good humour people hard at work left off to look at us while groups congregated at cottage doors walked into the middle of the road when they saw us approach looked at us in front from that commanding point of view until we passed them and then wheeled round with one accord and gazed at us behind as long as we were within sight little children ran indoors to bring out large children as we drew near farmers overtaking us on horseback pulled in and passed at a walk to examine us at their ease with the exception of bedridden people and people in prison i believe that the whole population of cornwall looked at us all overback view and front viewfrom head to foot  this staring was nowhere accompanied either on the part of young or old by a jeering word or an impertinent look we evidently astonished the people but we never tempted them to forget their natural goodnature forbearance and selfrestraint on our side the attentive scrutiny to which we were subjected was at first not a little perplexing it was difficult not to doubt occasionally whether some unpleasantly remarkable change had not suddenly taken place in our personal appearancewhether we might not have turned green or blue on our travels or have got noses as long as the preposterous nose of the traveller through strasburgh in the tale of slawkenbergius it was not until we had been some days in the county that we began to discover by some such indications as the following that we owed the public attention to our knapsacks and not to ourselves  we enter a small publichouse by the roadside to get a draught of beer in the kitchen we behold the landlord and a tall man who is a customer both stare as a matter of course the tall man especially after taking one look at our knapsacks fixes his eyes firmly on us and sits bolt upright on the bench without saying a wordhe is evidently prepared for the worst we can do we get into conversation with the landlord a jovial talkative fellow who desires greatly to know what we are if we have no objection we ask him what he thinks we arewell says the landlord pointing to my friends knapsack which has a square ruler strapped to it for architectural drawingwell i think you are both of you mappersmappers who come here to make new roadsyou may be coming to make a railroad i dare sayweve had mappers in the country before thisi know a mapper myselfheres both your good healths we drink the landlords good health in return and disclaim the honour of being mappers we walk through the country we tell him for pleasure alone and take any roads we can get without wanting to make new ones the landlord would like to know if that is the case why we carry those weights at our backsbecause we want to take our luggage about with us couldnt we pay to rideyes we could and yet we like walking betteryes we do this last answer utterly confounds the tall customer who has been hitherto listening intently to the dialogue it is evidently too much for his credulityhe pays his reckoning and walks out in a hurry without uttering a word the landlord appears to be convinced but it is only in appearance we leave him standing at his door keeping his eye on us as long as we are in sight still evidently persuaded that we are mappers but mappers of a bad order whose presence is fraught with some unknown peril to the security of the queens highway  we get on into another district here public opinion is not flattering some of the groups gathered together in the road to observe us begin to speculate on our characters before we are quite out of hearing then this sort of dialogue spoken in serious subdued tones just reaches us questionwhat can they be answertrodgers  this is particularly humiliating because it happens to be true we certainly do trudge and are therefore properly though rather unceremoniously called trudgers or trodgers but we sink to a lower depth yet a little further on we are viewed as objects for pity it is a fine evening we stop and lean against a bank by the roadside to look at the sunset an old woman comes tottering by on high pattens very comfortably and nicely clad she sees our knapsacks and instantly stops in front of us and begins to moan lamentably not understanding at first what this means we ask respectfully if she feels at all ill ah poor fellows poor fellows she sighs in answer obliged to carry all your baggage on your own backsvery hard poor lads very hard indeed and the good old soul goes away groaning over our evil plight and mumbling something which sounds very like an assurance that she has got no money to give us  in another part of the county we rise again gloriously in worldly consideration we pass a cottage a woman looks out after us over the low garden wall and rather hesitatingly calls us back i approach her first and am thus saluted if you please sir what have you got to sell again an old man meets us on the road stops cheerfully taps our knapsacks with his stick and says aha youre tradesmen eh things to sell i say have you got any tea pronounced tay ill buy some tay further on we approach a group of miners breaking ore as we pass by we hear one asking amazedly what have they got to sell in those things on their backs and another answering in the prompt tones of a guesser who is convinced that he guesses right guineapigs  it is unfortunately impossible to convey to the reader an adequate idea by mere description of the extraordinary gravity of manner the looks of surprise and the tones of conviction which accompanied these various popular conjectures as to our calling and station in life and which added immeasurably at the time to their comic effect curiously enough whenever they took the form of questions any jesting in returning an answer never seemed either to be appreciated or understood by the country people serious replies shared much the same fate as jokes everybody asked whether we could pay for riding and nobody believed that we preferred walking if we could so we soon gave up the idea of affording any information at all and walked through the country comfortably as mappers trodgers tradesmen guineapigmongers and poor backburdened vagabond lads altogether or one at a time just as the peasantry pleased  i have not communicated to the reader all the conjectures formed about us for the simple reason that many of them when they ran to any length were by no means so intelligible as could be desired it will readily be imagined that in a county which had a language of its own something similar to the welsh down to the time of edward vi if not laterin a county where this language continued to be spoken among the humbler classes until nearly the end of the seventeenth century and where it still gives their names to men places and implementssome remnants of it must attach themselves to the dialect of english now spoken by the lower orders this is enough of itself to render cornish talk not very easy to be understood by ordinary strangers but the difficulty of comprehending it is still further increased by the manner in which the people speak they pronounce rapidly and indistinctly often running separate syllables into one another through a sentence until the whole sounds like one long fragmentary word to the student in philology a series of conversations with the cornish poor would i imagine afford ample matter for observation of the most interesting kind some of their expressions have a character that is quite patriarchal young men for instance are addressed by their elders as my soneverything eatable either for man or beast is commonly denominated meat  it may be expected before i close this hasty sketch of the cornish people that i should touch on the dark side of the pictureunfinished though it iswhich i have endeavoured to draw but i have nothing to communicate on the subject of offences in cornwall beyond a few words about wrecking and smuggling  opinions have been divided among wellinformed persons as to the truth or falsehood of those statements of travellers and historians which impute the habitual commission of outrages and robberies on sufferers by shipwreck to the cornish of former generations without entering into this question of the past which can only be treated as a matter for discussion i am happy in proceeding at once to the present to be able to state as a matter of fact that wrecking is a crime unknown in the cornwall of our day so far from maltreating shipwrecked persons the inhabitants of the seashore risk their lives to save them i make this assertion on the authority of a gentleman whose life has been passed in the west of cornwall whose avocations take him much among the poor of all ranks and characters and who has himself seen wrecked sailors rescued from death by the courage and humanity of the population of the coast  in reference to smuggling many years have passed without one of those fatal encounters between smugglers and revenue officers which in other days gave a dark and fearful character to the contraband trade in cornwall so well is the coast watched that no smuggling of any consequence can now take place it is only the oldest cornish men who can give you any account from personal experience of adventures in running a cargo and those that i heard described were by no means of the romantic or interesting order  beyond this i have nothing further to relate regarding criminal matters it may not unreasonably be doubted whether a subject so serious and so extensive as the statistics of crime is not out of the scope of a book like the present whose only object is to tell a simple fireside story which may amuse an idle or solace a mournful hour moreover remembering the assistance and the kindness that my companion and i met with throughout cornwalland those only who have travelled on foot can appreciate how much the enjoyment of exploring a country may be heightened or decreased according to the welcome given to the stranger by the inhabitantsremembering too that we walked late at night through districts inhabited only by the roughest and poorest classes entirely unmolested and that we trusted much on many occasions to the honesty of the people and never found cause to repent our trusti cannot but feel that it would be an ungracious act to ransack newspapers and reports to furnish materials for recording in detail the vices of a population whom i have only personally known by their virtues let you and i reader leave off with the same pleasant impressions of the cornish peopleyou whose only object is to hear and i whose only object is to tell the story of a holiday walk there is enough to be found in them that is good amply to justify a little inattention to whatever we may discover that is bad  footnotes  2 it may be necessary to remind the reader that this statement respecting the population of cornwall was written in the year 1850 i have no means at my disposal of ascertaining what the increase in numbers may have been during the last ten yearsmarch 1861  3 the gentleman here referred towhose kind assistance while i was writing these pages i can never forgetwas mr richard moyle long resident as a medical man at penzance since my first visit to cornwall death has removed mr moyle from the scene of his labours to the lasting and sincere regret of all who knew himmarch 1861     v  loopool   now i think it very much amiss remarks sterne in tristram shandy that a man cannot go quietly through a town and let it alone when it does not meddle with him but that he must be turning about and drawing his pen at every kennel he crosses over merely o my conscience for the sake of drawing it i quote this wise and witty observation on a bad practice of some travelwriters as containing the best reason that i can give the reader for transporting him at once over some sixty miles of cornish highroads and footpaths without stopping to drop one word of description by the way having left off the record of our travels at liskeard and taking it up againas i mean to do hereat helston i skip over five intermediate markettowns and two large villages with a mere dash of the pen lostwithiel fowey st austell grampound probus truro falmouth are all places of mark and note and have all certain curiosities and sights of their own to interest the inquisitive tourist but nevertheless not one of them meddled with me in the course of my rambles and acting on sternes excellent principle i purpose letting them alone now in other words the several towns and villages that i have enumerated though presenting much that was generally picturesque and attractive in the way of old buildings and pretty scenery exhibited little that was distinctive or original in character produced therefore rather pleasant than vivid impressions and would by no means suggest any very original series of descriptions to fill the pages of a book which is confined to such subjects only as are most exclusively and strikingly cornish  the town of helston where we now halt for the first time since we left the cheesewring and st cleers well might if tested by its own merits alone be passed over as unceremoniously as the towns already passed over before it its principal recommendation in the opinion of the inhabitants appeared to be that it was the residence of several very genteel families who have certainly not communicated much of their gentility to the lower orders of the populationa riotous and drunken set the only bad specimens of cornish people that i met with in cornwall the streets of helston are a trifle larger and a trifle duller than the streets of liskeard the church is comparatively modern in date and superlatively ugly in design a miserable altarpiece daubed in gaudy colours on the window above the communiontable is the only approach to any attempt at embellishment in the interior in short the town has nothing to offer to attract the stranger but a public festivala sort of barbarous carnivalheld there annually on the 8th of may this festival is said to be of very ancient origin and is called the furryan old cornish word signifying a gathering and at helston particularly a gathering in celebration of the return of spring the furry begins early in the morning with singing to an accompaniment of drums and kettles all the people in the town immediately leave off work and scamper into the country having reached which they scamper back again garlanded with leaves and flowers and caper about handinhand through the streets and in and out of all the houses without let or hindrance even the genteel resident families allow themselves to be infected with the general madness and wind up the days capering consistently enough by a nights capering at a grand ball a full account of these extraordinary absurdities may be found in polwheles history of cornwall  but though thus uninteresting in itself helston must be visited by every tourist in cornwall for the sake of the grand the almost unrivalled scenery to be met with near it the town is not only the best startingpoint from which to explore the noble line of coast rocks which ends at the lizard head but possesses the further recommendation of lying in the immediate vicinity of the largest lake in cornwallloo pool  the banks of loo pool stretch on either side to the length of two miles the lake which in summer occupies little more than half the space that it covers in winter is formed by the flow of two or three small streams you first reach it from helston after a walk of half a mile and then see before you on either hand long ranges of hills rising gently from the waters edge covered with clustering trees or occupied by wide cornfields and sloping tracts of common land so far the scenery around loo pool resembles the scenery around other lakes but as you proceed the view changes in the most striking and extraordinary manner walking on along the winding banks of the pool you taste the water and find it soft and fresh you see ducks swimming about in it from the neighbouring farmhouses you watch the rising of the fine trout for which it is celebratedevery object tends to convince you that you are wandering by the shores of an inland lakewhen suddenly at a turn in the hill slope you are startled by the shrill cry of the gull and the fierce roar of breakers thunders on your earyou look over the light grey waters of the lake and behold stretching immediately above and beyond them the expanse of the deep blue ocean from which they are only separated by a strip of smooth white sand  you hurry on and reach this bar of sand which parts the great english channel and the little loo poola child might run across it in a minute you stand in the centre on one side close at hand water is dancing beneath the breeze in glassy tiny ripples on the other equally close water rolls in mighty waves precipitated on the ground in dashing hissing writhing floods of the whitest foamhere children are floating mimic boats on a mimic sea there the stateliest ships of england are sailing over the great deepboth scenes visible in one view rocky cliffs and arid sands appear in close combination with rounded fertile hills and long grassy slopes salt spray leaping over the first springwater lying calm beneath the last no fairy vision of nature that ever was imagined is more fantastic or more lovely than this glorious reality which brings all the most widely contrasted characteristics of a sea view and an inland view into the closest contact and presents them in one harmonious picture to the eye  the ridge of sand between loo pool and the sea which by impeding the flow of the inland streams spreads them in the form of a lake over the valleyground between two hills is formed by the action of storms from the southwest such at least is the modern explanation of the manner in which loo bar has been heaped up but there is an ancient legend in connexion with it which tells a widely different story  it is said that the terrible cornish giant or ogre tregeagle was trudging homewards one day carrying a huge sack of sand on his back whichbeing a giant of neat and cleanly habitshe designed should serve him for sprinkling his parlour floor as he was passing along the top of the hills which now overlook loo pool he heard a sound of scampering footsteps behind him and turning round saw that he was hotly pursued by no less a person than the devil himself big as he was tregeagle lost heart and ignominiously took to his heels but the devil ran nimbly ran steadily ran without losing breathran in short like the devil tregeagle was fat shortwinded had a load on his back and lost ground at every step at last just as he reached the seaward extremity of the hills he determined in despair to lighten himself of his burden and thus to seize the only chance of escaping his enemy by superior fleetness of foot accordingly he opened his huge sack in a great hurry shook out all his sand over the precipice between the sea and the river which then ran into it and so formed in a moment the bar of loo pool  in the winter time the lake is the cause and the scene of an extraordinary ceremony the heavy incessant rains which then fall ice is almost unknown in the moist climate of cornwall increase day by day the waters of the pool until they encroach over the whole of the low flat valley between helston and the sea then the smooth paths of turf the little streams that run by their sideso pleasant to look on in the summer timeare hidden by the great overflow millwheels are stopped cottages built on the declivities of the hill are threatened with inundation out on the bar at high tide but two or three feet of sand appear between the stormy sea on the one hand and the stagnant swollen lake on the other if loo pool were measured now it would be found to extend to a circumference of seven miles  when the flooding of the lake has reached its climax the millers who are the principal sufferers by the overflow prepare to cut a passage through the bar for the superabundant waters of the pool before they can do this however they must conform to a curious old custom which has been practised for centuries and is retained down to the present day procuring two stout leathern purses they tie up three halfpence in each and then set off with them in a body to the lord of the manor presenting him with their purses they state their case with all due formality and request permission to cut their trench through the sand in consideration of the threepenny recognition of his rights the lord of the manor graciously accedes to the petition and the millers armed with their spades and shovels start for the bar  their projected labour is of the slightest kind a mere ditch suffices to establish the desired communication and the water does the rest for itself on one occasion so high was the tide on one side and so full the lake on the other that a man actually scraped away sand enough with his stick to give vent to the waters of the pool thus after no very hard work the millers achieve their object and the spectators watching on the hill behold a startling and magnificent scene  tearing away the sand on either side floods of fresh water rush out furiously against floods of salt water leaping in upheaved into mighty waves by the winter gale a foaming roaring battle between two opposing forces of the same element takes place the noise is terrificit is heard like thunder at great distances off at last the heavy smooth continuous flow of the fresh water prevails even over the power of the ocean farther and farther out rushing through a wider and wider channel every minute pour the great floods from the land until the salt water is stained with an ochre colour over a surface of twenty miles but their force is soon spent soon the lake sinks lower and lower away from the slope of the hills then with the high tide the sea reappears triumphantly dashing and leaping in clouds of spray through the channel in the sandmaking the waters of the pool brackishnow threatening to swell them anew to overflowingand now at the ebb leaving them to empty themselves again in the manner of a great tidal river no new change takes place until a storm from the southwest comes on and then fresh masses of sand and shingle are forced upthe channel is refilledthe bar is reconstructed as if by a miracle again the scene resumes its old featuresagain there is a sea on one side and a lake on the other but now the pool occupies only its ordinary limitsnow the millwheels turn busily once more and the smooth paths and gliding streams reappear in their former beauty until the next winter rains shall come round and the next winter floods shall submerge them again  at the time when i visited the lake its waters were unusually low here they ran calm and shallow into little glassy flowery creeks that looked like fairies bathing places there out in the middle they hardly afforded depth enough for a duck to swim in near to the bar however they spread forth wider and deeper finely contrasted in their dun colour and perfect repose with the flashing foaming breakers on the other side the surf forbade all hope of swimming but standing where the spent waves ran up deepest and where the spray flew highest before the wind i could take a natural showerbath from the sea in one direction and the next moment turning round in the other could wash the sand off my feet luxuriously in the soft fresh waters of loo pool     vi  the lizard   we had waited throughout one long rainy day at helstonremote unfriended melancholy slowfor a chance of finer weather before we started to explore the lizard promontory but our patience availed us little the next morning there was the soft thick misty cornish rain still falling just as it had already fallen without cessation for twentyfour hours to wait longer in perfect inactivity and in the dullest of townsdoubtful whether the sky would clear even in a weeks timewas beyond mortal endurance we shouldered our knapsacks and started for the lizard in defiance of rain and in defiance of our landladys reiterated assertions that we should lose our way in the mist when we walked inland and should slip into invisible holes and fall over fogveiled precipices among the rocks if we ventured to approach the coast  what sort of scenery we walked through i am unable to say the rain was abovethe mud was belowthe mist was all around us the few objects near at hand that we did now and then see dripped with wet and had a shadowy visionary look sometimes we met a forlorn cow steaming composedly by the roadsideor an old horse standing up to his fetlocks in mire and sneezing vociferouslyor a goodhumoured peasant who directed us on our road and informed us with a grin that this sort of fine rain often lasted for a fortnight sometimes we passed little villages built in damp holes where trees cottages women scampering backwards and forwards peevishly on domestic errands big boys with empty sacks over their heads and shoulders gossiping gloomily against barn walls and illconditioned pigs grunting for admission at closed kitchen doors all looked soaked through and through together nothing in short could be more dreary and comfortless than our walk for the first two hours but after that as we approached lizard town the clouds began to part to seaward layer after layer of mist drove past us rolling before the wind peeps of faint greenishblue sky appeared and enlarged apace by the time we had arrived at our destination a white watery sunlight was falling over the wet landscape the prognostications of our cornish friends were pleasantly falsified a fine day was in store for us after all  the man who first distinguished the little group of cottages that we now looked on by the denomination of lizard town must have possessed magnificent ideas indeed on the subject of nomenclature if the place looked like anything in the world it looked like a large collection of farm outbuildings without a farmhouse muddy little lanes intersecting each other at every possible angle rickety little cottages turned about to all the points of the compass ducks geese cocks hens pigs cows horses dunghills puddles sheds peatstacks timber nets seemed to be all indiscriminately huddled together where there was little or no room for them to find the inn amid this confusion of animate and inanimate objects was no easy matter and when we at length discovered it pushed our way through the live stock in the garden and opened the kitchen door this was the scene which burst instantaneously on our view  we beheld a small room literally full of babies and babies mothers interesting infants of the tenderest possible age draped in long clothes and short clothes and shawls and blankets met the eye wherever it turned we saw babies propped up uncomfortably on the dresser babies rocking snugly in wicker cradles babies stretched out flat on their backs on womens knees babies prone on the floor toasting before a slow fire every one of these cornish cherubs was crying in every variety of vocal key every one of their affectionate parents was talking at the top of her voice every one of their little elder brothers was screaming squabbling and tumbling down in the passage with prodigious energy and spirit the mothers of englandand they onlycan imagine the deafening and composite character of the noise which this large family party produced to describe it is impossible  ere long while we looked on it the domestic scene began to change even as porters policemen and workmen of all sorts gathered together on the line of rails at a station move aside quickly and with one accord out of the way of the heavy engine slowly starting on its journeyso did the congregated mothers in the inn kitchen now move back on either hand with their babies and clear a path for the great bulk of the hostess leisurely advancing from the fireside to greet us at the door from this most corpulent and complaisant of women we received a hearty welcome and a full explanation of the family orgies that were taking place under her roof the great public meeting of all the babies in lizard town and the neighbouring villages on which we had intruded had been convened by the local doctor who had got down from london what the landlady termed a lot of fine fresh matter and was now about to strike a decisive blow at the smallpox by vaccinating all the babies he could lay his hands on at one fell swoop the surgical ceremonies were expected to begin in a few minutes  this last piece of information sent us out of the house without a moments delay the sunlight had brightened gloriously since we had last beheld itthe rain was overthe mist was gone but a short distance before us rose the cliffs at the lizard headthe southernmost land in englandand to this point we now hastened as the fittest spot from which to start on our rambles along the coast  on our way thither short as it was we observed a novelty in the south and west of cornwall the footpaths instead of leading through or round the fields are all on the top of the thick stone wallssome four feet highwhich divide them this curious arrangement for walking gives a startling and picturesque character to the figures of the country people when you see them at a distance striding along not on the earth but above it and often relieved throughout the whole length of their bodies against the sky preserving our equilibrium on these elevated pathways with some difficulty against the strong southwest wind that was now blowing in our faces we soon reached the topmost rocks that crown the lizard head and then the whole noble line of coast and the wild stormy ocean opened grandly into view  on each side of us precipice over precipice cavern within cavern rose the great cliffs protecting the land against the raging sea three hundred feet beneath the foam was boiling far out over a reef of black rocks above and around flocks of seabirds flew in ever lengthening circles or perched flapping their wings and sunning their plumage on ledges of riven stone below us every object forming the wide sweep of the view was on the vastest and most majestic scale the wild varieties of form in the jagged line of rocks stretched away eastward and westward as far as the eye could reach black shapeless masses of mist scowled over the whole landward horizon the bright blue sky at the opposite point was covered with towering white clouds which moved and changed magnificently the tossing and raging of the great bright sea was sublimely contrasted by the solitude and tranquillity of the desert overshadowed landwhile ever and ever sounding as they first sounded when the morning stars sang together the rolling waves and the rushing wind pealed out their primeval music over the whole scene  and now when we began to examine the coast more in detail inquiring the names of remarkable objects as we proceeded we found ourselves in a country where each succeeding spot that the traveller visited was memorable for some mighty convulsion of nature or tragically associated with some gloomy story of shipwreck and death turning from the lizard head towards a cliff at some little distance we passed through a field on our way overgrown with sweetsmelling wild flowers and broken up into low grassy mounds this place is called pistol meadow and is connected with a terrible event which is still spoken of by the country people with superstitious awe  some hundred years since a transportship filled with troops was wrecked on the reef off the lizard head two men only were washed ashore alive out of the fearful number that perished two hundred corpses were driven up on the beach below pistol meadow and there they were buried by tens and twenties together in great pits the position of which is still revealed by the low irregular mounds that chequer the surface of the field the place was named in remembrance of the quantity of firearmsespecially pistolsfound about the wreck of the illfated ship at low tide on the reef below the cliffs to this day the peasantry continue to regard pistol meadow with feelings of awe and horror and fear to walk near the graves of the drowned men at night nor have many of the inhabitants yet forgotten a revolting circumstance connected by traditional report with the burial of the corpses after the shipwreck it is said that when dead bodies were first washed ashore troops of ferocious halfstarved dogs suddenly appeared from the surrounding country and could with difficulty be driven from preying on the mangled remains that were cast up on the beach ever since that period the peasantry have been reported as holding the dog in abhorrence whether this be true or not it is certainly a rare adventure to meet with a dog in the lizard district you may walk through farmyard after farmyard you may enter cottage after cottage and never hear any barking at your heelsyou may pass on the road labourer after labourer and yet never find one of them accompanied as in other parts of the country by his favourite attendant cur  leaving pistol meadow after gathering a few of the wild herbs growing fragrant and plentiful over the graves of the dead we turned our steps towards the lizard lighthouse as we passed before the front of the large and massive building our progress was suddenly and startlingly checked by a hideous chasm in the cliff sunk to a perpendicular depth of seventy feet and measuring more than a hundred in circumference nothing prepares the stranger for this great gulf no railing is placed about it it lies hidden by rising land and the earth all around is treacherously smooth the first moment when you see it is the moment when you start back instinctively from its edge doubtful whether the hole has not yawned open in that very instant before your feet  this chasmmelodramatically entitled by the people the lions denwas formed in an extraordinary manner not many years since in the evening the whole surface of the down above the cliff was smooth to the eye and firm to the footin the morning it had opened into an enormous hole the men who kept watch at the lighthouse heard no sounds beyond the moaning of the seafelt no shocklooked out on the night and saw that all was apparently still and quiet nature suffered her convulsion and effected her change in silence hundreds on hundreds of tons of soil had sunk down into depths beneath them none knew in how long or how short a time but there the lions den was in the morning where the firm earth had been the evening before  the explanation of the manner in which this curious landslip occurred is to be found by descending the face of the cliff beyond the lions den and entering a cavern in the rocks called daws hugo or cave the place is only accessible at low water passing from the beach through the opening of the cavern you find yourself in a lofty tortuous recess into the farthest extremity of which a stream of light pours down from some eighty or a hundred feet above this light is admitted through the lions den and thus explains by itself the nature of the accident by which that chasm was formed here the weight of the upper soil broke through the roof of the cave and the earth which then fell into it was subsequently washed away by the sea which fills daws hugo at every flow of the tide it has lately been noticed that the loose particles of ground at the bottom of the lions den still continue to sink gradually through the narrow slanting passage into the cave already formed and it is expected that in no very long time the lower extremity of the chasm will widen so far as to make the sea plainly visible through it from above at present the effect of the two streams of light pouring into daws hugo from two opposite directionsone from the lions den the other from the seaward opening in the rocksand falling together in cross directions on the black rugged walls of the cave and the beautiful marine ferns growing from them is supernaturally striking and grand here rembrandt would have loved to study for here even his sublime perception of the poetry of light and shade might have received a new impulse and learned from the teaching of nature one immortal lesson more  daws hugo and the lions den may be fairly taken as characteristic types of the whole coast scenery about the lizard head in its general aspects great caves and greater landslips are to be seen both eastward and westward in calm weather you may behold the long prospects of riven rock in their finest combination from a boat at such times you may row into vast caverns always filled by the sea and only to be approached when the waves ripple as calmly as the waters of a lake then you may see the naturally arched roof high above you adorned in the loveliest manner by marine plants waving to and fro gently in the wind rocky walls are at each side of you variegated in dark red and dark green coloursnow advancing now receding now winding in and out now rising straight and lofty until their termination is hid in a pitchdark obscurity which no man has ever ventured to fathom to its end beneath is the emeraldgreen sea so still and clear that you can behold the white sand far below and can watch the fish gliding swiftly and stealthily out and in while all around thin drops of moisture are dripping from above like rain into the deep quiet water below with a monotonous echoing sound which half oppresses and half soothes the ear at the same time  on stormy days your course is different then you wander along the summits of the cliffs and looking down through the hedges of tamarisk and myrtle that skirt the ends of the fields see the rocks suddenly broken away beneath you into an immense shelving amphitheatre on the floor of which the sea boils in fury rushing through natural archways and narrow rifts beyond them at intervals as the waves fall you catch glimpses of the brilliant blue main ocean and the outer reefs stretching into it often such wild views as these are relieved from monotony by the prospect of smooth cornfields and pasturelands or by pretty little fishing villages perched among the rockseach with its small group of boats drawn up on a slip of sandy beach and its modest tiny gardens rising one above another wherever the slope is gentle and the cliff beyond rises high to shelter them from the winter winds  but the place at which the coast scenery of the lizard district arrives at its climax of grandeur is kynance cove here such gigantic specimens are to be seen of the most beautiful of all varieties of rockthe serpentineas are unrivalled in cornwall perhaps unrivalled anywhere a walk of two miles along the westward cliffs from lizard town brought us to the top of a precipice of three hundred feet looking forward from this we saw the white sand of kynance cove stretching out in a half circle into the sea  what a scene was now presented to us it was a perfect palace of rocks some rose perpendicularly and separate from each other in the shapes of pyramids and steeplessome were overhanging at the top and pierced with dark caverns at the bottomsome were stretched horizontally on the sand here studded with pools of water there broken into natural archways no one of these rocks resembled another in shape size or positionand all at the moment when we looked on them were wrapped in the solemn obscurity of a deep mist a mist which shadowed without concealing them which exaggerated their size and hiding all the cliffs beyond presented them sublimely as separate and solitary objects in the seaview  it was now necessary however to occupy as little time as possible in contemplating kynance cove from a distance for if we desired to explore it immediate advantage was to be taken of the state of the tide which was already rapidly ebbing hurriedly descending the cliffs therefore we soon reached the sand and here leaving my companion to sketch i set forth to wander among the rocks doubtful whither to turn my steps first while still hesitating i was fortunate enough to meet with a guide whose intelligence and skill well deserve such record as i can give of them here for to the former i was indebted for much local information and anecdote and to the latter for quitting kynance cove with all my limbs in as sound a condition as when i first approached it  the guide introduced himself to me by propounding a sort of strangers catechism 1st did i want to see everythingcertainly 2nd was i giddy on the tops of high placesno 3rd would i be so good if i got into a difficulty anywhere as to take it easy and catch hold of him tightyes very tight with these answers the guide appeared to be satisfied he gave his hat a smart knock with one hand to fix it on his head and pointing upwards with the other said well try that rock first to look into the gulls nests and get some wild asparagus and away we went accordingly                                       we mount the side of an immense rock which projects far out into the sea and is the largest of the surrounding group it is called asparagus island from the quantity of wild asparagus growing among the long grass on its summit half way up we cross an ugly chasm the guide points to a small chink or crevice barely discernible in one side of it and says devils bellows then first courteously putting my toes for me into a comfortable little hole in the perpendicular rock side which just fits them he proceeds to explain himself through the base of the opposite extremity of the island there is a natural channel into which the sea rushes furiously at high tide and finding no other vent but the little crevice we now look down on is expelled through it in long thin jets of spray with a roaring noise resembling the sound of a gigantic bellows at work but the sea is not yet high enough to exhibit this phenomenon so the guide takes my toes out of the hole again for me just as politely as he put them in and forthwith leads the way up higher stillexpounding as he goes the whole art and mystery of climbing which he condenses into this axiomnever loose one hand till youve got a grip with the other and never scramble your toes about where toes have no business to be  at last we reach the topmost ridge of the island and look down upon the white restless water far beneath and peep into one or two deserted gulls nests and gather wild asparaguswhich i can only describe as bearing no resemblance at all that i could discover to the garden species then the guide points to another perpendicular rock farther out at sea looming dark and phantomlike in the mist and tells me that he was the man who built the cairn of stones on its top and then he proposes that we shall go to the opposite extremity of the ridge on which we stand and look down into the devils throat  this desirable journey is accomplished with the greatest ease on his part and with considerable difficulty and delay on minefor the wind blows fiercely over us on the height our rock track is narrow rugged and slippery the sea roars bewilderingly below and a single false step would not be attended with agreeable consequences soon however we begin to descend a little from our bad eminence and come to a halt before a wide tunnelled opening slanting sharply downwards in the very middle of the islanda black gaping hole into the bottom of which the sea is driven through some unknown subterranean channel roaring and thundering with a fearful noise which rises in hollow echoes through the aptlynamed devils throat about this hole no grass grew the rocks rose wild jagged and precipitous all around it if ever the ghastly imagery of dantes terrible vision was realized on earth it was realized here  at this place close to the mouth of the hole the guide suggests that we shall sit down and have a little talkand very impressive talk it is when he begins the conversation by bawling into my ear and down the devils throat at the same time to make himself heard above the fierce roaring beneath us now his tale is of tremendous jets of water which he has seen during the storms of winter shot out of the hole before which we sit into the creek of the sea belownow he tells me of a shipwreck off asparagus island of halfdrowned sailors floating ashore on pieces of timber and dashed out to sea again just as they touched the strand by a jet from the devils throatnow he points away in the opposite direction under one of the steepleshaped rocks and speaks of a chase after smugglers that began from this place a desperate chase in which some of the smugglers cargo but not one of the smugglers themselves was seizednow he talks of another great hole in the landward rocks where the sea may be seen boiling within a hole into which a man who was fishing for fragments of a wreck fell and was drowned his body being sucked away through some invisible channel never to be seen again by mortal eyes  anon the guides talk changes from tragedy to comedy he begins to recount odd adventures of his own with strangers he tells me of a huge fat woman who was got up to the top of asparagus island by the easiest path and by the exertions of several guides who left to herself gasped reeled and fell down immediately and was just rolling off with all the momentum of sixteen stone over the precipice below her when she was adroitly caught and anchored fast to the ground by the ankle of one leg and the calf of the other then he speaks of an elderly gentleman who while descending the rocks with him suddenly stopped short at the most dangerous point giddy and panicstricken pouring forth deathbed confessions of all his sins and wildly refusing to move another inch in any direction even this man the guide got down in safety at last by making stepping places of his hands on which the elderly gentleman lowered himself as on a ladder ejaculating incoherently all the way and trembling in great agony long after he had been safely landed on the sands  this last story ended it is settled that we shall descend again to the beach stimulated by the ease with which my worthy leader goes down beneath me i get overconfident in my dexterity and begin to slip here and slide there and come to awkward pauses at precipitous places in what would be rather an alarming manner but for the potent presence of the guide who is always beneath me ready to be fallen upon sometimes when i am holding on with all the necessary tenacity of grip as regards my hands but scrambling my toes about in a very disorderly and unworkmanlike fashion he pops his head up from below for me to sit on and puts my feet into crevices for me with many apologies for taking the liberty sometimes i fancy myself treading on what feels like soft turf i look down and find that i am standing like an acrobat on his shoulders and hear him civilly entreating me to take hold of his jacket next and let myself down over his body to the ledge where he is waiting for me he never makes a false step never stumbles scrambles hesitates or fails to have a hand always at my service the nautical metaphor of holding on by your eyelids becomes a fact in his case he really views his employer as porters are expected to view a package labelled glass with care i am firmly persuaded that he could take a drunken man up and down asparagus island without the slightest risk either to himself or his charge and i hold him in no small admiration when after landing on the sand with something between a tumble and a jump i find him raising me to my perpendicular almost before i have touched the ground and politely hoping that i feel quite satisfied hitherto with his conduct as a guide  we now go across the beach to explore some cavesdry at low wateron the opposite side some of these are wide lofty and welllighted from without we walk in and out and around them as if in great irregular gothic halls some are narrow and dark now we crawl into them on hands and knees now we wriggle onward a few feet serpentlike flat on our bellies now we are suddenly able to stand upright in pitch darkness hearing faint moaning sounds of pentup winds when we are silent and long reverberations of our own voices when we speak then as we turn and crawl out again we soon see before us one bright speck of light that may be fancied miles and miles awaya star shining in the eartha diamond sparkling in the bosom of the rock this guides us out again pleasantly and on gaining the open air we find that while we have been groping in the darkness a change has been taking place in the regions of light which has altered and is still altering the aspect of the whole scene  it is now two oclock the tide is rising fast the sea dashes in higher and higher waves on the narrowing beach rain and mist are both gone overhead the clouds are falling asunder in every direction assuming strange momentary shapes quaint airy resemblances of the forms of the great rocks among which we stand height after height along the distant cliffs dawns on us gently great golden rays shoot down over them far out on the ocean the waters flash into a streak of fire the sails of ships passing there glitter bright yet a moment more and the glorious sunlight bursts out over the whole view the sea changes soon from dull grey to bright blue embroidered thickly with golden specks as it rolls and rushes and dances in the wind the sand at our feet grows brighter and purer to the eye the seabirds flying and swooping above us look like flashes of white light against the blue firmament and most beautiful of all the wet serpentine rocks now shine forth in full splendour beneath the sun every one of their exquisite varieties of colour becomes plainly visiblesilver grey and bright yellow dark red deep brown and malachite green appear here combined in thin intertwined streaks there outspread in separate irregular patchesglorious ornaments of the seashore fashioned by no human artnatures own homemade jewellery which the wear of centuries has failed to tarnish and the rage of tempests has been powerless to destroy  but the hour wanes while we stand and admire the surf dashes nearer and nearer to our feet soon the sea will cover the sand and rush swiftly into the caves where we have slowly crawled already the devils bellows is at workthe jets of spray spout forth from it with a roar the sea thunders louder and louder in the devils throatwe must gain the cliffs while we have yet time the guide takes his leave my companion unwillingly closes his sketchbook and we slowly ascend on our inland way togetherlooking back often and often with no feigned regret on all that we are leaving behind us at kynance cove     vii  the pilchard fishery   if it so happened that a stranger in cornwall went out to take his first walk along the cliffs towards the south of the county in the month of august that stranger could not advance far in any direction without witnessing what would strike him as a very singular and alarming phenomenon  he would see a man standing on the extreme edge of a precipice just over the sea gesticulating in a very remarkable manner with a bush in his hand waving it to the right and the left brandishing it over his head sweeping it past his feetin short apparently acting the part of a maniac of the most dangerous character it would add considerably to the startling effect of this sight on the stranger if he were told while beholding it that the insane individual before him was paid for flourishing the bush at the rate of a guinea a week and if he thereupon advanced a little to obtain a nearer view of the madman and then observed on the sea below as he certainly might a wellmanned boat turning carefully to right and left exactly as the bush turned right and left his mystification would probably be complete and the right time would arrive to come to his rescue with a few charitable explanatory words he would then learn that the man with the bush was an important agent in the pilchard fishery of cornwall that he had just discovered a shoal of pilchards swimming towards the land and that the men in the boat were guided by his gesticulations alone in securing the fish on which they and all their countrymen on the coast depend for a livelihood  to begin however with the pilchards themselves as forming one of the staple commercial commodities of cornwall they may be perhaps best described as bearing a very close resemblance to the herring but as being rather smaller in size and having larger scales where they come from before they visit the cornish coastwhere those that escape the fishermen go to when they quit it is unknown or at best only vaguely conjectured all that is certain about them is that they are met with swimming past the scilly isles as early as july when they are caught with a driftnet they then advance inland in august during which month the principal or inshore fishing begins visit different parts of the coast until october or november and after that disappear until the next year they may be sometimes caught off the southwest part of devonshire and are occasionally to be met with near the southernmost coast of ireland but beyond these two points they are never seen on any other portion of the shores of great britain either before they approach cornwall or after they have left it  the first sight from the cliffs of a shoal of pilchards advancing towards the land is not a little interesting they produce on the sea the appearance of the shadow of a dark cloud this shadow comes on and on until you can see the fish leaping and playing on the surface by thousands at a time all huddled close together and all approaching so near to the shore that they can be always caught in some fifty or sixty feet of water indeed on certain occasions when the shoals are of considerable magnitude the fish behind have been known to force the fish before literally up to the beach so that they could be taken in buckets or even in the hand with the greatest ease it is said that they are thus impelled to approach the land by precisely the same necessity which impels the fishermen to catch them as they appearthe necessity of getting food  with the discovery of the first shoal the active duties of the lookout on the cliffs begin each fishingvillage places one or more of these men on the watch all round the coast they are called huers a word said to be derived from the old french verb huer to call out to give an alarm on the vigilance and skill of the huer much depends he is therefore not only paid his guinea a week while he is on the watch but receives besides a perquisite in the shape of a percentage on the produce of all the fish taken under his auspices he is placed at his post where he can command an uninterrupted view of the sea some days before the pilchards are expected to appear and at the same time boats nets and men are all ready for action at a moments notice  the principal boat used is at least fifteen tons in burden and carries a large net called the seine which measures a hundred and ninety fathoms in length and costs a hundred and seventy poundssometimes more it is simply one long strip from eleven to thirteen fathoms in breadth composed of very small meshes and furnished all along its length with lead at one side and corks at the other the men who cast this net are called the shooters and receive eleven shillings and sixpence a week and a perquisite of one basket of fish each out of every haul  as soon as the huer discerns the first appearance of a shoal he waves his bush the signal is conveyed to the beach immediately by men and boys watching near him the seine boat accompanied by another small boat to assist in casting the net is rowed out where he can see it then there is a pause a hush of great expectation on all sides meanwhile the devoted pilchards press ona compact mass of thousands on thousands of fish swimming to meet their doom all eyes are fixed on the huer he stands watchful and still until the shoal is thoroughly embayed in water which he knows to be within the depth of the seine net then as the fish begin to pause in their progress and gradually crowd closer and closer together he gives the signal the boats come up and the seine net is cast or in the technical phrase shot overboard  the grand object is now to enclose the entire shoal the leads sink one end of the net perpendicularly to the ground the corks buoy up the other to the surface of the water when it has been taken all round the fish the two extremities are made fast and the shoal is then imprisoned within an oblong barrier of network surrounding it on all sides the great art is to let as few of the pilchards escape as possible while this process is being completed whenever the huer observes from above that they are startled and are separating at any particular point to that point he waves his bush thither the boats are steered and there the net is shot at once in whatever direction the fish attempt to get out to sea again they are thus immediately met and thwarted with extraordinary readiness and skill this labour completed the silence of intense expectation that has hitherto prevailed among the spectators on the cliff is broken there is a great shout of joy on all sidesthe shoal is secured  the seine is now regarded as a great reservoir of fish it may remain in the water a week or more to secure it against being moved from its position in case a gale should come on it is warped by two or three ropes to points of land in the cliff and is at the same time contracted in circuit by its opposite ends being brought together and fastened tight over a length of several feet while these operations are in course of performance another boat another set of men and another net different in form from the seine are approaching the scene of action  this new net is called the tuck it is smaller than the seine inside which it is now to be let down for the purpose of bringing the fish closely collected to the surface the men who manage this net are termed regular seiners they receive ten shillings a week and the same perquisite as the shooters their boat is first of all rowed inside the seinenet and laid close to the seineboat which remains stationary outside and to the bows of which one rope at one end of the tucknet is fastened the tuck boat then slowly makes the inner circuit of the seine the smaller net being dropped overboard as she goes and attached at intervals to the larger to prevent the fish from getting between the two nets during this operation they are frightened into the middle of the enclosure by beating the water at proper places with oars and heavy stones fastened to ropes when the tuck net has at length travelled round the whole circle of the seine and is securely fastened to the seine boat at the end as it was at the beginning everything is ready for the great event of the day the hauling of the fish to the surface  now the scene on shore and sea rises to a prodigious pitch of excitement the merchants to whom the boats and nets belong and by whom the men are employed join the huer on the cliff all their friends follow them boys shout dogs bark madly every little boat in the place puts off crammed with idle spectators old men and women hobble down to the beach to wait for the news the noise the bustle and the agitation increase every moment soon the shrill cheering of the boys is joined by the deep voices of the seiners there they stand six or eight stalwart sunburnt fellows ranged in a row in the seine boat hauling with all their might at the tuck net and roaring the regular nautical yoheaveho in chorus higher and higher rises the net louder and louder shout the boys and the idlers the merchant forgets his dignity and joins them the huer so calm and collected hitherto loses his selfpossession and waves his cap triumphantly even you and i reader uninitiated spectators though we are catch the infection and cheer away with the rest as if our bread depended on the event of the next few minutes hooray hooray yohoy hoy hoy pull away boys up she comes here they are here they are the water boils and eddies the tuck net rises to the surface and one teeming convulsed mass of shining glancing silvery scales one compact crowd of tens of thousands of fish each one of which is madly endeavouring to escape appears in an instant  the noise before was as nothing compared with the noise now boats as large as barges are pulled up in hot haste all round the net baskets are produced by dozens the fish are dipped up in them and shot out like coals out of a sack into the boats ere long the men are up to their ankles in pilchards they jump upon the rowing benches and work on until the boats are filled with fish as full as they can hold and the gunwales are within two or three inches of the water even yet the shoal is not exhausted the tuck net must be let down again and left ready for a fresh haul while the boats are slowly propelled to the shore where we must join them without delay  as soon as the fish are brought to land one set of men bearing capacious wooden shovels jump in among them and another set bring large handbarrows close to the side of the boat into which the pilchards are thrown with amazing rapidity this operation proceeds without ceasing for a moment as soon as one barrow is ready to be carried to the saltinghouse another is waiting to be filled when this labour is performed by night which is often the case the scene becomes doubly picturesque the men with the shovels standing up to their knees in pilchards working energetically the crowd stretching down from the saltinghouse across the beach and hemming in the boat all round the uninterrupted succession of men hurrying backwards and forwards with their barrows through a narrow way kept clear for them in the throng the glare of the lanterns giving light to the workmen and throwing red flashes on the fish as they fly incessantly from the shovels over the side of the boatall combine together to produce such a series of striking contrasts such a moving picture of bustle and animation as not even the most careless of spectators could ever forget  having watched the progress of affairs on the shore we next proceed to the saltinghouse a quadrangular structure of granite wellroofed in all round the sides but open to the sky in the middle here we must prepare ourselves to be bewildered by incessant confusion and noise for here are assembled all the women and girls in the district piling up the pilchards on layers of salt at threepence an hour to which remuneration a glass of brandy and a piece of bread and cheese are hospitably added at every sixth hour by way of refreshment it is a service of some little hazard to enter this place at all there are men rushing out with empty barrows and men rushing in with full barrows in almost perpetual succession however while we are waiting for an opportunity to slip through the doorway we may amuse ourselves by watching a very curious ceremony which is constantly in course of performance outside it  as the filled barrows are going into the saltinghouse we observe a little urchin running by the side of them and hitting their edges with a long cane in a constant succession of smart strokes until they are fairly carried through the gate when he quickly returns to perform the same office for the next series that arrive the object of this apparently unaccountable proceeding is soon practically illustrated by a group of children hovering about the entrance of the saltinghouse who every now and then dash resolutely up to the barrows and endeavour to seize on as many fish as they can take away at one snatch it is understood to be their privilege to keep as many pilchards as they can get in this way by their dexterity in spite of a liberal allowance of strokes aimed at their hands and their adroitness richly deserves its reward vainly does the boy officially entrusted with the administration of the cane strike the sides of the barrow with malignant smartness and perseverancefish are snatched away with lightning rapidity and pickpocket neatness of hand the hardest rap over the knuckles fails to daunt the sturdy little assailants howling with pain they dash up to the next barrow that passes them with unimpaired resolution and often collect their ten or a dozen fish a piece in an hour or two no description can do justice to the jackinoffice importance of the boy with the cane as he flourishes it about ferociously in the full enjoyment of his vested right to castigate his companions as often as he can as an instance of the early development of the tyrannic tendencies of human nature it is in a philosophical point of view quite unique  but now while we have a chance while the doorway is accidentally clear for a few moments let us enter the saltinghouse and approach the noisiest and most amusing of all the scenes which the pilchard fishery presents first of all we pass a great heap of fish lying in one recess inside the door and an equally great heap of coarse brownish salt lying in another then we advance farther get out of the way of everybody behind a pillar and see a whole congregation of the fair sex screaming talking andto their honour be it spokenworking at the same time round a compact mass of pilchards which their nimble hands have already built up to a height of three feet a breadth of more than four and a length of twenty here we have every variety of the fairer half of creation displayed before us ranged round an odoriferous heap of salted fish here we see crones of sixty and girls of sixteen the ugly and the lean the comely and the plump the sourtempered and the sweetall squabbling singing jesting lamenting and shrieking at the very top of their very shrill voices for more fish and more salt both of which are brought from the stores in small buckets by a long train of children running backwards and forwards with unceasing activity and in bewildering confusion but universal as the uproar is the work never flags the hands move as fast as the tongues there may be no silence and no discipline but there is also no idleness and no delay never was threepence an hour more joyously or more fairly earned than it is here  the labour is thus performed after the stone floor has been swept clean a thin layer of salt is spread on it and covered with pilchards laid partly edgewise and close together then another layer of salt smoothed fine with the palm of the hand is laid over the pilchards and then more pilchards are placed upon that and so on until the heap rises to four feet or more nothing can exceed the ease quickness and regularity with which this is done each woman works on her own small area without reference to her neighbour a bucketful of salt and a bucketful of fish being shot out in two little piles under her hands for her own especial use all proceed in their labour however with such equal diligence and equal skill that no irregularities appear in the various layers when they are finishedthey run as straight and smooth from one end to the other as if they were constructed by machinery the heap when completed looks like a long solid neatlymade mass of dirty salt nothing being now seen of the pilchards but the extreme tips of their noses or tails just peeping out in rows up the sides of the pile  having now inspected the progress of the pilchard fishery from the catching to the curing we have seen all that we can personally observe of its different processes at one opportunity what more remains to be done will not be completed until after an interval of several weeks we must be content to hear about this from information given to us by others yonder sitting against the outside wall of the saltinghouse is an intelligent old man too infirm now to do more than take care of the baby that he holds in his arms while the babys mother is earning her threepence an hour inside to this ancient we will address all our inquiries and he is well qualified to answer us for the poor old fellow has worked away all the pith and marrow of his life in the pilchard fishery  the fishas we learn from our old friend who is mightily pleased to be asked for informationwill remain in salt or as the technical expression is in bulk for five or six weeks during this period a quantity of oil salt and water drips from them into wells cut in the centre of the stone floor on which they are placed after the oil has been collected and clarified it will sell for enough to pay off the whole expense of the wages food and drink given to the seinersperhaps defraying other incidental charges besides the salt and water left behind and offal of all sorts found with it furnish a valuable manure nothing in the pilchard itself or in connexion with the pilchard runs to wastethe precious little fish is a treasure in every part of him  after the pilchards have been taken out of bulk they are washed clean in salt water and packed in hogsheads which are then sent for exportation to some large seaportpenzance for instancein coast traders the fish reserved for use in cornwall are generally cured by those who purchase them the export trade is confined to the shores of the mediterraneanitaly and spain providing the two great foreign markets for pilchards the home consumption as regards great britain is nothing or next to nothing some variation takes place in the prices realized by the foreign tradetheir average wholesale is stated to be about fifty shillings per hogshead  as an investment for money on a small scale the pilchard fishery offers the first great advantage of security the only outlay necessary is that for providing boats and nets and for building saltinghousesan outlay which it is calculated may be covered by a thousand pounds the profits resulting from the speculation are immediate and large transactions are managed on the ready money principle and the markets of italy and spain where pilchards are considered a great delicacy are always open to any supply the fluctuation between a good seasons fishing and a bad seasons fishing is rarely if ever seriously great accidents happen but seldom the casualty most dreaded being the enclosure of a large fish along with a shoal of pilchards a ling for instance if unfortunately imprisoned in the seine often bursts through its thin meshes after luxuriously gorging himself with prey and is of course at once followed out of the breach by all the pilchards then not only is the shoal lost but the net is seriously damaged and must be tediously and expensively repaired such an accident as this however very seldom happens and when it does the loss occasioned falls on those best able to bear it the merchant speculators the work and wages of the fishermen go on as usual  some idea of the almost incalculable multitude of pilchards caught on the shores of cornwall may be formed from the following data at the small fishing cove of trereen 600 hogsheads were taken in little more than one week during august 1850 allowing 2400 fish only to each hogshead3000 would be the highest calculationwe have a result of 1440000 pilchards caught by the inhabitants of one little village alone on the cornish coast at the commencement of the seasons fishing  at considerable seaport towns where there is an unusually large supply of men boats and nets such figures as those quoted above are far below the mark at st ives for example 1000 hogsheads were taken in the first three seine nets cast into the water the number of hogsheads exported annually averages 22000 in 1850 27000 were secured for the foreign markets incredible as these numbers may appear to some readers they may nevertheless be relied on for they are derived from trustworthy sourcespartly from local returns furnished to me partly from the very men who filled the baskets from the boatside and who afterwards verified their calculations by frequent visits to the saltinghouses  such is the pilchard fishery of cornwalla small unit indeed in the vast aggregate of englands internal sources of wealth but yet neither unimportant nor uninteresting if it be regarded as giving active employment to a hardy and honest race who would starve without it as impartially extending the advantages of commerce to one of the remotest corners of our island and more than all as displaying a wise and beautiful provision of nature by which the rich tribute of the great deep is most generously lavished on the land most in need of a compensation for its own sterility     viii  the lands end   something like what jerusalem was to the pilgrim in the holy land the lands end iscomparing great things with smallto the tourist in cornwall it is the ultima thule where his progress stopsthe shrine towards which his face has been set from the first day when he started on his travelsthe main vent through which all the pentup enthusiasm accumulated along the line of route is to burst its way out in one long flow of admiration and delight  the lands end there is something in the very words that stirs us all it was the name that struck us most and was best remembered by us as children when we learnt our geography it fills the minds of imaginative people with visions of barrenness and solitude with dreams of some lonely promontory far away by itself out in the seathe sort of place where the last man in england would be most likely to be found waiting for death at the end of the world it suggests even to the most prosaically constituted people ideas of tremendous storms of flakes of foam flying over the land before the wind of billows in convulsion of rocks shaken to their centre of caves where smugglers lurk in ambush of wrecks and hurricanes desolation danger and death it awakens curiosity in the most carelessonce hear of it and you long to see ittell your friends that you have travelled in cornwall and ten thousand chances to one the first question they ask ishave you been to the lands end  and yet strange to say this spot so singled out and set apart by our imaginations as something remarkable and even unique of its kind is as a matter of fact not distinguishable from any part of the coast on either side of it by any local peculiarity whatever if you desire really and truly to stand on the lands end itself you must ask your way to it or you are in danger of mistaking any one of the numerous promontories on the right hand and the left for your actual place of destination but i am anticipating before i say more about the lands end it is necessary to relate how my companion and i got there and what we saw that was interesting and characteristic on our road  the reader may perhaps remember that he last left us scrambling out of reach of the tide up the cliffs overlooking kynance cove from that place we got back to helston in mist and rain just as we had left it from helston we proceeded to marazionstopping there to visit st michaels mount so well known to readers of all classes by innumerable pictures and drawings and by descriptions scarcely less plentiful that they will surely be relieved rather than disappointed if these pages exhibit the distinguished negative merit of passing the mount without notice from marazion we walked to penzance from penzance to the beautiful coast scenery at lamorna cove and thence to trereen celebrated as the halting place for a visit to one of cornwalls greatest curiositiesthe loggan stone  this farfamed rock rises on the top of a bold promontory of granite jutting far out into the sea split into the wildest forms and towering precipitously to a height of a hundred feet when you reach the loggan stone after some little climbing up perilouslooking places you see a solid irregular mass of granite which is computed to weigh eighty five tons supported by its centre only on a flat broad rock which in its turn rests on several others stretching out around it on all sides you are told by the guide to turn your back to the uppermost stone to place your shoulders under one particular part of its lower edge which is entirely disconnected all round with the supporting rock below and in this position to push upwards slowly and steadily then to leave off again for an instant then to push once more and so on until after a few moments of exertion you feel the whole immense mass above you moving as you press against it you redouble your effortsthen turn roundand see the massy loggan stone set in motion by nothing but your own pair of shoulders slowly rocking backwards and forwards with an alternate ascension and declension at the outer edges of at least three inches you have treated eightyfive tons of granite like a childs cradle and like a childs cradle those eightyfive tons have rocked at your will  the pivot on which the loggan stone is thus easily moved is a small protrusion in its base on all sides of which the whole surrounding weight of rock is by an accident of nature so exactly equalized as to keep it poised in the nicest balance on the one little point in its lower surface which rests on the flat granite slab beneath but perfect as this balance appears at present it has lost something the merest hairsbreadth of its original faultlessness of adjustment the rock is not to be moved now either so easily or to so great an extent as it could once be moved sixandtwenty years since it was overthrown by artificial means and was then lifted again into its former position this is the story of the affair as it was related to me by a man who was an eyewitness of the process of restoring the stone to its proper place  in the year 1824 a certain lieutenant in the royal navy then in command of a cutter stationed off the southern coast of cornwall was told of an ancient cornish prophecy that no human power should ever succeed in overturning the loggan stone no sooner was the prediction communicated to him than he conceived a mischievous ambition to falsify practically an assertion which the commonest common sense might have informed him had sprung from nothing but popular error and popular superstition accompanied by a body of picked men from his crew he ascended to the loggan stone ordered several levers to be placed under it at one point gave the word to heaveand the next moment had the miserable satisfaction of seeing one of the most remarkable natural curiosities in the world utterly destroyed for aught he could foresee to the contrary under his own directions  but fortune befriended the loggan stone one edge of it as it rolled over became fixed by a lucky chance in a crevice in the rocks immediately below the granite slab from which it had been started had this not happened it must have fallen over a sheer precipice and been lost in the sea by another accident equally fortunate two labouring men at work in the neighbourhood were led by curiosity secretly to follow the lieutenant and his myrmidons up to the stone having witnessed from a secure hidingplace all that occurred the two workmen with great propriety immediately hurried off to inform the lord of the manor of the wanton act of destruction which they had seen perpetrated  the news was soon communicated throughout the district and thence throughout all cornwall the indignation of the whole county was aroused antiquaries who believed the loggan stone to have been balanced by the druids philosophers who held that it was produced by an eccentricity of natural formation ignorant people who cared nothing about druids or natural formations but who liked to climb up and rock the stone whenever they passed near it tribes of guides who lived by showing it innkeepers in the neighbourhood to whom it had brought customers by hundreds tourists of every degree who were on their way to see itall joined in one general clamour of execration against the overthrower of the rock a full report of the affair was forwarded to the admiralty and the admiralty for once acted vigorously for the public advantage and mercifully spared the public purse  the lieutenant was officially informed that his commission was in danger unless he set up the loggan stone again in its proper place the materials for compassing this achievement were offered to him gratis from the dock yards but he was left to his own resources to defray the expense of employing workmen to help him being by this time awakened to a proper sense of the mischief he had done and to a tolerably strong conviction of the disagreeable position in which he was placed with the admiralty he addressed himself vigorously to the task of repairing his fault strong beams were planted about the loggan stone chains were passed round it pulleys were rigged and capstans were manned after a weeks hard work and brave perseverance on the part of every one employed in the labour the rock was pulled back into its former position but not into its former perfection of balance it has never moved since as freely as it moved before  it is only fair to the lieutenant to add to this narrative of his mischievous frolic the fact that he defrayed though a poor man all the heavy expenses of replacing the rock just before his death he paid the last remaining debt and paid it with interest                                       leaving the loggan stone we next shaped our course for the lands end we stopped on our way to admire the desolate pile of rocks and caverns which form the towering promontory called tolpedenpenwith or the holed headland on the left thence turning a little inlandpassing over wild pathless moors occasionally catching distant glimpses of the sea with the mist sometimes falling thick down to the very edges of the waves sometimes parting mysteriously and discovering distant crags of granite rising shadowy out of the foaming waterswe reached at last the limits of our outward journey and saw the atlantic before us rolling against the westernmost extremity of the shores of england  i have already said that the stranger must ask his way before he can find out the particular mass of rocks geographically entitled to the appellation of the lands end he may however easily discover when he has reached the district of the lands end by two rather remarkable indications that he will meet with on his road he will observe at some distance from the coast an old milestone marked i and will be informed that this is the real original first mile in england as if all measurement of distances began strictly from the west a little further on he will come to a house on one wall of which he will see written in large letters this is the first inn in england and on the other this is the last inn in england as if the recognised beginning and end too of the island of britain were here and here only having pondered a little on the slightly exclusive view of the attributes of their locality taken by the inhabitants he will then be led forward about half a mile by his guide will descend some cliffs will walk out on a ridge of rocks till he can go no fartherand will then be told that he is standing on the lands end  here as elsewhere there are certain sights which a stranger is required to examine assiduously as a duty if not as a pleasure by guidebook law rigidly administered by guides there is first of all the mark of a horses hoof which is with great care kept sharply modelled to borrow the painters phrase in the thin grass at the edge of a precipice this mark commemorates the narrow escape from death of a military man who for a wager rode a horse down the cliff to the extreme verge of the lands end where the poor animal seeing its danger turned in affright reared and fell back into the sea raging over the rocks beneath the foolhardy rider had just sense enough left to throw himself off in timehe tumbled on the ground within a few inches of the precipice and so barely saved the life which he had richly deserved to lose  after the mark of the hoof the traveller is next desired to look at a natural tunnel in the outer cliff which pierces it through from one end to the other then his attention is directed to a lighthouse built on a reef of rocks detached from the land and he is told of the great waves which break over the top of the building during the winter storms lastly he is requested to inspect a quaint protuberance in a pile of granite at a little distance off which bears a remote resemblance to a gigantic human face adorned with a short beard and which he is informed is considered quite a portrait of all the people in the world to liken it to of dr johnson it is therefore publicly known as johnsons head if it can fairly be compared with any of the countenances of any remarkable characters that ever existed it may be said to exhibit in violent exaggeration the worst physiognomical peculiarities of nero and henry the eighth combined in one face  these several local curiosities duly examined you are at last left free to look at the lands end in your own way before you stretches the wide wild ocean the largest of the scilly islands being barely discernible on the extreme horizon on clear days tracts of heath fields where corn is blown by the wind into mimic waves downs valleys and crags mingle together picturesquely and confusedly until they are lost in the distance on your left on your right is a magnificent bay bounded at either extremity by farstretching promontories rising from a beach of the purest white sand on which the yet whiter foam of the surf is ever seething as waves on waves break one behind the other the whole bold view possesses all the sublimity that vastness and space can bestow but it is that sublimity which is to be seen not described which the heart may acknowledge and the mind contain but which no mere words may delineatewhich even painting itself may but faintly reflect  however it is after all the walk to the lands end along the southern coast rather than the lands end itself which displays the grandest combinations of scenery in which this grandest part of cornwall abounds there nature appears in her most triumphant glory and beautythere every mile as you proceed offers some new prospect or awakens some fresh impression all objects that you meet with great and small moving and motionless seem united in perfect harmony to form a scene where original images might still be found by the poet and where original pictures are waiting ready composed for the painters eye  on approaching the wondrous landscapes between trereen and the lands end the first characteristic that strikes you is the change that has taken place in the forms of the cliffs since you left the lizard head you no longer look on variously shaped and variously coloured serpentine rocks it is granite and granite alone that appears everywheregranite less lofty and less eccentric in form than the serpentine cliffs and crags but presenting an appearance of adamantine solidity and strength a mighty breadth of outline and an unbroken vastness of extent nobly adapted to the purpose of protecting the shores of cornwall where they are most exposed to the fury of the atlantic waves in these wild districts the sea rolls and roars in fiercer agitation and the mists fall thicker and at the same time fade and change faster than elsewhere vessels pitching heavily in the waves are seen to dawn at one moment in the clearing atmosphereand then at another to fade again mysteriously as it abruptly thickens like phantom ships up on the top of the cliffs furze and heath in brilliant clothing of purple and yellow cluster close round great white weird masses of rock dotted fantastically with patches of greygreen moss the solitude on these heights is unbrokenno houses are to be seenoften no pathway is to be found you go on guided by the sight of the sea when the sky brightens fitfully and by the sound of the sea when you stray instinctively from the edge of the cliff as mist and darkness gather once more densely and solemnly all around you  then when the path appears againa winding path that descends rapidlyyou gradually enter on a new scene old horses startle you scrambling into perilous situations to pick dainty bits by the hillside sheep fettered by the fore and hind leg hobble away desperately as you advance suddenly you discern a small strip of beach shut in snugly between protecting rocks a spring bubbles down from an inland valley while not far off an old stone well collects the water into a calm clear pool sturdy little cottages built of rough granite and thickly thatched stand near you with gulls and cormorants eggs set in their loopholed windows for ornament great white sections of fish hang thickly together on their walls to dry looking more like many legs of many dirty duck trousers than anything else pigsties are hardby the cottages either formed by the cromlech stones of the druids or excavated like caves in the side of the hill down on the beach where the rough old fishingboats lie the sand is entirely formed by countless multitudes of the tiniest fairylike shells often as small as a pins head and all exquisitely tender in colour and wonderfully varied in form up the lower and flatter parts of the hills above fishing nets are stretched to dry while you stop to look forth over the quiet simple scene wild little children peep out at you in astonishment and hardworking men and women greet you with a hearty cornish salutation as you pass near their cottage doors  you walk a few hundred yards inland up the valley and discover in a retired sheltered situation the ancient village church with its square grey tower surmounted by mossgrown turrets with its venerable saxon stone cross in the churchyardwhere the turf graves rise humbly by twos and threes and where the old coffinshaped stone stands midway at the entrance gates still used as in former times by the bearers of a rustic funeral appearing thus amid the noblest scenery as the simple altar of the prayers of a simple race this is a church which speaks of religion in no formal or sectarian tone appealing to the heart of every traveller be his creed what it may in loving and solemn accents it sends him on his way again up the mighty cliffs and through the mist driving cloudlike over them the better fitted for his journey forward here the better fitted it may be even for that other dread journey of one irrevocable momentthe last he shall ever taketo his abidingplace among the spirits of the dead                                       these are some of the attractions which home rambles can offer to tempt the home traveller for these are the impressions produced and the incidents presented during a walk to the lands end     ix  botallack mine   i have little doubt that the less patient among the readers of this narrative have already while perusing it asked themselves some such questions as theseis not cornwall a celebrated mineral country why has the author not taken us below the surface yet why have we heard nothing all this time about the mines  readers who have questioned thus may be assured that their impatience to go down a mine in this book was fully equalled by our impatience to go down a mine in the county of which this book treats our anxiety however when we mentioned it to cornish friends was invariably met by the same answer waitthey all saiduntil you have turned your backs on the lands end and then go to botallack the mine there is the most extraordinary mine in cornwall go down that and you will not want to go down anotherwait for botallack and we did wait for botallack just as the reader has waited for it in these pages may he derive as much satisfaction from the present description of the mine as we did from visiting the mine itself  we left the lands end feeling that our homeward journey had now begun from that point and walking northward about five miles along the coast arrived at botallack having heard that there was some disinclination in cornwall to allow strangers to go down the mines we had provided ourselvesthrough the kindness of a friendwith a proper letter of introduction in case of emergency we were told to go to the countinghouse to present our credentials and on our road thither we beheld the buildings and machinery of the mine literally stretching down the precipitous face of the cliff from the land at the top to the sea at the bottom  this sight was in its way as striking and extraordinary as the first view of the cheesewring itself here we beheld a scaffolding perched on a rock that rose out of the wavesthere a steampump was at work raising gallons of water from the mine every minute on a mere ledge of land half way down the steep cliff side chains pipes conduits protruded in all directions from the precipice rottenlooking wooden platforms running over deep chasms supported great beams of timber and heavy coils of cable crazy little boarded houses were built where gulls nests might have been found in other places there did not appear to be a foot of level space anywhere for any part of the works of the mine to stand upon and yet there they were fulfilling all the purposes for which they had been constructed as safely and completely on rocks in the sea and down precipices in the land as if they had been cautiously founded on the tracts of smooth solid ground above  the countinghouse was built on a projection of earth about midway between the top of the cliff and the sea when we got there the agent to whom our letter was addressed was absent but his place was supplied by two miners who came out to receive us and to one of them we mentioned our recommendation and modestly hinted a wish to go down the mine forthwith  but our new friend was not a person who did anything in a hurry he was a grave courteous and rather melancholy man of great stature and strength he looked on us with a benevolent paternal expression and appeared to think that we were nothing like strong enough or cautious enough to be trusted down the mine did we know he urged that it was dangerous work yes but we didnt mind dangerperhaps we were not aware that we should perspire profusely and be dead tired getting up and down the ladders very likely but we didnt mind that eithersurely we shouldnt like to strip and put on miners clothes yes we should of all things and pulling off coat and waistcoat on the spot we stood halfundressed already just as the big miner was proposing another objection which under existing circumstances he goodnaturedly changed into a speech of acquiescence very well gentlemen he said taking up two suits of miners clothes i see you are determined to go down and so you shall youll be wet through with the heat and the work before you come up again so just put on these things and keep your own clothes dry  the clothing consisted of a flannel shirt flannel drawers canvas trousers and a canvas jacketall stained of a tawny copper colour but all quite clean a white nightcap and a round hat composed of some ironhard substance well calculated to protect the head from any loose stones that might fall on it completed the equipment to which three tallowcandles were afterwards added two to hang at the buttonhole one to carry in the hand  my friend was dressed first he had got a suit which fitted him tolerably and which as far as appearances went made a miner of him at once far different was my case  the same mysterious dispensation of fate which always awards tall wives to short men decreed that a suit of the big miners should be reserved for me he stood six feet two inchesi stand five feet six inches i put on his flannel shirtit fell down to my toes like a bedgown his drawersand they flowed in turkish luxuriance over my feet at his trousers i helplessly stopped short lost in the voluminous recesses of each leg the big miner like a good samaritan as he was came to my assistance he put the pocket button through the waist buttonhole to keep the trousers up in the first instance then he pulled steadily at the braces until my waistband was under my armpits and then he pronounced that i and my trousers fitted each other in great perfection the cuffs of the jacket were next turned up to my elbowsthe white nightcap was dragged over my earsthe round hat was jammed down over my eyes when i add to all this that i am so nearsighted as to be obliged to wear spectacles and that i finished my toilet by putting my spectacles on knowing that i should see little or nothing without them nobody i think will be astonished to hear that my companion seized his sketchbook and caricatured me on the spot and that the grave miner polite as he was shook with internal laughter when i took up my tallowcandles and reported myself ready for a descent into the mine  we left the countinghouse and ascended the face of the cliffthen walked a short distance along the edge descended a little again and stopped at a wooden platform built across a deep gully here the miner pulled up a trapdoor and disclosed a perpendicular ladder leading down to a black hole like the opening of a chimney this is the shaft i will go down first to catch you in case you tumble follow me and hold tight saying this our friend squeezed himself through the trapdoor and we went after him as we had been bidden  the black hole when we entered it proved to be not quite so dark as it had appeared from above rays of light occasionally penetrated it through chinks in the outer rock but by the time we had got some little way farther down these rays began to fade then just as we seemed to be lowering ourselves into total darkness we were desired to stand on a narrow landingplace opposite the ladder and wait there while the miner went below for a light he soon reascended to us bringing not only the light he had promised but a large lump of damp clay with it having lighted our candles he stuck them against the front of our hats with the clayin order as he said to leave both our hands free to us to use as we liked thus strangely accoutred like solomon eagles in the great plague with flame on our heads we resumed the descent of the shaft and now at last began to penetrate beneath the surface of the earth in good earnest  the process of getting down the ladders was not very pleasant they were all quite perpendicular the rounds were placed at irregular distances were many of them much worn away and were slippery with water and copperooze add to this the narrowness of the shaft the dripping wet rock shutting you in as it were all round your back and sides against the ladderthe fathomless darkness beneaththe light flaring immediately above you as if your head was on firethe voice of the miner below rumbling away in dull echoes lower and lower into the bowels of the earththe consciousness that if the rounds of the ladder broke you might fall down a thousand feet or so of narrow tunnel in a momentimagine all this and you may easily realize what are the first impressions produced by a descent into a cornish mine  by the time we had got down seventy fathoms or four hundred and twenty feet of perpendicular ladders we stopped at another landingplace just broad enough to afford standing room for us three here the miner pointing to an opening yawning horizontally in the rock at one side of us said that this was the first gallery from the surface that we had done with the ladders for the present and that a little climbing and crawling were now to begin  our path was a strange one as we advanced through the rift rough stones of all sizes holes here and eminences there impeded us at every yard sometimes we could walk on in a stooping positionsometimes we were obliged to crawl on our hands and knees occasionally greater difficulties than these presented themselves certain parts of the gallery dipped into black uglylooking pits crossed by thin planks over which we walked dizzily a little bewildered by the violent contrast between the flaring light that we carried above us and the pitch darkness beneath and before us one of these places terminated in a sudden rising in the rock hollowed away below but surmounted by a narrow projecting wooden platform to which it was necessary to climb by crossbeams arranged at wide distances my companion ascended to this awkward elevation without hesitating but i came to an awful pause before it fettered as i was by my brobdingnag jacket and trousers i felt a humiliating consciousness that any extraordinary gymnastic exertion was altogether out of my power  our friend the miner saw my difficulty and extricated me from it at once with a promptitude and skill which deserve record descending half way by the beams he clutched with one hand that hinder part of my too voluminous nether garments which presented the broadest superficies of canvas to his grasp i hope the delicate reader appreciates my ingenious indirectness of expression when i touch on the unmentionable subject of trousers grappling me thus and supporting himself by his free hand he lifted me up as easily as if i had been a small parcel then carried me horizontally along the loose boards like a refractory little boy borne off by the usher to the masters birch orconsidering the candle burning on my hat and the necessity of elevating my position by as lofty a comparison as i can makelike a flying mercury with a star on his head and finally deposited me safely upon my legs again on the firm rock pathway beyond you are but a light and a little man my son says this excellent fellow snuffing my candle for me before we go on only let me lift you about as i like and you shant come to any harm while i am with you  speaking thus the miner leads us forward again after we have walked a little farther in a crouching position he calls a halt makes a seat for us by sticking a piece of old board between the rocky walls of the gallery and then proceeds to explain the exact subterranean position which we actually occupy  we are now four hundred yards out under the bottom of the sea and twenty fathoms or a hundred and twenty feet below the sea level coasttrade vessels are sailing over our heads two hundred and forty feet beneath us men are at work and there are galleries deeper yet even below that the extraordinary position down the face of the cliff of the engines and other works on the surface at botallack is now explained the mine is not excavated like other mines under the land but under the sea  having communicated these particulars the miner next tells us to keep strict silence and listen we obey him sitting speechless and motionless if the reader could only have beheld us now dressed in our coppercoloured garments huddled close together in a mere cleft of subterranean rock with flame burning on our heads and darkness enveloping our limbshe must certainly have imagined without any violent stretch of fancy that he was looking down upon a conclave of gnomes  after listening for a few moments a distant unearthly noise becomes faintly audiblea long low mysterious moaning which never changes which is felt on the ear as well as heard by ita sound that might proceed from some incalculable distance from some far invisible heighta sound so unlike anything that is heard on the upper ground in the free air of heaven so sublimely mournful and still so ghostly and impressive when listened to in the subterranean recesses of the earth that we continue instinctively to hold our peace as if enchanted by it and think not of communicating to each other the awe and astonishment which it has inspired in us from the very first  at last the miner speaks again and tells us that what we hear is the sound of the surf lashing the rocks a hundred and twenty feet above us and of the waves that are breaking on the beach beyond the tide is now at the flow and the sea is in no extraordinary state of agitation so the sound is low and distant just at this period but when storms are at their height when the ocean hurls mountain after mountain of water on the cliffs then the noise is terrific the roaring heard down here in the mine is so inexpressibly fierce and awful that the boldest men at work are afraid to continue their labour all ascend to the surface to breathe the upper air and stand on the firm earth dreading though no such catastrophe has ever happened yet that the sea will break in on them if they remain in the caverns below  hearing this we get up to look at the rock above us we are able to stand upright in the position we now occupy and flaring our candles hither and thither in the darkness can see the bright pure copper streaking the dark ceiling of the gallery in every direction lumps of ooze of the most lustrous green colour traversed by a natural network of thin red veins of iron appear here and there in large irregular patches over which water is dripping slowly and incessantly in certain places this is the salt water percolating through invisible crannies in the rock on stormy days it spirts out furiously in thin continuous streams just over our heads we observe a wooden plug of the thickness of a mans leg there is a hole here and the plug is all that we have to keep out the sea  immense wealth of metal is contained in the roof of this gallery throughout its whole length but it remains and will always remain untouched the miners dare not take it for it is part and a great part of the rock which forms their only protection against the sea and which has been so far worked away here that its thickness is limited to an average of three feet only between the water and the gallery in which we now stand no one knows what might be the consequence of another days labour with the pickaxe on any part of it  this information is rather startling when communicated at a depth of four hundred and twenty feet under ground we should decidedly have preferred to receive it in the countinghouse it makes us pause for an instant to the miners infinite amusement in the very act of knocking away a tiny morsel of ore from the rock as a memento of botallack having however ventured on reflection to assume the responsibility of weakening our defence against the sea by the length and breadth of an inch we secure our piece of copper and next proceed to discuss the propriety of descending two hundred and forty feet more of ladders for the sake of visiting that part of the mine where the men are at work  two or three causes concur to make us doubt the wisdom of going lower there is a hot moist sickly vapour floating about us which becomes more oppressive every moment we are already perspiring at every pore as we were told we should and our hands faces jackets and trousers are all more or less covered with a mixture of mud tallow and irondrippings which we can feel and smell much more acutely than is exactly desirable we ask the miner what there is to see lower down he replies nothing but men breaking ore with pickaxes the galleries of the mine are alike however deep they may go when you have seen one you have seen all  the answer decides uswe determine to get back to the surface  we returned along the gallery just as we had advanced with the same large allowance of scrambling creeping and stumbling on our way i was charitably carried along and down the platform over the pit by my trousers as before our order of procession only changing when we gained the ladders again then our friend the miner went last instead of first upon the same principle of being ready to catch us if we fell which led him to precede us on our descent except that one of the rounds cracked under his weight as we went up we ascended without casualties of any kind as we neared the mouth of the shaft the daylight atmosphere looked dazzlingly white after the darkness in which we had been groping so long and when we once more stood out on the cliff we felt a cold healthgiving purity in the sea breeze and at the same time a sense of recovered freedom in the power that we now enjoyed of running jumping and stretching our limbs in perfect security and with full space for action which it was almost a new sensation to experience habit teaches us to think little of the light and air that we live and breathe in or at most to view them only as the ordinary conditions of our being to find out that they are more than this that they are a luxury as well as a necessity of life go down into a mine and compare what you can exist in there with what you do exist in on upper earth  on reentering the countinghouse we were greeted by the welcome appearance of two large tubs of water with soap and flannel placed invitingly by their sides copious ablutions and clean clothes are potent restorers of muscular energy these and a half hour of repose enabled us to resume our knapsacks as briskly as ever and walk on fifteen miles to the town of st ivesour resting place for the night                                       while we were sitting in the countinghouse we had some talk with our goodhumoured and intelligent guide on the subject of miners and mining at botallack some of the local information that he gave us may interest the readerto whom i do not pretend to offer more here than a simple record of a half hours gossip i could only write elaborately about the cornish mines by swelling my pages with extracts on the subject from encyclopædias and itineraries which are within easy reach of every one and on the province of which it is neither my business nor my desire to intrude  botallack mine is a copper mine but tin and occasionally iron are found in it as well it is situated at the western extremity of the great strata of copper tin and lead running eastward through cornwall as far as the dartmoor hills according to the statement of my informant in the countinghouse it has been worked for more than a century in former times it produced enormous profits to the speculators but now the case is altered the price of copper has fallen of late years the lodes have proved neither so rich nor so extensive as at past periods and the mine when we visited cornwall had failed to pay the expenses of working it  the organization of labour at botallack and in all other mines throughout the county is thus managedthe men work eight hours underground out of the twentyfour taking their turn of night duty for labour proceeds in the mines by night as well as by day in regular rotation the different methods on which their work is undertaken and the rates of remuneration that they receive have been already touched on in the chapter on the cornish people it will be found that ordinary wages for mine labour are there stated as ranging from forty to fifty shillings a monthmention being made at the same time of the larger remuneration which may be obtained by working on tribute or in other words by agreeing to excavate the lodes of metal for a percentage which varies with the varying value of the mineral raised it is however necessary to add here that although men who labour on this latter plan occasionally make as much as six or ten pounds each in a month they are on the other hand liable to heavy losses from the speculative character of the work in which they engage the lode may for instance be poor when they begin to work it and may continue poor as they proceed farther and farther under these circumstances the low value of the mineral they have raised realizes a correspondingly low rate of percentage and when this happens the best workmen cannot make more than twenty shillings a month  another system on which the men are employed is the system of contract a certain quantity of ore in the rock is mapped out by the captain of the mine and put up to auction among the miners thusone man mentions a sum for which he is willing to undertake excavating the ore upon the understanding that he is himself to pay for the assistance candles c out of the price he asks another man who is also anxious to get the contract then offers to accept it on lower terms a third mans demand is smaller still and so they proceed until the piece of work is knocked down to the lowest bidder by this sort of labour the contracting workmanafter he has paid his expenses for assistanceseldom clears more than twelve shillings a week  upon the whole setting his successful and his disastrous speculations fairly against each other the cornish miners average gains year by year may be fairly estimated at about ten shillings a week its hard work we have to do sir said my informant summing up when we parted the proportions of good and evil in the social positions of his brethren and himselfharder work than people think down in the heat and darkness under ground we may get a good deal at one time but we get little enough at another sometimes mines are shut up and then we are thrown out altogetherbut good work or bad work or no work at all what with our bits of ground for potatoes and greens and what with cheap living somehow we and our families make it do we contrive to keep our good cloth coat for sundays and go to chapel in the morningfor were most of us wesleyansand then to church in the afternoon so as to give em both their turn like we never go near the mine on sundays except to look after the steampump our rest and our walk in the evening once a week is a good deal to us thats how we live sir whatever happens we manage to work through and dont complain  although the occupation of smelting the copper above ground is as may well be imagined unhealthy enough the labour of getting it from the mine by blasting the subterranean rock in the first place and then hewing and breaking the ore out of the fragments seems to be attended with no bad effect on the constitution the miners are a finelooking race of menstrong and wellproportioned the fact appears to be that they gain more physically by the pure air of the cliffs and moors on which their cottages are built and the temperance of their lives many of them are teetotallers than they lose by their hardest exertions in the underground atmosphere in which they work  serious accidents are rare in the mines of cornwall from the horrors of such explosions as take place in coal mines they are by their nature entirely free the casualties that oftenest occur are serious falls generally produced by the carelessness of inexperienced or foolhardy people of these and of extraordinary escapes from death with which they are associated many anecdotes are told in mining districts which would appear to the reader exaggerated or positively untrue if i related them on mere hearsay evidence there was however one instance of a fall down the shaft of a mine unattended with fatal consequences which occurred while i was in cornwall and which i may safely adduce for i can state some of the facts connected with the affair as an eyewitness i attended an examination of the sufferer by a medical man and heard the story of the accident from the parents of the patient  on the 7th of august 1850 a boy fourteen years of age the son of a miner slipped into the shaft of boscaswell down mine in the neighbourhood of penzance he fell to the depth of thirteen fathoms or seventyeight feet fiftyeight feet down he struck his left side against a board placed across the shaft snapped it in two and then falling twenty feet more pitched on his head he was of course taken up insensible the doctor was sent for and on examining him found to his amazement that there was actually a chance of the boys recovery after this tremendous fall  not a bone in his body was broken he was bruised and scratched all over and there were three cutsnone of them seriouson his head the board stretched across the shaft twenty feet from the bottom had saved him from being dashed to pieces but had inflicted at the same time where his left side had struck it the only injury that appeared dangerous to the medical mana large hard lump that could be felt under the bruised skin the boy showed no symptoms of fever his pulse day after day was found never varying from eightytwo to the minute his appetite was voracious and the internal functions of his body only required a little ordinary medicine to keep them properly at work in short nothing was to be dreaded but the chance of the formation of an abscess in his left side between the hip and ribs he had been under medical care exactly one week when i accompanied the doctor on a visit to him  the cottage where he lived with his parents though small was neat and comfortable we found him lying in bed awake he looked languid and lethargic but his skin was moist and cool his face displayed no paleness and no injury of any kind he had just eaten a good dinner of rabbitpie and was anxious to be allowed to sit up in a chair and amuse himself by looking out of the window his left side was first examined a great circular bruise discoloured the skin over the whole space between the hip and ribs but on touching it the doctor discovered that the lump beneath had considerably decreased in size and was much less hard than it had felt during previous visits next we looked at his back and armsthey were scratched and bruised all over but nowhere seriously lastly the dressings were taken off his head and three cuts were disclosed which even a nonmedical eye could easily perceive to be of no great importance such were all the results of a fall of seventyeight feet  the boys father reiterated to me the account of the accident just as i had already heard it from the doctor how it happened he said could only be guessed for his son had completely forgotten all the circumstances immediately preceding the fall neither could he communicate any of the sensations which must have attended it most probably he had been sitting dangling his legs idly over the mouth of the shaft and had so slipped in but however the accident really happened there the sufferer was before usless seriously hurt than many a lad who has trodden on a piece of orange peel as he was walking along the street  we left him humanly speaking certain of recovery now that the dangerous lump in his side had begun to decrease i heard afterwards from his medical attendant that in two months from the date of the accident he was at work again as usual in the mine at that very part of it too where his fall had taken place  it was not the least interesting part of my visit to the cottage where he lay ill to observe the anxious affection displayed towards him by both his parents his mother left her work in the kitchen to hold him in her arms while the old dressings were being taken off and the new ones appliedsighing bitterly poor creature every time he winced or cried out under the pain of the operation the father put several questions to the doctor which were always perfectly to the point and did the honours of his little abode to his stranger visitor with a natural politeness and a simple cordiality of manner which showed that he really meant the welcome that he spoke nor was he any exception to the rest of his brotherworkmen with whom i met as a body of men they are industrious and intelligent sober and orderly neither soured by hard work nor easily depressed by harder privations no description of personal experiences in the cornish mines can be fairly concluded without a collateral testimony to the merits of the cornish minersa testimony which i am happy to accord here and to which my readers would cheerfully add their voices if they ever felt inclined to test its impartiality by their own experience     x  the modern drama in cornwall   our walk from botallack mine to st ives led us almost invariably between moors and hills on one side and cliffs and sea on the other and displayed some of the dreariest views that we had yet beheld in cornwall about nightfall we halted for a short time at a place which was certainly not calculated to cheer the traveller along his onward way  imagine three or four large square comfortlesslooking shutup houses all apparently uninhabited add some halfdozen miserable little cottages standing near the houses with the nasal notes of a methodist hymn pouring disastrously through the open door of one of them let the largest of the large buildings be called an inn but let it make up no beds because nobody ever stops to sleep there place in the kitchen of this inn a sickly little girl and a middleaged melancholy woman the first staring despondently on a wasting fire the second offering to the stranger a piece of bread three eggs and some sour porter corked down in an earthenware jar as all that her larder and cellar can afford fancy next an old grim dark church with two or three lads leaning against the churchyard wall looking out together in gloomy silence on a solitary high road conceive a thin slow rain falling a cold twilight just changing into darkness a surrounding landscape wild barren and shelterlessimagine all this and you will have the picture before you which presented itself to me and my companion when we found ourselves in the village of morvah  late that night we got to the large seaport town of st ives and stayed there two or three days to look at the pilchard fishery which was then proceeding with all the bustle and activity denoting the commencement of a good season leaving st ives on our way up the northern coast we now passed through the central part of the mining districts of cornwall chimneys and enginehouses chequered the surface of the landscape the roads glittered with metallic particles the walls at their sides were built with crystallized stones towns showed a sudden increase in importance villages grew large and populous inns disappeared and hotels arose in their stead people became less curious to know who we were stared at us less gossiped with us less gave us information but gave us nothing moreno long stories no invitations to stop and smoke a pipe no hospitable offers of bed and board all that we saw and heard tended to convince us that we had left the picturesque and the primitive with the streets of looe and the fishermen at the lands end and had got into the commercial part of the county among sharp prosperous business like peopleit was like walking out of a painters studio into a merchants countinghouse  as we were travelling like the renowned doctor syntax in search of the picturesque we hurried through this populous and highlycivilized region of cornwall as rapidly as possible i doubt much whether we should not have passed as unceremoniously through the large town of redruththe capital city of the mining districtsas we passed through several towns and villages before it had not our attention been attracted and our departure delayed by a public notice printed on rainbowcoloured paper and pasted up in the most conspicuous part of the marketplace  the notice set forth that the beautiful drama of the curates daughter was to be performed at night in the unrivalled sans pareil theatre by the most talented company in england before the most discerning audience in the world as far as we were individually concerned this theatrical announcement was remarkably tempting and welltimed we were now within one days journey of piran round the famous amphitheatre where the old cornish miracle plays used to be performed anything connected with the stage was therefore a subject of particular interest in our eyes the bill before us seemed to offer a curious opportunity of studying the dramatic tastes of the modern cornish on the very day before we were about to speculate on the dramatic tastes of the ancient cornish among the remains of their public theatre such an occasion was too favourable to be neglected we ordered our beds at redruth and joined the discerning audience assembled to sit in judgment on the curates daughter  the sans pareil theatre was not of that order of architecture in which outward ornament is studied there was nothing florid about it canvas ropes scaffoldingpoles and old boards threw an air of saxon simplicity over the whole structure admitted within we turned instinctively towards the stage on each side of the proscenium boards was painted a knight in full armour with powerful calves weak knees and an immense spear tallow candles stuck round two hoops threw a mysterious light on the green curtain in front of which sat an orchestra of four musicians playing on a trombone an ophicleide a clarionet and a fiddle as loudly as they couldthe artist on the trombone especially performing prodigies of blowing though he had not room enough to develop the whole length of his instrument every now and then great excitement was created among the expectant audience by the vehement ringing of a bell behind the scenes and by the occasional appearance of a youth who gravely snuffed the candles all round with a skill and composure highly creditable to him considering the pertinacity with which he was stared at by everybody while he pursued his occupation  at last the bell was rung furiously for the twentieth time the curtain drew up and the drama of the curates daughter began  our sympathies were excited at the outset we beheld a ladylike woman who answered to the name of grace and an old gentleman dressed in dingy black who personated her father the curate and who was on this occasion i presume through unavoidable circumstances neither more nor less thandrunk there was no mistaking the cause of the fixed leer in the reverend gentlemans eye of the slow swaying in his gait of the gruff huskiness in his elocution it appeared from the opening dialogue that a pending lawsuit and the absence of his daughter fanny in london combined to make him uneasy in his mind just at present but he was by no means so clear on this subject as could be desiredin fact he spoke through his nose put in and left out his hs in the wrong places and involved his dialogue in a long labyrinth of parentheses whenever he expressed himself at any length it was not until the entrance of his daughter fanny just arrived from london nobody knew why or wherefore that he grew more emphatic and intelligible we now observed with pleasure that he gave his children his blessing and embraced them both at once and we were additionally gratified by hearing from his own lips that his daughters were the hall on which his hall dependedthat they would watch hover his ale autumn and that whatever happened the whole party must invariably trust in heabbens obdipotent power  grateful for this clerical advice fanny retired into the garden to gather her parent some flowers but immediately returned shrieking she was followed by a highwayman with a cocked hat mustachios bandits ringlets a scarlet huntingcoat and buff boots this gentleman had shown his extraordinary politenessalthough a perfect strangerby giving miss fanny a kiss in the garden conduct for which the curate very properly cursed him in the strongest language apparently a quiet and orderly character the highwayman replied by beginning a handsome apology when he was interrupted by the abrupt entrance of another personage who ordered him rather late in the day as we ventured to think to let go his holt and beware how he laid his brutal touch on the form of innocence this newcomer the parson informed us was good hadam marle the teacher of the village school we found hadam in respect of his outward appearance to be a very short man dressed in a highcrowned modern hat with a fringed vandyck collar drooping over his back and shoulders a modern frockcoat buttoned tight at the waist and a pair of jackboots of the period of james the second aided by his advantages of costume this character naturally interested us and we regretted seeing but little of him in the first scene from which he retired following the penitent highwayman out and lecturing him as he went no sooner were their backs turned than a waggoner in a clean smockfrock and highlows entered with an offer of a situation in london for fanny which the unsuspicious curate accepted immediately as soon as he had committed himself it was confided to the audience that the waggoner was a depraved villain in the employ of that notorious profligate colonel chartress who had commissioned a second myrmidon of the female sex to lure fanny from virtue and the country to vice and the metropolis by the time the plot had thickened thus far the scene changed and we got to london at once  we now beheld the curate chartresss female accomplice fanny and the vicious waggoner all standing in a row across the stage the curate in a burst of amiability had just lifted up his hands to bless the company when colonel chartress dressed in an old naval uniform with an operahat of the year 1800 suddenly rushed in followed by the highwayman who having relapsed from penitence to guilt had as a necessary consequence determined to supplant chartress in the favour of miss fanny these two promptly seized each other by the throat vehement shouting scuffling and screaming ensued and the curate clasping his daughter round the waist frantically elevated his walkingstick in the air was he about to inflict personal chastisement on his innocent child who could say before there was time to ask the question the curtain fell with a bang on the crisis of the first act  in act the second the first scene was described in the bills as temple bar by moonlight neither bar nor moonlight appeared when the curtain roseso we took both for granted and fixed our minds on the story the first person who now confronted us was good hadam marle the paint was all washed off his face his immense spread of collar looked grievously in want of washing and he leaned languidly on an oaken stick he had been walkinghe informed usthrough the streets of london for six consecutive days and nights without sustenance in search of miss fanny who had disappeared since the skirmish at the end of act the first and had never been heard of since poor dear marle how eloquent he was with his white handkerchief when he fairly opened his heart and confided to us that he was madly attached to fanny that he knew he was nothink to her and that under existing circumstances he felt inclined to rest himself on a door step just as he had comfortably settled down the valet of the profligate chartress entered in the communicative stage of intoxication and immediately mentioned all his masters private affairs to hadam it appeared that the colonel had carried off miss fanny had then got tired of her and had coolly handed her over to a jew in part payment of a little bill having ascertained the jews address the indefatigable marle left us still without sustenance to rescue the curates daughter or die in the attempt  the next scene disclosed fanny sitting consciencestricken and inconsolable in a red polka jacket and white muslin slip mr marle having discovered her place of refuge now stepped in to lecture and reclaim vain proceeding the curates daughter looked at him with a scream exclaimed cuss me hadam cuss me and rushed out hadam after a despondent soliloquy followed with his eloquent handkerchief to his eyes but while he had been talking to himself our old friend the highwayman had been on the alert and had picked fanny up fainting in the street and what did he do with her after that he handed her over to his comrades in villany and who were his comrades in villany they were the trombone and ophicleide players from the orchestra and the miss grace of act first disguised as a bad character in a cloak with a red pockethandkerchief over her head and what happened next a series of events happened next miss fanny recovered on a sudden perceived what sort of company she had about her rushed out a second time into the street fell fainting a second time on the pavement and was picked up on this occasion by colonel chartressin the interests it is to be presumed of his friend the jew moneylender before however he could get clear off with his prize the indefatigably vicious highwayman and the indefatigably virtuous marle precipitated themselves on the stage assaulting chartress assaulting each other assaulting everybody fanny fell fainting a third time in the street and before we could find out who was the third person who picked her up down came the curtain in the midst of the catastrophe  act the third was opened by the heroine still injured still inconsolable and still clad in the polka jacket and white slip we thought her a very nice little woman with a melodious genteelcomedyvoice trim ankles and a habit of catching her breath in the most pathetic manner at least a dozen times in the course of one soliloquy while she was still assuring us that she felt the most forlorn creature on the face of the earth she was suddenly interrupted by the entrance of no less a person than the curate himself we had seen nothing of the reverend gentleman throughout the second act but hadam had casually informed us that his time had been passed at his parsonage sittun with his ed between his knees sobbun having now wearied of this gymnastic method of indulging in parental grief he had set forth to seek his lost daughter and had accidentally stopped at the very inn where she had taken refuge nothing could be more piteous than his present appearance he was infinitely more tipsy infinitely more dignified and infinitely more parenthetical in his mode of expressing himself than when we last beheld him a streak of burnt cork running down each side of his venerable nose showed us how deeply grief had increased the wrinkles of age and our pity for him reached its climax when he cast his clerical hat on the floor sank drowsily into a chair and began to pray in these words oh heabben hear a solemn and a solid prayerhear a solemn heart who wants to embrace his darling fanny  all this time the lost daughter was hiding behind the forlorn fathers chair an awful and convenient darkness being thrown on the stage by the introduction of a plank between the actors and the tallow candles in this striking situation miss fanny told her sad story and pleaded her own cause as a stranger under disguise of the darkness uselessquite useless the reverend gentleman having never turned round to see who it was that was speaking to him and having therefore no idea that it was his own daughter received in dignified silence the advances of a young person unknown to him what course was now left to the unhappy fanny the old coursea rush off the stage and a swoon in the street as soon as her back was turned the parson forgetting to take away his hat with him staggered out at the opposite side to continue his journey he uttered as he went the following moral observationno soul so lost to nature but must be lost eternallymy art is broken  the next moment we were startled by a long and elaborate trampling of feet behind the scenes and the villain chartress ran panicstricken across the stage hotly pursued by good hadam marle in the eloquent language of virtue thus did adam address himstay ruffian stay inquiring for chartress at the bar of this inn i found indeed that you was the very identical you foul venomous treacherous voluptuous liar where is the unappy fanny where is the victim of your preyha oaryedded ruffian i have yer collars chartress but no i will not strike yer i will drag yer it was interesting to see adam exemplify the peculiar distinction in the science of assault implied in his last words by hauling chartress all round the stage it was awful to observe that the colonel lost his temper at the second round murderously snapped a pistol in hadams face and rushed off in hot homicidal triumph we waited breathless for the fall of marle nothing of the sort happened he started frowned paused laughed fiercely exclaimedthe villain as missed and followed in pursuit  in the interim miss fanny had been picked up in the street for the fourth time by a benevolent washerwoman who happened to be passing by at the moment had been conveyed to the said washerwomans lodgings and now appeared before us despoiled at last of all the glories of the red polka enveloped from head to foot in clouds of white muslin and dying with frightful rapidity in an armchair in the next and last scene all that remained to represent the unhappy heroine was a coffin decently covered with a white sheet with slow and funereal steps the curate miss grace hadam the highwayman and the venomous and voluptuous liar chartress approached to weep over it the curate had gone raving mad since we saw him last his wig was set on wrong side foremost the ends of his clerical cravat floated wildly a yard long at least over his shoulders his eyes rolled in frenzy he swooned at the sight of the coffin recovered convulsively placed marles hand in the hand of miss grace telling him that now one daughter was dead nothing was left for him but to marry the other and then fell flat on his back with a thump that shook the stage and made the audience start unanimously marlewellbred to the lastpolitely offered his arm to grace and pointing to the coffin asked chartress reproachfully whether that was not his work the colonel took off his operahat raised his hand to his eyes and doggedly answered indeed it is the tableau thus formed was completed by the highwayman the coffin and the defunct curate and the curtain fell to slow music  such was the plot of this remarkable dramatic work exactly as i took it down in the theatre between the acts noting also in my pocketbook such scraps of dialogue as i have presented to the reader while they fell from the actors lips there were plenty of comic scenes in the play which i leave unmentioned for their humour was of the dreariest and their morality of the lowest order that can possibly be conceived i can only say as the result of my own experience at redruth that if the dramatic reforms which are now being attempted in the theatrical byways of the metropolis succeed there would be no harm in extending the experiment as far as the locomotive stage of cornwall good plays are good missionaries and like missionaries let them travel to teach                                       and now having seen enough of the modern drama in cornwall without waiting for the songs the dances and the farces which are to follow the curates daughter let us go on to piranzabuloe and look at the theatre in which the cornish of former days assembled endeavouring to discover at the same time by what sort of performances the people were instructed or amused some two hundred and fifty years ago     xi  the ancient drama in cornwall   we found the modern cornish theatre situated in a populous town built up as a temporary structure with old canvas and boards and opened to audiences only at night we found the ancient cornish theatre placed in a perfect desert constructed permanently though rudely of mounds of turfthe sky forming its only roof the flat plain its only stage the broad daylight its only means of illumination nothing of the kind could be more strongly marked than the difference between the theatre of the past and the theatre of the present day in the far west of england  in like manner the country about piran round such is the name of the old cornish amphitheatre offers a startling contrast to the country about redruth you are at once powerfully impressed by its barren solitude its dreary repose after the fertility and populousness of the great mining districts through which you have just passed now the large towns and busy villages disappear the mines grow rarer the roads look deserted the wide pathways dwindle to the merest foottrack again you behold the spacious moor rolling away in alternate hill and dale to the far horizon again you pass though the quaint coast villages and see the few simple cottages the few old boats the little groups talking quietly at the inn door as they have already presented themselves along the southern and western shores of cornwall soon however your onward road towards piran round becomes yet more desolate ere long not even a solitary cottage is in sight not a living being appears you find yourself wandering along the uneven boundary of a wilderness of sandhills heaped up from the seashore by the wind you look over a perfect desert of miniature mountains and valleys in some places overgrown with thin dry grass in others dotted with little pools of mud and stagnant water year by year this invasion of sand encroaches on the moorlandyear by year it is ever shifting ever increasing ever assuming newer and more fantastic forms now in one direction and now in another with each fresh storm  when you leave this dreary scene you only leave it for the wild flat heath the open naked country once more you follow your long road visible miles on before you winding white and serpentlike over the dark ground until you suddenly observe in the distance an object which rises strangely above the level prospect you approach nearer and behold a circular turf embankment a wide lonesome desolate enclosure looking like a witches dancingring that has sprung up in the midst of the open moor this is piran round here the old inhabitants of cornwall assembled to form the audience of the drama of former days  a level area of grassy ground one hundred and thirty feet in diameter is enclosed by the embankment there are two entrances to this area cut through the boundary circle of turf and earth which rises to a height of nine or ten feet and narrows towards the top where it is seven feet wide all round the inside of the embankment steps were formerly cut but their traces are now almost obliterated by the growth of the grass they were originally seven in number the spectators stood on them in rows one above anothera closely packed multitude all looking down at the dramatic performances taking place on the wide circumference of the plain when it was well filled the amphitheatre must have contained upwards of two thousand people  such is this rude yet extraordinary structure in our time it has not lost its patriarchal simplicity since the far distant period when the populace thronged its turf steps to welcome the strolling players of their age the antiquity of piran round dates back beyond the period of the earliest and rudest dramatic performances on english ground it was first used for popular sports for single combats for rustic councils then plays were acted in itmiracle playssome translated into the ancient cornish language some originally written in it the oldest of these are lost but one of a comparatively late date has been preserved and translated into english we will examine this book while we sit within the deserted amphitheatre and thus in imagination at least people the simple stage before us with the rough country actors who once trod itthus pry behind the scenes at all that is left to us of the ancient drama in cornwall  the play which we now open is called by the comprehensive title of the creation of the world with noahs flood it was translated in 1611 from a drama of much earlier date for performance in cornish by william jordan was then rendered into english by john keygwyn in 1691 and was finally corrected and published by mr davies gilbert in 1827 the cornish and english versions are printed on opposite pages so we can compare the two throughout as we go on  the play is in five acts and is written in poetryin a rambling octosyllabic metre often varied by the introduction of longer or shorter lines and sometimes interspersed in the cornish version with a word or two of english it occupies a hundred and eighty pages containing on the average about twentyfive lines each this would be thought rather a lengthy manner of developing a dramatic story in our days but we must remember that the time embraced in the plot of the old playwright extends from the creation to the flood and must be astonished and thankful that he has not been more diffuse  the dramatis personæ muster by the legion in the first act we have the whole heavenly host in the second are superadded adam eve torpen a devil beelzebub the serpent and michael the archangel in the third besides these death cain and his wife abel and seth in the fourth we have the addition of lamech a servant a cherubim and a first and second devil and in the fifth enoch noah and his wife shem ham japhet seth jaball and tubal cain  the author manages this tremendous list of mortal and immortal characters with infinite coolness and dexterity nothing appears to embarrass him he follows history in a negligent sauntering way passing over a hundred years or so whenever it is convenient and giving all his personages their turn of talking in orderly and impartial rotation his speeches are wonderfully moral and long even his worst characters have for the most part a temperate and logical way of uttering the most violent language which must have read an excellent lesson to the roistering young gentlemen among the audiences of the time  we will now examine the play a little in detail quoting the stage directions the most extraordinary part of it exactly as they occur and occasionally presenting a line or two of the dialogue from the old english translation wherever it best illustrates the authors style  the first act comprehends the fall of the angelsthe introductory stage direction commanding that the theatrical clouds and the whole sky to boot shall open when heaven is named all is harmony at the outset of the play until it is lucifers turn to speak he declares that he alone is great and that all allegiance must be given to him some of the angels glorify him accordingly others remain true to their celestial service the debate grows warm and some of the disputants give each other the lie but very calmly at length the scene is closed by lucifers condemnation to hell which as the directions provide shall gape when it is named the faithful angels are then told to have swords and staves ready for lucifer who we are informed voideth and goeth down to hell apparelled foul with fire about him turning to hell with every degree of devils and lost spirits on cords running into the plain with this stirring scene the act ends  the second act comprises the creation and fall of man here again we will consult the stage directions as giving the best idea of the incidents and scenes we find that adam and eve are to be apparelled in white leather in a place appointed by the conveyor probably the person we term stagemanager now and are not to be seen until they be called and then each rises after this we readlet paradise be finely made with fair trees in it and apples upon a tree and other fruit on the others a fountain too in paradise and fine flowers painted put adam into paradiselet flowers appear in paradiselet adam lie down and sleep where eve is and she by the conveyor must be taken from adams sidelet fishes of all sorts birds and beasts as oxen kyne sheep and such like appear  then we have the preparations for the temptation ordered thusa fine serpent to be made with a virgins face and yellow hair on her head let the serpent appear and also geese and hens lucifer enters immediately afterwards and goes into the serpent which is then directed to be seen singing in a tree the actor who personated lucifer must have had some gymnastic difficulties to contend with in his parteve looketh strange on the serpent then talketh familiarly and cometh near him then doubteth and looketh angrily and then eats part of the apple shows it to adam and insists on his eating part of it too in the following lines    sir in a few words   taste them part of the apple     or my love thou shalt lose   see take this fair apple   or surely between thee and thy wife   the love shall utterly fail     if thou wilt not eat of it4  the stage direction now proceedsadam receiveth the apple and tasteth it and so repenteth and casteth it away eve looketh on adam very strangely and speaketh not anything during this pause the conveyor is told to get the figleaves ready then lucifer is ordered to come out of the serpent and creep on his belly to hell adam and eve receive the curse and depart out of paradise showing a spindle and distaffno badlyconceived emblem of the labour to which they are henceforth doomed and thus the second act terminates  the third act treats of cain and abel and is properly opened by an impersonation of death after which cain and abel appear to sacrifice  cain makes his offering of the first substance that comes to handdry cowdung and tells abel that he is a dolthead and a frothy fool for using anything better abel is stricken with a jawbone and dieth cain casteth him into a ditch the effect of the first murder on the minds of our first parents is delineated in some speeches exhibiting a certain antique simplicity of thought which almost rises to the poetical by its homely adherence to nature and its perfect innocence of effort artifice or display the banishment of cain still glorying in his crime follows the lamentations of adam and eve for the death of abel and the act is closed by adams announcement of the birth of seth  the fourth act relates the deaths of cain and adam and contains some of the most eccentric and also some of the most elevated writing in the play lamech opens the scene candidly and methodically exposing his own character in these lines      sure i am the first   that ever yet had two wives   and maidens in sufficient plenty   they are to me i am not dainty   i can find them where i will   nor do i spare of them     in anywise one that is handsome   but i am wondrous troubled   scarce do i see one glimpse     what the devil shall be done  in this vagabond frame of mind lamech goes out hunting with bow and arrow and shoots cain accidentally in a bush when cain falls lamech appeals to his servant to know what is it that he has shot the servant declares that it is hairy rough ugly and a buckgoat of the night cain however discovers himself before he dies there is something rudely dreary and graphic about his description of his loneliness bare as it is of any recommendation of metaphors or epithets    deformed i am very much   and overgrown with hair   i do live continually in heat or cold frost         surely night and day   nor do i desire to see the son of man   with my will at any time   but accompany most time with all the beasts  lamech discovering the fatal error that he has committed kills his servant in his anger and the scene ends with the devils carrying them away with great noise to hell  the second scene is between adam and his son seth and here the old dramatist often rises to an elevation of poetical feeling which judging from the preceding portions of the play we should not have imagined he could reach barbarous as his execution may be the simple beauty of his conception often shines through it faintly but yet palpably in this part of the drama  adam is weary of life and weary of the world he sends seth to the gates of paradise to ask mercy and release for him telling his son that he will find the way thither by his fathers footprints burnt into the surface of the earth which was cursed for adams transgression seth finds and follows the supernatural marks is welcomed by the angel at the gate of paradise and is permitted to look in he beholds there an apocalypse of the redemption of the world on the tree of life sit the virgin and child while on the tree from which eve plucked the apple the woman is seen having power over the serpent the vision changes and cain is shown in hell sorrowing and weeping then the angel plucks three kernels from the tree of life and gives them to seth for his fathers use saying that they shall grow to another tree of life when more than five thousand years are ended and that adam shall be redeemed from his pains when that period is fulfilled after this seth is dismissed by the angel and returns to communicate to his father the message of consolation which he has received  adam hears the result of his sons mission with thankfulness blesses seth and speaks these last words while he is confronted by death    old and weak i am gone   to live longer is not for me   death is come   nor will here leave me       to live one breath    i see him now with his spear   ready to pierce me on every side   there is no escaping from him   the time is welcome with me       i have served long in the world  so the patriarch dies trusting in the promise conveyed through his son and is buried by seth in a fair tomb with some church sonnet  after this impressive close to the fourth actimpressive in its intention however clumsy the appliances by which that intention is worked outit would be doing the old author no kindness to examine his fifth act in detail here he sinks again in many places to puerility of conception and coarseness of dialogue it is enough to say that the history of the flood closes the drama and that the spectators are dismissed with an epilogue directing them to come tomorrow betimes and see very great mattersthe minstrels being charged at the conclusion to pipe so that all may dance together as the proper manner of ending the days amusements  and now let us close the book look forth over this lonesome country and lonesome amphitheatre and imagine what a scene both must have presented when a play was to be acted on a fine summers morning in the year 1611  fancy at the outset the arrival of the audiencepeople dressed in the picturesque holiday costume of the time which varied with every varying rank hurrying to their daylight play from miles off all visible in every direction on the surface of the open moor and all converging from every point of the compass to the one common centre of piran round then imagine the assembling in the amphitheatre the running round the outer circle of the embankment to get at the entrances the tumbling and rushing up the steps inside the racing of hotheaded youngsters to get to the top places the sly deliberation of the elders in selecting the lower and safer positions the quarrelling when a tall man chanced to stand before a short one the giggling and blushing of buxom peasant wenches when the gallant young bachelors of the district happened to be placed behind them the universal speculations on the weather the universal shouting for pots of aleand finally as the time of the performance drew near and the minstrels appeared with their pipes the gradual hush and stillness among the multitude the combined stare of the whole circular mass of spectators on one point in the plain of the amphitheatre where all knew that the actors lay hidden in a pit properly covered in from observationthe mysterious greenroom of the strolling players of old cornwall  and the playto see the play must have been a sight indeed conceive the commencement of it the theatrical sky which was to open awfully whenever heaven was named the mock clouds coolly set up by the propertyman on an openair stage where the genuine clouds appeared above them to expose the counterfeit the hard fighting of the angels with swords and staves the descent of the lost spirits along cords running into the plain the thump with which they must have come down the rolling off of the whole troop over the grass to the infernal regions amid shouts of applause from the audience as they rolled then the appearance of adam and eve packed in white leather like our modern dollsthe serpent with the virgins face and the yellow hair climbing into a tree and singing in the branchescain falling out of the bush when he was struck by the arrow of lamech and his blood appearing according to the stage directions when he fellthe making of the ark the filling it with live stock the scenery of the deluge in the fifth act what a combination of theatrical prodigies the whole performance must have presented how the actors must have ranted to make themselves heard in the open air how often the machinery must have gone wrong and the rude scenery toppled and tumbled down could we revive at will for mere amusement any of the bygone performances of the theatre since the first days of barbaric acting in a cart assuredly the performances at piran round would be those which without hesitation we should select from all others to call back to life  the end of the play toohow picturesque how striking all the circumstances attending it must have been oh that we could hear again the merry old english tune piped by the minstrels and see the merry old english dancing of the audience to the music then think of the separation and the return home of the populace at sunset the fishing people strolling off towards the seashore the miners walking away farther inland the agricultural labourers spreading in all directions wherever cottages and farmhouses were visible in the far distance over the moor and then the darkness coming on and the moon rising over the amphitheatre so silent and empty save at one corner where the poor wornout actors are bivouacking gipsylike in their tents cooking supper over the fire that flames up red in the moonlight and talking languidly over the fatigues and the triumphs of the play what a moral and what a beauty in the quiet night view of the old amphitheatre after the sight that it must have presented during the noise the bustle and the magnificence of the day  shall we dream over our old play any longer shall we delay a moment more ere we proceed on our journey to compare the modern with the ancient drama in cornwall as we have already compared the theatre of redruth with the theatre of piran round if we set them fairly against one another as we now know them would it be rash to determine which burnt purestthe new light that flared brilliantly in our eyes when we last saw it or the old light that just flickered in the socket for an instant as we tried to trim it afresh or if we rather inquire which audience had the advantage of witnessing the worthiest performance should we hesitate to decide at once between the people at redruth and the people at piran round there was certainly a curious resemblance in one respectthey failed alike to discern the barbarisms and absurdities of the plays represented before them but were they also equally uninstructed by what they beheld which was likeliest to send them away with something worth thinking of and worth rememberingthe drama about knaves and fools at the modern theatre or the drama about scripture history at the ancient let the reader consider and determine  for our parts let us honestly confess that though we took up the old play not unnaturally to laugh over the clumsiness and eccentricity of the performance we now lay it down not inconsistently recognising the artless sincerity and elevation of the designjust as in the earliest productions of the italian school of painting we first perceive the false perspective of a scene or the quaint rigidity of a figure and only afterwards discover that these crudities and formalities enshrine the germs of deep poetic feeling and the first struggling perceptions of grace beauty and truth  footnotes  4 in case any of my readers should feel desirous of seeing a specimen of the cornish language at the date of the play i subjoin the original text of the seven lines of john keygwyns translation quoted above    syr war nebas lavarow   tast gy part an avallow     po ow harenga ty a gyll   meir kymar an avail teake   po sure inter te hath wreage   an garenga quyt a fyll     mar ny vynyth y thebbry  some of this looks like a very polyglot language but the ancient cornish tongue had altered and deteriorated and was indeed changing into english at the period of our play why the author should have helped himself in his literary emergency to the two latin words in the fifth line inter te when english would have served his turn as well it is difficult to discover unless he wished to show his learning before the rustic audiences of piran round     xii  the nuns of mawgan   about three miles from the large markettown of st columb major in the direction of the coast is situated the vale of mawgan the village of the same name occupies the lower part of the valley and includes a few cottages an old church a yet older manorhouse and a clear running stream crossed by a little stone bridge all nestling close together on a few hundred yards of ground enclosed by some of the most luxuriant wood foliage in cornwall the trees bound each side of the stream tinging it in deep places where it eddies smoothly with hues of lustrous green and dipping their lower branches into it where it ripples on white pebbles or glides fast over grey sand they cluster thickly about the old churchyard as if to keep the place secret throwing deep shadows over the graves and hiding all outer objects from the eye the small cottage garden and the spacious manorhouse enjoy their verdant shelter alike the byeroads leading in and out of the village are soon lost to view amid outspread branches and not even a peep of the land that leads on to the sea in one direction and back to the town in the other is to be obtained through the natural screen of leaves above and mosses ferns and high grass below which closely shut in this part of the vale of mawgan from the open country around  there is an unbroken unworldly tranquillity about this secluded place which communicates itself mysteriously to the strangers thoughts making him unconsciously slacken in his walk and look and listen in silence when he enters it as if he had penetrated into a new sphere slight noises rarely noticed elsewhere are always audible here the dull fall of the latch when an idle child carelessly opens the churchyard wicket sounds from one end of the village to the other the curious traveller who wanders round the walls of the old church peering through its dusty lattice windows at the dark religious solitude within can hear the lightest flap of a ducks wing in the stream below or the gentlest rustle of distant leaves as the faint breeze moves them in the upland woods above but these and all other sounds never break the peaceful charm of the placethey only deepen its unearthly stillness  within the churchyard the bright colour of the turf and the quiet grey hues of the mouldering tombstones are picturesquely intermingled all over the uneven surface of the ground save in one remote corner where the graves are few and the grass grows rank and high here the eye is abruptly attracted by the stern of a boat painted white and fixed upright in the earth this strange memorial little suited though it be to the old monuments around has a significance of its own which gives it a peculiar claim to consideration inscribed on it appear the names of ten fishermen of the parish who went out to sea to pursue their calling on one wintry night in 1846 it was unusually cold on landon the sea the frosty bitter wind cut through to the bones the men were badly provided against the weather and hardy as they were the weather killed them that night in the morning the boat drifted on shore manned like a spectre bark by the ghastly figures of the deadfreighted horribly with the corpses of ten men all frozen to death they are now buried in mawgan churchyard and the stern of the boat they died in tells their fatal story and points to the last home which they share together  but it is not from such a village tragedy as this it is not from its retired situation its arcadian peacefulness its embowering trees and hidden hermitlike beauties of natural scenery that the vale of mawgan derives its peculiar interest it possesses an additional attraction stronger than any of these to fix our attentionit is the scene of a romance which we may still study of a mystery which is of our own time even to this little hidden nook even to this quiet bower of natures building that vigilant and indestructible papal religion which defies alike hidden conspiracy and open persecution has stretched its stealthy and farspreading influence even in this remote corner of the remote west of england among the homely cottages of a few cornish peasants the imperial christianity of rome has set up its sanctuary in triumpha sanctuary not thrown open to dazzle and awe the beholder but veiled in deep mystery behind gates that only open like the fatal gates of the grave to receive but never to dismiss again to the world without  it is this attribute of the vale of mawgan which leads the stranger away from the cool clear stream and the pleasant shadowy recesses among the trees to an ancient building near the church which he knows to have been once an old english manorial hallto be now a convent of carmelite nuns  the house of lanhearne so it is named comprises an ancient and a modern portion the first dating back before the time of the conquest the second added probably not more than a century and a half ago the place formerly belonged to the old cornish family of the arundels but about the year 1700 their race became extinct and the property passed into the possession of the present lord arundel however although the manorhouse has changed masters there is one peculiar circumstance connected with it which has remained unaltered down to the present timeit has never had a protestant owner  thus whatever religious traditions are connected with it are roman catholic traditions a secret recess remains in the wall of the old house where a priest was hidden from his pursuers during the reign of elizabeth for eighteen months the place being only large enough to allow a man to stand upright in it the skull of another priest who was burnt at the same period is also preserved with jealous care as one of the important relics of the ancient history of lanhearne  about the commencement of this century the manorhouse entirely changed its character it was at that time given to the carmelite nuns who now inhabit it by lord arundel the sisterhood was originally settled in france and was removed thence to antwerp at the outbreak of the first french revolution shortly afterwards when the affairs of the continent began to assume a threatening and troubled aspect the nuns again migrated and sought in england at lanhearne house the last asylum which they still occupy  the strictness of their order is preserved with a severity of discipline which is probably without parallel anywhere else in europe it is on our free english ground in one of our simplest and prettiest english villages that the austerities of a carmelite convent are now most resolutely practised and the seclusion of a carmelite convent most vigilantly preserved by the nuns of mawgan they are at present twenty in number two of them are frenchwomen the rest are all english they are of every age from the very young to the very old the eldest of the sisterhood has long passed the ordinary limits of human lifeshe has attained ninetyfive years  the nuns never leave the convent and no one even sees them in it women even are not admitted to visit them the domestic servants who have been employed in the house for years have never seen their faces have never heard them speak it is only in cases of severe and dangerous illness when their own skill and their own medicines do not avail them that they admit from sheer necessity the only stranger who ever approaches themthe doctor and on these occasions whenever it is possible the face of the patient is concealed from the medical man  the nuns occupy the modern part of the house which is entirely built off inside from the ancient their only place for exercise is a garden of two acres enclosed by lofty walls and surrounded by trees their food and other necessaries are conveyed to them through a turning door all personal communition with the servants offices being carried on through the medium of lay sisters the nuns have a private way known only to themselves to the chapel choir which is constructed in the form of a gallery boarded in at the sides and concealed by a curtain and close grating in front the chapel itself is in the old part of the house and occupies what was formerly the servants hall the officiating priest who undertakes the duties here lives in this portion of the building and leads a life of complete solitude until he is relieved by a successor he never sees the face of one of the nuns he cannot even ask one of his own profession to dine with him without first of all obtaining by letter the express permission of the abbess and when his visitor is at length admitted it is impossible to gain for himlet him be who he maythe additional indulgence of being allowed to sleep in the house5  the chapel is the only part of the whole interior of the building to which strangers can be admitted those who desire to do so can attend mass there on sundays the casual visitor when permitted to enter it is not allowed to pass beyond the pillars which support the gallery of the choir above him for if he advanced farther the nuns who might then be occupying it might see him while they were engaged at their devotions the chapel exhibits nothing in the way of ornament beyond the altar furniture and a few copies from pictures on sacred subjects by the old masters some of the more valuable objects devoted to its service are not shown these consist of the sacred vestments and the sacramental plate which are said to be of extraordinary beauty and value and are preserved in the keeping of the abbess the worth of one of the jewelled chalices alone has been estimated at a thousand pounds  much of the land in the neighbourhood belongs to the convent which has been enriched by many valuable gifts the nuns make a good use of their wealth neither the austerities and mortifications to which their lives are devoted nor their rigid and terrible selfexclusion from all intercourse with their fellowbeings in the world around them have diminished their sympathy for affliction or their readiness in ministering to the wants of the poor any assistance of any kind that they can render is always at the service of those who require it without distinction of rank or religion no wandering beggar who rings at the convent bell ever leaves the door without a penny and a piece of bread to help him on his way  but the charities of the nuns of mawgan do not stop short at the first good work of succouring the afflicted they extend also to a generous sympathy for those human weaknesses of impatience and irresolution in others which they have surmounted but not forgotten themselves rather more than twelve years since a young girl of eighteen applied to be admitted to share the dreary lifeindeath existence of the carmelite sisterhood she was received for her year of probation it expired and she still held firmly to her first determination but the nuns in pity to her youth and perhaps mournfully remembering even in their lifelong seclusion of mind and body how strong are the ties which bind together the beings of this world and the things of this world gave her more time yet to search her own motives to look back on what she was abandoning to look forward on what she desired to obtain mercifully refusing to grant her her own wishes they forebore the performance of the fatal ceremony which irrevocably took her from earth to give her up only to heaven until she had undergone an additional year of probation this last solemn period of delay which christian charity and sisterly love had piously granted expired and found her still determined to adhere to her resolution she took the veil and the dreary gates of lanhearne have closed on all that is mortal of her for ever  the convent has two burial places the first is in an ancient recess within the village church and was given to the nuns with the manorhouse those among them who first expired on english ground lie buried herethe catholic dead have returned to the once catholic edifice where the protestant living now worship when the carmelite funeral procession entered this place it entered at the dead of night to avoid the chance of any intrusion but as the nuns have no private entrance to their burialvault and have been by law prohibited from making one as they are obliged to pass through the public door of the church and walk up the nave they are at the mercy of any stranger who can gain admittance to the building and who may be led by idle curiosity to watch the ceremonies which accompany their midnight service for the dead feeling this they have of late years abandoned their burial place after first carefully boarding it off from all observation no inquisitive eyes can now behold no intruding footsteps can now approach the tombs of the nuns of mawgan  the second cemetery which they use at present is situated in one of the conventgardens and can therefore be secured whenever they please from all observation a wooden door at one corner of the ancient portion of the manorhouse leads into it the place is merely a small square plot of ground damp shady and overgrown with long grass an old and elaborately carved stone cross stands in it and about this appear the graves of the nuns marked by plain slate tablets but even here the mystery which hangs darkly over the carmelite household does not clearthe seclusion that has hidden the living in the convent is but the forerunner of the secrecy that veils from us on the tombstone the history of the dead the saints name once assumed by the nun and the short yet beautiful supplication of the roman church for the repose of the soul of the departed form the only inscriptions that appear over the graves  this is allall of the lives all of the deaths of the sisterhood at lanhearne that we can ever know the remainder must be conjecture we have but the bare stern outline that has been already drawnwho shall venture even in imagination to colour and complete the picture which it darkly yet plainly indicates  even if we only endeavour to image to ourselves the externals of the life which those massy walls keep secret what have we to speculate on nothing but the day that in winter and summer in sunshine and in storm brings with it year after year to young and to old alike the same monotony of action and the same monotony of reposethe turning door in the wall sole indication to those within that there is a world without moved in silence ever at the same stated hour by invisible handsthe prayer and penance in the chapel choir always a solitude to its occupants however many of their fellowcreatures may be standing beneath itthe short hours of exercise amid high garden walls which shut out everything but the distant sky beyond this what remains but that utter vacancy where even thought ends that utter gloom in which the brightest fancy must cease to shine  should we try to look deeper than the surface to strip the inner life of the convent of all its mysteries and coverings and anatomising it inch by inch search it through down to the very heart should we pry into the dread and secret processes by which among these women one human emotion after another may be suffering first ossification then death nothis is a task which is beyond our power an investigation which of our own knowledge we cannot be certain of pursuing aright we may imagine grief that does not exist remorse that is not felt error that has not been committed it is not for us to criticise the catastrophe of the drama when we have no acquaintance with the scenes which have preceded it it is not for us guided by our own thoughts moved by the impulses of the world we live in to decide upon the measure of good or evil contained in an act of selfsacrifice at the altar of religion which is in its own motive and result so utterly separated from all other motives and results that we cannot at the outset even so much as sympathise with it the purpose of the convent system is of those purposes which are conceived in this world but which appeal for justification or condemnation only to the next  judge not that ye be not judged those words sink deep into our hearts as we look our last upon the convent walls and leave the livingdead at old lanhearne  footnotes  5 all the particulars here related of the convent discipline were communicated to me by the resident priest this gentleman was certainly not a prejudiced witness on the side of austerityfor he frankly complained of the lonely life which the rules of the sisterhood inflicted on him and unhesitatingly acknowledged that he was anxious for the time when his clerical successor would come to relieve him     xiii  legends of the northern coast   from the time when we left st ives we walked through the last part of our journey much faster than we walked through the first faster perhaps than the reader may have perceived from these pages when we stopped at the town of st columb major to visit the neighbouring vale of mawgan we had already advanced half way up the northern coast of cornwall throughout this part of the county the towns lay wide asunder and as pedestrian tourists we were obliged to lengthen our walks and hasten our pace accordingly  after we had quitted st columb major our rambles began to draw rapidly to their close little more was now left for us to examine than the different localities connected with certain interesting cornish legends the places thus associated with the quaint fancies of the olden time were all situated close together some fifteen or twenty miles farther on along the coast the first among them that we reached was tintagel castle an ancient ruin magnificently situated on a precipice overhanging the sea and romantically if not historically reputed as the birthplace of king arthur  the date of the castle of tintagel is as much a subject of perplexity among modern antiquaries as is the existence of king arthur among modern historians we may still see some ruins of the castle but when or by whom the building was erected which those ruins represent we have no means of discovering we only know that after the conquest it was inhabited by some of our english princes and that it was used as a state prison so late as the reign of elizabeth the rest is for the most part mere conjecture raised upon the weak foundation of a few mouldering fragments of walls which must soon crumble and disappear as the rest of the castle has crumbled and disappeared before them  the position of the old fortress was probably almost impregnable in the days of its strength and glory the outer part of it was built on a precipitous projection of cliff three hundred feet high which must have been wrenched away from the mainland by some tremendous convulsion of nature the inner part stood on the opposite side of the chasm formed by this convulsion and both divisions of the fortress were formerly connected by a drawbridge the most interesting portion of the few ruins now remaining is that on the outermost promontory which is almost entirely surrounded by the sea the way up to this cliff is by a steep and somewhat perilous path so narrow in certain places where it winds along the verge of the precipice that a single false step would be certain destruction the difficulties of the ascent appear to have impressed the old historian of cornwall norden so vividly that he tries in his survey to frighten all his readers from attempting it warning unstable man if he will try to mount the cliff that while he respecteth his footinge he indaungers his head and looking to save the head indaungers the footinge accordinge to the old proverbe incidit in scyllam qui vult vitare charybdim he must have eyesominously adds the worthy nordenthat will scale tintagel  the ruins on the summit of the promontory only consist of a few straggling walls loosely piled up rather than built with darkcoloured stone some still remain entire enough to show the square loopholes that were pierced in them for arrows and here and there fragments of rough irregular arches which might have been either doorways or windows are still visible those parts of the building which have fallen are concealed by long thickly growing grassthe foot may sometimes strike against them but the eye perceives them not these are all the vestiges which remain of the once mighty castle all the signs that are left to point out the site of the old halls where the bold knights of arthur gathered for the feast or prepared for the fight at their royal masters command  the cornish legends tell us that the british hero held his last court solemnized his last feast reviewed his last array of warriors at tintagel before he went out to the fatal battlefield of camelford to combat his nephew mordred who had rebelled against his power in the morning the martial assemblage marched out of the castle in triumph led by the king with his deathdealing sword excalibur slung at his shoulder and his magic lance rou in his hand in the evening the warriors returned fatally victorious from the struggle the rebel army had been routed and the rebel chief slain but they brought back with them their renowned leaderthe favourite hero of martial adventure the conqueror of the saxons in twelve battlesmortally wounded from the field which he had quitted a victor  that night the wise and valiant king died in the castle of his birth died among his followers who had feasted and sung around him at the festal table but a few hours before the deeptoned bells of tintagel rang his death peal and the awestricken populace from the country round gathering together hurriedly before the fortress heard portentous wailings from supernatural voices which mingled in ghostly harmony with the moaning of the restless sea the dirging of the dreary wind and the dull deep thunder of the funeral knell about the heights of the castle and in the caverns beneath it these sounds ceased not night or day until the corpse of the hero was conveyed to the ship destined to bear it to its burialplace in glastonbury abbey then dirging winds and moaning sea and wailing voices ceased and in the intervals between the slow pealing of the funeral bells clear childlike voices arose from the calmed waters and told the mourning people that arthur was gone from them but for a little time to be healed of all his wounds in the fairy land and that he would yet return to lead and to govern them as of old  such is the scenestrange compound of fiction and truth of the typical and the realwhich legends teach us to imagine in the tintagel castle of thirteen centuries ago what is the scene that we look on nowa solitude where the decaying works of man and the enduring works of nature appear mingled in beauty together the grass grows high and luxuriant where the rushes were strewn over the floor of arthurs banqueting hall sheep are cropping the fresh pasture within the walls which once echoed to the sweetest songs or rang to the clash of the stoutest swords of ancient england about the fortress nothing remains unchanged but the sun which at evening still brightens it in its weak old age with the same glory that shone over its lusty youth the sea that rolls and dashes as at first against its foundation rocks and the wild cornish country outspread on either side of it as desolately and as magnificently as ever  the grandeur of the scenery at tintagel the romantic interest of the old british traditions connected with the castle might well have delayed us many hours on these solitary heights but we had other places still to visit other and far different legends still to gossip over descending the cliff while the day gave us ample time to wander at our will we strolled away inland to track the scene of a new romance as far as the waterfall called nightons keive                                       a walk of little more than halfamile brings us to the entrance of a valley bounded on either side by high gentlysloping hills with a small stream running through its centre fed by the waterfall of which we are in search we now follow a footpath a few hundred yards pass by a mill and looking up the valley see one compact mass of vegetation entirely filling it to its remotest corners and not leaving the slightest vestige of a path the merest patch of clear ground visible in any direction far or near  it seems as if all the foliage which ought to have grown on the cornish moorlands had been mischievously crammed into this place within the narrow limits of one cornish valley weeds ferns brambles bushes and young trees are flourishing together here thickly intertwined in every possible position in triumphant security from any invasion of billhook or axe you win every step of your way through this miniature forest of vegetation by the labour of your arms and the weight of your body tangled branches and thorny bushes press against you in front and behind meet over your head knock off your cap flap in your face twist about your legs and tear your coat skirts so obstructing you in every conceivable manner and in every conceivable direction that they seem possessed with a living power of opposition and commissioned by some evil genius of fairy mythology to prevent mortal footsteps from intruding into the valley whether you try a zigzag or a straight course whether you go up or down it is the same thingyou must squeeze and push and jostle your way through the crowd of bushes just as you would through a crowd of menor else stand still surrounded by leaves like a jackinthegreen and wait for the very remote chance of somebody coming to help you out  forcing our road incessantly through these obstructions for a full halfhour and taking care to keep our only guidethe sound of the runningwateralways within hearing we came at last to a little break in the vegetation crossed the stream at this place and found on the opposite side of the bank a faintlymarked track which might have been once a footpath following it as well as we could among the branches and brambles and now ascending steep ground we soon heard the dash of the waterfall but to attempt to see it was no easy undertaking the trees the bushes and the wild herbage grew here thicker than ever stretching in perfect canopies of leaves so closely across the overhanging banks of the stream as entirely to hide it from view we heard the monotonous eternal splashing of the water close at our ears and yet vainly tried to obtain even a glimpse of the fall adverse fate led us up and down and round and round and backwards and forwards amid a labyrinth of overgrown bushes which might have bewildered an australian settler and still the nymph of the waterfall coyly hid herself from our eyes our ears informed us that the invisible object of which we were in search was of very inconsiderable height our patience was evaporating our time was wasting awayin short to confess the truth here as i have confessed it elsewhere in these pages let me acknowledge that we both concurred in a sound determination to consult our own convenience and give up the attempt to discover nightons keive  our wanderings however though useless enough in one direction procured us this compensating advantage in another they led us accidentally to the exact scene of the legend which we knew to be connected with this part of the valley and which had indeed first induced us to visit it  we found ourselves standing before the damp dismantled stone walls of a solitary cottage placed on a plot of partially open ground near the outskirts of the wood long dark herbage grew about the inside of the ruined little building a toad was crawling where the leaves clustered thickest on what had once been the floor of a room in every direction corruption and decay were visibly battening on the lonesome place its aspect would repel rather than allure curiosity but for the mysterious story associated with it which gives it an attraction and an interest that are not its own  years and years ago when this desolate building was a neat comfortable cottage it was inhabited by two ladies of whose histories and even names all the people of the district were perfectly ignorant one day they were accidentally found living in their solitary abode before any one knew that they had so much as entered it or that they existed at all both appeared to be about the same age and both were inflexibly taciturn one was never seen without the other if they ever left the house they only left it to walk in the most unfrequented parts of the wood they kept no servant and never had a visitor no living souls but themselves ever crossed the door of their cottage they procured their food and other necessaries from the people in the nearest village paying for everything they received when it was delivered and neither asking nor answering a single unnecessary question their manners were gentle but grave and sorrowful as well the people who brought them their household supplies felt awed and uneasy without knowing why in their presence and were always relieved when they had dispatched their errand and had got well away from the cottage and the wood  gradually as month by month passed on and the mystery hanging over the solitary pair was still not cleared up superstitious doubts spread widely through the neighbourhood harmless as the conduct of the ladies always appeared to be there was something so sinister and startling about the unearthly seclusion and secrecy of their lives that people began to feel vaguely suspicious to whisper awful imaginary rumours about them to gossip over old stories of ghosts and false accusations that had never been properly sifted to the end whenever the inhabitants of the cottage were mentioned at last they were secretly watched by the less scrupulous among the villagers whom intense curiosity had endowed with a morbid courage and resolution even this proceeding led to no results whatever but increased rather than diminished the mystery  the expertest eavesdroppers who had listened at the door brought away no information with them for their pains some declared that when the ladies held any conversation together they spoke in so low a tone that it was impossible to distinguish a word they said others of more imaginative temperament protested on the contrary that their voices were perfectly audible but that the language they talked was some mysterious or diabolical language of their own incomprehensible to everybody but themselves one or two expert and daring spies had even contrived to look in at them through the window unperceived but had seen nothing uncommon nothing supernaturalnothing in short beyond the spectacle of two ladies sitting quietly and silently by their own fireside  so matters went on until one day universal agitation was excited in the neighbourhood by a rumour that one of the ladies was dead the rustic authorities immediately repaired to the cottage accompanied by a long train of eager followers and found that the report was true the surviving lady was seated by her companions bedside weeping over a corpse she spoke not a word she never looked up at the villagers as they entered question after question was put to her without ever eliciting an answer kind words were uselesseven threats proved equally inefficient the lady still remained weeping by the corpse and still said nothing gradually her inexorable silence began to infect the visitors to the cottage for a few moments nothing was heard in the room but the dash of the waterfall hard by and the singing of birds in the surrounding wood bitterly as the lady was weeping it was now first observed by everybody that she wept silently that she never sobbed never even sighed under the oppression of her grief  people began to urge each other superstitiously to leave the place it was determined that the corpse should be removed and buried and that afterwards some new expedient should be tried to induce the survivor of the mysterious pair to abandon her inflexible silence it was anticipated that she would have made some sign or spoken some few words when they lifted the body from the bed on which it lay but even this proceeding produced no visible effect as the villagers quitted the dwelling with their dead burden the last of them who went out left her in her solitude still speechless still weeping as they had found her at first  days passed and she sent no message to any one weeks elapsed and the idlers who waited about the woodland paths where they knew that she was once wont to walk with her companion never saw her watch for her as patiently as they might from haunting the wood they soon got on to hovering round the cottage and to looking in stealthily at the window they saw her sitting on the same seat that she had always occupied with a vacant chair opposite her figure wasted her face wan already with incessant weeping it was a dismal sight to all who beheld ita vision of affliction and solitude that sickened their hearts  no one knew what to do the kindesthearted people hesitated the hardesthearted people dreaded to disturb her while they were still irresolute the end was at hand one morning a little girl who had looked in at the cottage window in imitation of her elders reported when she returned home that she had seen the lady still sitting in her accustomed place but that one of her hands hung strangely over the arm of the chair and that she never moved to pick up her pockethandkerchief which lay on the ground beside her at these ominous tidings the villagers summoned their resolution and immediately repaired to the lonesome cottage in the wood  they knocked and called at the doorit was not opened to them they raised the latch and entered she still occupied her chair her head was resting on one of her hands the other hung down as the little girl had told them the handkerchief too was on the ground and was wet with tears was she sleeping they went round in front to look her eyes were wide open her drooping hand worn almost to mere bone was cold to the touch as the waters of the valleystream on a winters day she had died in her wonted place died in mystery and in solitude as she had lived  they buried her where they had buried her companion no traces of the real history of either the one or the other have ever been discovered from that time to this  such is the tale that was related to us of the cottage in the valley of nightons keive it may be only imagination but the stained roofless walls the damp clotted herbage and the reptiles crawling about the ruins give the place a gloomy and disastrous look the air too seems just now unusually still and heavy herefor the evening is at hand and the vapours are rising in the wood the shadows of the trees are deepening the rustling music of the waterfall is growing dreary the utter stillness of all things besides becomes wearying to the ear let us pass on and get into bright wide space again where the down leads back to happier solitudes by the seashore  we now rapidly lose sight of the trees which have hitherto so closely surrounded us and find ourselves treading the short scanty grass of the clifftop once more we still advance northward walking along rough cartroads and skirting the extremities of narrow gullies leading down to the sea until we enter the picturesque village of boscastle then descending a long street of irregular houses of all sizes shapes and ages we are soon conducted to the bottom of a deep hollow beyond this the bare ground rises again abruptly up to the highest point of the high cliffs which overhang the shore and here where the site is most elevated and where neither cottages nor cultivation appear we descry the ancient walls and gloomy tower of forrabury church  the interior of the building still contains a part of the finelycarved roodloft which once adorned it its rickety wooden pews are blackened with extreme old age and covered with curiouslycut patterns and cyphers the place is so dark that it is difficult to read the inscriptions on many of the mouldering monuments fixed together without order or symmetry on the walls outside are some saxon arches oddly built of black slatestone and the windowmouldings are ornamented with rough carving which at once proclaims its own antiquity but it is in the tower that the interest attached to the church chiefly centres square thick and of no extraordinary height it resembles in appearance most other towers in cornwallexcept in one particular all the belfry windows are completely stopped up  this peculiarity is to be explained simply enough the church has never had any bells the old tower has been mute and useless except for ornament since it was first built the congregation of the district must trust to their watches and their punctuality to get to service in good time on sundays at forrabury the chimes have never sounded for a marriage the knell has never been heard for a funeral  to know the reason of this to discover why the church though tower and belfry have always been waiting ready for them has never had a peal of bells we must seek instruction from another popular tradition from a third legend of these legendary shores let us go down a little to the brink of the cliff where the sea is rolling into a black yawning perpendicular pit of slate rock the scene of our third story is the view over the waters from this place  in ancient times when forrabury church was still regarded as a building of recent date it was a subject of sore vexation to all the people of the neighbourhood that their tower had no bells while the inhabitants of tintagel still possessed the famous peal that had rung for king arthurs funeral for some years this superiority of the rival village was borne with composure by the people of forrabury but in process of time they lost all patience and it was publicly determined by the rustic council that the honour of their church should be vindicated money was immediately collected and bells of magnificent tones and dimensions were forthwith ordered from the best manufactory that london could supply  the bells were cast blessed by high ecclesiastical authorities and shipped for transportation to forrabury the voyage was one of the most prosperous that had ever been known fair winds and calm seas so expedited the passage of the ship that she appeared in sight of the downs on which the church stood many days before she had been expected great was the triumph of the populace on shore as they watched her working into the bay with a steady evening breeze  on board however the scene was very different here there was more uproar than happiness for the captain and the pilot were at open opposition as the ship neared the harbour the bells of tintagel were faintly heard across the water ringing for the evening service the pilot who was a devout man took off his hat as he heard the sound crossed himself and thanked god aloud for a prosperous voyage the captain who was a reckless vainglorious fellow reviled the pilot as a fool and impiously swore that the ships company had only to thank his skill as a navigator and their own strong arms and ready wills for bringing the ship safely in sight of harbour the pilot in reply rebuked him as an infidel and still piously continued to return thanks as before while the captain joined by the crew tried to drown his voice by oaths and blasphemy they were still shouting their loudest when the vengeance of heaven descended in judgment on them all  the clouds supernaturally gathered the wind rose to a gale in a moment an immense sea higher than any man had ever beheld overwhelmed the ship and to the horror of the people on shore she went down in an instant close to land of all the crew the pilot only was saved  the bells were never recovered they were heard tolling a muffled deathpeal as they sank with the ship and even yet on stormy days while the great waves roll over them they still ring their ghostly knell above the fiercest roaring of wind and sea  this is the ancient story of the bellsthis is why the chimes are never heard from the belfry of forrabury church                                       now that we have visited the scene of our third legend what is it that keeps me and my companion still lingering on the downs why we are still delaying the hour of our departure long after the time which we have ourselves appointed for it  we both know but too well at this point we leave the coast not to return to it again at forrabury we look our last on the sea from these rocky shores with this evening our pleasant days of strolling travel are ended tomorrow we go direct to launceston and from launceston at once to plymouth tomorrow the adventures of the walking tourist are ours no longer for on that day our rambles in cornwall will have virtually closed  rise brothertraveller we have lingered until twilight already the seaward crags grow vast and dim around us and the inland view narrows and darkens solemnly in the waning light shut up your sketchbook which you have so industriously filled and pocket your pencils which you have worn down to stumps even as i now shut up my dogseared old journal and pocket my empty inkbottle one more of the few and fleeting scenes of life is fast closing soon to leave us nothing but the remembrance that it once existeda happy remembrance of a holiday walk in dear old england which will always be welcome and vivid to the last like other remembrances of home  come the night is drawing round us her curtain of mist let us strap on our trusty old friends the knapsacks for the last time and turn resolutely from the shore by which we have delayed too long come let us once again jog on the footpath way as contentedly if not quite as merrily as ever and remembering how much we have seen and learnt that must surely better us both let us as we now lose sight of the dark grey waters gratefully though sadly speak the parting word   farewell to cornwall      postscript to   rambles beyond railways     the cruise of the tomtit   to   the scilly islands     the cruise of the tomtit     i   at any other time of the year and for a shorter cruise i should be delighted to join you but as i prefer dying a dry death i must decline accompanying you all the way to the scilly islands in a little pleasure boat of thirteen tons just at the time of the autumnal equinox you may meet with a gale that will blow you out of the water you are running a risk in my opinion of the most senseless kindand if i thought my advice had any weight with you i should say most earnestly be warned in time and give up the tripextract from the letter of a prudent friend  if i were only a single man there is nothing i should like better than to join you but i have a wife and family and i cant reconcile it to my conscience to risk being drownedreport from the personal statement of a married friend  dont come back bottom upwardsfinal valedictory blessing of a facetious friend                                       my messmate and i having absolutely made up our minds to go to the scilly islands received the expressions of opinion quoted above with the supreme composure which distinguishes all resolute men in other words we held fast to our original determination engaged the boat and the crew and put to sea on our appointed day in the teeth of the wind and of our friends objections but before i float the present narrative into blue water i have certain indispensable formalities to accomplish which will keep me and my readers for a little while yet on dry land first of all let me introduce our boat our crew and ourselves  our boat is named the tomtit she is cutterrigged her utmost length from stem to stern is thirtysix feet and her greatest breadth on deck is ten feet as her size does not admit of bulwarks her deck between the cabinhatch and the stern dips into a kind of well with seats round three sides of it which we call the cockpit here we can stand up in rough weather without any danger of being rolled overboard elsewhere the sides of the vessel do not rise more than a few inches above the deck the cabin of the tomtit is twelve feet long eight feet wide and five feet six inches high it has roomy lockers and a snug little fireplace and it leads into two recesses forward which make capital storerooms for water coals firewood and so forth when i have added that the tomtit has a bright red bottom continued as to colour up her sides to a little above the watermark and when i have further stated that she is a fast sailer and that she proved herself on our cruise to be a capital little seaboat i have said all that is needful at present on the subject of our yacht and may get on to our crew and ourselves  our crew is composed of three brothers sam dobbs dick dobbs and bob dobbs all active seamen and as worthy and hearty fellows as any man in the world could wish to sail with my friends name is mr migott and mine is mr jollins thus we are five on board altogether as for our characters i shall leave them to come out as they may in the course of this narrative i am going to tell things plainly just as they happened smart writing comic colouring and graphic description are departments of authorship at which i snap my fingers in contempt  the port we sailed from was a famous wateringplace on the western coast called mangertononthemud and our intention as intimated at the beginning of these pages was to go even farther than the lands end and to reach those last morsels of english ground called the scilly islands but if the reader thinks he is now to get afloat at once he is lamentably mistaken one very important and interesting part of our voyage was entirely comprised in the preparations that we made for it to this portion of the subject therefore i shall wholly devote myself in the first instance on paper or off it neither mr migott nor myself are men to be hurried  we left london with nothing but our clothes our wrappers some tobacco some french novels and some egyptian cigars everything that was to be bought for the voyage was to be procured at bristol everything that could be extracted from private benevolence was to be taken in unlimited quantities from hospitable friends living more or less in the neighbourhood of our place of embarkation at bristol we plunged over head and ears in naval business immediately after ordering a ham and a tongue marmalade lemons anchovy paste and general groceries we set forth to the quay to equip ourselves and our vessel  we began with charts sailing directions and a compass we got on to a hammock apiece and a flag and we rose to a nautical climax by buying tarpaulincoats leggings and souwesters at a sailors publichouse with these seastores and with a noble loaf of homemade bread the offering of private benevolence we left bristol to scour the friendly country beyond in search of further contributions to the larder of the tomtit  the first scene of our ravages was a large countryhouse surrounded by the most charming grounds from the moment when we and our multifarious packages poured tumultuous into the hall to the moment when we and the said packages poured out of it again into a carriage and a cart i have no recollection excepting mealtimes and bedtime of having been still for an instant escorted everywhere by two handsome highspirited boys in a wild state of excitement about our voyage we ranged the house from top to bottom and laid hands on everything portable and eatable that we wanted in it the inexhaustible hospitality of our hostess was proof against all the inroads that we could make on it the priceless gift of packing perishable commodities securely in small spaces possessed by a lady living in the house and placed perpetually at our disposal encouraged our propensities for unlimited accumulation we ravaged the kitchen garden and the fruitgarden we rushed into the awful presence of the cook with our ham and tongue from bristol as an excuse and ranged predatory over the lower regions we scaled backstaircases and tramped along remote corridors and burst into secluded lumberrooms with accompaniment of shouting from the boys and of operatic humming from mr migott and myself who happen among other social accomplishments to be both of us musical in a desultory way we turned out in these same lumberrooms plans of estates from their neat tin cases and put in lemons and loafsugar instead mr migott pounced upon a stray telescope and strapped it over my shoulders forthwith the two boys found two japanned boxes with the epaulettes and shako of an exmilitary member of the family inside which articles of martial equipment though these are wartimes and nobody is meritorious or respectable now who does not wear a uniform i with my own irreverent hands shook out on the floor and straightway conveyed the empty cases downstairs to be profaned by tea sugar harveys sauce pickles pepper and other products of the arts of peace in a word and not to dwell too long on the purely piratical part of our preparations for the voyage we doubled the number of our packages at this hospitable country house before we left it for mangertononthemud and the dangers of the sea that lay beyond  at mangerton we made a second piratical swoop upon another longsuffering friend the resident doctor we let this gentleman off however very easily only lightening him of a lanthorn and two milkcans to hold our freshwater we felt strongly inclined to take his warmest cape away from him also but mr migott leaned towards the side of mercy and mr jollins was as usual only too ready to sacrifice himself on the altar of friendshipso the doctor kept his cape after all  not so fortunate was our next victim mr purler the port admiral of mangertononthemud and the convivial host of the metropolitan inn wisely entering his house emptyhanded we left it with sheets blankets mattresses pillows tablecloths napkins knives forks spoons crockery a fryingpan a gridiron and a saucepan when to these articles of domestic use were added the parcels we had brought from bristol the packages we had collected at the countryhouse the doctors milkcans the personal baggage of the two enterprising voyagers additions to the eating and drinking department in the shape of a cold curry in a jar a piece of spiced beef a side of bacon and a liberal supply of wine spirits and beernobody can be surprised to hear that we found some difficulty in making only one cartload of our whole collection of stores the packing process was in fact not accomplished till after dark the tide was then flowing we were to sail the next morning and it was necessary to get everything put on board that night while there was water enough for the tomtit to be moored close to the jetty  this jetty it must be acknowledged was nothing but a narrow stone causeway sloping down from the land into the sea our cart loaded with breakable things was drawn up at the high end of the jetty the tomtit waiting to receive the contents of the cart at the low end in the water we had no moon no stars no lamp of any kind on shore and the one small lanthorn on board the vessel just showed how dark it was and did nothing more imagine the doctor and the doctors friend and the doctors two dogs and mr migott and mr jollins all huddled together in a fussy state of expectation midway on the jetty seeing nothing doing nothing and being very much in the wayand then wonder as we wondered at the marvellous dexterity of our three valiant sailors who succeeded in transporting piecemeal the crockery cookery and general contents of the cart into the vessel on that pitchy night without breaking dropping or forgetting anything when i hear of professional conjurors performing remarkable feats i think of the brothers dobbs and the loading of the tomtit in the darkness and i ask myself if any landsmans mechanical legerdemain can be more extraordinary than the natural neathandedness of a sailor  the next morning the sky was black the wind was blowing hard against us and the waves were showing their white frills angrily in the offing a double row of spectators had assembled at the jetty to see us beat out of the bay if they had come to see us hanged their grim faces could not have expressed greater commiseration our only cheerful farewell came from the doctor and his friend and the two dogs the remainder of the spectators evidently felt that they were having a last long stare at us and that it would be indecent and unfeeling under the circumstances to look happy produce me a respectable inhabitant of an english country town and i will match him in the matter of stolid and silent staring against any other man civilized or savage over the whole surface of the globe  if we had felt any doubts of the seagoing qualities of the tomtit they would have been solved when we went about for the first time after leaving the jetty a livelier stiffer and drier little vessel of her size never was built she jumped over the waves as if the sea was a great playground and the game for the morning leapfrog though the wind was so high that we were obliged to lower our foresail and to doublereef the mainsail the only water we got on board was the spray that was blown over us from the tops of the waves in the state of the weather getting down channel was out of the question we were obliged to be contented on this first day of our voyage with running across to the welsh coast and there sheltering ourselvesamid a perfect fleet of outwardbound merchantmen driven back by the windin a snug roadstead for the afternoon and the night  this delay which might have been disagreeable enough later in our voyage gave us just the time we wanted for setting things to rights on board  our little twelvefoot cabin it must be remembered was bedroom sittingroom diningroom storeroom and kitchen all in one everything we wanted for sleeping reading eating and drinking had to be arranged in its proper place the butter and candles the soap and cheese the salt and sugar the bread and onions the oilbottle and the brandybottle for example had to be put in places where the motion of the vessel could not roll them together and where also we could any of us find them at a moments notice other things not of the eatable sort we gave up all idea of separating mr migott and i mingled our stock of shirts as we mingled our sympathies our fortunes and our flowing punchbowl after dinner we both of us have our faults but incapability of adapting ourselves cheerfully to circumstances is not among them mr migott especially is one of those rare men who could dine politely off blubber in the company of esquimaux and discover the latent social advantages of his position if he was lost in the darkness of the north pole  after the arrangement of goods and chattels came dinner the curry warmed up with a second course of fried onionsthen the slinging of our hammocks by the neat hands of the brothers dobbsand then the practice of how to get into the hammocks by messrs migott and jollins no landsman who has not tried the experiment can form the faintest notion of the luxury of the sailors swinging bed or of the extraordinary difficulty of getting into it for the first time the preliminary action is to stand with your back against the middle of your hammock and to hold by the edge of the canvas on either side you then duck your head down throw your heels up turn round on your back and let go with your hands all at the same moment if you succeed in doing this you are in the most luxurious bed that the ingenuity of man has ever invented if you fail you measure your length on the floor so much for hammocks  after learning how to get into bed the writer of the present narrative tried his hand at the composition of whisky punch and succeeded in imparting satisfaction to his intemperate fellowcreatures when the punch and the pipes accompanying it had come to an end a pilotboat anchored alongside of us for the night once embarked on our own element we old seadogs are after all a polite race of men we asked the pilot where he had come fromand he asked us we asked the pilot where he was bound to tomorrow morningand he asked us we asked the pilot whether he would like a drop of rumand the pilot to encourage us said yes after that there was a little pause and then the pilot asked us whether we would come on board his boatand we to encourage the pilot said yes and did go and came back and asked the pilot whether he would come on board our boatand he said yes and did come on board and drank another drop of rum thus in the practice of the social virtues did we while away the hourssix jolly tars in a twelvefoot cabintill it was past eleven oclock and time as we say at sea to tumble in or tumble out as the case may be when a jolly tar wants practice in the art of getting into his hammock  so began and ended our first day afloat     ii   the wind blew itself out in the night as the morning got on it fell almost to a calm and the merchantmen about us began weighing anchor to drop down channel with the tide the tomtit it is unnecessary to say scorned to be left behind and hoisted her sails with the best of them favoured by the lightness of the wind we sailed past every vessel proceeding in our direction barques brigs and schooners french luggers and dutch galliots we showed our stern to all of them and when the weather cleared and the breeze freshened towards the afternoon the little tomtit was heading the whole fleet  in the evening we brought up close to the high coast of somersetshire to wait for the tide weighed again at ten at night and sailed for ilfracombe got becalmed towards morning but managed to reach our port at ten with the help of the sweeps or long oars went ashore for more bread beer and fresh water feeling so nautical by this time that the earth was difficult to walk upon and all the people we had dealings with presented themselves to us in the guise of unmitigated landsharks o my dear eyes what a relief it was to mr migott and myself to find ourselves in our floating castle boxing the compass dancing the hornpipe and splicing the mainbrace freely in our oceanhome  about noon we sailed for clovelly our smooth passage across the magnificent bay of bideford is the recollection of our happy voyage which i find myself looking back on most admiringly while i now write  no cloud was in the sky far away on the left sloped inward the winding shore so clear so fresh so divinely tender in its blue and purple hues that it was the most inexhaustible of luxuries only to look at it over the watery horizon to the right the autumn sun hung grandly with the firepath below heaving on a sea of lustrous blue flocks of wild birds at rest floated chirping on the water all around the fragrant steady breeze was just enough to fill our sails on and on we went with the bubbling seasong at our bows to soothe us on and on till the blue lustre of the ocean grew darker till the sun sank redly towards the far waterline till the sacred evening stillness crept over the sweet air and hushed it with a foretaste of the coming night  what sight of mystery and enchantment rises before us now steep solemn cliffs bare in some placeswhere the darkred rock has been rent away and the winding chasms open grimly to the viewbut clothed for the most part with trees which soften their summits into the sky and sweep all down them in glorious masses of wood to the very waters edge climbing from the beach up the precipitous face of the cliff a little fishing village coyly shows itself the small white cottages rise one above another now perching on a bit of rock now peeping out of a clump of trees sometimes two or three together sometimes one standing alone here placed sideways to the sea there fronting itbut rising always one over the other as if instead of being founded on the earth they were hung from the trees on the top of the cliff over all this lovely scene the evening shadows are stealing the last rays of the sun just tinge the quiet water and touch the white walls of the cottages from out at sea comes the sound of a hornblown from the nearest fishingvessel as a signal to the rest to follow her to shore from the land the voices of children at play and the still fall of the small waves on the beach are the only audible sounds this is clovelly if we had travelled a thousand miles to see it we should have said that our journey had not been taken in vain  on getting to shore we found the one street of clovelly nothing but a succession of irregular steps from the beginning at the beach to the end half way up the cliffs it was like climbing to the top of an old castle instead of walking through a village when we reached the summit of the cliff the hour was too advanced to hope for seeing much of the country we strayed away however to look for the church and found ourselves at twilight near some ghastly deserted outhouses approached by a halfruinous gateway and a damp dark avenue of trees the church was near but shut off from us by ivygrown walls no living creature appeared not even a dog barked at us we were surrounded by silence solitude darkness and desolation and it struck us both forcibly that the best thing we could do was to give up the church and get back to humanity with all convenient speed  the descent of the high street of clovelly at night turned out to be a matter of more difficulty than we had anticipated there was no such thing as a lamp in the whole village and we had to grope our way in the darkness down steps of irregular sizes and heights paved with slippery pebbles and ornamented with nothing in the shape of a bannister even at the most dangerous places halfway down my friend and i had an argument in the darkstanding with our noses against a wall and with nothing visible on either sideas to which way we should turn next i guessed to the left and he guessed to the right and i being the more obstinate of the two we ended in following my route and at last stumbled our way down to the pier looking at the place the next morning we found that the steps to the right led through a bit of cottagegarden to a snug little precipice over which inquisitive tourists might fall quietly without let or hindrance talk of the perils of the deep what are they in comparison with the perils of the shore  the adventures of the night were not exhausted so far as i was concerned even when we got back to our vessel  i have already informed the reader that the cabin of the tomtit was twelve feet long by eight feet widea snug apartment but scarcely large enough as it struck me for five men to sleep in comfortably nevertheless the experiment was to be tried in clovelly harbour i bargained at the outset for one thingthat the cabin hatch should be kept raised at least a foot all night this ventilatory condition being complied with i tumbled into my hammock mr migott rolled into his and sam dobbs dick dobbs and bob dobbs cast themselves down promiscuously on the floor and the lockers under us out went the lights and off went my friend and the brothers dobbs into the most intolerable concert of snoring that it is possible to imagine  no alternative was left for my unfortunate self but to lie awake listening and studying the character of the snore in each of the four sleeping individuals the snore of mr migott i found to be superior to the rest in point of amiability softness and regularityit was a kind of oily longsustained purr amusing and not unmusical for the first five minutes next in point of merit to mr migott came bob dobbs his note was several octaves lower than my friends and his tone was a gruntbut i will do him justice i will not scruple to admit that the sounds he produced were regular as clockwork very inferior was the performance of sam dobbs who as owner of the boat ought i think to have set a good example if an idle carpenter planed a board very quickly at one time and very slowly at another and if he groaned at intervals over his work he would produce the best imitation of sam dobbss style of snoring that i can think of last and worst of all came dick dobbs who was afflicted with a cold and whose snore consisted of a succession of loud chokes gasps and puffs all contending together as it appeared to me which should suffocate him soonest there i lay wide awake suffering under the awful nosechorus which i have attempted to describe for nearly an hour it was a dark night there was no wind and very little air horrible doubts about the sufficiency of our ventilation began to beset me reminiscences of early reading on the subject of the black hole at calcutta came back vividly to my memory i thought of the twelve feet by eight in which we were all huddled togetherterror and indignation overpowered meand i roared for a light before the cabin of the tomtit became too mephitic for flame of any kind to exist in it uprose they then my merry merry men bewildered and grumbling to grope for the matchbox it was found the lantern was lit the face of mr migott appeared serenely over the side of his hammock and the voice of mr migott sweetly and sleepily inquired what was the matter  matter the black hole at calcutta is the matter poisonous gaseous exhalation is the matter outrageous ungentlemanly snoring is the matter give me my bedding and my drop of brandy and my pipe and let me go on deck let me be a chaldean shepherd and contemplate the stars let me be the careful watch who patrols the deck and guards the ship from foes and wreck let me be anything but the companion of men who snore like the famous furies in the old greek play while i am venting my indignation and collecting my bedding the smiling and sleepy face of mr migott disappears slowly from the side of the hammockand before i am on deck i hear the oily purr once more just as amiable soft and regular as ever  what a relief it was to have the sky to look up at the fresh night air to breathe the quiet murmur of the sea to listen to i rolled myself up in my blankets and for aught i know to the contrary was soon snoring on deck as industriously as my companions were snoring below  the first sounds that woke me in the morning were produced by the tongues of the natives of clovelly assembled on the pier staring down on me in my nest of blankets and shouting to each other incessantly i assumed that they were making fun of the interesting stranger stretched in repose on the deck of the tomtit but i could not understand one word of the devonshire language in which they spoke whatever they said of me i forgive them however in consideration of their cream and fresh herrings our breakfast on the cabinhatch in clovelly harbour after a dip in the sea is a remembrance of gustatory bliss which i gratefully cherish when we had reduced the herrings to skeletons and the creampot to a whited sepulchre of emptiness we slipped from our moorings and sailed away from the lovely little village with sincere regret by noon we were off hartland point  we had now arrived at the important part of our voyagethe part at which it was necessary to decide once for all on our future destination mr migott and i took counsel together solemnly unrolled the charts and then astonished our trusty crew by announcing that the end of the voyage was to be the scilly islands up to this time the brothers dobbs had been inclined to laugh at the notion of getting so far in so small a boat but they began to look grave now and to hint at cautious objections the weather was certainly beautiful but then the wind was dead against us our little vessel was stiff and sturdy enough for any service but nobody on board knew the strange waters into which we were goingand as for the charts could any one of us study them with a proper knowledge of the science of navigation would it not be better to take a little cruise to lundy island away there on the starboard bow and another little cruise about the welsh coast where the dobbses had been before to these cautious questions we replied by rash and peremptory negatives and the brothers thereupon abandoned their view of the case and accepted ours with great resignation  for the scilly islands therefore we now shaped our course alternately standing out to sea and running in for the land so as to get down ultimately to the lands end against the wind in a series of long zigzags now in a westerly and now in an easterly direction our first tack from hartland point was a sail of six hours out to sea at sunset the little tomtit had lost sight of land for the first time since she was launched and was rising and falling gently on the long swells of the atlantic it was a deliciously calm clear evening with every promise of the fine weather lasting the spirits of the brothers dobbs when they found themselves at last in the blue water rose amazingly  only give us decent weather sir said bob dobbs cheerfully smacking the tiller of the tomtit and well find our way to scilly somehow in spite of the wind  how we found our way remains to be seen     iii   we were now fairly at sea keeping a regular watch on deck at night and never running nearer the cornish coast than was necessary to enable us to compare the great headlands with the marks on our chart under present circumstances no more than three of us could sleep in the cabin at one timethe combined powers of the snoring party were thus weakened and the ventilation below could be preserved in a satisfactory state instead of chronicling our slow zigzag progress to the lands endwhich is unlikely to interest anybody not familiar with cornish names and nautical phrasesi will try to describe the manner in which we passed the day on board the tomtit now that we were away from land events and amusements if there was to be any such thing as an alloy of dulness in our cruise this was assuredly the part of it in which time and the hour were likely to run slowest through the day                                       in the first place let me record with just pride that we have solved the difficult problem of a pure republic in our modest little craft no man in particular among us is masterno man in particular is servant the man who can do at the right time and in the best way the thing that is most wanted is always the hero of the situation among us when dick dobbs is frying the onions for dinner he is the person most respected in the ship and mr migott and myself are his faithful and expectant subjects when grog is to be made or sauces are to be prepared mr jollins becomes in his turn the monarch of all he surveys when musical entertainments are in progress mr migott is vocal king and sole conductor of band and chorus when nautical talk and seastories rule the hour bob dobbs who has voyaged in various merchantmen all over the world and is every inch of him a thorough sailor becomes the best man of the company when any affairs connected with the internal management of the vessel are under consideration sam dobbs is chairman of the committee in the cockpit so we sail along and such is the perfect constitution of society at which we mariners of england have been able to arrive  our freedom extends to the smallest details we have no stated hours and we are well ahead of all rules and regulations we have no breakfast hour no dinner hour no time for rising or for going to bed we have no particular eatables at particular meals we dont know the day of the month or the day of the week and never look at our watches except when we wind them up our voice is frequently the voice of the sluggard but we never complain because nobody ever wakes us too soon or thinks of interfering with our slumbering again we wear each others coats smoke each others pipes poach on each others victuals we are a happy dawdling undisciplined slovenly lot we have no principles no respectability no business no stake in the country no knowledge of mrs grundy we are a parcel of lotoseaters and we know nothing except that we are poking our way along anyhow to the scilly islands in the tomtit  we rise when we have had sleep enoughany time you like between seven and ten if i happen to be on deck first i begin by hearing the news of the weather and the wind from sam dick or bob at the helm soon the face of mr migott rosy with recent snoring rises from the cabin and his body follows it slowly clad in the blue jersey frock which he persists in wearing night and dayin the heat of noon as in the cool of evening he cannot be prevailed upon to give any reason for his violent attachment to this garmentonly wagging his head and smiling mysteriously when we ask why sleeping or waking he never parts with it well being up the next thing is to make the toilette we keep our fresh water for minor ablutions in an old wine cask from bristol the colour of the liquid is a tawny yellow it is in fact weak sherry and water for the major ablutions we have the ships bucket and the sea and a good stock of rough towels to finish with the next thing is breakfast on deck when we can catch fish which is very seldom though we are well provided with lines and bait we fall upon the spoil immediately at other times we range through our sea stores eating anything we like cooked anyhow we like after breakfast we have two words to say to our box of peaches nectarines and grapes from the hospitable countryhouse then the bedding is brought up to air the deck is cleaned the breakfast things are taken away the pipes cigars and french novels are produced from the cabin mr migott coils himself up in a corner of the cockpit and i perch upon the taffrail and the studies of the morning begin they end invariably in smalltalk beer and sleep so the time slips away cosily till it is necessary to think about dinner  now all is activity on board the tomtit except the man at the helm every one is occupied with preparations for the banquet of the day the potatoes onions and celery form one department the fire and solid cookery another the washing of plates and dishes knives and forks a third the laying of the cloth on deck a fourth the concoction of sauces and production of bottles from the cellar a fifth no man has any particular department assigned to him the most active republican of the community for the time being plunges into the most active work and the others follow as they please  the exercise we get is principally at this period of the day and consists in incessant dropping down from the deck to the cabin and incessant scrambling up from the cabin to the deck the dinner is a long business but what do we care for that we have no appointments to keep no visitors to interrupt us and nothing in the world to do but to tickle our palates wet our whistles and amuse ourselves in any way we please dinner at last over it is superfluous to say that the pipes become visible again and that the taking of forty winks is only a prohibited operation on the part of the man at the helm  as for teatime it is entirely regulated by the wants and wakefulness of mr migott who since the death of dr johnson is the most desperate drinker of tea in all england when the cups and saucers are cleared away a conversazione is held in the cockpit sam dobbs is the best listener of the company dick dobbs who has been a yachtsman is the jester bob dobbs the merchant sailor is the teller of adventures and my friend and i keep the ball going smartly in all sorts of ways till it gets dark and a great drought falls upon the members of the conversazione then if the mermaids are anywhere near us they may smell the fragrant fumes which tell of sacrifice to bacchus and may hear shortly afterwards the muse of song invoked by cheerful topers thus the dark hours roll on jovial till the soft influences of sleep descend upon the tuneful choir and the cabin receives its lodgers for the night  this is the general rule of life on board the tomtit exceptional incidents of all kindssaving seasickness to which nobody on board is liableare never wanting to vary existence pleasantly from day to day sometimes mr migott gets on from taking a nap to having a dream and records the fact by a screech of terror which rings through the vessel and wakes the sleeper himself who always asks whats that ehnever believes that the screech has not come from somebody elsenever knows what he has been dreaming ofand never fails to go to sleep again before the rest of the ships company have half done expostulating with him  sometimes a little interesting indigestion appears among us by way of change dick dobbs for example who is as bilious as an indian nabob is seen to turn yellow at the helm and to steer with a glazed eye is asked what is the matter replies that he has the boil terrible bad on his stomach is instantly treated by jollins md as followstwo teaspoonfuls of essence of ginger two dessertspoonfuls of brown brandy two table spoonfuls of strong tea pour down patients throat very hot and smack his back smartly to promote the operation of the draught what follows the cure of dick how simple is medicine when reduced to its first principles  another source of amusement is provided by the ships we meet with  whenever we get near enough we hail the largest merchantmen in the most peremptory manner as coolly as if we had three decks under us and an admiral on board the large ships for the most part paralysed by our audacity reply meekly sometimes we meet with a foreigner and get answered by inarticulate yelling or disrespectful grins but this is a rare case the general rule is that we maintain our dignity unimpaired all down the channel then again when no ships are near there is the constant excitement of consulting our charts and wondering where we are every man of us has a different theory on this subject every time he looks at the chart but no man rudely thrusts his theory on another or aspires to govern the ideas of the rest in virtue of his superior obstinacy in backing his own opinion did i not assert a little while since that we were a pure republic and is not this another and a striking proof of it  in such pursuits and diversions as i have endeavoured to describe the time passes quickly happily and adventurously until we ultimately succeed at four in the morning on the sixth day of our cruise in discovering the light of the longships lighthouse which we know to be situated off the lands end we are now only some sevenandtwenty miles from the scilly islands and the discovery of the lighthouse enables us to set our course by the compass cleverly enough the wind which has thus far always remained against us falls on the afternoon of this sixth day to a dead calm but springs up again in another and a favourable quarter at eleven oclock at night by daybreak we are all on the watch for the scilly islands not a sign of them the sun rises it is a magnificent morning the favourable breeze still holds we have been bowling along before it since eleven the previous night and ought to have sighted the islands long since but we sight nothing no land is visible anywhere all round the horizon  where are we have we overshot scillyand is the next land we are likely to see ushant or finisterre nobody knows the faces of the brothers dobbs darken and they recall to each other how they deprecated from the first this rash venturing into unknown waters we hail two ships piteously to ask our way the two ships cant tell us we unroll the charts and differ in opinion over them more remarkably than ever the dobbses grimly opine that it is no use looking at charts when we have not got a pair of parallels to measure by and are all ignorant of the scientific parts of navigation mr migott and i manfully cheer the drooping spirits of the crew with guinnesss stout and put a smiling face upon it but in our innermost hearts we think of columbus and feel for him  the last resource is to post a man at the masthead if so lofty an expression may be allowed in reference to so little a vessel as the tomtit to keep a lookout up the rigging swarms dick the bilious in the lowest spiritsstrains his eyes over the waters and suddenly hails the gaping deck with a joyous shout the runaway islands are caught at lasthe sees them ahead of ushe has no objection to make to the course we are steeringnothing particular to say but crack onand nothing in the world to do but slide down the rigging again contentment beams once more on the faces of sam dick and bob mr migott and i say nothing but we look at each other with a smile of triumph we remember the injurious doubts of the crew when the charts were last unrolledand think of columbus again and feel for him more than ever  soon the islands are visible from the deck and by noon we have run in as near them as we dare without local guidance they are lowlying and picturesque in an artistic point of view but treacherouslooking and full of peril to the wary nautical eye horrible jagged rocks and sinister swirlings and foamings of the sea seem to forbid the approach to them the tomtit is hove toour ensign is run up halfmast highand we fire our doublebarrelled gun fiercely for a pilot  the pilot arrives in a long serviceablelooking boat with a wild handsome darkhaired son and a silent solemn old man for his crew he himself is lean wrinkled hungrylooking his eyes are restless with excitement and his tongue overwhelms us with a torrent of words spoken in a strange accent but singularly free from provincialisms and bad grammar he informs us that we must have been set to the northward in the night by a current and goes on to acquaint us with so many other things with such a fidgety sparkling of the eyes and such a ceaseless patter of the tongue that he fairly drives me to the fore part of the vessel out of his way smoothly we glide along parallel with the jagged rocks and the swirling eddies till we come to a channel between two islands and sailing through that make for a sandy isthmus where we see some houses and a little harbour this is hugh town the chief place in st marys which is the largest island of the scilly group we jump ashore in high glee feeling that we have succeeded in carrying out the purpose of our voyage in defiance of the prognostications of all our prudent friends at sea or on shore how sweet is triumph even in the smallest things  bating the one fact of the wind having blown from an unfavourable quarter unvarying good fortune had thus far accompanied our cruise and our luck did not desert us when we got on shore at st marys we went happily for our own comfort to the hotel kept by the master of the packet plying between hugh town and penzance by our landlord and his cordial wife and family we were received with such kindness and treated with such care that we felt really and truly at home before we had been half an hour in the house and by way of farther familiarizing us with scilly at first sight who should the resident medical man turn out to be but a gentleman whom i knew these were certainly fortunate auspices under which to begin our short sojourn in one of the remotest and wildest places in the queens dominions     iv   the scilly islands seem at a rough glance to form a great irregular circle enclosing a kind of lagoon of sea communicating by various channels with the main ocean all around  the circumference of the largest of the group is as we heard not more than thirteen miles five of the islands are inhabited the rest may be generally described as masses of rock wonderfully varied in shape and size inland in the larger islands the earth where it is not planted or sown is covered with heather and with the most beautiful ferns potatoes used to be the main product of scilly but the disease has appeared lately in the island crops and the potatoes have suffered so severely that when we filled our sack for the return voyage we were obliged to allow for twothirds of our supply proving unfit for use the views inland are chiefly remarkable as natural panoramas of land and seathe two always presenting themselves intermixed in the loveliest varieties of form and colour on the coast the granite rocks though not notably high take the most wildly and magnificently picturesque shapes they are rent into the strangest chasms and piled up in the grandest confusion and they look down every here and there on the loveliest little sandy bays where the sea in calm weather is as tenderly blue and as limpid in its clearness as the mediterranean itself the softness and purity of the climate may be imagined when i state that in the winter none of the freshwater pools are strongly enough frozen to bear being skated on the balmy sea air blows over each little island as freely as it might blow over the deck of a ship  the people have the same great merit which i had previously observed among their cornish neighboursthe merit of good manners we two strangers were so little stared at as we walked about that it was almost like being on the continent the pilot who had taken us into hugh town harbour we found to be a fair specimen as regarded his excessive talkativeness and the purity of his english of the islanders generally the longest tellers of very long stories so far as my experience goes are to be found in scilly ask the people the commonest question and their answer generally exhausts the whole subject before you can say another word their anxiety whenever we had occasion to inquire our way to guard us from the remotest chance of missing it and the honest pride with which they told us all about local sights and marvels formed a very pleasant trait in the general character wherever we went we found the natural kindness and natural hospitality of the people always ready to welcome us  strangely enough in this softest and healthiest of climates consumption is a prevalent disease if i may venture on an opinion after a very short observation of the habits of the people i should say that distrust of fresh air and unwillingness to take exercise were the chief causes of consumptive maladies among the islanders i longed to break windows in the main street of hugh town as i never longed to break them anywhere else one lovely afternoon i went out for the purpose of seeing how many of the inhabitants of the place had a notion of airing their bedrooms i found two houses with open windowsall the rest were fast closed from top to bottom as if a pestilence were abroad instead of the softest purest seabreeze that ever blew then again as to walking the people ask you seriously when you inquire your way on foot whether you are aware that the destination you want to arrive at is three miles off as for a pedestrian excursion round the largest islanda circuit of thirteen mileswhen we talked of performing that feat in the hearing of a respectable inhabitant he laughed at the idea as incredulously as if we had proposed a swimming match to the cornish coast when people will not give themselves the first great chance of breathing healthily and freely as often as they can who can wonder that consumption should be common among them  in addition to our other pieces of good fortune we were enabled to profit by a very kind invitation from the gentleman to whom the islands belong to stay with him at his house built on the site of an ancient abbey and surrounded by gardens of the most exquisite beauty  to the firm and benevolent rule of the present proprietor of scilly the islanders are indebted for the prosperity which they now enjoy it was not the least pleasant part of a very delightful visit to observe for ourselves under our hosts guidance all that he had done and was doing for the welfare and the happiness of the people committed to his charge from what we had heard and from what we had previously observed for ourselves we had formed the most agreeable impressions of the social condition of the islanders and we now found the best of these impressions more than confirmed when the present proprietor first came among his tenantry he found them living miserably and ignorantly he has succoured reformed and taught them and there is now probably no place in england where the direr hardships of poverty are so little known as in the scilly islands  i might write more particularly on this topic but i am unwilling to run the risk of saying more on the subject of these good deeds than the gooddoer himself would sanction and besides i must remember that the object of this narrative is to record a holidaycruise and not to enter into details on the subject of scilly details which have already been put into print by previous travellers let me only add then that our sojourn in the islands terminated with the close of our stay in the house of our kind entertainer it had been blowing a gale of wind for two days before our departure and we put to sea with a doubledreefed mainsail and with more doubts than we liked to confess to each other about the prospects of the return voyage                                       however lucky we had been hitherto and lucky we were to continue to the end before we had been long at sea the wind began to get capricious then to diminish almost to a calm then towards evening to blow again steadily and strongly from the very quarter of all others most favourable to our return voyage if this holds was the sentiment of the brothers dobbs as we were making things snug for the night we shall be back again at mangerton before we have had time to get half through our victuals and drink  the wind did hold and more than hold and the tomtit flew in consequence as if she was going to give up the sea altogether and take to the sky for a change our homeward run was the most perfect contrast to our outward voyage no tacking no need to study the charts no laggard luxurious dining on the cabin hatch it was too rough for anything but picnicking in the cockpit jammed into a corner with our plates on our knees i had to make the grog with one hand and clutch at the nearest rope with the othermr migott holding the bowl while i mixed and the man at the helm holding mr migott as for reading it was hopeless to try it for there was breeze enough to blow the leaves out of the bookand singing was not to be so much as thought of for the moment you opened your mouth the wind rushed in and snatched away the song immediately the nearer we got to mangerton the faster we flew my last recollection of the sea dates at the ghostly time of midnight the wind had been increasing and increasing since sunset till it contemptuously blew out our fire in the cabin as if the stove with its artful revolving chimney had been nothing but a farthing rushlight when i climbed on deck we were already in the bristol channel  that last view at sea was the grandest view of the voyage ragged black clouds were flying like spectres all over the sky the moonlight streaming fitful behind them one great ship shadowy and mysterious was pitching heavily towards us from the land backward out at sea streamed the red gleam from the lighthouse on lundy island and marching after us magnificently to the music of the howling wind came the great rollers from the atlantic rushing in between hartland point and lundy turning over and over in long black hills of water with the seething spray at their tops sparkling in the moonshine it was a fine breathless sensation to feel our sturdy little vessel tearing along through this heavy seajumping stern up as the great waves caught herdashing the water gaily from her bows at the return dipand holding on her way as bravely and surely as the largest yacht that ever was built after a long look at the sublime view around us my friend and i went below again and in spite of the noise of wind and sea managed to fall asleep the next event was a call from deck at halfpast six in the morning informing us that we were entering mangerton bay by seven oclock we were alongside the jetty again after a run of only fortythree hours from the scilly islands                                       thus our cruise ended and thus we falsified the predictions of our prudent friends and came back with our right side uppermost heres luck to you gentlemenwas the toast which our honest sailorbrothers proposed when we met together later in the day and pledged each other in a parting cup heres luck we answered on our sideluck to the brothers dobbs and thanks besides for hearty companionship and faithful service and here in the last glass with one cheer moreheres luck to the vessel that carried us our lively little tomtit tiny home of joyous days may thy seafortunes be happy and thy trim sails be set prosperously for many a year still to the favouring breeze  with
