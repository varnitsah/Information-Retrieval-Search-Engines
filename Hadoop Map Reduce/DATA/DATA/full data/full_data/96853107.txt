flagship began the firing     preface   fighting in cuban waters although a complete story in itself forms the third volume of the old glory series tales depicting the various campaigns in our late war with spain  in under dewey at manila we followed larry russells adventures on board of the flagship olympia during the memorable contest off cavite in a young volunteer in cuba we marched and fought with ben russell in that notable campaign leading up to the surrender of santiago and in the present volume are narrated the haps and mishaps of walter russell who joins commodore schleys flagship the brooklyn and sails with the flying squadron from hampton roads to key west thence to cienfuegos and at last succeeds in bottling up admiral cerveras fleet in santiago bay the long blockade and the various bombardments are described and then follow the particulars of that masterly battle on the part of the north atlantic squadron which led to the total destruction of the spanish warships  walter russells bravery may seem overdrawn but such is far from being a fact that our sailors were heroes in those days we have but to remember the sinking of the merrimac the winslow affair and a score of deeds of equal daring the hour makes the man and the opportunity likewise makes the hero walter was brave but he was no more so than hundreds of others who stood ready to lay down their lives in the cause of humanity and for the honor of old glory like his two brothers his religious belief was of the practical kind and he went into battle convinced that so long as he did his duty according to the dictates of his conscience an allwise and allpowerful providence would guide him and watch over him  the author cannot refrain from saying a word about the historical portions of the present work they have been gleaned from the best available authorities including the reports of admiral sampson commodore schley and a number of captains who took part in the contest also the personal narratives of one man who was on board the merrimac at the time that craft was sunk and of a number who have made the brooklyn their home for several years past and who will probably remain on the pride of the flying squadron for some time to come  in presenting this third volume the author begs to thank both critics and the public for the cordial reception accorded to the previous volumes and trusts that the present story will meet with equal commendation  edward stratemeyer  newark nj  march 1 1899     contents   i walter determines to enter the navy  ii a visit to the

chapter i  walter determines to enter the navy   well walter i suppose the newspapers are going like hot cakes this morning  they are mr newell everybody wants the news i ran out of globes and heralds before seven oclock and sent dan down for fifty more of each  that was right its a windfall for us newsdealers as well as a glorious victory to match it makes me think of my old war days when i was aboard of the carondelet under captain walke we didnt sink so many ships as dewey has at manila but we sank some and smashed many a shore battery in the bargain along the banks of the mississippi what does that extra have to say and phil newell the onelegged civilwar naval veteran who was also proprietor of the newsstand took the sheet which walter russell his clerk handed out  there is not much additional news as yet answered walter one of the sensational papers has it that dewey is now bombarding manila but the news is not confirmed but it is true that our squadron sunk every one of the spanish warshipsand that i reckon is enough for one victory  true my lad true but there is nothing like keeping at em when you have em on the run that is the way we did down south perhaps dewey is waiting for additional instructions from washington i hope he didnt suffer much of a loss some papers say he came off scot free but that seems too good to be true  the news makes me feel more than ever like enlisting continued the boy after a pause during which he served out half a dozen newspapers to as many customers what a glorious thing it must be to fight like that and come out on top  glorious doesnt express it walter why if it wasnt for this game leg of mine and my age being against me id go over to the navyyard today and reÃ«nlist keelhaul me if i wouldnt  but what of the stand  the stand could take care of itselfuntil the dons were given the thrashing they deserve for making the cubans suffer beyond all reason phil newell threw back his head and gave a laugh that puts me in mind of something that happened when the civil war started a young lawyer in new york locked up his office and pasted a notice on his door gone to the front will be back when the war is over id have to put up something similar wouldnt i  i wish you and i could go together mr newell  so do i walter but im over sixty now and they want young blood by the way what of that brother of yours down in new york  ben has joined the militia of that state and is now at camp black waiting to be sworn into the united states service i wish he had come on to boston  well uncle sam wants soldiers as well as sailors or he wouldnt call for a hundred and twentyfive thousand volunteers but give me the deck or gunroom of a warship every time nothing finer in the world i served for nearly ten years and i know  walter smiled and then waited on several additional customers my youngest brother larry takes to the ocean he answered he is out on the pacific now somewhere between the hawaiian islands and hong kong he was always crazy for a boat when we were at home in buffalo together and spent all his spare time on lake erie  going to hong kong eh thats not so far from the philippines it is a pity he is not with commodore dewey it would be a feather in his cap when he got home  a steady stream of customers for five minutes broke off the conversation at this point and throwing down his newspaper phil newellhe never wanted to be called philipentered the stand to help his young assistant the stand was situated in the heart of boston just outside of one of the leading hotels and trade at this hour in the morning eight oclock was always brisk  when there came a lull later on walter turned again to his employer mr newell what if i do enlist can you spare me he questioned  what do you really mean it walter  i do sir as you know ive been thinking the matter over ever since this war with spain started  but youve got to have your guardians consent or they wont take you  ive got it in my pocket now i wrote to him last week and he answered that as ben had already joined the soldiers i could do as i pleased but i mustnt blame him if i was killed  which you wouldnt be likely to do if you were killed dead so to speak laughed phil newell then he slapped walter on the back for twenty odd years on land had not taken his seadog manners from him enlist my lad enlist by all means if you feel it your duty of course i dont like to lose such a handy clerk but uncle sam can have you and welcome  didnt you say there was a young man named gimpwell looking for this position  yes and he wants it badly for he has a sick sister to support  has he any experience  oh yes he tended a railroad stand for several years  then perhaps you could break him in without much troubleif i went away  do you want to go at once  if i am to enlist then it seems to me the quicker the better i see by the papers that some of our warships are still at hampton roads and key west but there is no telling when they will start for cuban waters besides ive been thinking that if i could manage it i should like to get aboard of the brooklyn the flagship of commodore schleys flying squadron which is now at hampton roads awaiting orders  its not so easy to pick your ship my lad however if you wish you can go over to the navyyard this afternoon and see what you can doand ill go along and leave dan in charge here concluded phil newell  walter russell was one of three brothers of whom ben was the eldest and larry the youngest their home had been in buffalo where at the death of their mother a widow they had been turned over to the care of their stepuncle mr job dowling an eccentric old bachelor whose prime object in life was to hoard up money  in the two volumes previous to this entitled respectively under dewey at manila and a young volunteer in cuba i related how the boys found it impossible to remain under job dowlings roof and how they ran away each to seek fortune as he might find it larry drifted first to san francisco and then to honolulu the principal city of the hawaiian islands where he shipped on a vessel bound for hong kong from this ship he was cast overboard with a yankee friend named luke striker and both were picked up by the flagship olympia of the asiatic squadron and taken to manila bay there to serve most gallantly under the naval commander whose name has since become a household word everywhere as walter had intimated larry was a sailor by nature and it was likely that he would follow the sea as long as he lived  ben and walter had gone eastward but at middletown in new york state they had separated walter to drift to boston and ben to make his way to new york at the latter city the eldest of the russell brothers had secured employment in a hardware establishment but this place was burned out and then ben enlisted in the 71st regiment of new york while his intimate friend gilbert pennington joined roosevelts rough riders and both went to cuba there to fight valorously in that campaign which led to the surrender of santiago and caused spain to sue for peace  as walter had written to larry the recital of the formers adventures in getting from middletown to boston would fill a volume he had stolen a ride on the cars from middletown to albany and during this wild trip his hat blew off and was not recovered he was put off the train just outside of the capital city and stopping at a farmhouse to inquire the way had his clothing torn by a bulldog that was more than anxious to get at what was beneath the garments walter hardly knew what to do when a tramp put in an appearance and sent a welldirected stone at the dogs head causing the beast to slink away the tramp introduced himself as raymond cass a bricklayer out of luck and bound for boston on foot he proposed that they journey together and walter rather hesitatingly consented they moved eastward in company for two days when on awakening one morning walter found raymond cass missing the boys coat was also gone and with it his entire capitalfortyseven cents  the pair had made their bed in the haymow of a large barn and while walter was searching for the tramp the owner of the place came up and demanded to know what the youth was doing on his premises walters tale was soon told and farmer hardell agreed to give him a weeks work in his dairy one of the dairymen being sick for this walter received four dollars and an old hat and a coat in addition  leaving cornberry the name of the hamlet walter had struck out once more for boston but this time steering clear of all tramps of the raymond cass type or otherwise he was sparing of his money and the first day out earned his dinner and a packedup lunch for supper by putting in two panes of glass for an old lady who had waited for a week for a travelling glazier to come around and do the job in addition to this the lad worked for two days at a village blacksmiths establishment during the absence of the regular helper who had gone to his aunts funeral in another place and also found a regular position with a florist who had a number of large greenhouses up the charles river walter was not used to working where there was so much glass and on the third day he allowed a stepladder he was using to slip the ladder crashed through several hotbed frames and poor walter was discharged on the spot without a cent of pay  the boys next move had been to the river where he had obtained a position on a freight steamboat his duty was to truck freight on and off and the work blistered his hands and gave him many a backache but he stuck to it for two weeks thereby earning fourteen dollars and with this capital entered boston  walter had not expected an easy time finding a situation in the hub but neither had he anticipated the repeated failures that one after another stared him in the face for over a week he tramped up and down without so much as a smell of an opening as he afterwards wrote to his brothers in the meanwhile his money diminished rapidly until more than twothirds of it was gone  a deed of kindness had obtained for him the position with phil newell chancing to walk along school street one afternoon he had seen two boys beating a small boy unmercifully the small boy had turned into province street and the big boys had followed and here they had thrown the little fellow down and were on the point of kicking him when walter rushed up and flung both back you brutes to attack such a small boy he had cried clear out or ill call a policeman and have you both locked up  we told him to keep back at de newspaper office growled one of the big fellows do it again dan brown and well give it to you worse and then as walter advanced once more both took to their heels and disappeared  dan brown had been very grateful and questionings had elicited the information that the lad worked for phil newell as a paper carrier and to do errands his regular clerk dick borden left yesterday dan had continued perhaps you can get the job and walter had lost no time in following the small youth to newells place of business here dans story was told and the lad put in a good word for walter with the result that the youth was taken for a week on trial how well walter pleased the old naval veteran we have already seen he had now occupied the place as head clerk for nearly two months and his salary had been increased from four dollars a week to six he boarded with dans mother in a little suite of rooms on a modest side street not a great distance from the common  it must not be supposed that job dowling who held a good deal of money in trust for the boys had allowed them to run off without making an effort to bring them back larry was out of his reach but ben and walter were not and the miserly man had descended upon ben in new york and tried his best to make things warm as ben had mentioned in a letter to larry but job dowling had overreached himself by attempting to sell a watch and some jewelry which had belonged originally to mr and mrs russell heirlooms which were not to be disposed of under any circumstances on his trip to new york after ben the articles had been stolen from him at the postofficesomething that had so frightened job dowling that he had consented to bens enlisting in the army with scarcely a murmur fearful the youth might otherwise have him brought to book for what had happened a vigorous search had been made for the thief but he was not found later on when ben was in the army job dowling received information that caused him to reach the conclusion that the thief had gone to boston the miserly guardian of the boys returned to his home in buffalo and as much worried as ever wrote to walter to keep an eye open for the missing property walter did as requested but in such a large place as the hub the youth had little hope of ever seeing the precious heirlooms again     chapter ii  a visit to the navyyard   there was a rush of business at the newsstand between twelve and one oclock but shortly after one this died away and inside of half an hour phil newell told walter that they might be on their wayif you are bound to enlist in uncle sams service he added  walter made sure that the paper containing job dowlings permission for him to enter the navy was safe in his coat pocket and then announced his readiness to depart the owner of the stand called up dan brown and gave him a few directions and in another minute newell and walter had boarded a charlestown car and were off  i havent been over to the navyyard for several years remarked phil newell as they rode along i used to know several of the boys that were there but theyve grown too old for the service i reckon the yard is a busy place these days  and a busy place it proved to be as they turned into chelsea street and moved along the solid granite wall which separates the yard from the public thoroughfare from beyond came the creaking of hoists and the ringing of countless hammers and anvils for the government employees were hard at work fitting out a warship or two and converting several private vessels into naval craft  i dont know if im just right about this went on phil newell as they headed for one of the numerous buildings near the wall after being passed by a guard it may be that they want to keep strangers out now the war is on and youll have to go elsewhere to sign articles but i know old caleb walton is here and hell tell me all he can and set us straight  walters heart beat violently for he began to realize that the step he was about to take was a serious one who knew but that after getting into the navy he might be sent to the philippines or to the coast of spain already there was some talk of carrying the war into the enemys home waters  but i dont care he said to himself if larry can ship for hong kong i guess im safe in shipping to anywhere but i do hope i can get on the brooklyn or on some other ship of the flying squadron  hi there phil newell what brought you here you old landlubber came a cry from their left and phil newell turned as swiftly as his wooden leg permitted to find himself confronted by the very individual he had started out to find  caleb walton he ejaculated joyfully and held out his bronzed hand i just came in to see you here is a young friend of mine who wants to sign articles under uncle sam do you think you can take him in  take him in caleb walton held out his hand brown and as tough as a piece of leather sure we can take him in if hes soundand glad to get him he gave walters hand a grip that made every bone crack so you want to enlist eh go right over to yonder office and theyll soon put you through a course of sprouts and he laughed goodnaturedly  but hold on caleb interposed newell as the seaman was about to show walter the way he dont want to sign articles and go just anywhere he would like to get aboard the brooklyn  that is what half of all who come here want answered caleb walton i reckon they think commodore schleys flying squadron is going to settle the whole war by going after that spanish fleet said to be at cadiz or thereabouts well the lad better come with me i belong to the brooklyn now  you came from both phil newell and walter simultaneously  i thought you were stationed here continued the woodenlegged man  i was but ive just received orders to join the brooklyn and bring at least fifteen men with me it seems they are shorthanded and cant get the men at norfolk if this lad wants to go with me now is his chance whats his handle  my name is walter russell sir butbut are you going to join the brooklyn at once stammered walter never having dreamed that he would be taken away on the spot  uncle sam doesnt wait long when he picks his man replied the old gunner for such caleb walton was orders were to leave boston tonight but i fancy well be kept until tomorrow night for we are shy three men not counting you come on and he led the way to the building he had previously pointed out  hes all right and youre in luck whispered phil newell when he got the chance cotton to caleb walton and youll have a friend worth the making how true were newells words the chapters to follow will prove  the building to which caleb walton led them was one in which were situated the main business offices of the yard this was now a busy place and they had to fairly push their way through the crowd of seamen officers and workmen who kept coming and going on one errand or another several telephones were ringing and from a corner came the steady clickclick of a telegraph sounder  uncle sam has his shirt sleeves rolled up and is pitching in whispered caleb walton here we are captain line here is another man for my party  hes rather a boy rejoined captain line as he gave walter a searching glance is your father with you  my father is dead answered walter softly here is my guardians consent and he handed over the sheet  that seems to be correct walton take him over to the examination room and hurry up for i must catch the fourfifty train for new york  the course of sprouts had begun and almost before he knew it walter had been passed upon as ablebodied time was pressing and in a quarter of an hour the youth received a slip of paper signed and sealed by captain line  that is good for your passage to fortress monroe he said you will make the journey in company with walton and a number of others when you get there you will report to lieutenant lee who will have you transferred to the brooklynunless the flagship has already sailed in which case you will be assigned to some other ship  and when do i start sir  walton will have the orders inside of the next hour go with him and he will tell you what to do then came a bang of the curtain to a rollertop desk a shoving back of a revolving chair and in a twinkle captain line had disappeared from view truly uncle sam and all under him were rushing things  walter wished very much to visit the dry dock and the great west basin filled as both were with vessels in various stages of construction alteration or repair but he felt if he was to leave that night he must be getting back to boston and to his boardinghouse to pack his ditty box as phil newell had dubbed his valise for all such receptacles are called ditty boxes in the navy  all right walter you go ahead said newell ill stay with caleb and let you know just when you are to leave so you wont be left behind and in a moment more the youth had run out of the navyyard and was on board of another car he made one transfer and in less than half an hour entered mrs browns home  why mr russell what brings you queried dans mother surprised at his appearance for he rarely showed himself during the day excepting at the dinner and the supper hours  ive enlisted mrs brown and im to get off tonight or tomorrow he answered you can let mr keefe have my room now im glad that it wont be left empty on your hands  so am i mr russell for a poor widow cant afford to have a room vacant long replied mrs brown with a faint smile so you have really entered the navy well i wish you all the luck in the world and i hope you will come out of the war aacommodore or something like that and she wrung his hand  walters belongings were few and soon packed away in his valise then he ran downstairs again and bid mrs brown goodby and settled up with her ill write to you and dan some time he said on parting  well did you make it was dans question when walter appeared at the newsstand  i did dan and the protÃ©gÃ© of uncle sam told his youthful friend the particulars  im glad you got on the brooklyn said dan with a shake of his curly head shes going to lick the spaniards out of their boots see if she aint and his earnestness made walter laugh dan was but eleven yet he read the newspapers as closely as do many grown folks  the afternoon papers were now coming in and trade picked up so that walter had to help behind the counter while he was at work a tall thin boy sauntered up and gazed at him doubtfully  thats george gimpwell whispered dan didnt the boss say something about hiring him  he did dan call him over  the errand boy did so russell wants to see you he explained  i believe you were speaking to mr newell about this situation began walter  welleri asked him if he had any opening i want work the worst way sighed george gimpwell of course i dont want to do you out of your job  thats all right ive just enlisted in the navy replied walter and he could not help but feel proud over the words so if you want this situation you had best remain around here until mr newell gets back  i will george gimpwells face brightened so youve enlisted i wanted to do that but i was too tall for my weight so they told me  so youve enlisted broke in a gentleman standing by glad to hear it young man it does you credit and buying a magazine he caught walter by the hand and wished him well soon it became noised around on the block that newells clerk was going to join the brooklyn and half a dozen including the clerk of the hotel came out to see him about it in those days anybody connected with our army or navy was quite a hero and somebody to be looked up to people unconsciously told themselves  it was after seven oclock and walter was wondering if anything unusual had delayed his employer when phil newell hove into appearance its all right my lad dont worry he said at once you dont leave until tomorrow noon you are to meet caleb walton at the new york and new england railroad depot at exactly eleven oclock and all of the others of the crowd are to be there too the government wants to get you down to norfolk as soon as it can and will consequently send you by rail instead of by water  hurrah that will make a jolly trip cried walter if only i could stop off at new york take a run out to camp black and see ben  i doubt if youll be given time to stop anywhere time seems to be so precious caleb walton thinks the flying squadron will up anchors before another week is out  well i dont care how quickly they leaveafter i am on board laughed the youth much relieved that nothing had occurred whereby he had been left behind  george gimpwell now came up again and soon he was engaged to take walters place phil newell promised him five dollars weekly and as walter had gotten six the goodhearted newsdealer put the extra dollar on dans salary much to that lads delight  eight oclock found walter at the stand alone and it was then that he penned the letter mailed to ben as mentioned in a previous volume stating he had enlisted and was making a strong pull to get on the brooklyn i wont say i am on her until its a fact he thought as he sealed up the communication stamped it and placed it in the corner letterbox  the stand was located in a niche of the hotel and was open only in the front above the counter at night this space was closed by letting down two large shutters attached to several hinges and ropes  i reckon this is the last time ill put these shutters down thought walter as he brought one down on the run he was about to drop the second when a burly man rather shabbily dressed sauntered up and asked for one of the weekly sporting papers  im thinking of going to the theatre he said somewhat unsteadily and now walter learned by a whiff of his breath that he had been drinking whats the best variety show in town  ill give it up said the youth laughingly i havent been to a show since i came to boston and thats a number of weeks ago  humph what do you do with yourself nights  im here up to eight or half past and after that i either go home or to one of the public reading rooms or to the young mens christian association hall  humph that must be dead slow the man lurched heavily against the counter what time is it now  about half past eight i havent any watch so i cant tell you exactly  ive got a watch right here mumbled the newcomer still leaning heavily on the counter here it is but your light is so low i cant see the hands turn it up  walter obligingly complied and the fellow tried again to see the time but failed strike a match he went on i aint going to no theatre if its as late as you say it is  walter did not like the mans manner but not caring to enter into any dispute he lit a match as requested and held it down close to the timepiece which lay in the mans open palm  only eighttwenty grumbled the fellow slowly i knew you was off you dontwhats up and suddenly he straightened himself and stared at walter  i want to know where you got that watch demanded the youth excitedly  that watch the man fell back a pace what do youahemwhy do you ask that question boy  because i know that watch was walters ready reply it was stolen from my uncle in new york only a few weeks ago  was it the mans face changed color youyoure mistaken boy he faltered and fell back still further and then as walter leaped over the counter he took to his heels and started down the halfdeserted street at the best speed at his command     chapter iii  a chase and its result   walter knew that watch which had belonged first to his father and then his mother quite well but if there was anything needed to convince him that there was no mistake in the identification it was furnished by the hasty and unceremonious manner in which the partly intoxicated wearer was endeavoring to quit the scene  if he was honest he wouldnt run thought the youth ten to one hes the thief who took the grip from uncle job he started after the fleeing one come back here he shouted stop thief  but the man did not stop instead he tried to run the faster but he did not turn any corners and consequently aided by the electric lights walter could see him for quite a distance ahead  the youth ran but a few yards then turned and clashed back to the stand bang the second shutter came down with a crash and in a trice he had the padlock secured then off he set satisfied that a form in the distance was the one he wanted to overtake  whats the matter questioned a policeman on the second corner as he clutched walter by the arm what are you running for  didnt i call out to catch the thief answered the youth sharply let me go if you werent so dead slow youd be doing something instead of standing there looking at the moon and on he went again the officer shaking his fist after him half of the opinion that walter was trying to joke him  at this hour of the evening the street was far from crowded and walter kept the man ahead in sight with comparative ease four blocks were covered when the fellow paused and looked back seeing he was being followed he turned and darted into a small side street here were a number of warehouses and several tenements the door to one of the latter stood open and he lost no time in seeking the shelter of the dark hallway  thats the time i made a bad break he muttered thickly when i came up to boston with that stuff i reckoned i was safe i wonder if hell follow me to here he had better not unless he wants a broken head  in the meantime walter had reached the corner of the side street and come to a halt the narrow thoroughfare was but dimly lighted and not a soul was in sight  he turned in herei am certain of that said the boy to himself more than likely he is in hiding in some dark corner i wonder if i hadnt better call an officer  with this intention he gazed around but no policeman was in view and he did not think it advisable to go back for the guardian of the peace before encountered he entered the side street slowly and cautiously peering into every nook and corner and behind every billboard box and barrel as he moved along  he had just passed the tenement where the man was in hiding when the sounds of muffled voices broke upon his ears and the front door was thrown back with a bang  who are you and what are you doing in here came in an unmistakable irish voice  excuse meii made a mistake was the answer and now walter recognized the tones of the fellow who had the watch i am looking for a man named harris  well he doesnt live hereso you had better get out  will youertell me who lives next door asked the man walter was after in a lower tone evidently wishing to gain time ere leaving the building  a man named casey and another named barton live there there aint a harris on the block if you  hold him please burst in walter mounting the tenement steps he has a watch that was stolen from my uncle  shut up boy answered the man fiercely my watch is my own and this is all a mistake  there is no mistake hold him will you  ive got him came from the gloom of the hallway i thought he was a sneak or something by the way he was tiptoeing around here  you are both of you crazy i never stole a thing in my life let go both of you and then the man began to struggle fiercely finally pushing the party in the hallway backward and almost sending walter headlong as he darted down the tenement steps and continued his flight along the side street  as walter went down he made a clutch at the mans watchchain or rather the chain which belonged among the russell heirlooms he caught the top guard and the chain parted one half remaining in the boys hand and the other fast to the timepiece  help me catch him gasped the youth as soon as he could get up his breast had struck the edge of one of the steps and he was momentarily winded  i will answered the man who lived in the tenement stop there he called out and set off in pursuit with walter beside him but the irishman was old and rheumatic and soon felt compelled to give up the chase i cant match ye he puffed and sank down on a step to rest and once again walter continued the chase alone  had the thief deck mumpers been perfectly sober he might have escaped with ease for he was a good runner and at this hour of the evening hidingplaces in such a city as boston with its many crooked thoroughfares were numerous but the liquor he had imbibed had made him hazy in his mind and he ran on and on with hardly any object in view excepting to put distance between himself and his pursuer  he was heading eastward and presently reached a wharf facing the harbor and not a great distance from the congress street bridge here there was a high board fence and a slatted gate which for some reason stood partly open without a second thought he slipped through the gateway slid the gate shut and snapped the hanging padlock into place  now hell have a job following me he chuckled i wonder what sort of a place ive struck and he continued on his way among huge piles of merchandise covered with tarpaulins  walter had come up at his best speed and was less than a hundred feet away when the gate was closed and locked  you rascal he shouted but deck mumpers paid no attention to his words now whats to do the boy asked himself dismally  he came up to the gate and examined it it was all of nine feet high and the palings were pointed at the top could he scale such a barrier  i must do it he muttered and thrust one hand through to a cross brace he ascended with difficulty and once slipped and ran a splinter into his wrist but undaunted he kept on until the top was gained then dropped to the planking of the wharf beyond  several arc lights high overhead lit up the wharf and he ran from one pile of merchandise to another half the wharf was thus covered when he suddenly came face to face with deck mumpers the thief had picked up a thick bale stick and without warning he raised this on high and brought it down with all force upon walters head the boy gave a groan threw up both hands and dropped like a lump of lead senseless  phew i wonder if ive finished him muttered the man anxiously didnt mean to hit him quite so hard but it was his own faulthe had no right to follow me he bent over walter and made a hasty examination hes breathing thats certain i must get away before a watchman shows up  he started to go then paused and bent over walter again with a dexterity acquired by long practice in his peculiar profession he turned out one pocket after another transferring the cash and other articles to his own clothing then as walter gave a long deep sigh as if about to awaken he took to his heels once more he was in no condition to climb the wharf fence as walter had done but helped himself over by the use of several boxes and was soon a long distance away  illustration he bent over walter again  when walter came to his senses and opened his eyes the glare from a bullseye lantern struck him and he saw a wharf watchman eyeing him curiously  what are you doing here young fellow were the watchmans words  iiwhere is he questioned the youth weakly  he who  the thiefthe man who struck me down  i havent seen anybody but you around here  a thief who has my uncles watch came in here and i followed him and he struck me down with a club whenhow long is it since you found me here  several minutes ago i thought you were drunk at first and was going to hand you over to an officer  i dont drink walter essayed to stand up but found himself too weak gracious my head is spinning around like a top he groaned  you must have got a pretty good rap to be knocked out like this commented the watchman kindly so the man was a thief its a pity he wasnt the one to be knocked down do you know the fellow  i would know himif we ever meet again but i fancy he wont let the grass grow under his feet after attacking me like this  ill take a run around the wharf and see if i can spot any stranger concluded the watchman and hurried off another watchman was aroused and both made a thorough investigation but of course nobody was brought to light  by the time the search was ended walter felt something like himself and arose slowly and allowed the watchmen to conduct him to their shanty at one side of the wharf here he bathed his face picked the splinter from his wrist and brushed up generally a cup of hot coffee from one of the watchmens cans braced him up still further  it must be ten oclock isnt it he asked  ten oclock came from the man who had found him i reckon that clip on the head has muddled you its about three oclock in the morning  three oclock in the morning repeated walter then i must have been lying out there for several hours that thief has escaped long ago and his face fell  yes hes had plenty of time if he did the deed as long ago as that did he have anything else besides your uncles watch  i dont know but its likely you see my uncle came to new york from buffalo to sell some heirlooms which were left to my brothers and myself when our folks died the heirlooms were in a travellingbag and consisted of the watch and chain two gold wedding rings and a diamond that a grandfather of mine once picked up in australia my uncle left his bag standing in the postoffice for a few minutes and when he got back the grip was gone the police hunted everywhere for the thief but all that could be discovered was that it looked as if the rascal had come to boston tonightor rather last eveninga man came up and showed the watch which i know only too well as it has a little horseshoe painted on the dial plate i tried to collar the fellow but he ran away and after stopping in a tenement house he came here now i suppose he is miles awayperhaps out of the city altogether  thats so yet there is no telling lad the best thing you can do is to report to the police without delayif you are able to do it  yes i guess i am able although my head aches a good bit i can tell you that i am much obliged for what you have done for me  oh thats all righthope you get your belongings replied the watchman and led the way to the gate which he unlocked soon walter was on the street and walking as rapidly as his condition permitted to the police station  at this hour of the night he found only a sergeant and several roundsmen in charge the sergeant listened with interest to what he had to say  i remember that caseit was reported to here from new york some time ago the pawnshops were ransacked for the jewelry and the watch but nothing was found so you are certain you would recognize the man again if you saw him  i amunless he altered his appearance a good deal he had a small dark moustache but otherwise he was cleanshaven  come into the rear office and look over our album of pickpockets and sneakthieves that is what this fellow most likely isand a peculiar one too no firstclass criminal would do this job as he is doing it  he drinks heavilyhe was partly intoxicated when i met him said walter as he followed the station official into a rear office  then that accounts for it a man cant be a really successful criminal unless he keeps his wits about him here is the album look it over carefully and let me know if you see anybody that looks like your man and he left walter to himself and reÃ«ntered the outer office to hear the reports of the roundsmen coming in  the book given to walter was a thick one filled with cards photos and tintypes of criminals under each picture was written a name usually accompanied by several aliases and also a number to correspond with the same number in the criminal register  gracious but they keep pretty good track of them thought walter as he turned over page after page who would think all these goodlooking men were wrongdoers some of them look a good deal more like ministers  walter had gone through half the book and the photographs were beginning to confuse his already aching head when a certain picture arrested his attention ive found him he cried out thats the fellow although he is minus that moustache of his  did you call asked the sergeant coming to the door  ive found him this is the man his name is given as deck mumpers alias foxy mumpers and swiller deck  if he is called swiller deck he must drink a good deal said the sergeant with a laugh you are sure of this identification  i am but he wants a moustache put on that picture  we take them barefaced if we can this photo was taken in brooklyn the officer turned to an official register deck mumpers age fortytwo height five feet seven inches weight one hundred and thirtytwo pounds round face big ears broad shoulders poor teeth sent to sing sing in 1892 for two years for robbery of scott diamonds a hard drinker when flush now wanted for several petty crimes in new york came originally from south boston where he was in the liquor business the sergeant turned again to walter i guess you have struck your man ill send out the alarm what is your address  i have just joined the navy and am bound for the brooklyn but i can leave you my uncles name and address and he can come on to boston from buffalo if its necessary  that will do then answered the sergeant  he brought forth a book in which to put down the details of the affair while he was writing walter slipped his hand into his pocket to see if the slip of paper he had received at the navyyard was still safe the paper was gone     chapter iv  on the way to the brooklyn   oh what luck  what is the matter now  my order for a railroad ticket from boston to fortress monroe is gone  is that true perhaps deck mumpers cleaned you out after he struck you down suggested the sergeant quickly feel in your pockets  walter did so and his face blanched he dideverythingmy money keys cashall are missing what in the world shall i do now  how much money did you have  about twenty dollars the main thing was that railroad ticket order if that is gone how am i to get to norfolk  was your name mentioned on the paper  yes sir  where was it to be presented any particular depot  yes the new york and new england railroad depot  then the best thing to do is to ring the railroad folks up and have the bearer of the order detained if the slip is presented went on the police officer and stepping to the telephone he rang up central and had the necessary connection made  is this the ticket office of the new york and new england railroad depot he questioned  yes came the reply over the wire  a navyyard order for a ticket from here to norfolk or fortress monroe has been stolen it is made out in the name of walter russell if it is presented hold the party having it and communicate with police headquarters  is the name walter russell was the excited query and walters heart began to sink as he seemed to feel what was coming  yes  that order has already been filled it was presented about ten oclock last night  ive missed it groaned the youth and dropped into a chair what will the navyyard people say to this when they hear of it  i dont see how they can blame you returned the sergeant kindly seeing as you were knocked senseless by the thief deck mumpers has got the best of it so far  he called through the telephone for a description of the party having the order and soon learned it must have been mumpers beyond a doubt  cant you telegraph to norfolk to have him arrested when he arrives asked walter suddenly  you dont think hell go all the way to norfolk do you smiled the police officer then he turned again to the telephone what kind of a ticket did that party get on the order he asked  firstclass with sleepers  he got a firstclass ticket ten to one hell not use it at all but sell the pasteboard at some cutrate ticket office right here in boston and then buy another ticket for somewhere else  i see cried walter but if the ticket was sold here could we trace it  it is not likely for many firstclass tickets are alike we might trace the sleepingcar checks but i doubt if mumpers will try to do anything with those  but he may use the ticket ventured walter hardly knowing what else to say  oh possibly ill have the men at the various stations keep an eye open for the rascal concluded the sergeant and after a few more words walter left the station  it must be confessed that the youth was considerably out of sorts i start off to recover some stolen property and end by losing more he groaned im not fit to join the navy or do anything and he gave a mountainous sigh  it was almost five oclock and knowing dan would soon be on hand with gimpwell to open the stand he walked slowly in that direction to keep up his courage he tried to whistle but the effort was a dismal failure walter was naturally very lighthearted but just now no one looking at his troubled face would have suspected this  reaching the stand he opened the shutters and put out the light which he had forgotten to extinguish soon the first bundles of papers came along and he sorted them over and arranged them for sale and for dans route the work was almost done when the carrier came along followed immediately by the new clerk  hullo i didnt know youd be here cried dan why didnt you come home last night mother expected you to use the room and you paid for it  i wish i had used the room answered walter and went over his tale in a few words for dan must be off to serve several men with newspapers before they themselves started off to their daily labors  say but thats too bad cried the errand boy ive got two dollars walter you can have the money if it will do you any good  thanks dan i want to see mr newell first but its kind of you to make the offer  id offer you something russell put in the new clerk but the fact is i havent even carfare had to tramp over from charlestown  phil newell put into appearance shortly before seven oclock coming a little earlier than usual to see that gimpwell got along all right calling him aside walter told of what had happened he was getting sick of telling the story but in this case there was no help for it  douse the toplights but youve run on a sunken rock and no mistake walter cried the old naval veteran so he cleaned you out completely eh  yes mr newell i dont care so much for the money but that order for the railroad ticket  its too had too bad phil newell ran his hand through his bushy hair i dont believe the navyyard authorities will issue a duplicate order  neither do i  you see some sailors wouldnt be none too good for to get such a paper and then sell it for what she would fetch  yes thats the worst part of it i shouldnt want them to think i waswas getting in on themor trying to do so  the best thing to do as far as i can see is to call on caleb walton and get his advice  where does he live  in charlestown only a few blocks from the bunker hill monument i dont know the number but its on hill street and i know the house  will you go with me if i havent the number  to be sure ill go with you just as soon as i can set the new clerk on his proper course  and mr newell would you mindthat is would you make me aa loan faltered walter  out with it my boy how much do you want i told you before id be your friend and what phil newell says he means every trip  you are very kind sir i dont know how much i want i had twenty dollars and thirtyfive cents and mr walton said that was more than enough to see me through until pay day came along  then here are twenty dollars the proprietor of the newsstand pulled a roll of small bills from his pocket and counted out the amount you can pay me back when you recover your money or else out of your pay money if they dont collar that thief have you had breakfast yet  no sir  then you had better get a bite while i instruct gimpwell ill be ready for you in quarter of an hour  fifteen minutes found them on the way taking a car which took them directly over to charlestown along the navyyard and up hill street  here we are cried phil newell as he stopped the car and just in time for there is caleb walton leaving his house now  what brings you up demanded the gunner when confronted well this is certainly a mess he continued after he had been told no im certain they wont issue a duplicate order for captain line is out of the city  but we might try and see what we can do insisted phil newell  to be sure come on and the three set off for the navyyard here it looked at first as if nothing could be gained but finally one of the higher officers took it upon his own shoulders to give walter a new order at the same time saying something about charging it up to the emergency account  well thats a big relief murmured walter on coming away i feel as if a thousand pounds were taken from my heart and he certainly looked it  i must leave you now said caleb walton be sure and be at the depot on time and take care of that new order  its pinned fast in my pocket said the youth if it goes so does my coat  on returning to the newsstand walter procured some paper and an envelope and in the readingroom of the hotel sat down and wrote a long letter to his uncle job dowling telling of his enlistment in the navy and of what had happened during the night i think you ought to come to boston he concluded if the police cant do anything a detective ought to be set on this deck mumpers track you are holding a good deal of money in trust for ben larry and me and for my part i would spend a good deal rather than see fathers watch and his and mothers wedding rings gone forevernot to mention grandfathers diamond which alone is worth at least two hundred dollars write to me concerning this and send the letter to the brooklyn off fortress munroe va  this letter was mailed without delay and soon after walter bade phil newell dan and several others goodby and grip in hand walked to the depot here he found several jackies already assembled and soon learned that they were members of waltons party in a few minutes walton himself came hurrying down federal street with several green hands in tow  all here he demanded and began to count noses only one man was missing and he soon put in an appearance and all entered the depot and procured their tickets then walter asked about the stolen order but the clerk had heard nothing new concerning it you were mighty lucky to get another order he said with a grin next time they may make you walk the tracks  the train was in and hurrying out to the long shed they found their proper places soon there came a sharp jerk the train moved off and the long journey southward was begun  for a seatmate walter had a typical yankee lad one from the coast of maine a young fellow who knew but little about warships but who had spent several years on the rolling deep in voyages to south america to nova scotia and elsewhere his name was silas doring and walter found him talkative although not objectionably so  yes i couldnt hardly wait till i got to boston said si for that was what he said all of his friends to hum called him well lick the spanish out of their boots see if we dont  you are bound for the brooklyn asked walter  thets it if they want me otherwise im booked for the texas putty good for a boy from maine to go on the texas aint it he he but i dont care much they can put me on the san francisco if they want toso long as they give me a chance at them tarnal dons when the maine was blowed up why i jest jumped up an down an up an down with rage si doring sez i si doring are you agoing to let such an insult an crime go by unnoticed not much sez i ill join the navy an help blow all of the spanish to jerichoan im going to do it and the yankee lad struck his fist into his open palm with a thump of energy  i wish i knew as much about ships as you do ventured walter ive been on two trips across lake erie and know something but im afraid ill feel like a fish out of water when i get on a manowar  well keep our eyes and ears open and try to learnthats the only way i know every rope on a merchantman kin name em from fore royal stay to topping lift but that aint the hundredth part on it weve got to learn our vessel jest as a person has got to learn a new city and its streets fer boats aint built one like another not by a jugful and after we have learned the ship weve got to learn the guns and the firedrill and how to clear ship for action and a lot more not to say a word about learning how to knock out them dons as some calls em oh well have our hands full after we get on board dont forget it and si doring shook his head vigorously  on and on sped the train until hyde park was reached here a brief stop was made and several persons including a sailor got on board the sailor came through the car as if looking for somebody and finally found caleb walton and shook hands  yes im bound for norfolk too walter and si doring heard him remark  by gum whispered the yankee sailor i wonder if thet chap is going with us  do you know him asked the boy  know him jest guess i do his name is jim haskett and he used to be the mate of the sunflower a threemaster from penobscot i sailed under him once and he was the hardest man on shipboard i ever got next to if he gets in the navy hell make everybody under him dance to his pipings and worse  if thats the case i sincerely hope he isnt assigned to my ship was walters comment i havent any use for a bully big or little  i owe jim haskett many an old score i would like to get the chance to even up went on the yankee but ive enlisted to do my duty and lick the spanish and if haskett leaves me alone ill leave him alone here he comes now and si straightened up  the former mate of the sunflower passed down the aisle slowly when he saw the yankee he started and then scowled at him have you enlisted he asked in a voice that was far from pleasant  i have returned si got any objections haskett  humph was the only answer and the exmate of the sunflower passed on to drop into a vacant seat some distance behind them  oh hes a corker whispered the yankee and walter nodded to show that he agreed with him walter was destined to many an encounter with jim haskett before his first term in the navy should come to an end     chapter v  something about war and prize money   commodore george deweys great victory over admiral montojo occurred on may 1 1898 and was the first to be scored during our war with spain  previous to this time matters had moved along swiftly but with no definite results following the wanton destruction of our battleship maine in the harbor of havana in february popular indignation arose to a fever heat against the country which had offered the american flag several insults in the past and which was now engaged in a ruthless effort to put down the longstanding rebellion in cuba be the cost what it might  for many months our president congress and the people had watched with anxious eyes the progress of events in cubahad seen the cubans doing their best to throw off the yoke of spanish tyranny and oppression from a little uprising here and another there the rebellion spread all over what was no longer the everfaithful isle until rich and poor those of cubanspanish blood and those whose ancestors had been negroes and indians became involved in it at first there was no army only bands of guerillas who fled to the mountains whenever a regular spanish force presented itself but soon the conflict assumed a definite shape a rebel army was formed to be commanded by generals gomez antonio maceo calixto garcia and others and then spain awoke to the realization that cuba her richest colonial possession with the possible exception of the philippines was about to break away from her  this crisis filled the rulers in spain with alarm for cuba had turned into her treasury millions of pesetas every year for which the island got little or nothing in return cuba must and shall be subdued was the cry and thousands of soldiers were transported from spain and elsewhere to be landed at havana santiago and other points these soldiers immediately took possession of all the larger cities causing those in rebellion to withdraw to the villages and to the forests and mountains  a bloody warfare lasting between two and three years followed and thousands of the rebels including the noble antonio maceo one of the best negro patriots that ever existed were slain in addition to this millions of dollars worth of property were destroyed in the shape of tornup railroads burnt sugar and tobacco plantations and sacked villages and towns every owner of property was compelled to take sides in the conflict and if he did not side with those who waited upon him then his property was either confiscated or destroyed  the spanish authorities had started out to crush the rebellion on the spot as time went by and the rebels grew stronger and stronger those in command saw that extreme measures must be resorted to or the campaign would prove a failure the majority of the cuban men were away from their homes at once orders were issued to drive all the defenceless women and children into the cities held by the spanish this was accomplished under the pretext that spain wished to keep them from harm once driven into the larger places these women and children were not fed and cared for but were allowed to either live upon the charity of those about them or starve these poor people were called reconcentrados and it is a matter of record that before the war closed nearly three hundred thousand of them gave up their lives through neglect and lack of food  the people of the united states had stood by mutely and seen the war waged against the rebels who well deserved their liberty but no one could stand by and see women children and helpless old men starved to death at once it was proposed to send relief ships to cuba but spain frowned at this saying that such relief was only one way of helping those who had taken up arms against her  at this time there were many americans in havana and elsewhere in cuba and as a matter of selfprotection the battleship maine was sent down to havana harbor to see that no harm came to them how the battleship was blown up and over two hundred and fifty lives lost has already been told in the previous volumes of this series a board of inquiry was appointed by the president and it was soon settled that the explosion which had wrecked the warship had come from the outside and that spain was responsible for the loss spain denied the charge and the war was practically on  the first movement of the authorities at washington was to blockade the city of havana and a large portion of the coast to the east and the west of that port this work was intrusted to commodore afterwards admiral sampson and he left key west with the north atlantic squadron on the morning of april 22 and in a few days had a grand semicircle of warships stationed on the outside of havana matanzas mariel cardenas bahia honda cabanas and other ports of lesser importance later on other ports were likewise blockaded and these portions of cuba suddenly found themselves cut off from the outside world sampson wished to bombard havana and bring the spanish stationed there to terms at once but this suggestion was overruled as it was imagined that spain might be brought to terms without such a great loss of life  as soon as the blockading of the ports mentioned began the president called for volunteers and how nobly all our states responded we have already learned in a young volunteer in cuba the regular army was also hurried to the southeast and concentrated at tampa and other points while the volunteers remained in their various state camps waiting to be mustered into the united states service of the grand movement to cuba we shall hear later  the news of commodore deweys glorious victory as related in under dewey at manila thrilled our people as they had not been thrilled for years in the army and the navy were men from both the north and the south and sectionalism was now wiped out forever and all stood shoulder to shoulder under old glory fighting for the sake of humanity the battlecries were free cuba and remember the maine and certainly none could have been more inspiring  the blockading of so long a coast line required a great many warships and as it was not deemed advisable to place all our big vessels on this duty the authorities lost no time in buying or leasing a number of ocean steamers and coast craft and converting them into vessels of war these vessels required a great number of men and the naval reserves were in great demand as were also volunteers for the regular navy this was the reason that walter and those with him were taken on so quickly had he applied for enlistment into the navy during times of peace he would have found an entrance far more difficult for uncle sam is growing more and more particular every day as to the class of men he allows to tread the decks of his menowar  shortly after havana and its neighboring ports were blockaded it was rumored that spain would send over a powerful fleet to bombard new york or some other principal city along our eastern seacoast this caused a good deal of uneasiness and steps were immediately taken to fortify all principal points and mine many of the harbor entrances patrol boats were also placed on duty to give the alarm at the first sight of an enemy in some cases channel buoys were removed and lighthouse lamps were left unlit so that no spanish vessel might creep in under cover of darkness  acting rearadmiral sampson as he was officially designated was kept busy watching the blockade along the northern coast of cuba and in distributing his auxiliary vessels to such points as would be most advantageous this being the case commodore schley next in command was left at hampton roads near fortress monroe virginia with what was known as the flying squadron a number of the fastest warships riding the atlantic the flying squadron was to wait until the spanish fleet started westward when it was to do its best toward doing as dewey had done to montojos fleet find it and engage it in plain words to fight it to the bitter end great things were expected of the flying squadron and in this the people were not to be disappointed as we shall see  the trip by rail from boston to the south proved full of interest to walter who loved riding on the cars so far two transfers had been made one at new york and the other at baltimore but at neither city was any time allowed for seeing the sights its a case of get there explained caleb walton you see that spanish fleet may sail for the united states at any moment and then schley will be bound to go out on a hunt for it in doublequick order  i see that the spanish cape verde squadron has joined the fleet at cadiz which is ready for sea observed walter pointing to a morning newspaper he had purchased on the train there are four firstclass cruisers the viscaya the almirante oquendo the infanta maria teresa and the cristobal colon besides two or three torpedoboat destroyers at cadiz there are the pelaya alfonso xiii and several other ships if they all come over here it seems to me they may make matters mighty warm for us  we want em warm interrupted si doring i wouldnt give a rap for a milkandwater battle let us have it hot say i hotand knock the spanish to kingdom come  they wont dare to send all of the ships over said caleb walton they must guard their own coast if they dont some of our ships may slip over there and make it interesting for them  do you think well carry the war to spain asked walter with deep interest  there is no telling lad some folks have it that half of europe will be mixed up in this muss before its over one thing is certain deweys victory at manila isnt going to be such a smooth thing out there for the filipinos are in a state of revolt and wont want us to govern them any more than they want the spanish and besides germany france and other nations have big interests there  well i guess the best we can do is to look out for our little end smiled the boy as for the rest the authorities at washington must settle that  well said lad you and i couldnt run the government if we tried but we can do our duty and that will be to obey orders and take what comes  how is it that you got jim haskett to enlist asked si  oh that fellow is after prize money was the gunners reply he has been reading of the luck down around havana and he wants the chance to earn a few hundred extra well maybe hell get it  ive heard of prize money before but i dont exactly know what it is observed walter  its the money got out of a captured ship when shes sold you see when a ship is captured shes taken to some port and turned over to a prize court and if she doesnt turn out a scotch prize she is knocked down under the hammer  i know what you mean by knocking her down under the hammer but why doesnt the rule apply to a scotch vessel  at this query of walters caleb walton burst into a roar of laughter its easy to see youre a landsman he said i didnt say a scotch vessel i said a scotch prizea ship captured illegally and one that must be given back to her owners i dont know where that term came from but its what the men in the navy always use  i see  a legitimate prize is sold and then the money is divided if the vessel captured was the equal of that taking her then all the prize money goes to her captain and crew but if the captured ship is inferior then her takers get only half of the money and uncle sam keeps the balance  and what part would i get if my ship took a prize went on walter more interested than ever for the question of prize money had not appealed to him before  you would get a share according to your regular payperhaps one dollar out of every five or ten thousand  that wouldnt be muchon a small craft  you are right lad but it would be a tidy amount on a big warship worth two or three millions the division of the prize money is regulated according to law so there cant be any quarrelling the commander of a fleet gets onetwentieth the commander of a ship onetenth of that coming to his ship when there are more ships than one interested in the prize and so on and we all get our money even if we are on temporary leave of absence  but what does uncle sam do with his share put in si  his share is put into a fund that is used toward paying naval officers seamen and marines the pensions due them these pensions are of course not as large as those of the army but they are considerable  well i hope we strike a big prize or half a dozen little ones said walter on a pay of eleven dollars a month a fellow cant expect to get very rich  do your duty lad and you may rise before the war is over the old gunner caught walter by the arm come with me and caleb walton arose and led the way to the smokingcar wondering what was meant by this movement walter followed  i want to have a quiet talk with you went on caleb walton after they were seated in a secluded corner do you smoke  no sir  youre just as well off but i must have my pipe caleb walton drew forth a brierroot filled it with a dark mixture of tobacco and lit it ah thats just right and now to business and he threw one leg over the other for a moment he gazed thoughtfully at walter and the boy wondered what was coming next he was satisfied that it must be of more than ordinary importance otherwise the old gunner would not have asked him to come to the smokingcar away from their companions     chapter vi  a glimpse of the president   you see its this way began caleb walton after gazing for a moment at walter phil newell is your friend isnt he  yes indeed responded the boy warmly  exactlylikewise he is my friend too we served together for years and i sometimes looked up to phil as a kind of elder brother well after you left us at the navyyard he and i had a long talk about you and he made me promise to keep my eye on youdo you understand  i think i do  now keeping an eye on you is out of the question unless you are placed where i can see you  but arent we both to go aboard of the brooklyn cried walter  yes according to the course were steering now but both being on the brooklyn doesnt cover the bill i expect to be in charge of one of the gunswill be if bill darworthy is still in the hospital now if you enter as a mere boy or even as a landsman it may be that youll never get around to where i am you must remember that the brooklyn is a big ship and all the men on her are divided into classesofficers petty officers seamen gunners marines and so onand one class is pretty well separated from another  i presume that is so but i never thought of it before  even seamen are divided into seamen gunners apprentices and the like and if you went on as a mere boy you might not see me once a week unless we happened to be off duty at the same time  i see what you are driving at mr walton you  avast there walter no mister for me please im plain caleb walton  well then walton you want to get me attached to that gun you hope to have placed in your charge  now youve struck the bullseye lad the thing of it is can i manage it  im sure you must know more about that than i do ill like it firstrate if you could for iwell to be plain i like you  caleb walton held out his horny hand the liking is mutual walter and theres my fist on it now i have an idee the old gunner took several puffs at his pipe i know captain cook of the brooklyn tolerably wellserved under him for a short spell and once did a little private business for him now captain cook wont do a thing as is out of his line of duty but still  he may aid you in having me assigned to the gun you expect to have charge of finished walter  thats it i think i can work the dealalmost sure of itbut you must help me  what must i do  say nothing and leave it all to me and if my plan goes through dont tell any one that you were favored if you do youll only make enemies  ill remember that but what of haskett doring and the others  id like to have doring in my ganghes the right sort i dont want that scowling jim haskett not after what doring has told me of him but hes out of it anyway for he enlisted as a firstclass seaman at twentysix dollars per month  i wish i knew a little more about a warship said the youth longingly the more i hear the less i seem to know  it will all come to you in time and when you are on board ill show you all i can it would do no good to talk about guns and the like until i can point out the different parts to you for you wouldnt know a breechblock from a primingwire until you laid eyes on it  but how is a ship commanded wont you tell me something about that  of course you mean a warship not a merchantman well the highest officer is of course the captain although the vessel may be the flagship of a commodore or an admiral  and what of a commodore and an admiral you see im awfully green when it comes down to the navy my younger brother larry is the real sailor in our family  youll get there lad anybody will who is in for learning as you are an admiral is the highest officer in any navy and he commands everything that floats from battleship to despatch tug next to him is the viceadmiral in the united states navy these offices dont exist any more having died out with the deaths of admiral porter and viceadmiral rowan  but the newspapers speak of admiral sampson  he is acting rearadmiral but holds only the office of commodore he commands a fleet of warships while a commodore commands only a squadron that is four or six usually although he may have more at times his ships are generally divided into two divisions  i understand please go on  well as i said before the captain really commands the ship next to him are the commander and the lieutenantcommander the first of these takes orders from the captain and issues them to those under him the lieutenantcommander is called the executive officer and hes always put down as the hardest worked man on the ship what he does would fill a book and he rarely gets leave of absence for nobody can spare him  but what does he do  well in the first place he sees that the whole crew keeps straight and he keeps a conduct book for reference he hears all complaints and straightens out all difficulties he sees to it that the ship is kept clean and he has the say about arranging messes he must also station the hands for the various fire sail and boat drills the gun exercises and the drills with smallarms and cutlasses then every night at eight oclock he receives the reports of petty officers to show that each department is o k up to that hour and there is a lot more besides  thanks but i dont care to be an executive officer smiled walter but perhaps he gets well paid for it  he earns from twentyeight hundred to three thousand dollars per year the commander gets five hundred more than that a commodore gets five thousand a year and a rearadmiral six thousand when at sea when on shore all these figures are slightly reduced  those are nice salaries  that is true but dont forget that everybody on the ship in the shape of an officer must board himself the crew does that too but uncle sam makes them an allowance for that purpose  dont the higher officers get anything  they have a ration allowed themthat or thirty cents of course such a ration cuts no figure with a commander or a captain  i suppose thats so but please go on who is next to the executive officer  the junior lieutenant and then come the ensigns and naval cadets that is those young fellows from annapolis who are studying up to become higher officers  and after that what  then come the warrant officers that is those warranted by our president and they include boatswain gunner carpenter and sailmaker and you mustnt forget the marinesthe soldiersailors  gracious what a lot any more  we are not half through lad but the others will explain themselves by their titles such as chief engineer chief surgeon paymaster and chaplain the chaplain holds the relative position to a captain or a commander but his whole duty is to hold church and keep the men from going wrong morally and spiritually besides these we have boatswains mate gunners mate and the like then among the seamen the leading men are called captains as for instance captain of the top captain of the afterguard and like that youll soon get to know them all never fear  how will i know themby their uniforms  by their uniforms and also by the stripes and devices they wear dont you see this flaming spherical shell of silver that i wear that shows that i am a gunner and have seen over twenty years of service if i was a gunner with less time to my credit the shell would be of gold  and does everybody wear some device  everybody from a rearadmiral with his two silver stars and anchor down to the apprentice who has his figure 8 knot if i get to be a chief gunner ill wear two crossed cannons instead of this shell  and if you got to be a captain what would you wear  a silver spread eagle with an anchor at each end on my shoulders  thats another deal to learn i should think a fellow would get mixed on all these stars eagles shells cannons and the rest  it takes time to learn lad let me give you a bit of advice if you meet another person on shipboard and you are in doubt about it salute you may be making a mistake but it will be a mistake on the right side  ill remember that but i feel as if i had more than ever to learn cant i get some book and study it  ive got such a work in my valise ill get it for you concluded caleb walton and he arose but remember about that other thingmum is the word  i certainly shall remember and walter smiled im awfully glad ive found such a friend as you and he squeezed the old gunners hand  they returned to the other car and soon walter was deeply interested in the volume which caleb walton loaned him it was a technical work issued by the authority of the navy department and contained all that he desired to learn and a deal besides  going to learn your duty as soon as possible eh observed si doring as he looked over the boys shoulder thats right if you want to know anything about sails or knots call on me  whats the matter with calling on me put in the voice of jim haskett as he slid into the seat behind them and leaned over i reckon i know as much as doring about a ship and maybe a leetle more  at this si doring fired up on the instant see here haskett i aint under ye no longer remember that he cried i dont want you to talk to me or about me i owe you one and more and i aint forgetting itremember that  oh dont get on a high horse growled the former mate of the sunflower i wont talk to you if you dont want me to  and ye neednt talk about me either think ye know a leetle more about a ship than i do eh well maybe captain pepperill didnt think so when you let the sunflower split her foremast in that blow off  i wasnt responsible for that interrupted jim haskett his surly face growing red you let the past drop and ill let it drop he glared savagely at si then turned to walter do you want some pints explained russell  thank you but i would just as lief study this book for the present answered walter coldly and somewhat astonished to learn that haskett knew his name  maybe i can make some pints clearer im an old seadog you know  i think doring can explain all i wish to know continued the boy feeling he ought to stick up for the yankee who had made himself so agreeable since leaving boston  dont want my advice then  i think not  all right then suit yourself if you want to cotton to such a fellow as doring you can do so buthe lowered his voicei reckon you are making a mistake and then before either walter or si could answer he bounced up and strode down the aisle and into the smoker  the train was approaching washington and shortly after this conversation it rolled into the depot at the capitol city and came to a standstill  we stop here for fifteen minutes said the porter to walter when questioned on the point give you sailorboys time to stretch your shoah legs and he grinned having been on a warship himself once serving as a strikerone who waits on the mess tables  let us take a few minutes walk i am all cramped up said walter to his yankee friend and si readily agreed caleb walton was willing they should go but warned them not to stay too long  fifteen minutes dont mean sixteen remember that he called after them  i should like to spend a few days here observed walter as he and his companion hurried on the capitol patent offices and other buildings must be very interesting  id rather see president mckinley returned the yankee my but he must have his hands full these days  do you want to see the president questioned a man who was just passing them if you do hes in his carriage three blocks below here theres a cavein of a sewer and his carriage just stopped  then heres our chance si cried walter eagerly come on we can make it if we run i wouldnt miss seeing the president for a good deal  thets me burst out the yankee off we go and he started to run his long legs giving walter all he could do to keep up with him the three blocks were covered and they came to where the cavein was located but only some very ordinary vehicles were in sight  were too late grumbled si crestfallen come on back  too late for phwat asked an irishman standing near the sewer  we wanted to see the president  sure an there goes his carriage down beyant and the irishman pointed to a side street  it was still less than a block away and without stopping to think twice they made after it and came up just as it was turning a corner a very trim driver sat on the box of the turnout and on the rear seat the sole occupant of the carriage sat our countrys chief executive  hurrah shouted walter impulsively and waved his cap and si did the same several others bowed and tipped their hats and the president bowed and tipped his silk hat in return then the carriage rolled swiftly away  illustration the president bowed in return  it was him all right enough exclaimed si enthusiastically and with a total disregard for grammar he looks jest like his pictures only a little more careworn i suppose he loses lots o sleep these nights  yes indeed being the president isnt the easiest berth in the world if i walter broke off short our trainill wager a dollar well miss it  creation dont say that gasped si and then both took to their heels as if running the race of their lives     chapter vii  a talk about spanish sailors   the train is gone  it was walter who gasped out the words as he and his companion rushed upon the depot platform in the distance they could see the end of the rear car just vanishing from view in a cloud of dust  thets so groaned si panting for breath for they had done their best to reach the depot in time whats to be the next move and he looked anxiously at his companion  im sure i dont know was walters slow answer ii almost wish i hadnt seen the presidentnow  cant we take a later train  i dont know if the tickets will be good certainly well have no sleeping accommodations for tonight  who cares for that so long as we get to fortress monroe come on let us see what can be done and si led the way to the ticket office  the ticketseller was busy and it was several minutes before they could get to him yes there will be another train in an hour and a quarter he said about your tickets did you have stopover privileges  we did notwe didnt intend to stop over answered walter  then i dont believe the conductor will accept them  gee shoo groaned si dismally do you mean to say weve got to pay the fare from here to our destination why it will take all ive got with me and maybe more  there ought to be some way of having our tickets fixed up said walter cant we go to the main office and see about them  certainly if you desire rejoined the ticket seller and turned to a number of others who were waiting impatiently to be served  the main offices of the railroad company were not far distant and hither they made their way inside a young clerk learned what they wanted and then took them to an inner apartment  government fares eh questioned the elderly gentleman to whom they had been conducted what was the reason you didnt catch your train  we lingered to see president mckinley who was out in his carriage said walter we got so interested we forgot the time until we were just about a minute late  well i cant blame you much for wanting to see the man you are fighting under said the railroad official let me see your tickets and taking them he wrote upon the back of each in blue pencil there you are but youll have to ride in an ordinary coach  we dont care if it is a freight put in si earnestly we want to get there and after both had thanked the official for his kindness they withdrew  were all right so far observed walter as to kill time they walked slowly down one of the broad avenues for which our capitol city is famous the question is what will caleb walton think of us when he finds us missing  i hope he doesnt think we are trying to desert cried walter to whom this idea had not before occurred  some fellows wouldnt be any too good to desert walter only last week a lot of fellows deserted on their way from one of the western states they got to chicago where they wanted to go and that was the last seen of them they were like trampswilling to do anything for a free ride on the cars but they ran the risk of being courtmartialled for it  i think the fact that we had our tickets fixed up will go to show what our intentions were si however we have put our feet into it and must take what comes  after a walk of half an hour both felt hungry and entered a modestlooking restaurant on a side street they had just ordered a cheap meal each when a newsboy entered with a bundle of afternoon newspapers  have a paper sir extra sir all about the flying squadron going to sail only one cent sir  whats that questioned walter here give me a paper and he grasped the sheet eagerly while si also purchased one of another sort soon both were devouring the scareheads showing upon each       the flying squadron ready to sail       schley and his warships may leave hampton roads tonight       the spanish fleet said to be on its way westward       has it sailed for cuba or will it bombard some city on our      coast       the authorities very reticent but a strict watch to be kept      from maine to florida for the appearance of the enemy   by ginger theyre acomin over here sure pop burst from the yankee youths lips supposing they bombard new york why i heard tell that they could lay out in the harbor and plant a shell right on the top of trinity church or come up to boston harbor and knock the top off of the bunker hill monument  our ships and forts wont give them the chance to come so close si but what im thinking of is supposing the warships sail before we can get on board  thets so si doring heaved a long sigh why didnt we wait some other time for to see the president if we miss the ships i dont know what well do well be stranded  oh i presume theyll put us on some other vessel but my heart was set on getting aboard the brooklyn and walter sighed too  both had lost interest in eating and swallowed the food mechanically then without waiting they hurried back to the depot bound that the next train should not slip by  the route to fortress monroe was by way of fredericksburg richmond and newport news soon the train came along and they got aboard the cars were comfortable but not nearly so elegant as the one previously occupied  it is odd to me to see separate cars for negroes and whites observed walter after the journey had begun we dont have any such thing up north  they will be done away with in time i guess answered si by the way i see in this newspaper that among the first troops to be sent to cuba will be two regiments of negroes hurrah for those boys say i  it was growing dark and soon the car lamps were lighted the boys read their newspapers through from end to end and walter learned that the volunteer regiments were everywhere being sworn into the united states service as rapidly as possible  i wonder who will get to the front first he mused it would be odd if they should send ben to the philippines instead of cuba if only larry was with me to go into the navy i am sure he would enjoy this sort of service and thus musing he dropped asleep never dreaming of the part his younger brother had taken in the contest of manila ray  richmond change cars for james city williamsburg and newport news such was the cry which awoke him he arose sleepily to find si snoring heavily  si wake up he cried and shook his companion we have to change here  changefor what questioned the yankee as he blinked his eyes in the glare of an electric light how far have we got  richmond comethe other train leaves in a few minutes  it was early morning and the depot platform was deserted excepting for the passengers that left the train soon the second train rolled in and they found a double seat and proceeded to make themselves comfortable  by ginger i never thought of em before remarked si suddenly  what  our satchels that we left in that first train  i had mine checked through  i didnt because i wanted to look over some things of mine on the way down si shook his head in dejection say but aint i running up against the worst luck ever was ill bet a new pocketknife the satchel is gone when i get to the end of this trip  oh i hope not si did it contain much of value  it had my clothing in a bible that my mother gave me and a tendollar gold piece that ive been carrying around for twelve years for luck because it was given to me by a south american rainmaker a kind of waterwitch i met in san luiz brazil and that aint the worst on it either the grip wasnt locked  its too bad but let us hope its all right si anyway i wouldnt worry until you know the truth said walter trying to put a bright face on the matter and then he dropped asleep again and the yankee youth presently followed his example  luckily the train ran right through from newport news to hampton which is within two miles and a half of old point comfort and fortress munroe the ride proved uneventful and when they reached hampton they fell directly into the arms of caleb walton  what does this mean demanded the old gunner as he caught each by the arm missed the train eh i told you to be careful  well know better next time answered walter but what of the flying squadron has it sailed  not yet but the ships may leave hampton roads at any hour i made up my mind to wait for this train and then go on i sent the others ahead  what of my satchel put in si  its in the baggage room but hurry up every hour counts just about now and he led the way to where the bag had been left  here is a big wagon bound for the fort said walton as they left the station well ride down on that for the soldiers in charge gave me permission should you show up  the wagon was loaded with blankets and the pile made a soft seat soon there came a crack of a whip and they were off down a sandy highway leading directly to the sea soon the salt air filled their nostrils  oh were in good shape to give the dons a hot reception if they show themselves around here said one of the soldiers in reply to a question from walter weve got some of the finest guns in the country at the fort and can reach a ship ten or twelve miles out in the harbor  i should like very much to inspect a real fort answered the youth the guns must be even more complicated than on board a warship  the disappearing guns are very fine but i doubt if you could get permission to go through nowat least not until you were duly enlisted into the navy and had your uniform on you know we have strict orders to keep all outsiders at a distance we dont want any spanish spies to get plans of our hidden batteries and the fort itself  would they dare to try to get them asked si pears to me that would be a mighty risky piece of business  certainly they would try you mustnt think that all spaniards are cowardseven if the authorities are responsible for blowing up the maine theyll give us a good shake up if they get the chance  i dont think so said caleb walton they are not as uptodate as we are i know we can beat em at gun practice every round  dont brag wait till the war is over  im not braggingonly talking facts sergeant i have a friend at the brooklyn navyyard and he wrote to me about the gunners on the vizcaya when that spanish warship was lying off staten island this spring he said they werewell tired i reckon wed call itand didnt have any drills worth mentioning all the while the ship was there now you know that wont do  oh yes i know a man must keep at his drills if he doesnt want to grow rusty  besides that you must remember that fourfifths of their sailors dont enlist for themselves they are shanghied out of the seaport towns made drunk and taken on the ships like so many cattle and they are lucky if they get away inside of ten or fifteen years and in addition the catonine tails is always dangling afore their eyes now a man treated like that cant make a good sailor for the simple reason that he knows he has been treated unjustly and he cant take an interest in his duties  gracious dont you think you are stretching it a bit put in walter what of their officers  nearly every one of them comes from the ranks of the nobility and that takes a good deal of ambition from the men too knowing it will be next to impossible for them to rise even to a petty office now in our navy its totally different a man enlists of his own free will he is treated fairly even though subject to rigorous discipline and if its in him he can rise to quite a respectable office and earn a good salaryand hes certain to get his money while the spanish sailors and soldiers go without a cent for months and months  t know what you say about wages is true said the sergeant in command of the army wagon i have it from a friend who left havana when lee our consul came away that the majority of the spanish troops stationed about the city hadnt seen a payday for nearly a year  and then there is another thing continued caleb walton the spaniards have little mechanical ability and before this war broke out they had a great number of engineers and the like who were foreign bornenglishmen frenchmen and germans principally now those men wont stay on spains warships during this little mussat least the englishmen and germans wontand a green hand at a marine engine can do more damage in ten minutes than a shipyard can repair in a month take it all in all therefore i think we have the best of it concluded the old gunner     chapter viii  the men behind the guns   by the time fortress monroe was reached it was quite dark so but little could be seen outside of those sturdy and frowning walls behind which were concealed the heavy guns intended to protect the entrance to chesapeake bay  the warships rode at anchor some distance beyond to the squadron had just been added the protected cruiser minneapolis and the new orleans and st paul were also expected and all was a buzz of excitement alongshore  theyll be off before long said one old soldier i know because i saw one of the captains saying goodby to his family such a parting means a good deal  i understand a spanish warship was sighted last night put in another we may have a fight right here unless schley keeps his eyes open  oh hes got the scorpion out on scout dutyshe can take care of any sneak work was the answer he referred to the gunboat scorpion of the auxiliary navy which was doing duty just beyond the capes the scorpion was fast and carried a strong searchlight so it was likely nothing could pass her without being detected and the alarm being given alarms were numerous but they were likewise all false for no spanish ship of war came anywhere near our coast  a boat was in waiting at the wharf and walter si and the others were ordered aboard without delay the boat was manned by eight sturdy jackies  up oars came the command and up went the eight blades straight into the air let fall and the oars fell into the water give way and the blades moved in a clocklike stroke and they were off to the ships it was destined to be many a day before walter should set foot on land again  halt who goes there came suddenly from out of the darkness and walter saw that they were lying beside what looked to be a bulging wall of darkcolored steel  aye aye was the answer and there followed a short talk got ten of them sir said the wardroom officer in charge of the small boat then a rope ladder was thrown down and the newcomers clambered aboard the warship that was to be their home for so long to come  walter gazed about him eagerly but that look was hardly satisfactory for to the darkness was now added a heavy fog through which the ships lights shone but faintly all had their baggage and without ceremony they were told to fall in and were then marched below by order of the officer of the deck  this looks like home to me exclaimed caleb walton as he gazed around the berth deck i went over the brooklyn many a time when she was up at the navyyard so i know her from stem to stern he took walter by the arm here is the baby i hope to manage he whispered and pointed to one of the starboard monsters whose long muzzle pointed frowningly outward isnt she a daisy  i suppose she is was the boys reply but how in the world do you manage such a mass of metal surely a man cant do it by hand  it might be done by hand but nowaday everything is worked by electricity and hydraulic pressure youll learn it all after you have been on board awhile at present just do what you are told and keep your eyes open  supper had been served some time before but as it was not intended to let the newcomers go hungry a table was set and they messed together the swinging table and the tableware all interested walter especially when he was provided with his own personal cup plate spoon knife and fork  as a gunner ill mess with the other warrant officers exclaimed caleb walton in reply to a question about messes from walter you see there are a great number of tables the commodore is entitled to dine alone so is the captain and the commander while the other officers have what they call the wardroom mess then there are the steerage mess for midshipmen ensigns and clerks the masteratarms mess for yeomen machinists boilermakers and so on and three or four other messes besides including that to which you will belong we gunners dine with the boatswain sailmaker and carpenter  the meal was a plain one of bread and butter coffee cold corned beef and apple sauce but it was well cooked and all the new men and boys ate heartily as soon as it was finished walton hurried off to interview captain cook if he could obtain that privilege  well where are we going to sleep i dont see any beds said one of the boys a timid lad named paul harbig his query brought forth a roar  your bed is rolled up and lashed away paul answered si who had rather taken to the little lad do you see those gratings over yonder  yes  well all the hammocks for this deck are stowed away behind that when it comes time to go to bed well get them out fasten them up to the hooks you see about you and there you are and let me tell you there is nothing finer nor a good canvas hammock to sleep in ill take it before i take a greasy dirty bunk in a buggy focastle every time  but a fellow may fall out suggested paul  if youre afraid of that get a ropesend and tie yourself in answered si philosophically but you wont tumble unless we strike some putty rough weather  the order was now passed to bring along all baggage and walter and si picked up their satchels thinking to take out several things he needed the yankee youth opened his bag and put his hand inside  by ginger came from him in an undertone but loud enough for walter to hear  whats up si  thet tendollar gold piece is gone  are you sure perhaps it has slipped among some of the clothing  ill soon see was the quick response and the yankee youth dumped the articles out in a heap sure enough the golden eagle was gone  somebody has robbed me came in a groan now who did it do you suppose  im sure i dont know it might have been done here or on the train or at the depot  si looked around him sharply not far away stood jim haskett watching him intently as soon as the exmate of the sunflower saw that he was noticed he turned away  ive got half a notion haskett was the one to play me foul he whispered to walter what do you think  he wouldnt be much of a man to rob a messmate of ten dollars  oh you dont know haskett hes as close as he is brutal once we got up a list to give captain pepperill a birthday present but haskett although he was first mate only gave twentyfive centsno more than cooley the cook chipped in in his eyes a tendollar gold piece is a big lot of money  it wouldnt do you any good to accuse him if you wasnt pretty certain he was guilty returned walter cautiously you dont want to get into trouble right after coming on board if you raised a row they might put both you and haskett in the brig  im going to ask him about it anyway answered the yankee youth see he is looking at us and it pears to me as if he was enjoying himself to see me in trouble  leaving his satchel and scattered clothing as they were si advanced upon haskett and without ceremony caught the mans shoulder  haskett i want to ask you something he said in a low tone do you know anything about this or dont you  i dont know the exmate of the sunflower stopped short what are you talking about doring  i left my satchel on the train as you know a tendollar gold piece is missing i want to know  what do you accuse me of taking it demanded the man wrathfully  i asked you if you knew anything about it  no i dont ive got my own affairs to look after more than likely the car porter took your moneyif you really had that amount  well im going to find that gold piece sooner or later as sure as my name is si doring exclaimed the yankee youth determinedly and with a shake of his head he rejoined walter and paul harbig  the officer who had previously taken them in charge now came forward and assigned them to their various sleeping places this matter was readily arranged for one of the main features of the cruiser brooklyn is her commodious berthing quarters there being two complete decks running from end to end of the ship for this purpose also an extra forecastle so that the vessel can accommodate a thousand men if requireda number nearly double that of her usual crew  its a big hotel with one room on a floor thought walter as he took the hammock assigned to him he was glad to find si on one side of him and paul harbig on the other si showed both boys how to take their canvasses and sling them this work was just completed when caleb walton came back with a broad smile on his face  its all right he whispered to walter the captain treated me better than i thought he would he called up the chief gunner and we had a talk and you are to take the place of a man named silvers who has gone lame through having a catblock fall on his foot if youll only mind yourself and study up as i tell you youll have the chance of your life  study im ready to begin right off answered walter earnestly im just crazy to get at that gun you pointed out to me cant you show me something tonight  caleb walton laughed outright dont try to learn it all before you go to bed walter he said of course you know more than some landlubbers who think that on warships of today they handle the guns as they used to when one man took the powder and ball from the powdermonkeys another rammed them home in the gun and the gunner sighted his piece and pulled the string those days are gone and a head gunner like myself has very little to do even if the position is a responsible one come ill get permission to go below and show you just how a big gun is served from start to finish folks talk about the man behind the gun when they really mean from eight to twelve men  the two hurried off and presently descended an iron staircase which seemed to lead into the very bowels of the ship at last they came to a steel trapdoor barred and locked  below this door is one of the magazines explained caleb it contains the ammunition for the eightinch guns in the turret above the keys to the magazine are in the captains cabin and can only be had on special order and by certain persons the magazines are kept locked continually excepting when in use or when being inspected all of them are connected with huge water tanks so at the first sign of a fire they can be flooded thus lessening the danger of an explosion  yes i remember the spaniards tried to prove that the maine blew up from one of her magazines  such a thing couldnt happen in the american navy because the discipline is too strict now when a gun is being served several men in the magazine get out the shells for the shellmen who load them on the ammunition hoist over there which is nothing more than a warship dumbwaiter the hoist takes the shells up to the guns in this case in the forward turret other hoists supply the rear turret and the secondary battery and other guns including the rapidfiring weapons in the military tops  you mean those platforms around the upper ends of the two masts  exactly the tops are the places for the sharpshooters and the rangefinders  the rangefinders  exactly you see it is a difficult matter to get an exact range on an enemy several miles off and we have to try to get the range in various ways one of the simplest ways is to station two rangefinders in the tops as far away from each other as possible each man gets a bead on the enemy with his glasses and then proceeds to get the angle between the bead and an imaginary line drawn between his station and that taken by the other fellow the three pointsthat is the two rangefinders and the enemyform a triangle and having one line and the two angles to work on the working out of the problem gives the distance the gunners are hunting for  that makes pointing a gun nothing but a mathematical problem doesnt it  it makes it partly a mathematical problem lad but having the distance isnt everything for that will only give us the height at which a gun should be elevated in order to make its charge cover that distance and hit the mark instead of flying over it or ploughing the water below it after getting the distance we have to calculate on how the enemys vessel is moving if she is under steam and then most important we have to let the gun go off at just the right motion of our own craft in some navies they discharge the guns on the upward roll of the ship and in others on the downward roll my private opinion on that point is a downward roll in clear weather and an upward roll in a choppy sea when you dont know just what is coming next  i see firing a gun isnt so easy as one would imagine  easy enough if you want to waste ammunition as those spaniards did at manila gun practice is expensive and spain hasnt any money to waste in that direction come well have to get up to sleeping quarters now concluded the old gunner as a drum beat was heard sounding throughout the warship thats tattoo it will soon be two bells nine oclock and then comes pipe down  all right im willing enough to go to sleep said walter but just one question more how do you count the time by bells on a warship  just the same as on any ship lad the bell strikes at each halfhour starting at halfpast twelve at night which is one bell this makes one oclock two bells halfpast one three bells and so on up to four oclock which is eight bells when you start again from the beginning by this means the day and night are divided into periods of time called watches as morning watch middle watch dog watch and the like youll get the lay of it soon finished walton and then having reached the berth deck the pair separated for the night     chapter ix  commodore winfield scott schley   in a couple of days walter began to feel at home on the flagship and he could no longer be termed a greeny strictly speaking although there were still a great number of things for him to learn he was much interested in the brooklyn as a whole as well as in detail and was proud to learn that this armored cruiser was the largest of the class in our navy having a displacement of 9215 tons as against her sister ship the new york which had a displacement of about a thousand tons less  this ship is just four hundred feet and six inches long said caleb she dont look so long as she rides the water but as a city block is ordinarily two hundred feet deep so to speak she would cover two blocks of a side street providing the street was sixtyfive feet wide for her to rest in thats pretty big eh  and how much water does she draw walton  draws twentyfour feet which is the height of an ordinary twostory house her three smokestacks are about a hundred feet high each and that gives her fires a firstclass draught sailing or standing still  im awfully glad im on her smiled walter oh i do hope we have a fight with the dons i want to see the big guns go off i know the main battery as you call it has eight 8inch guns how many guns are there besides  there are twelve 5inch rapidfire guns twelve 6pounders four 1pounders four colts and two field guns besides we carry four torpedo tubes  were a regular floating arsenal exclaimed walter it must make things shake when they all get to firing  youll think youve struck the infernal regions lad if we ever do get them all agoing yes the brooklyn is nothing but a floating fort shes an unusual type because she has an extra high forecastle deck some folks dont think that makes her a beauty but they must remember that warships arent built altogether for looks although to my mind shes as handsome as any of em the high bow enables us to carry our forward guns eight feet higher than those on the new york and it will come in mighty handy if we ever want to run full steam after an enemy in a heavy sea which would drown out a ship with a low freeboard  and why is she called an armored cruiser  because she is protected by steel plating three inches thick on her sides and on her deck and under this is an additional protection of coal and of cocoafibre for keeping out water it would surprise you to see how the sides and deck as well as the bottom are built were they taken apart for examination  discipline walter found very strict and once he had donned his uniform he was kept employed from sunrise to sunset his duties being largely similar to those performed by his brother larry on the olympia early in the morning he was aroused by the blare of a bugle or the roll of a drum and given but a few minutes in which to dress and roll up his hammock and put it away then came the work of washing down the deck followed by breakfast and later all hands were called to quarters to attend some drill sometimes at the guns sometimes at the hose pipes scattered about in case of fire and occasionally with smallarms and with cutlasses each afternoon there was a run around lasting from ten minutes to half an hour in this the men fell in singly or in pairs and ran around and around the deck at first slowly until second wind was gained and then faster and faster this is the one chance a jackie gets of stretching his legs while on board of his ship and how he does enjoy it  taking them as a whole walter found the ships company a jolly crowd with but few men of the jim haskett stamp among them the men connected with the guns were a particularly brotherly set and the youth soon felt thoroughly at home among them he was always willing to do anything asked of him and in return the best gunners on the vessel did not hesitate to give him points whenever he asked for them one jocularly called him the questioner but walter did not mind and went on picking up all the information possible  on his second morning on board walter was talking to si when a low roll of drums reached their ears hark cried the yankee boy two ruffles do you know what that means the commodore is either leaving or coming on board they always give a high officer that salute or a similar one  let us see him if we can exclaimed walter who had not yet caught sight of the commander of the squadron they crowded to an open port and were just in time to see commodore schley descend by the swinging ladder to the gig soon the little craft shot out of sight through the fog for the day was far from clear  he looks like a fighter remarked walter he has quite a record hasnt he  yes indeed i was reading about him only last week he was in the civil war operating along the mississippi and after that he saw a lot of fighting besides  i know all about our commodore said a gunner standing near my father fought with him on the mississippi and also when port hudson in louisiana was taken he is named after general winfield scottwinfield scott schleyfor his father and the general were warm friends  its a good name for a fighter for certainly nobody fought better than did general scott through the war with mexico was walters comment  schley entered the naval academy in 1856 and remained until 1861 when the war broke out continued the gunner they say he graduated at the head of his class and was so well liked that he was given seaduty on the frigate potomac and in 1862 he was made a master and ordered on the winona of the gulf squadron  after the civil war was over he was sent to the pacific and there he aided in the suppression of an outbreak among the chinese coolies in the chin chi islands the united states consulate at this place was in danger of being mobbed but schley took a hundred marines ashore and knocked the whole uprising in the head in short order  no wonder hes a commodore said walter and si nodded approvingly  it wasnt long before the young officer was made a lieutenantcommander and coming back from the pacific he was placed in charge of a department at the naval academy he remained ashore for three years then went to the coast of africa on the benicia where he took part in a number of contests and helped clear the congo river of pirates and overthrew the forces defending the salu river in corea another bit of work for which he was warmly praised  oh hes a corker cried si enthusiastically  im not done yet went on the gunner who loved to talk about the exploits of his old commander of course you have heard how the greely expedition to the north pole got lost and couldnt get back home well it was schley who went after them and found greely and six of his companions at cape sabine and brought them safely back for this congress voted him a medal and president arthur raised him to the full rank of captain and made him chief of the bureau of equipment a very important office in the naval department but schley couldnt stand it on land he must have the rolling ocean under him and so he gave up his berth ashore and took command of the baltimore  i remember about that put in walter i was reading about john ericsson the inventor of the monitor when ericsson died the body was sent to sweden his fatherland on the baltimore under schley  exactly and the king of sweden gave schley a medal to commemorate the event at a grand gathering at stockholm from sweden schley took the baltimore to southern waters and while off the coast of chili he smoothed out what threatened to become a serious difficulty between that country and ours on account of some of uncle sams jackies being stoned on the streets of valparaiso for this the navy department was extremely grateful and he went up several points on the register so that it didnt take him long to become a commodore  hes certainly a man worth sailing under said walter i suppose he is married  yes and has several childrenbut that dont interest me concluded the gunner who was an old bachelor with a peculiar dislike for the gentler sex  since the time that si had spoken to haskett about the missing money the seaman had steered clear of both the yankee lad and walter perhaps he was afraid that si would accuse him openly of the theft of the gold piece or perhaps he was afraid of caleb walton who was continually around and ready to champion his boys as he had dubbed both but there was one boy who could not get away from him and that was paul harbig  youre just the right sort to take to said haskett as he caught paul by the arm one morning while both were coming from mess youre too much of a real little man to have anything to do with that russell boy or si doring  oh i like them both very much answered paul and attempted to pass on with a frown haskett caught him by the arm and swung him back  see here i want to talk to you he cried uglily has si doring been telling you any yarns about me  illustration see here i want to talk to you  you let go of me was pauls only answer i dont want anything to do with you  answer my question  i havent got to and now paul did his best to get away he had just twisted himself loose when jim haskett struck him a cruel blow on the head  youyou brute gasped the boy as the tears came he was about to try retreating again when haskett caught him once more  now answer me or ill thrash the life out of you he hissed into pauls ear and mind you tell the truth  he said that he had aa the boy broke off short i wont tell you there now let go and he began to squirm  i know what he said blustered haskett said he had had a tendollar gold piece in his valise didnt he  yees  and he accused me of taking it eh  he didnt say so outright he said you had been where you could get at the bag  it amounts to the same thing as a matter of fact i couldnt get at the bag any more than could you or russell or walton or any of the others  i suppose that is so now let me go  i will in a minute but i want to tell you something for its not nice to have folks taking you to be a thief went on haskett tactfully  i havent said anything about the affair  perhaps not paul but doring talks and i reckon so do russell and walton during the past couple of days ive found more than one fellow aboard the brooklyn looking at me queerlike and i can put two and two together as quick as the next man if i allow this to go on there wont be a soul speak to me after a while  i shant say a wordill promise you  its russell who will talk the most i reckon went on haskett with apparent bitterness russell the very fellow who ought not to say a word  ill caution him if you want me to went on paul who was tenderhearted and very willing to help anybody out of trouble  caution russell not for the world see here ill tell you something and you can tell doring or not just as you please to the best of my knowledge russell is the thief  walter ejaculated paul oh no you must be mistaken why whyhow could he get at the satchel he was with doring  i dont know about that but im almost positive russell is guilty  have you any proof you shouldnt say such a thing unless you have retorted paul anxious to stick up for walter who had served him several good turns since they had become acquainted  ive got more proof against russell than doring has against me answered jim haskett boldly and what is more i can prove what ive got to say  but what have you to say came in a cold heavy voice behind haskett and turning swiftly the former mate of the sunflower found himself confronted by caleb walton the old gunners face looked stern and angry  whyerwhere did you come from stammered the seaman  i asked you what you have to say against walter russell demanded caleb come out with it or by the jumping beeswax ill wipe up this deck with you and he doubled up his fists  im not afraid if you want to fight walton replied haskett recovering somewhat from his fright what i said about russell ill stick to  but what have you got to say out with it was the old gunners demand  ive got this much to say i think russell took dorings gold piece and i am not the only one that does either if you think im wrong ask cal blinker the shellman he heard almost as much as i did  heard what  heard russell talk in his sleep it was last night i got up to get a drink of water and slipped and roused up blinker then when i went to the water tub i passed russells hammock he was dreaming and talking about the gold piece and saying that doring would never learn that he had it and a lot more about hiding it under the gun he went on about the money and about hiding it for fully ten minutes if you dont believe me go to blinker about it     chapter x  walter shows his pluck   and is that all you have to say asked caleb walton after a few seconds of silence during which he gazed so sharply at jim haskett that the fellow felt compelled to drop his eyes because a fellow dreams about a gold piece must you accuse him of stealing  thats all right too responded haskett doggedly i know he wouldnt dream that way unless there was something in the wind im satisfied he took the money  and i am satisfied that he is innocent cried caleb that boy would never steal a cent from anybody  why he was after a thief himself before he left boston put in paul who had now sought protection behind the old gunner  well suit yourselves answered haskett with a shrug of his somewhat rounded shoulders but let me tell you that i wont allow russell doring or anybody else to speak of me as having taken the moneymind that and he shook his fist savagely  here comes walter now announced paul walter come here he called out before caleb could stop him  at once walter came up an inquiring look upon his manly face which was now becoming sunburnt through exposure on deck what do you want paul he asked  its only some of hasketts nonsense answered caleb ere the boy could speak tell us lad do you remember dreaming anything about sis gold piece  for the instant walter looked puzzled then his face brightened i do he answered what of it  tell us what you dreamed first  whyii cant remember exactly excepting that i was having a good lot of worry about it he stammered you know how dreams come and go  to be sure walter  you dreamt about the money you hid didnt you said haskett sneeringly  the money i hid i hid no money  oh no of course not  see here haskett what do you mean and walter strode over to the seaman his face flushing deeply do you mean to insinuate that i took sis gold piece and hid it away  he just does burst out paul and he says you talked in your sleep about it too  it is falseat least it is false that i took the money i might have dreamed about it and talked in my sleep we are not accountable for what we do when we are sleeping  perhaps you took the gold piece when you were asleep said haskett squinting suggestively at those surrounding him  the gold piece was taken while si and i were left behind in washington it was taken by somebody on the train  thats your storyand youve been trying to lay the thing at my door but i shant stand itnot me stormed haskett i heard what you said in your sleep and so did cal blinker if anybody is guilty it is you and he pointed his long bony finger full in walters face  by this time a crowd of a dozen or more had gathered round realizing that a quarrel of some sort was in progress its about a gold piece said one haskett says russell took it say fellows we dont want anything to do with a thief  not much we dont answered a messmate heave him overboard if he is guilty  this matter ought to be reported to the officer of the deck put in a third if there is a thief on board no mans dittybox will be safe  at hasketts concluding remark walters face grew as red as a beet then deadly pale for a moment he stood stock still breathing heavily suddenly he leaped forward with clenched fist and struck haskett a stunning blow on the chin which sent the seaman staggering up against a guncarriage  that for talking to me in this fashion he exclaimed  oh grunted the exmate of the sunflower as he caught at the gun just in time to prevent himself from falling to the deck youyou young rascal what do you mean by hitting me  a fight a fight cried several and soon a crowd of about fifty jackies surrounded the pair  wasnt that a pretty blow though and hes only a boy too came from a gunners mate  ill fix you for this went on haskett putting one hand to his chin where a lump was rising rapidly i never before allowed anybody to hit meleastwise a boy and he rushed at walter with a fierceness which boded the youth no good  dont you hit him haskett put in caleb catching the seaman by the arm if you do youll have to settle this affair with me  he hit me  and you as much as said he was a thief  and so he is  i am not and ive a good mind to hit you again for saying so burst out walter and before anybody around could separate them he and haskett had closed in several ineffective blows were struck on each side when they were pulled apart  this wont do walter whispered caleb if youre not careful youll spend a week in the brig  butbut its awful to have him say im aa  i know i know but keep cool lad its best take my word for it youve been on board only a few days but you have made lots of friends while i reckon most of the men have already sized up haskett for the meanest chap on board  he has no right to talk about me  he says you and si doring talked about him  haskett now pushed his way forward again i dont want trouble with the officers so well let this matter drop for the present he blustered but ill remember you and some day youll be mighty sorry we had this little mixup and muttering some more that nobody could understand he strode off the majority of the crowd gazing after him curiously  ran away from a boy said one old tar he must be a regular coward and no mistake  many wanted walter to relate his version of what had brought the encounter about but caleb hurried the lad away to a corner where he took a wash up and brushed off his clothing  i want to interview that cal blinker said the youth where can i find him  down around the forward ammunition hoist answered paul and walter hurried off accompanied by his friends  yes i did hear you say something about a gold piece the shellman admitted you didnt talk very plainly and i understood very little haskett said he understood every word well maybe he did ive been in the navy so long that the noise of the big guns has affected my hearing  did i say i stole the piece insisted walter  i dont know as you did all i could make out was ten dollars in gold and the gunjust the place  this was all cal blinker had to say he was rather old and it was plain to see that he wanted nothing to do with the controversy one side or the other  si doring had been attending a special boat drill and it was not until an hour had passed that he came below and heard what had occurred without hesitation he slapped walter on the shoulder  dont you take this to heart he said no matter what that mean old rascal of a haskett says hell never make me believe that you are anything but perfectly straight i believe yet that he took the gold piece and that some day ill be able to prove it and there the incident for the time being dropped  the manner in which walter had sailed into haskett as caleb expressed it made the youth many friends among the crew for if there is one thing a jack tar loves it is to see a messmate stand up for himself youre all right you are said more than one and caught walters hand in a grip calculated to break the bones several who had thought to play a few tricks on the greeny reconsidered their ideas on the subject and concluded that it was best not to run any chances with such a spirited lad  for some time walter was afraid that the executive officer would hear of the encounter and bring him to book for it but if the mixup was reported nothing came of it as a matter of fact uncle sams officers just then had affairs of more importance requiring their attention  for every hour on board of the warships composing the flying squadron increased the anxiety concerning the spanish ships which it was felt were preparing to make a quick dash for cuba or for our own coast how soon would these warships sail and where would they make their presence felt those were the allimportant questions commodore and captains asked of each other theyll most likely try to break the blockade at havana said one no theyll bombard one of our downeast seacoast cities said another i think theyll rush through the suez canal to fight dewey was the conclusion reached by a third underofficers and men speculated quite as much as did their superiors arriving at equally opposite conclusions they have our whole seacoast and cuba to pick from commodore schley said they will go where they can do the most goodto their way of thinking i think theyll go to cuba or porto rico how correct the commander was history has shown  although the scorpion was patrolling the ocean just outside of the capes a strict watch was kept on every one of the warships night and day rumors were numerous and one was to the effect that the spaniards had a submarine craft in their service and that this boat would soon arrive along our eastern seacoast to destroy the shipping from maine to the gulf of mexico in these days when we know the truth we can afford to laugh at such a report but to the jackies on the warships who remembered only too well the fate of the maine it was no laughing matter even when off duty many would go on the spar deck and lie flat gazing into the dark waters for the best part of a night hoping to catch a glimpse of the unknown terror should it come to that vicinity  sunday with its deeply impressive church service came and went and still the squadron lay at anchor in the meantime it was rumored that sampson would soon take his most powerful vessels from the blockade and bombard havana the newspapers reported this but if such was the plan of the navy department it was altered at the last moment  on may 12 came news of a fierce fight in the harbor of cardenas a seaport a hundred and twenty miles east of havana in an attempt to effect a landing the torpedo boat winslow had her boiler blown to pieces and several men were killed and injured among them ensign worth bagley who was thus the first american officer to fall in the war two other warships the wilmington and the hudson also took part in the contest but were repulsed after a gallant onslaught lasting over an hour  this is war said caleb as he read the news from the paper that one of the gunners had just brought on board those fellows on the winslow caught it hot think of running right into that harbor and having a shell drop and smash your boiler and send the live steam all over you i tell you ensign bagley was a plucky one all honor to his memory  the next day brought even more important news dewey had gained a foothold in the philippines the main city of cuba was in a state of blockade and now rearadmiral sampson had shifted the scene of action to porto rico by shelling the forts of san juan the principal city of spains only other possession in the west indies  were getting there cried caleb excitedly well soon give the dons all they want  if sampson succeeds in making the san juan forts surrender the whole city will be at our mercy said walter hurrah for the american navy and every ship and man in it  we are bound to get them on the run put in si here is another report about a fight at cienfuegos where is that  on the southern coast of cuba answered walter who had always had a good head for geography and who since the war had started had studied the map of cuba closely havana san juan and manila say but this is becoming a war of magnificent distances  its a naval war thats what it is said caleb if wehullo did any of you see this telegram he pointed to his newspaper the spanish squadron under admiral cervera has slipped away from cape verde islands and is undoubtedly bound westward  and here is another report that some strange vessels supposed to be warships have been sighted off martinique windward island added walter quickly ill wager we leave soon  but where tothe windward islands queried si  thats for commodore schley to decide rest assured hell find this admiral cervera sooner or later just as dewey found old admiral montojo  the news was spreading and officers and men gathered in knots to discuss the situation as for commodore schley and captain cook they smiled knowingly but said nothing everybody in the flying squadron remembered what dewey and his men had accomplished and all were on their mettle accordingly     chapter xi  the sailing of the flying squadron   we are off at last  it was walter who broke the news as he came tumbling down the stairs to the berth deck where si and caleb were engaged in a friendly game of checkers on the top of a dittybox  off cried the old gunner and leaped up scattering the men on the checkerboard in all directions who told you  the signal has just been hoisted on the military mast i couldnt read it but sandram could and he translated it for me  caleb waited to hear no more but rushed on deck with walter and the others following the news was true the signal flew the words weigh anchor and follow the flagship and the heavy black smoke was pouring in dense volumes from every warships funnels  i wonder where we are bound questioned walter whose heart was thumping within him at the thought war might soon become a stern reality to him of course we are going after admiral cerveras ships  i reckon thats right but theres no telling responded caleb the officers dont consult us when they want to move you know and he said this so dryly that both walter and si had to laugh  the warships at hand were four in numberthe brooklyn which i have already described and the massachusetts texas and scorpion with them was the collier sterling loaded to the very rail with huge bags of coal for the exclusive use of the flying squadron  the massachusetts was a battleship of the firstclass a sister ship to the indiana she had a displacement of over ten thousand tons and a speed of sixteen knots per hour her massive armor was eighteen inches thickenough to withstand some of the heaviest shots ever fired from any gun her armament consisted of a main battery of four 13inch and eight 8inch guns and four 6inch slowfire guns the secondary battery comprised twenty 6pounders four 1pounders four gatlings and two fieldguns besides this she carried three torpedo tubes and an immense quantity of smallarms captain francis j higginson was in charge with lieutenantcommander seaton schroeder  the texas was a battleship of the second class her displacement being only 6315 tons she had the honor to be the first vessel built when our navy began its reconstruction in 1886 her armor was just one foot thick and she could speed along at the rate of nearly eighteen knots an hour two 12inch and six 6inch slowfire guns made up her main battery while her secondary battery counted up six 1pounders four hotchkiss and two gatling guns there were two torpedo tubes the texas was under the command of captain john w philip and lieutenantcommander giles b harber  the scorpion was a despatch boat of the gunboat pattern with a displacement of six hundred tons and a rapidfiring battery of four 5inch and six 6pounders she was a swift craft and had done duty as a scout for a long time  the signal to weigh anchor was hoisted on the flagship at four oclock in the afternoon and inside of half an hour the flying squadron and the collier were standing down hampton roads toward the capes each ploughing the waters at a twelve to fifteen knot rate the wharves alongshore were lined with people who waved their hats and their handkerchiefs and shouted out their best wishes for the departing ones  remember the maine boys and send us a good account of yourselves shouted one old southern veteran as he shook a partly empty coat sleeve at them i wish i was younger id go along and fight as well for the old stars and stripes as i once did for the stars and bars  now youre talking responded a union veteran that other quarrel was our own eh neighbor let foreign nations keep their hands off uncle sams family and the children seeking his protection three cheers for old glory and free cuba and the cheers were given with a will while fortress monroe thundered out a parting salute  a number of other vessels including the protected cruisers minneapolis and new orleans and the auxiliary cruiser st paul had been left behind to join their sister ships later on the new orleans was a warship but recently purchased from the brazilian government and formerly known as the amazonas the st paul had formerly been a transatlantic steamer and was commanded by captain charles e sigsbee who had so gallantly stuck to his post until the last moment when the maine was destroyed  each of the warships had a harbor pilot on board and proceeded under a full head of steam for the passage between the capes which were passed a little after seven oclock in the evening leaving cape henry well to starboard the pilots were dropped and the warships taking the middle course as it is termed disappeared from the gaze of those who had watched their departure so eagerly  were out for a fight now sure enough said caleb as he and walter went below each to the mess to which he had been assigned orders are to prepare for action so ive just been told  i noticed that lights were being extinguished answered the youth do you suppose they are afraid that the spanish warships are coming up this way  no telling lad its a game of hide and seek until one fellow or the other sneaks up and thumps his opponent in the neck i only hope were in it to do the first thumping  mess was scarcely over when there came a call to quarters ports were closed with massive steel covers the battle hatches were put down and the big guns were carefully loaded watches had of course already been established and now the men were ordered to take turns at standing by the guns  which way are we pointing eastward or down the coast questioned walter of si who had come up during his off hours to take a look at the cloudy sky from which only a few stars were peeping  we are moving almost directly southward was the slow reply of the yankee youth after a long look overhead  and where will that bring us to si  it will take us to cape hatteras first and if we keep on long enough it will bring us to the neighborhood of san salvador island but i reckon well change our course after hatteras is passed  isnt hatteras a bad point to pass  is it you just ought to try it in dirty weather many a craft has left her hulk off that cape but such a craft as the brooklyn with her high bow ought to weather almost anything to my mind the worst thing we can run into is a fogbank and thats just what we are likely to do in this vicinity  the regular lights of the warship had been extinguished but behind its hood the great searchlight glowed and spluttered ready to be turned to one point or another at a seconds notice all was quiet on board save for the rumble and quiver of the powerful engines which were driving this floating fort on her way through the rolling ocean while daylight lasted the vessels kept more or less apart but with the coming of night they closed in and the fretting and puffing little scorpion darted ahead on picket guard  walters duty at his gun came to an end at midnight and none too soon for the lad whose head had suddenly begun to spin around like a top i guess im getting seasick he murmured to si and the yankee lad at once led him away to a secluded corner where he might have matters all his own way and where none might look on and enjoy his misery once haskett started to pass some uncomplimentary remarks about walter but a single stern look from caleb silenced the seaman who tumbled into his hammock without another word for several days jim haskett had kept his distance but he was only biding his time to even up as he termed it ill make young russell feel mighty sore before im done with him was what he promised himself  walter was expected to go on duty again at four oclock but he was in no condition for service and sent caleb word to that effect paul took the message and soon returned with a reply  youre to take it easy until youre all right said paul walton will fix it up so there will be no trouble  hes the best friend a fellow ever fell in with sighed walter if i hadnt met him i dont know what i should have done  oh you would have taken care of yourself answered paul lightly he had not yet forgotten the attack haskett had sustained at walters hands  daybreak found the squadron running into the first of a series of fogbanks at once the speed of each warship was reduced and presently it became necessary to use the foghorns and shipbells in the meantime all hands were put through several drills to get them into fighting trim as the officer of the deck explained the drills lasted until dinner time and in some way they made walter feel much better as a matter of fact his spell of seasickness was of short duration and once gone the malady never returned  im a fine specimen of a jackie am i not he said to caleb with a faint smile on first presenting himself why a spaniard could knock me over with a feather  dont you go for to find fault with yourself was the old gunners reply ive known men who have been on the ocean for years to get sick the first day out its something they cant overcome try their best why i saw several officers of the marines as sick as so many dogs  mess over walter went on deck for a breath of fresh air they had just left a fogbank and were standing out boldly into the ocean the youth sauntered slowly forward as far as the rules permitted  sail o came suddenly from the military mast  where away demanded the officer on the bridge  dead ahead sir  is she flying any flag  i think not sir  what does she look like  i cant make out very well for she is running into the fog i dont know but that she looks a bit like a warship continued the lookout after some hesitation  without delay commodore schley and captain cook were notified a brief consultation took place and it was decided to pursue the unknown craft and find out what she was and where she was going     chapter xii  an adventure off charleston   the news that a strange vessel was in sight soon travelled throughout the ship and all who could do so crowded to the spar deck while the officers stationed themselves on the forecastle bridge and other points of vantage  there was no necessity to give the order clear ship for action for the brooklyn was already cleared moreover all the big guns contained their charges of eightinch and other shells the sixpounders and the colts were now provided as it is termed and then there was nothing to do but to lie by the guns and await further orders  immediately upon notification that a strange sail was in sight the flagship had run up a signal to the scorpion follow the unknown ship to the southward and away darted the little gunboat at a rate of speed which caused the mighty waves of the atlantic to wash her decks from end to end presently the sea proved almost too heavy for her and she had to reduce her speed and the brooklyn went ahead her high freeboard sending the water to port and starboard with scarcely an effort once however she did get caught below an unusually high crest and all on the forward deck received a liberal drenching  fire a shot across her bow was the order given when the strange craft again emerged from a fogbank and boom one of the smaller guns belched forth the echoes of the shot had scarcely died away when the unknown ship was seen to hoist the british flag  only a britisher sighed caleb when the news came down to him and i thought we were going to have the profit of a nice spanish prize  not caring to go entirely by the flag displayed since the unknown ship had acted so strangely the scorpion was again sent forward to make an investigation in quarter of an hour she came up within hailing distance  what ship is that was bawled out through a megaphone  british steamer elsie what gunboat is that  the scorpion of the united states navy where are you bound and what have you on board  bound for norfolk virginia with a cargo of phosphate rock  why didnt you show your flag before  well to tell the truth we were afraid we had run into some spanish warships and that england might be mixed up in this muss in which case we didnt want to become a spanish prize how is it are we in it yet  no uncle sam is running this war without outside help was the concluding remark and then the two vessels separated and the flying squadron proceeded on its way  saturday found the course of the brooklyn changed to southwest by south we are still hugging the coast explained si i shouldnt wonder if we are to make a stop somewhere say at charleston or savannah  perhaps the commodore has word that the spanish ships are sailing for our southeast coast suggested walter my what a nasty day it is going to be he referred to the mist which was so heavy that it felt almost like rain for may the weather was raw and cold and all hands were glad to stay below decks as much as possible  on this day another long exercise at the gun was had and walter learned more thoroughly than ever how the charge was raised from the ammunition hoists to the gun pushed into place by the mechanical rammer and how the gun was moved up down or sideways by merely touching this button or that wheel or lever its wonderful he observed i suppose it would be next to impossible to move such a big gun by hand  oh it can be done answered caleb in the old navy they used to do it by hand and each gun had ten to sixteen men to man it in those days they had no device to lessen the shock of the recoil as we have now instead of having a water cushion for the gun to strike on they used a heavy rope in the back and sometimes the rope broke and the gun did more damage flying backward than the charge did flying forward  they didnt have any breechloaders in those days did they  they had some in the civil war but not many before that everything in the way of powder and ball had to be put into the muzzle and was rammed home by hand the first breechloading guns were clumsy affairs and not a few accidents were had by guns going off before the breeches were properly locked  and what about sighting the pieces  oh they have had dozens of devices for getting a correct aim some pretty good and some decidedly bad in the old navy the guns didnt carry near so far as they do now and your oldtime gunner was just what his name calls for for he sighted the piece and fired it himself but the old times are gone and i expect one of these days all the work still left will be done by machinery and a dozen men sitting up in the conning tower will control the warship from stem to stern  walter laughed at this i reckon were some time off from that yet walton but it is wonderful how much the commander can control by using his bells annunciators speakingtubes and electrical indicators i guess that is a great improvement on the old way of yelling orders through a speakingtrumpet and having a dozen middies rushing around telling this man and that what to do  no doubt of it lad but when its all done and said you must remember one thingwe have still to prove the worth of our floating forts in war times dewey did well at manila but it may be that the spanish warships out there werent in the best condition now this admiral cervera whom we are after has ships that are thoroughly up to date and when his outfit meets ours thenwell well see what we will see concluded the old gunner  that afternoon walter took his first lesson in making knots he had had some idea concerning a variety of knots which had been taught to him by larry when he and his younger brother were sailing about lake erie but those which were now exhibited were truly bewildering  the single bend and figure of 8 are easy enough he sighed but when you come to that sheepshank and bowline upon the bight as you term them it grows confusing  this is only the beginning answered caleb after you know the knots youll want to learn the hitcheshalfhitch rollinghitch and so onand after that youll want to take up the splices and then the different kinds of tacklelongtackle singlewhip and all that i reckon those will keep your mind busy for a week or two to be sure those things belong more to a seaman than a gunhand but its good to know how to do in case you are called upon at some time  the night came on with a storm in the air as before all the lights were extinguished and the different watches took their turns at the guns walter had just turned in when a shout rang out another vessel in sight as rapidly as possible the lad leaped up  is it a spanish warship he asked  dont know answered caleb laconically but leaped to the gun with walter and the others following  but it was only another scare for the vessel in sight proved to be a merchantman bound for a northern port the big searchlight of the brooklyn was turned upon her and instantly every light on the merchantman went out and the ship sneaked away with all sails set no effort was made to pursue her  the captain of that craft will report falling in with a big spanish fleet see if he dont said caleb and the old gunner was right as a newspaper of a few days later proved  by noon on sunday charleston harbor was sighted and a few hours later the squadron came to anchor near charleston bar nine miles from the city  the sterling isnt in sight said walter as he came on deck and took a look behind i wonder if the heavy sea was too much for the collier  oh shell turn up sooner or later answered si but a boat loaded as she was isnt the safest thing to sail around such a point as cape hatteras i can tell you that the collier came in before night reporting a thoroughly disagreeable trip  a lighthouse tender was at hand ready to take the mail ashore as well as to deliver letters and special messages the messages were at once delivered to commodore schley  i wonder how long well stop here said walter i wouldnt mind a run ashore just to see what the city looks like  there goes a signal to the texas said si as the signalman took up his flag and began to wigwag wait a moment till i read what he is saying  can you read it asked walter in deep interest  certainly its easy enough si began to spell to himself what whatis isyour yourbest bestrate rateof ofspeed speednow now he is asking what the texas can do at once so far as speed is concerned that means something important hold on here comes the answer again the yankee youth began to spell might go fifteen and a half knots then the signalman on the brooklyn sent another message we are off on business now and the signal went up for the squadron to weigh anchor again  were off for a fight ejaculated walter but tell me about that wigwagging si how do they signal the letters  its easy enough you take a small flag of some bright color attached to a pole six or eight feet long as soon as you attract the attention of the other fellow you begin to use the flag in three motions to the right the left and down in front to the right means one to the left means two and down in front means three now all the letters are represented by combinations of numbers and all you have to do is to learn the combinations and spell ahead its easy enough when one gets the hang of it at night you can use a lantern instead of a flag  that is easy commented walter but what about those signals at the masthead can you read those  no in those most every flag represents a letter or a word or sentence but to read the signal you have got to have either the international signal codebook or else the united states navy codebook the navy code is locked up in the captains cabin and the book is weighted with lead so that if anything happens it can be heaved overboard and sunk thus keeping it out of the enemys hands  i declare signalling isnt so difficult after all cried walter to me it looked like a perfect jumble  the trouble with flags is that when theres no wind they wont straighten out so you can see em put in caleb who had joined the pair lanterns are more to be depended upon and they have a new system now called the ardois electric in which they use four powerful electric lights so that the signals can be read at a distance of several miles youll learn all about them if you stay in the navy long enough     chapter xiii  in which the gold piece comes to light   where now was the question which more than one man on board of the brooklyn asked himself but no answer was forthcoming the commodore captain and commander knew of course but they kept the information to themselves in war it is a rule not to let the enemy know what you are doing until you do it and so a strict guard was kept so that no information might leak out yet spanish spies in canada learned a good deal and notified the home government as quickly as it could be done  from charleston the course was almost due south and both si and caleb came to the conclusion that the flagship and her sister craft were bound for cuban waters perhaps were going to join in the blockading of havana remarked the old gunner  oh i hope not said walter riding in one spot day after day must be awfully tiresome id like to hunt the spaniards out and do them battle as dewey did he didnt waste any time  deweys name was to be heard constantly for the jackies never got done talking about this first great victory of the war some of them had served on the olympia boston and other vessels of the asiatic squadron and they described just how these boats were built and what parts they must have taken in the contest  dont grow impatient walter said caleb well run up against something soonperhaps more than you care for its easy enough to think of sinking an enemys ship supposing he puts a few thirteeninch shells through your craft and you begin to go downwhat then  ill make the best of it returned the boy calmly i enlisted to fight for uncle sam and im willing to take what comes  jim haskett was passing when walter made this remark and his lip curled with a sneer that boy is too big for his boots muttered the seaman i cant see what the other men find in him to like  jim haskett was more sour than ever for his disagreeable ways had lost to him the few friends he had picked up when first coming on board the fact that si and walter were growing more popular every day caused him fairly to grate his teeth with rage  ill fix him see if i dont he told himself that night they shant tell everybody that i took that gold piecewhen i didnt touch his bag  jim haskett was one of those mean unscrupulous men who do a wrong and then try to argue themselves into thinking that it is all right it was not true that he had taken the tendollar gold piece from sis bag but it was true that he had found the yankee boys satchel overturned and partly open and had closed it up and locked it and afterward found the money on the floor of the car within a few feet of where the bag had stood any fairminded man would have told himself that the gold piece must be the one lost by si but haskett was not fairminded and it was doubtful if the man could ever become so any more than a dwarfed and crippled tree can be forced to become straight and upright  on monday morning the day after leaving charleston bar haskett heard caleb tell walter and si that the gun must be cleaned and oiled well go over the piece from top to bottom tomorrow said the old gunner and if there is anything more that you dont understand ill explain it to you  this is my chance said haskett to himself and lost no time in bringing forth the gold piece from the place where he had hidden it watching his opportunity when caleb si and walter were asleep that night he secreted the piece in a corner of the track upon which the gunbase revolved  inside of half an hour after breakfast the next day walter stripped to the waist was working over the gun in company with his friends and steve colton the second guncaptain and carl stuben the hoseman all were supplied with cotton waste polishingpaste and rags and in a short while the bright portions of the gun shone like a mirror  there i reckon that will suit the chief gunner was calebs remark as he stood back to inspect the work no piece on the starboard side brighter than this ill wager my months pay  si was bending down under the gun swabbing up some oil which had run down from one of the working joints suddenly the yankee youth threw down his swab and caught up something which shone in spite of the dirt upon it  my gold piece as sure as youre born he ejaculated after he had made an inspection at the porthole now how in creation did that get there  he looked at caleb and half unconsciously both turned to walter  whats that asked the youth  my gold piecei found it hidden under the guntrack answered si  walters face turned red as he remembered what jim haskett had said concerning his talking in his sleep why siareare you sure it is your piece he faltered  certainly there is the date 1876centennial year and here is a scratch i once made with my jackknife its the very one that was taken from my bag beyond any doubt  si continued to look at walter while caleb suddenly turned and gazed out of the porthole while stuben the hoseman whistled softly to himself  why si have you got your money back cried paul who had just chanced up  yes  and where did you find it  under the gun by the track and si pointed out the place with his forefinger  under the gun why that is where haskett said walter hid it was pauls comment before he stopped to think twice i meanthat is haskett said something about it he stammered  i know he did answered the yankee youth coldly  walters face was burning hotly now and he could scarcely trust himself to speak si do you think i put that money there he asked in a strained voice  im sure i dont know what to think was the dogged answer and now si turned his gaze away haskett saidwell you know whatand cal blinker backed him up in it he went on hesitatingly  yes i know what haskett and blinker said answered walter butbutdo you think i stole your money the words would scarcely come but he forced them out  i dont say that walter but the whole thing looks mighty queer  i have it burst out caleb perhaps walter put the money there when he was asleep folks often do queer things when they have the nightmare  yes but if he put it there while he was asleep how did he come by it in the first place questioned si bluntly  perhaps he took it out of the bag while he was asleep on the train suggested caleb you had the bag with you all the way from boston didnt you  yes  and walter bunked with you too  he did  then its as plain as day went on the old gunner walter took the money while you were asleep on the train and hid it away in his clothing or somewhere when he got on board he took to sleepwalking and put the piece under the gun of course he doesnt know anything about the transaction  again all eyes were turned upon walter whose face was as red as ever perhaps thats truebut its mighty queer murmured colton the second guncaptain  i dont believe i did anything of the sort cried the youth at last i can give you my word on it that i never saw sis money until just now to my mind this whole matter is a job put up by jim haskett he took the money and then when si raised such an ado about it he was afraid to get it changed or to spend it and he watched his chance to get rid of it hes down on me and when he heard me mutter in my sleep he formed his plan to get me into trouble im going to find haskett on the spot and off he rushed before anybody could detain him  haskett was discovered mending his jacket which had become torn the evening before what do you want he asked as walter ran up and caught him fiercely by the arm  i want you to own up to your dirty trick on me answered the boy you thought you had me but your little plot wont work  what do you mean blustered haskett although he knew well enough what was coming  by this time the crowd had followed walter and they gathered round the pair soon haskett had heard all there was to say  dont lay it off on me he cried i knew russell was guilty from the start si doring can think as he pleases as for me im glad that im not training with a nightwalkeror a thief  walter leaped forward with blazing eyes but before he could strike out caleb caught him while another man held haskett then before anything more could be done or said si stepped to the front  haskett i lost the money and i think i ought to have the biggest say in this matter if you played a trick on walter you are the meanest man that ever trod the deck of a ship if you didnt let me say that i dont think walter stole the gold piece although he may have taken it while he was asleep and not responsible for his doings  thank you for saying that si came from walter but i dont think i took it even when asleep to my mind haskett is guilty and nobody else  if i wasnt held began haskett when a young seaman named george ellis chief yeoman of the brooklyn stepped forward and asked to know what the trouble was about  i think i can tell something about this said george ellis after the matter had been explained  you just hold your jaw stormed haskett you dont know anything  i know what i see answered the chief yeoman pointedly and something in his manner attracted such attention that all in the crowd gathered around to learn what he might have to say     chapter xiv  key west and the last of jim haskett   george ellis was known to be an upright honest man and one whose word was worth taking upon every occasion he had an education above that of the ordinary man in the navy and was anxious to make something of himself while in the service of his country never dreaming alas that his life was so soon to be taken from him during our struggle in the cause of humanity and cuban freedom  and what did you see questioned caleb as all eyes were turned upon ellis inquiringly  it was last night answered the range finder for such was the mans popular title given him because he was so good at determining distances i was rather feverish and couldnt sleep i walked the berth deck for a while and then went up to waltons gun and stood leaning out of the porthole gazing at the water  presently i heard a slight noise behind me and turning around i saw in a dim way the figure of a man behind me he was bending down under the gun as if he was hunting for something i was just on the point of speaking to him when he straightened up and slunk away as silently as a ghost i watched him and when he got under the rays of the electric light i got a good look at his face  and was it this man cried si pointing to jim haskett  it was  with a cry of anger si leaped upon haskett and bore him to the deck you goodfornothin rascal he panted will try to shove off your dirty tricks on walter eh so you stole my money and then got afraid to use it take that and that and that  each that was a blow in the face one on the cheek another on the nose and a third directly in hasketts left eye they were heavy and haskett roared with pain  let up he sputtered let go of methe latter to caleb who still held him oh my eye is this fair fighting two to one  it is as fair as you treated walter answered caleb give him another si he deserves it and si followed directions by planting a blow on hasketts neck something which spun the former mate of the sunflower around like a top at last haskett broke loose and backed away  ill get square on all of you he foamed shaking his fist first at caleb and then at the others im not done yet  illustration ill get square on all of you  ive a good mind to report you put in walter i reckon youd be good for a month in irons on bread and water  at this haskett grew pale the officers wont believe your story ellis and the rest of you havent any witnesses he replied but his voice shook just wait my day will come some time and then as si started to advance again he beat a hasty retreat  that settles that mystery remarked caleb when the excitement was over i calculate walter that you are not sorry the way matters came out  no indeed walter turned to george ellis i owe you one for your kindness ill not forget it  thats all righti only did what any fairminded fellow would do answered the chief yeoman and strolled away  it was time for dinner and walter hurried off arm in arm with si who was still somewhat worked up over what had happened walter dont you go for to imagine i thought you guilty said the yankee boy i know you are honest to the core  even if i do talk in my sleep said walter from whose heart a great load had been lifted  once more the course of the flying squadron had been changed and now they were making straight for the coast of florida tuesday passed quietly although the same vigilance prevailed as before it was evident come what might commodore schley did not mean to allow the enemy to catch him napping  they had passed through the straits of florida and now they turned to the westward past a number of the florida reefs far across the ocean could be seen the lowlying shore backed up by stately palms and other trees the weather was now much warmer  you see we are drawing closer to the equator remarked caleb i reckon we are bound for key west and his surmise proved correct for they dropped anchors in key west harbor early on the morning following  what a lot of warships around here cried walter as he came on deck what is that big fellow over yonder  that is the iowa answered the old gunner you can well say big fellow for the iowa is the largest seagoing battleship we possess she has a displacement of over eleven thousand tons and can speed in any sea at over seventeen knots she carries four 12inch guns and a whole host of others her armor belt is solid steel fourteen inches thick  shes a beauty i wonder if she will go out with us  that is according to what rear admiral sampson has to say about it lad you see this campaign in atlantic waters is largely in his hands  the iowa lay quite close and during the day several messages were transmitted from one warship to the other by means of the wigwag system walter had now mastered the mysteries of wigwagging and amused himself by spelling out the messages as they passed to and fro  a salute had been fired when the commodore entered the harbor eleven rounds being shot off if he was a rearadmiral hed get thirteen guns explained caleb you see the salute varies from the president down mckinley gets twentyone guns the vicepresident or secretary of the navy nineteen guns a foreign minister fifteen guns a consul seven guns and so on by counting the guns every man on the ships can tell what sort of a dignitary has arrived  it was a cloudy day and the air was so close that walter was glad enough to take it easy presently he saw a boat leave the side containing several petty officers and george ellis and jim haskett  i wonder where they are going said walter to si  some special business for captain cook answered paul who stood near oh but haskett is in an ugly mood today it will be a big wonder if he and ellis dont get into a fight before they come back  ellis is too much of a gentleman to fight with any one returned walter by the way what is his real position on board  he is chief yeoman replied si he is going ashore to look after some ships stores so i heard him tell one of the paymasters  the small boat was soon out of sight and walter turned away to seek the shade for it was growing hotter and hotter if this is a sample of weather in the torrid zone what shall we do when we get into cuban waters he observed  we are not very far from cuban waters now said the yankee youth we could make havana in six or seven hours if it was necessary  i wonder how the people of that city feel si all cooped up as they have been for so long  i reckon they wish they had some fighting ships to come out after us walter ive heard it said that general blanco hardly knows how to turn himself food is so scarce and so many idlers are about it wouldnt surprise me if they had a riot there if they havent had one already even soldiers wont keep quiet when the grub fails  but little could be seen of key west outside of the numerous shipping presently a couple of petty officers came along with marine glasses and one pointed out to his companion several spanish prizes in the port theyll be worth a good bit of money to the sailors on the blockade he added i wish we were in for a share of the spoils  there are several transports said caleb on joining his friends they are fitting out to go to tampa it wont be long before an army of invasion starts for cuba  i wonder if my brother ben will go along mused walter but just then to get word from his older brother was impossible  inside of two hours the small craft came back somewhat to his surprise walter saw that jim haskett was missing he would not have thought much of this had it not been that the brooklyn was already preparing to continue on her trip  haskett did not come back he announced to si ill wager something is wrong  oh i guess not said the yankee youth nevertheless he too began to watch for the former mate of the sunflower  several hours later walter passed george ellis on the upper deck and saluted the chief yeoman hesitated and then called walter to him  i suppose you and your friend will be interested to know that james haskett has been left behind at key west under military arrest he began  indeed and what for if i may ask  for getting into a roughandtumble fight with a soldier named grumbell it seems grumbell once owned a fishingsmack down east and haskett failed to settle up on a cargo of fish he sold for grumbell three years ago they had a quarrel of words and then got to blows and haskett hit a captain of the regulars who tried to separate them both he and the soldier are now in prison and i rather imagine it will go pretty hard with the seaman for striking a captain is no light offence and after a few words more george ellis passed on  of course walter lost no time in carrying the news to his friends all listened with interest and si said he was glad haskett was gone and i hope he doesnt ever come back he added  and jim haskett never did come back nor did walter ever set eyes on the man again for quarrelling with the soldier and striking the captain of the regulars jim haskett was dishonorably discharged from the navy and sentenced to a years imprisonment at hard labor thus in a roundabout way was the rascal made to suffer the punishment he so richly deserved     chapter xv  from cienfuegos to santiago bay   from key west the flying squadron set sail direct for cienfuegos the brooklyn massachusetts texas and scorpion left together and were followed twentyfour hours later by the iowa mentioned in the previous chapter and by the castine and the collier merrimac  cienfuegos is a town of good size lying on a small bay on the south coast of cuba about midway between the eastern and western extremities for several days the navy department had been watching or trying to watch the movements of the spanish squadron satisfied at last that it was somewhere in cuban waters one report had it that admiral cervera was at cienfuegos another that he was at santiago de cuba many miles to the eastward commodore schley was now sent out to bring the truth to light were it possible to do so  the rainy season as it is termed was at its height in this vicinity and the showers came down nearly all day striking the hot metal decks and converting the water into something closely resembling steam it was so muggy and uncomfortable that hardly any of the jackies could sleep and more than one poor fellow was overcome and had to be carried to the sick bay for treatment  if that spanish squadron has passed santiago and cienfuegos and is crawling up around the western turn of cuba it wont be long before we see some hot work observed caleb as he lounged at a porthole devoid of any clothing but his shirt and trousers  any kind of work would be hot said walter laughingly why i think a fellow could cook eggs on deck  puts me in mind of a voyage i took to south america put in si who had just soused his head into a bucket of water and was dripping from nose ears and chin in consequence we lay off the mouth of the amazon for two days waiting to get on a cargo of rubber it was right under the equator and the tar just poured out of all our seams one afternoon i ran across the deck in my bare feet for i was taking a swim and as true as i live i blistered my feet  oh thats nothing returned caleb dryly i was under the equator once off the coast of columbia in the bark sally d the captain let us go fishing in the jollyboat we caught about a dozen fish and threw em in the bottom as fast as they came in and when we got back to the bark hang me if the first two fish we had brought up werent baked as nice as you please all fit for the captains table and caleb turned away and began to whistle softly to himself while si continued his ablutions without another word among old sailors matching yarns is a constant pastime and the stories sometimes told would shame even a baron munchausen  the watch on board of the warship was now more strict than ever and the men slept at their guns sometimes not seeing a hammock for several nights everybody from the captain down to the apprentices felt that a crisis could not be far off  it must not be imagined that while commodore schley was skirting the southern coast of cuba the northern coast was neglected for such was not the case the blockade of havana and vicinity still continued and in addition rearadmiral sampson took his own flagship the new york and several other warships and sailed eastward thinking to occupy the st nicholas channel thus if admiral cervera tried to gain the vicinity of havana by the northern coast he would be likely to fall in with sampson if he took the southern way schley would intercept his path by keeping his ships in the st nicholas channel sampson remained ever ready to dash northward should the spanish destroyers take a new course and show themselves along our own coast  we are coming in sight of land cried walter toward nightfall two days after leaving key west i suppose this is some port on the southern coast of cuba  it is cienfuegos bay returned caleb i just heard one of the officers say so were to lie at anchor until morning and then perhaps the fun will commence  at this announcement walters heart beat quickly and it must be admitted that he did not sleep a wink that night for speculating on what the morrow might bring forth in this particular his thoughts were not far different from those of every one else on board  daybreak brought more rain and the big warship rode on the long swells of the ocean grim and silent not far away lay the texas and several newcomers could be seen approaching from a distance this looks like business observed si to walter and the boy nodded  immediately after breakfast the signal was hoisted to clear ship for action and once more the jackies rushed to their various places and got into fighting trim then the great engines of the brooklyn began to work and they crept slowly toward the entrance to the harbor  if cervera is there he keeps himself pretty well hidden remarked one of the officers within hearing of walter i dont see anything that looks like a warship  presently the flagship came to a halt and the texas steamed past her and quite close to the harbor here the spaniards had a small land battery but it kept silent the inner portion of the bay was hidden from view by a high spur of land  what to do next was a problem if the spanish squadron was really there it would be foolhardy to rush in and do battle while the enemy would have the support of the shore battery commodore schley thought the matter over and ever on the alert decided to play a waiting game  sunday passed without anything unusual developing and so did the day following the strain on the men at the guns was great for they were on duty constantly night and day the bosom of the outer bay was closely watched for it was known that cervera had with him one or two torpedoboat destroyers and these were dreaded more than anything else  let one of those torpedo destroyers get near us and well go up as quickly as did the maine said caleb im not afraid of the dagos but let me get out of the way of a torpedo boat every time and this opinion was shared by all waltons messmates  theres another boat coming up announced si at six oclock on tuesday morning walton what do you make her out to be  shes the marblehead was the old gunners answer after a long look at the craft and shes got despatches for the commodore he added as the signal went up and a small boat put off for the brooklyn soon commander mccalla of the marblehead came on board and a long conference with commodore schley resulted after which the newly arrived officer departed for his own warship with all possible speed mccallas mission was to communicate with the cuban insurgents who were encamped near cienfuegos with a view to ascertaining if admiral cerveras ships were really in the harbor  the morning passed quietly and by noon the marblehead and her commander returned the cuban spies had made an investigation and not a single ship of war belonging to spain had been found outside of a little harbor vessel of small moment  it was now thought that if admiral cervera was not at cienfuegos he must either be on his way hither or at santiago accordingly toward evening the squadron received orders to sail for santiago  were off for santiago bay said caleb and if we dont find the dagos there ill give up where they are perhaps they have gone back to spain he continually alluded to the spaniards as dagosa term which became quite common among soldiers and sailors during the war although many referred to the enemy as the dons  it had cleared off and the sun shone down fiercely on the deck and elsewhere inside of the steel turrets the air was stifling and no one could remain at his post over a couple of hours from below the engineers firemen and coalheavers came up constantly for a whiff of fresh air  were badly enough off remarked walter but look at those poor chaps why some of the firemen look ready to melt  yes and the worst of it is they never get any credit when it comes to a battle added caleb now to my mind the engineer who sticks to his engine during a battle obeying orders and running the risk of having a shot plough through a boiler and scald him to death is just as much of a hero as the chap behind a gunand in one way hes more of a hero for if the ship should start to sink a gunner has got the chance to leap overboard and swim for it while the man below is likely to be drowned like a rat in a trap  and the coalheavers work harder than negroes put in paul just think of the tons and tons of coal they shovel every twentyfour hours when we are under full steam im quite certain such work would break my back  oh life on a warship isnt all a picnic was sis comment if a fellow enlists to have an easy time of it he deserves to get left i enlisted to serve uncle sam and im going to do itif providence will give me the chance  as commodore schley sailed toward santiago from cienfuegos rearadmiral sampson gaining additional information concerning the whereabouts of the enemy moved slowly and cautiously eastward toward cape maysi and the windward passage thus if cervera was where he was supposed to be he was bound to be discovered before many more days passed  do you know anything about santiago bay asked si of walter ive travelled to south america and central america but i never stopped anywhere in cuba  i know only what the geographies teach answered walter it is on the south side of cuba a hundred and some odd miles from the eastern end of the island it is said to be a very pretty harbor about eight miles long and one to two miles wide santiago which is the next largest cuban city to havana is located on the northeast shore i heard caleb say that the entrance to the harbor is shaped like the neck of a crooked bottle and that on the eastern side there is a strong fortress called morro castle and opposite to it a heavy concealed battery called la zocapa somehow its in my mind that well see a good deal of the harbor before we come away concluded the boy     chapter xvi  the finding of admiral cerveras fleet   well this doesnt look much like fighting  it was paul who uttered the remark the youngest member of the gunners crowd rested in the shadow of one of the long guns half asleep near by sat walter and si each writing letters although there was no telling when the communications would be taken from the brooklyn and sent home at key west walter had looked for some word from ben and from job dowling but none had come  id like to know if my uncle went to boston and if he learned anything concerning that deck mumpers and the stolen heirlooms walter observed to si after nodding to paul in agreement that it didnt look like fighting  well youll have to possess your soul in patience answered the young yankee but oh this is dead slow and thrusting his letter into an envelope he addressed it and laid it away  several days had been spent around the mouth of santiago bay without anything being brought to light if the spanish fleet was within the harbor it knew enough to keep out of sight that was certain  if i was commodore schley id rush past old morro and make short work of this grumbled paul stretching himself and yawning why well all die of laziness if this keeps on  i hear the merrimac has broken down put in caleb who had just come below that means another wait of twentyfour hours or more even if cervera isnt in the harbor why under the sun must those dagos play such a game of hideandseek why cant they come up and fight like men  perhaps admiral cervera is bombarding some of our cities at this very moment began si when a sudden loud hurrah caused all hands to leap up and make for the deck  whats up came from a hundred throats  the iowa has just signalled that she has seen a big spanish warship showing her nose around the harbor point was the wild answer weve found the dons at last  and then came another hurrah and a wild yell let us get at em down with the spaniards remember the maine and deweys victory at manila  commodore schley was on the afterbridge of the flagship as the yelling broke loose he smiled grimly yes they must be in there he said to captain cook and if they are theyll never get home prophetic words as the events of just five weeks later proved  owing to the heavy swells of the ocean the warships under the commodores command had drifted somewhat apart but now when it was known definitely that admiral cerveras ships were in the harbor before them the various craft were signalled to draw closer until they lay within four to six miles of the entrance this may seem a long way off to some of my readers but it must be remembered that guns of the present day can carry as far as ten to twelve miles when put to it and a destructive fire can be maintained at seven or eight miles  the night that followed was a trying one for no one knew but that admiral cerveras warships might come dashing out of the bay at any instant ready to do them deadly battle the brooklyn had long since been stripped for action many articles of wood being thrown overboard to avoid splinters when shot and shell began to fall the small boats were covered with strong nets also to keep splinters away and everywhere throughout the ship the hoses were connected with the waterplugs to be used in case of fire and all watertubs were kept filled for a like purpose the magazines were kept open and every gun big and little stood ready to be fired at the word of command even the wardroom tables were cleared off and covered with the sickbay cloths and the surgeons saw to it in a quiet way that their bandages knives and saws were ready to hand  say but that looks like war eh whispered paul jerking his thumb in the direction of one of the improvised operating tables gracious its enough to give a fellow a cold shiver  then dont look that way paul answered walter as si said life here isnt expected to be a picnic we may gain lots of glory but well have to work for itand maybe suffer too  it was the 30th of may decoration day but no services of a special character were had although the civil war was talked of by a dozen veterans of both the north and the south who were now standing once more shoulder to shoulder as washington jefferson and a hundred other patriots of old had intended that they should stand once and forever were under the stars and stripes to stay said one man who had worn the gray at gettysburg just let those dons show themselves and well lick em out of their boots the mans name was berkeley and he was as good a soldier as he was a sailor and wore both union and confederate medals for bravery  walter had just fallen into a light doze early in the morning when a dull booming awoke him with a start and made him leap to his feet what is thatguns firing he asked  thats it lad came from caleb the commodore is giving his defiance to the enemy i reckon there she goes again he went on as half a dozen sullen reports rolled over the water i just wish we were in this  a spanish warship the christobal colon had again showed herself at the entrance to santiago bay and the iowa the massachusetts and the new orleans had been ordered to move to within seven thousand yards and open fire away they darted and passed and repassed the harbor entrance twice firing as they sailed what damage was done it was impossible to tell but that the colon was hit seemed very probable for she soon disappeared the shore batteries also took part and sent one big shell directly over the iowa where it burst with a noise that was deafening but without doing any damage  gracious what a racket exclaimed walter as he watched the bombardment from afar  racket repeated caleb who stood beside him why lad this is nothing to what well have when we get mixed up i only hope the commodore signals us to line up for the scrap he went on for commodore schley had left the brooklyn temporarily and hoisted his pennant on the massachusetts but the signal did not come much to the old gunners disappointment  by dark the bombardment was at an end it had been brought about by the commodore with the view to ascertain the strength of the enemy his ability to shoot straight and the number and location of the shore batteries now this information was gained and it was likely to be of great value in the near future  it had been decided should admiral cerveras fleet be discovered in santiago bay that commodore schley should unload the collier merrimac as quickly as possible and then sink the craft directly across the channel at the narrow entrance if this was accomplished it would make it impossible for the spanish warships to escape until the sunken wreck was blown up and cleared away and in the meantime several other available american vessels could be hurried to the scene of action a number of spies had been sent ashore and at last the commodore was positive that the enemy was just where he wanted him and now well sink the merrimac and bottle him up he said  the merrimac was an iron steamboat of five thousand tons burden she had previously been a tramp steamer that is one going from port to port picking up any cargo that came to hand she carried a large quantity of coal for the various ships and as we already know had followed the flying squadron from key west to cienfuegos and the present ocean territory she was a heavily built craft carrying two masts and just the right sort for the plan now at hand  a heavy salute on the morning of june 1 announced the coming of admiral sampson with a number of additional warshipsthe new york oregon mayflower porter and others the new york it may be added here was a cruiser similar to the brooklyn only somewhat smaller the oregon was a battleship of the first class of over ten thousand tons displacement and carried four 13inch eight 8inch and four 6inch guns in her main battery over twenty guns in her secondary battery besides several gatling guns and three torpedo tubes this noble vessel had just made a record for herself by steaming at full speed from san francisco around cape horn to our eastern coast without a breakdowna journey without precedent for a heavy battleship so far as our own navy was concerned in the past foreign critics had imagined that our vessels were not quite as good as theirs in thoroughness of build now these critics were silenced and they stood looking on and wondering what those clever yankees would do next  the merrimac had been under the command of captain james miller but now she was eased of a large quantity of her coal and turned over to lieutenant richmond p hobson an assistant naval constructor hobson had his plans arranged in detail for sinking the merrimac and all he asked for was a crew of six or seven men to aid him in running the collier into the harbor channel i know it looks like certain death to go in he said and therefore i want only volunteers with me  you can get them easily enough said rearadmiral sampson with a smile i know a hundred men on the new york who will be only too anxious to go no matter how dangerous the mission volunteers were called for and to the credit of our navy be it said that the crews of the different ships offered themselves almost to a man  we can die only once said one old gunner take me  id like to go captain said caleb appealing to captain cook cant you put me on the list somehow  ill go said walter readily and si said the same paul was so young that he knew they would not take him  of course where only seven men were wanted and hundreds had begged to be allowed to go there were numerous disappointments at last the list was made up of the followingnames to be remembered by every patriotic young american lieutenant hobson in command o w deignan helmsman g f phillips engineer f kelley fireman j murphy coxswain g charette mine batteries d montague anchor hand r clausen extra wheelman the men were all experienced sailors and fully realized the extreme peril which awaited them when they should run the merrimac in directly under the fire of morro castle and the la zocapa battery  a start was made late on wednesday night the merrimac cruising up and down before the harbor entrance trying to gain a favorable opportunity for entering but none showed itself and by orders of the rearadmiral the attempt was postponed until the night following in the meantime a catamaran was built and attached to the merrimacs side to be used in getting away in case the small boats became disabled when the craft was wrecked     chapter xvii  in which the merrimac is sunk   its too bad we cant get places on the merrimac observed walter to si as the two walked to their quarters after the selection of men had been made if lieutenant hobson succeeds in getting the collier up in the harbor entrance and sinking her it will be a big feather in his cap  my idea is that the heavy guns of old morro will blow the merrimac clean out of the water before she gets within quarter of a mile of where she is to be sunk answered the yankee lad those on board are running the greatest risk of their lives  but the glory si  no glory if youre killed  but you said you would go  so i wouldbut i wouldnt expect to come back alive ill wager we never see hobson again nor none of his men  the fierce heat of the day had given walter a headache as evening came on it grew worse and he was not able to sleep during the night  i hope im not getting the cuban fever he remarked to caleb who had offered several simple remedies ready at hand  better report and go on the sick list advised the old gunner if its fever the sooner you take it in hand the better  at first walter demurred but finally as the ache in his head began to creep all over him he reported to one of the surgeons i dont want to go into the sick bay he said but i wish you would give me something  yes you need something was the answer we dont want any men to get down so soon we may have to stay on the blockade here for some time if cervera refuses to come out and fight us  or we block him in with the wreck of the merrimac said walter with a faint smile  oh that will be only a temporary check to give admiral sampson time to get his fleet into shape and give the army authorities time to send on an army of invasion the army is already gathering at tampa replied the surgeon  the medicine was forthcoming and walter was at once given a big dose and told to repeat every two hours it has quinine in it and will make your ears ring and your head buzz but that wont hurt you said the surgeon if you feel worse by tomorrow morning report to me again  this was at eight oclock by noon walter felt as if a buzz saw was in full operation in his head while he could not hear at all but he continued to take the medicine and rested in a hammock slung up in the coolest spot to be found between decks  oh dear he murmured when left alone how my head does spin around if i get very sick whatever will become of me and he buried his face in his jacket sleeve to suppress a groan that was bound to come  by nightfall he was worse if anything and both caleb and si advised him to go into the sick bay for further treatment but he shook his head no i reckon i can stand it till morning he said there may be a turn for the better by that time  midnight found him on deck under the impression that the fresh night air would do him some good to tell the truth he was hardly responsible for what he was doing for his head was in a worse whirl than at any time previous he staggered to the side and leaned over the warship rose and fell on the bosom of the ocean and the water danced and twinkled before his eyes nobody was near him  how it all happened he could never tell afterward he must have leaned over too far or slipped for suddenly he seemed to awake as by a shock and felt himself going down and down into the greenish element which washed up against the brooklyns sides he tried to scream but his mouth filled with water and he could only splutter  when at length he arose to the surface the waves had carried him a hundred feet away from the ship he tried to cry out but he was too weak to utter more than a whisper he threw out his hands and began to swim in a mechanical way but instead of carrying him back whence he had come the mighty waves lifted him closer and closer to shore  ten minutes had passed and walter felt that he could keep up no longer when he came into contact with a large box which had at one time been filled with naval stores but which on being emptied had been thrown overboard from one of the warships the box was over four feet in length and built of heavy slatting and afforded a fair degree of buoyancy lying across the top of the receptacle he floated on wondering in a bewildered way how this strange adventure was going to end  if only i could get to one of our ships he thought if i dont i must either drown or else be cast up on the coast in which case the spaniards will most likely capture me if ioh there is a ship now  walter was right a twomasted vessel was bearing directly down upon him the vessel carried no lights and moved along as silently as a ghost  ill be run down was the boys agonizing thought when on coming within a few hundred feet the craft began to turn in a small circle then when halfway around her engines came to a stop and she drifted idly on the waves  a chain was dangling from the vessels stern it was but three yards away and making a frantic leap walter clutched it and hung fast scarcely had this been accomplished than the steamer moved off again dragging him behind her  in his weak state it is a wonder that walter was not compelled to relinquish his hold but life is sweet to us all and he hung on grimly and setting his teeth began to climb up the chain hand over hand in a few minutes he reached the taffrail fell rather than climbed over and dropped unconscious on the deck  how long he lay in this state walter did not know he came to his senses to find himself being shaken by somebody bending over him  what are you doing here was the rough demand dont you know that all of the regular crew were ordered off at three oclock  iiwhere am i stammered walter sitting up  where are you dont you know  no sir  youre on board of the merrimac  the merrimac echoed the boy and attempted to rise to his feet he was still very weak but otherwise his involuntary bath had done him much good  exactly the merrimac how dare you remain on board against orders  i didnt remain on board ii fell off of my own ship the brooklyn and came near drowning when this vessel came along and i managed to catch hold of a chain that is dragging over the taffrail i climbed up and thenthen i dont remember anything more  humph thats a likely story how did you happen to fall overboard went on the man who was one of the volunteers on this nevertobeforgotten expedition  in a few words walter told him by this time the youth felt stronger and got up on his feet i hope i shant be in the way he said as he concluded  you had better keep out of the way was the grim return come forward and ill report the matter to lieutenant hobson if you have to go in with us the best thing you can do is to strip off your clothing and buckle a life preserver around youjust as the rest of us have done of course if you were on the brooklyn you know what we intend to do and let me tell you weve some mighty hot work ahead of us and throwing him a life preserver the man stalked off leaving walter standing on the forward deck of the collier in the darkness  it was a little after three oclock in the morning and the merrimac was headed northnortheast directly for the harbor entrance from far ahead shone a spanish flashlight located on a hill and by steering for this lieutenant hobson knew the craft would be taken just where he wanted her  walter was but lightly attired and without stripping off any more clothing he placed the life preserver around him under the arms when the merrimac goes down we may not even have the catamaran to fall back on he thought  boom it was the report of one of the spanish guns on shore and a heavy shot whizzed over the bridge of the merrimac where lieutenant hobson and the helmsman were standing and fell into the waves on the starboard side the aim was so close that the wind from the shot carried off the helmsmans cap  other shots soon followed and in the excitement of the moment walters presence on board was forgotten the merrimac was now running at a tremendous rate of speed her fires roaring fiercely and her boilers threatening to burst at any instant quivering from stem to stern under such high pressure she shot into the harbor entrance and straight for the narrowest part of the channel by this time the spanish guns from all sides were sending down on her a shower of shot and shell awful to contemplate seeing he could do nothing walter ran for the shelter of one of the companionways  put the wheel hard aport came the order from the bold commander who if he was excited did not show it lively now  ay ay sir came from the helmsman and the wheel went over and was lashed fast  she isnt coming over came another cry a moment later and while shot and shell were flying in all directions  whats the matter there charette go down and look at the steering gear  at once charette ran off at his best speed he was gone but a moment and came back all out of breath  one of the rudder chains has been shot away sir he reported  shot away came from several thats bad  to this hobson did not answer but instantly ordered the engines stopped and open the seavalves and come up he added there is not a minute to lose now lads if we want to sink her and escape alive  morro castle and the battery opposite had heretofore been firing alone but now came shots from smith cay up the harbor and from a spanish warship which was bearing down upon the scene  we must fire the mines now walter heard somebody say fire them as closely together as possible and then make for the starboard side amidships  this order had scarcely been given when the wires attached to the mines were touched off a sullen roar from beneath the merrimac followed and the vessel was thrown high up in the air while great columns of water spouted up on every side then slowly but surely the collier began to sink     chapter xviii  walters adventure on shore   although the merrimac had been blown up and was sinking the spaniards continued to fire upon her without interruption and as before the air was filled with solid shot bursting shells and the whistling of leaden messengers from rapidfiring rifles  the order to gather at the starboard was a wise one for this spot was the best protected on the deck as the port side was settling rapidly to take to a small boat or the catamaran would have been the height of foolishness for a strong searchlight was being thrown on the scene and the men would have been picked off by the spanish gunners at will  with the others walter rushed to starboard and found a hidingplace close to the rail i wonder what will happen next he muttered he was certain that something would take place very soon for the waves of the harbor channel were already rolling over a portion of the merrimacs deck  a few anxious minutes passed when suddenly the doomed collier gave a heavy list to starboard and walter found himself sliding along the rail and unable to stop himself  hold on shouted somebody who is that  still weak and with the flying spray drenching his face walter could not answer and in a second more the questioner had disappeared amid the gloom smoke and flying water again came a lurch of the collier and walter was hurled flat and sent spinning against the smokestack as he arose he saw lieutenant hobson and his men climbing over the starboard rail realizing even in his bewildered state of mind that he could not do better than to follow them he too made for the rail going over at one point as the courageous commander of the expedition went over at another the crew were swimming for the catamaran which had been shoved off from the merrimacs side and walter came after them hardly had the catamaran been gained than with a final lurch and quiver the merrimac went down partly across the narrow channel but not exactly in the position in which she would have been placed had not the rudder chain been shot away  illustration with a final lurch the merrimac went down  as the craft sank a yell came from the spanish battery nearest at hand the gunners thinking they had sunk an american manowar and not dreaming that the sinking had been done by those on board and purposely but none of the americans paid any attention to these cries all thinking only of escape now the work of the night was over  a steam launch under the command of ensign joseph powell had been moving up and down the harbor waiting for a chance to pick hobson and his men up but a spanish picket boat lay between those on the catamaran and the launch so escape in this direction was now cut off  the float was still attached by a long rope to the wreck of the merrimac and the men were now ordered to remain where they were clinging to the catamaran with only their heads showing above water if you try to swim away the spanish sharpshooters will pick you off as quick as a wink was the word passed around  thus cautioned all the brave crew remained where they were until daylight began to show itself then a large launch steamed up carrying several oarsmen half a dozen sharpshooters and admiral cervera himself  do you surrender came in spanish while every sailor on the catamaran was carefully covered  we surrender as prisoners of war was lieutenant hobsons reply and then he and his men were ordered to swim to the launch one at a time and give up their arms if they had any this was done and the steam launch returned to the reina mercedes one of the spanish warships later on hobson and his men were sent ashore under a strong guard marched up a hill to morro castle and turned over to general toral the military governor of santiago province  when he made the leap for the catamaran walter was not as fortunate as those around him he entered the water close to the merrimac and when the great collier sank the suction drew him under and he went so far down that he fancied he would never come up his breath was gone a gulp partly filled him with water and when at last the surface of the bay was again reached he came up more dead than alive  he set out to swim instinctively the life preserver holding him up although it had not been light enough to counteract the suction of the sinking ship where he was going he did not know for the glare of the searchlight and the splashing of shots on the water was perfectly bewildering im lost he thought a dozen times o god help me to get out alive and that prayer was answered for presently his foot touched bottom and he saw land aheada bit of sandy beach between morro castle and a battery located on estrella cove for the tide was coming in and had carried him up the harbor instead of down  as walter waded out of the water he heard several pickets shouting to each other in spanish without waiting for them to come nearer he dove out of sight in some bushes back of the beach and then started to walk to a woods still further inland  so far the intense excitement had kept him up but now came the reaction and he felt as sick as he had while on the brooklyn his head began to spin and strange lights flashed before his eyes while chills crept up and down his backbone i reckon im in for a spell of sickness whether i escape or not he groaned and reaching the woods threw himself down under a mahogany tree to rest  walter thought he could not sleep but presently the pain became less and he sank into a troubled slumber he roused up to find a tall finelooking negro shaking him as soon as he opened his eyes the negro began to question him in spanish  i cant understand you said the youth and shook his head  americano mistair questioned the negro and walter nodded you come from big fight maybe he went on brokenly  what fight do you mean  fight down by morro last night spanish sink your ship maybe not so and the negro laughed  our men did the sinking but who are you a spaniard  no me cuban carlos dunetta  my name is walter russell but i suppose it might be smith for all the difference it makes to you replied walter moodily what do you intend to do turn me over to the spanish authorities  to de spanish no no carlos dunetta leaned forward cuba libre member de maine not so and he smiled broadly  now you are talking ejaculated walter joyfully you are an insurgent i suppose do you belong to general garcias troops  again the negro leaned forward carlos dunetta spy for de general he whispered come want to get away must hurry and he took hold of walters arm  their course was directly into the woods under broad mahogany and grenadillo trees and over rough rocks overgrown with rank vines insects and bugs were numerous and spiderwebs hung everywhere  udder men all caught and taken to prison said the cuban as they progressed i hear dat from udder spy  well im not out of the woods yet said walter seriously  woods safe place in daytime answered the negro not catching his true meaning  they had progressed less than half a mile when walter began to lag behind i cant go any farther he declared ive been sick and im about used up  sick what is de mattair  i dont knowunless it is malarial fever  at the word fever carlos dunetta drew down the corners of his broad mouth fever dat is werry badamericano canno stand dat maybe i best carry you to josefinas hut josefina she my sistair she take care of you if so you be sick  the tall negro took walter upon his back with ease and continued on his way presently they reached a trail and passing along this for the distance of a hundred yards came within sight of a long low hut thatched with palm  the negro gave a peculiar whistle and immediately a short fat negro wench put in an appearance followed by a man of twentyfive or thirty the man was fairly well dressed and evidently a cuban of spanish descent  it is all right carlos cried the wench this is seÃ±or ramona  seÃ±or ramona exclaimed the negro and rushing up he dropped walter and took the outstretched hand of the cuban gentleman a long talk in spanish followed of which walter understood hardly a word yet he felt certain the pair were talking about the american warships outside of the harbor the blowing up of the merrimac and about himself suddenly the negro ran back to him at the same time calling the wench  you sicki forget he said come nice bed here and he pointed to a grass hammock suspended from one of the rear corner posts of the hut to a nearby tree you lay dare josefina make good drink for you den you feel bettair  walter was glad enough to accept the invitation for standing unaided was now out of the question as soon as he was in the hammock the negro woman ran off for a wet bandage which she tied tightly over his forehead  carlos dunetta evidently had an important message for seÃ±or ramona for no sooner was the talk between the pair at an end than the cuban brought out a horse from the shelter of the trees and dashed down the trail at a breakneck speed  me watch warn you if any spaniards come said carlos on returning to walters side you bettair rest or get fever werry bad  do you suppose there is any hope of my getting back to my ship  de ship dat blow up  no a big warship out there and walter waved his hand in the direction of the coast  at this the tall negro shrugged his shoulders carlos can take you to de shorebut no got boat maybe you swim not so  well hardly answered walter i may be a pretty good swimmer but four or five miles is too much for any man  the negro retired and walter lay back watching the woman who had brought out several bags filled with herbs selecting some of the herbs the woman steeped them in water and poured the tea into an earthen bowl sweetening the concoction with sugarcane ends bringing the bowl to walter she motioned for him to drink  the youth had expected an unsavory mess but he found the tea very pleasant to the taste and ten minutes after he had taken half the contents of the bowl he was in a sound slumber from which he did not awaken until nearly nightfall in the meantime josefina removed the life preserver and made him otherwise as comfortable as possible proud to think she was serving un americano who was battling against the enemies of her beloved cuba  you had bettair come into de house nownight air werry bad for you announced carlos as walter sat up in the hammock and stared around him how feel now weak  ii dreamed i was back on the brooklyn and sailing for home was the hesitating reply my head feels better but im afraid my legs have gone back on me walter went on as on trying to stand he found he must support himself against the tree this is the queerest spell of sickness i ever had  never mindif only so be dat de fever is broken said carlos seriously come and he about carried walter into the hut usually negro huts in cuba are dirty and full of vermin but this was an exception in her younger days josefina had worked for a titled lady of santiago and there had learned cleanliness quite unusual to those of her standing in a corner of the hut was a pile of fresh sugarcane husks covered with a brown spread and to this she motioned walter and here he rested until the following morning     chapter xix  carlos the rebel spy   well im not out of my troubles yet but i suppose im better off than those fellows who were captured and taken off to some spanish dungeon  it was walter who mused thus as he sat up and rubbed his eyes the herb tea josefina had made for him had touched the spot and he felt quite like himself again the native cubans have to fight fevers constantly and consequently know a great deal about proper remedies  will you eat questioned carlos who sat by smoking a cigarette while josefina busied herself in preparing a morning meal of ricecakes and strong coffee  i havent much appetite but i suppose i ought to eat if i want to get back my strength but see here walter went on i cant pay you a cent for what you are doing for me for i have no money with me  dats all right josefina and me no want paywe glad to do for you answered carlos and josefina smiled so broadly that her eyes were fairly closed  the ricecakes were well done and walter ate several of them and also sipped at the heavy black coffee sweetened with sugarcane drippings the meal over carlos leaped up and lit a fresh cigarette  you stay here and i go to shoresee if you can get to ship he said if spaniards come josefina show you where to hide so no can find you  ill have to stay for i cant walk the distance to the shoreyet by the way where am i  dis place back of estrella bout halfway to aguadores on the guama river can see warships from mouth of guama  yes ive heard of the guama some of the fellows on board ship said we might capture that point or guantanamo bay so as to have a place to coal when the ocean was rough you are going to the shore  if spanish pickets let me grinned carlos werry strong spanish guard around here now werry much afraid american soldiers come  perhaps they will come if sampson needs help replied walter but without knowing that the army of invasion at tampa was already preparing to leave for cuba and his own brother ben with it  after carlos was gone walter tried to carry on a conversation with josefina but as the wenchs english vocabulary was as limited as was the boys knowledge of spanish the talk soon lagged cuba libre member de maine she said over and over again and smiled that awful smile that almost caused walter to burst into a fit of laughter during the morning she made him some more tea and insisted upon his drinking it greatly to the benefit of his health and strength as he soon realized  it was growing late in the afternoon and walter was wondering when carlos would get back when the sound of a rifleshot from a distance startled him before he could get to the doorway of the hut josefina was outside and speeding up the trail in the direction her brother had taken  get back it was the voice of carlos and he was running beside his sister who kept up with him despite her weight the spaniards are coming  soldiers gasped walter  yes ten or fifteen they caught me going through de pickets but i knocked one so and anodder so and got away come wid me before da catch you and he took hold of walters arm and turned him to the back of the hut  wondering what would happen next but remembering what had been said about a hidingplace the youth followed carlos to the rear wall of the structure here directly against the logs grew a tall ebony tree  dat tree hollow explained the cuban climb to limb and drop inside josefina haul us out when spanish go way and he gave walter a lift up  the lower branches were but twelve feet from the ground and were easily gained carlos came up also let me drop first he said den you come on top of me be quick or too late and down he went into darkness and walter came after  the hollow portion of the tree was not over twenty inches in diameter and it was a lucky thing for both inside that neither was stout nor broad of shoulder as it was they stood breast to breast with difficulty and yet not daring to make a sound  a shout came from the trail sounding in strange contrast to the song josefina had begun to singan oldfashioned cuban ditty about a sailor and his lass soon the soldiers drew closer and several came around to the side of the hut  ho within there came in spanish where is that wretch we are after  wretch answered josefina in pretended surprise whom do you mean kind sirs  you know well enoughthe tall fellow who knocked over our guards and ran in this direction  i have seen nobody i have been busy washing answered josefina pointing to a few articles of wearing apparel which lay soaking in a waterbutt  you cannot humbug us cried the leader of the spanish detachment in a fury tell me where they are or ill run you through and he ran at josefina with pointed sword it is doubtful if he intended to carry out his threat but the wench thought him in earnest and the yell she gave would have done credit to a cannibal of the south sea islands  the cry of terror from his sister was more than carlos dunetta could stand and in a twinkle he placed his hands on walters shoulders shoved himself upward and showed himself at the top of the opening  let my sister alone you dogs he burst out let her alone and leaping to the ground he made after the spaniard with a drawn machete a long knife used in the sugarcane fields and employed by the insurgents as a favorite weapon  there was a cry of alarm and then came two shots in quick succession followed by a fall close to the foot of the tree  you have killed my brother shrieked josefina oh carlos carlos what shall i do now  back with you you goodfornothing woman came from the leader of the spanish detachment i thought we were on the right trail we ought to shoot you for lying to us  at that moment came a deep groan of pain showing that carlos was not yet dead he had been shot in the arm and through the back but the wounds were not dangerous although painful  without paying attention to what more the spaniards had to say josefina busied herself over the body of her brother laying him out on the grass and binding up his wounds with such rags as were handy while she was doing this the spaniards began an excited conversation among themselves of which of course walter understood not a word  your brother had a very convenient hidingplace in the tree suggested the leader of the detachment a greasy leanfaced corporal who rejoiced in the name of pedro ruz had he not shown himself it is doubtful if we should have located him  you are bad men to shoot himi want nothing to do with you was josefinas only response goand leave my brother to me  leave him here burst out pedro ruz no no he goes with us as a prisoner if i am not mistaken he is the spy captain coleo has been after these many days  you cannot take him awaya journey will kill him  he must gowhether it kills him or not he can ride on the back of the horse one of my men is bringing up captain coleo will want to interview him before nightfall and let me tell you if it is discovered that he has been carrying information to the rebels or those yankee pigs out in the waters beyond the bay why so much the worse for him thats all and corporal ruz shrugged his shoulders suggestively  in a moment more the horse was brought forward a beast as lean as its owner since fodder in that territory was becoming a scarce article since carlos could not move himself he was lifted up to the saddle in anything but a gentle fashion josefina began to expostulate but the only attention paid to her was by one of the men who snatched at her arm and hurled her backward  you must learn to mind your betters said the soldier our worthy corporal knows his business  i will search the man to see if he carries any despatches put in corporal ruz ha you rascal let me get at that breast pocket of yours and camara climb up into the tree and look into that hole there may be something worth finding there     chapter xx  in the hands of the enemy   as walter did not understand what was said he was not aware of his peril until the spanish soldier began to climb the tree then he realized the truth and his heart sank within him  its all up with me now he half groaned i wonder what they will do with me after they find me  reaching the top of the opening the soldier paused and shouted something to his companions regarding the darkness of the hole below  light a match and drop it down ordered corporal ruz this rascal carries nothing he went on disappointedly having found carloss pockets empty of anything of value the negro did carry a message but it was on a small patch of thin paper which had been rolled up tightly and concealed in his thick woolly hair  the match was lit and dropped and all ablaze it landed upon walters head he caught it in silence and put it out but the movement was noticed from above  there is some one else in the treea white man cried the soldier come out of that he continued  walter guessed what the command meant and as further concealment would have been useless he attempted to crawl from the hole but this was not so easy and in the end the soldier had to lend a hand and then both leaped to the ground together  un americano ejaculated corporal ruz de donde viene v he added asking walter where he came from  at this the boy shook his head i dont understand you he said  no habla v castellano continued the corporal asking if he did not speak spanish  again walter shook his head  yankee pig murmured the corporal using a term quite common in cuba during the war why does he not learn our beautiful language does he expect we will learn his dirty english  he turned to the soldier who had discovered walter and between them they searched the lads clothing thoroughly and even took off his shoes and stockings  nothing growled the underofficer it is strange  carlos had been almost unconscious but was now recovering we are in serious trouble i am afraid said walter addressing him but carlos pretended not to understand not wishing the spaniards to know that he spoke english for then they would have been more certain than ever that he was a spy  in a few minutes the entire party had left the hut and was making its way along the trail carlos on horseback and the others walking walter between the corporal and a spanish private and josefina bringing up in the rear as if unwilling to leave her brother  the soldiers were eight in number and each was armed with a mauser rifle of recent pattern they were a hungrylooking set and their uniforms were sadly in need of repair six were of middle age but the other two were no older than walter for conscription into the spanish army begins at as early an age as it does in the navysome of the soldiers and sailors being scarcely fifteen to sixteen years old  the course of the party was upward over rocks and trailing vines and through a woods where hardly a breath of air was stirring the heat soon made walters head ache again and he was glad enough when a small spanish camp was gained and he was allowed to sit down in the shade of a plantain and rest  the encampment was in the open the only shelter being that provided for the officer in charge captain coleoa bit of dilapidated canvas stretched between four trees fifteen or twenty feet apart under this shelter were located a couple of hammocks a small folding table for writing and a camp chair  walter found captain coleo a thorough gentleman despite his surroundings he was well educated and spoke english fluently with a soft accent which under other circumstances would have been quite pleasing  so you are an american youth he said after he had listened to his corporals report and examined carlos and where did you come from and what are you doing here  feeling there would be no use in concealing the truth walter told his story at the mentioning of the merrimac the spanish captains brow grew dark  it was a brave deed but it will do your countrymen small good he said the boat is not directly across the channel so the harbor pilots have discovered all of your comrades are now prisoners in morro castle and i presume that is where i shall have to send you  as a prisoner of war  as a prisoner of war and you can be thankful that in trying to escape you were not shot down continued captain coleo  walter was very thirsty and said so you look as if you were getting ready to have the fever was the captains comment and he had a soldier bring walter a tin cup full of guarapo water sweetened with sugarcane ends and said to be healthier than the plain article good water in cuba is scarce and although walter did not know it it was only the captains natural goodheartedness that obtained for him what he wanted  it had threatened rain for some hours and as nightfall came on the first drops of a violent tropical storm descended soon from a distance came the rumble of thunder and spasmodic flashes of lightning lit up the woods the soldiers huddled under the shelter of a clump of low trees while captain coleo sought the protection of the canvas accompanied by walter carlos and a guard walters hands had been bound behind him and he was allowed to sit on a small block of wood beside one of the hammocks in which the wounded negro reclined  we will not move to santiago tonight said the spanish captain i think the storm will clear away by morning  he was busy making out a report and sat at his little table for the purpose a spluttering mambi taper fastened to a stick driven into the soil being his only light the taper went out half a dozen times but there was nothing to do but to light it again and this captain coleo did without the least show of impatience to him war was a business and he was satisfied to take matters just as they came  the guard trudged around and around the patch covered by the canvas his rifle on his shoulder and the neverfailing spanish cigarette in his mouth occasionally he glanced toward walter and the negro but his interest in the prisoners soon gave way to his own discomforts and he gave them no more attention  presently walter felt a hand steal over his shoulder what you thinkwe run for it maybe whispered carlos  id like to run but we may get shot whispered walter in return  at this carlos shrugged his shoulders with two mauser bullets in him the tall negro rebel was still game it was such men as he who had kept this unequal warfare in cuba going for three long years despite spains utmost endeavors to end the conflict  raise up a bit and i untie rope he said as the guard made another round and walked from them maybe we can go when big thunder and lightning comenot so  all rightill go you cried walter lowly and in a bit of western slang a fellow cant die but once and i have no desire to be taken to the dungeon of morro castle or to any other spanish lockup  he raised up and in a trice carlos had the cords about his wrists unloosened captain coleo still sat writing but now the taper went out again and he paused to relight it  at that instant came a blinding flash of lightning and a loud peal of thunder which startled the few horses the camp possessed and caused them to prance about madly now cried carlos and with one quick leap he cleared six feet of ground between the hammock and the nearest patch of woods walter also leaped and away they went side by side through the wind rain and darkness  crack crack it was the reports of two mausers and the ping of a bullet from the spanish captains pistol followed walter felt a strange whistling by his ear and putting up his hand found it covered with blood the bullet from the pistol had scratched the side of his head had his aim been an inch closer gentlemanly captain coleo would have killed the youth on the spot  you are hit queried carlos breathing heavily for loss of blood had made him weak  ii reckon its not much panted walter but hurry upthey are coming after us  the boy was right both the captain and the guard were following the pair with all possible speed while three others brought up in the rear the other soldiers remaining behind to manage the horses three of which had broken their tethers and were bounding down the trail at a breakneck speed  could he manage to escape such was the one question which walter asked himself as he stumbled on in the darkness a very few minutes would suffice to answer the allimportant query     chapter xxi  the flight to the seacoast   carlos knew the wood well and now he took hold of walters hand put udder arm up or get hurt maybe he said nasty trees around here and walter found this was true for presently a low and twisted branch caught him and flung him flat on his back had his arm been down he must have been knocked senseless  the spanish captain and the guard came crashing along behind them shouting alto halt at the top of their lungs captain coleo was very much chagrined that they had gotten away so easily and blamed the guard roundly the latter did not dare to answer back and felt he must catch the fleeing prisoners or suffer for it  the course had been straight ahead but now carlos turned to the southward presently they came to a halt at the edge of a mountain torrent the pursuers were still on the track and drawing closer  jump and go ahead i will come after panted carlos who could run no more dont wait he added as he saw walter hesitate  but yourself began walter  never mindgo broke in the negro and walter made the leap over the stream and ran on instantly carlos sought the shelter of a nearby tree and became silent  i do not see them capitan observed the guard as he and captain coleo reached the spot have they crossed do you think  i will see rampo was the answer and the captain hurried on in the direction walter had taken scarcely was he out of sight than with set teeth carlos came forth from the shadow of the tree and crawled up behind rampo as silently as a panther seeking its prey a quick nervous clutch and the negro had the soldiers mauser then came a heavy swing of the butt and with hardly a groan the spanish guard went down with a broken skull cuba libre muttered carlos grimly that for maceo our fallen hero referring to antonio maceo the patriot who had led the rebels in eastern cuba for several years only to be shot down at last in ambush  in the meantime walter ran on not knowing where he was going and hardly caring if only his liberty might be assured to him occasionally a flash of lightning lit up the scene but this only served to make the general darkness more intense soon his foot caught in an exposed treeroot and he went headlong and rolled over and over to the bottom of a hollow filled with rank vegetation foulsmelling moss and brackish water  before he could collect his scattered senses he heard the spanish captain coming up he arose slowly to his feet but struck by a sudden idea remained in the hollow ankledeep in water and screened from view by the vegetation previously mentioned  a flash of lightning revealed the captain and at the same time uncovered the youth for a second both stood spellbound then the spaniard drew his pistol  surrender he shouted and the former mildness in his tone of voice was now missing surrender or ill shoot you where you stand  illustration surrender or ill shoot you where you stand  dont shoot answered walter readily ill come out  where is that cuban rebel  i dont know  you dont know ha dont fool with me ladi am in no humor for it now  well i dont know and that is all there is to it we separated several minutes ago  i do not believe youhe is hiding somewhere in the hollow tell me where or as sure as i stand here i will put a bullet through your head and the pistol was aimed straight at walter  before the youth could remonstrate indeed before he had time to think the crack of a mauser penetrated the damp air a second of silence followed and then to walters amazement captain coleo sank down where he stood a ball through his brain  i hit him what a fine shot the words came from carlos as he emerged into the opening the rifle still in hand that makes number two for de udder rascal is laid low with a broken head seÃ±or we are in luck but let us make de most of our chance  butbutis he dead asked walter in a hoarse whisper to him such a proceeding seemed little less than murder  dead to be sure he is dead but dont let dat worry you see de blood on your left ear where he tried to serve you as i served him come before de udder soldiers arrive and catching walter by the arm carlos hurried him away  and this is war thought the boy oh how cruel how barbarous but carlos is right the captain tried to kill me he drew a long breath im glad i wasnt the one to knock him over  the pair had gone on about a hundred yards further when they came out on a broad highway used principally as an oxteam road here carlos called a halt again to get his breath and take a view of the situation  harka horse come he ejaculated suddenly and slipped a cartridge into the mauser rifle for he had taken the ammunition box from the dead soldier back out of sightah  walter ran to the shelter of a tree but at the same time the negro bounded forward throwing the rifle to the ground it was no horseman approaching only one of the animals that had broken away during the heavy thunder and lightning making a clutch at the beasts bridle carlos held fast and brought the horse to a sudden halt  we in luck he observed as walter came out of hiding mount wid me and well soon be miles away  you get into the saddle and ill ride behind answered walter who saw how weak carlos now was and thus they went on until several miles had been covered presently from a distance the youth heard the booming of the surf  is that from the seacoast he asked and the negro nodded and where are we  we close to de ocean two or three miles east from san juan hill we stop pretty soonwerry much tired and carlos closed his eyes he would have fallen from the horse had not walter held him fast turn to left at first crossroad he muttered and then fainted  poor chap thought the boy he kept up well with two bullets in him i must do what i can for him and he urged the horse on at the same time keeping his eyes open for the side road mentioned soon it came into view and five minutes later he found himself at the entrance to a hut similar to that occupied by josefina who had now disappeared entirely from the scene beyond the hut the road lost itself in a wilderness of small brush  the hoofstrokes of the horse had been observed and soon several men cubans and negroes came from the building carlos cried several they turned to walter what does this mean seÃ±or came in spanish  spaniards answered walter and pointed behind him then he pointed to the gun and to the wounds carlos had received and also showed his own bloody ear and scalp  the dumb language was instantly comprehended and two men carried the unconscious negro into the hut while others took charge of the horse and conducted walter inside the lad found the small abode crowded with insurgents who had come in to escape the drenching rain and the air was heavy with the smoke of cigarettes and the smell of a stew seasoned with garlic which was cooking over a lire in the rear a constant flow of conversation was kept up of which he understood only an occasional word  poor carlos was in a bad way and by morning it was easy to see he could be removed only with difficulty yet he was cheerful or tried to be so and smiled when walter came to him  i have news for you he said in his broken english your warships fight bang bang bang down by the water at aguadores and udder places think ships go up by guantanamo bay maybe if sailors land you have a chance to join themnot so  i just hope some of our boys do land and that right away cried walter cant i get somebody to show me the way to the seacoast  gilberto my brudder show the way but not today maybe tomorrow or next daywhen it is safe  gilberto had just come in a stout negro as short as his brother was long but a rebel fighter to the core he too could speak a little english and said he had been a sailor  sail from santiago to philadelphia twice with ore he said very nice country america me like de people only werry cold in winter no like datmake go dis way and he gave a shiver later on walter learned that the entire district was rich in minerals and that large quantities of these were shipped from santiago and from a nearby town called baiquiri  the day passed slowly and so did the next in the meanwhile the cubans came and went they were a detachment of garcias army the main body of which was located many miles further northward they were watching the seacoast and trying to communicate with the american ships of war which could be seen on fair days lying in the offing they knew that once a landing was effected by the americans uncle sam would speedily supply them with what they so greatly neededclothing guns and ammunition once these were obtained they felt that they could secure their independence they had yet to learn that the trained soldiers of spain could be conquered only by the equally or better trained soldiers of the states  on the morning of the third day and while they could distinctly hear the sounds of heavy firing in the vicinity of morro castle and the estrella battery walter and gilberto started off each on horseback the youth felt once more like himself for the cubans had continued to give him drinks of herbs which had entirely banished the lurking fever in his system before leaving walter heard from the negress josefina she had escaped injury and fled to the northward there to join a great number of women and children the wives and young people of the insurgents  the course lay along a stretch of tableland and then up the side of a small mountain at one point on the mountain top there was a clearing and here a distant view could be obtained of the ocean to the south of the pearl of the antilles as cuba had often been termed  your ships over dare explained gilberto pointing with his long fingers might see dem if we had glass like dis and he shut up one hand and placed it over the other in imitation of a spyglass  do the spaniards guard the coast  to be sure seÃ±or very heaby guard too at aguadores and guantanamo bay  then well have to go slow when we get near the waters edge  we no go to water right away seÃ±orwait till we see de coast clear gilberto find you good hidingplace and bring eating and there you stay till i say comenot so  i suppose that will be best im sure i dont want to be taken prisoner again concluded walter very positively  on they went down the opposite side of the mountain they were now travelling in an easterly direction and before night many miles were covered at last they came to a series of rocks overlooking the ocean but situated at least a quarter of a mile back from the beach proper  here is a good place to hide gilberto know it well said the guide and pointed out a rude cave here americano can stay many days and spaniards not find him you take it easy and i bring food to you and then gilberto hurried off alone  walter was glad to rest for the travelling even on horseback had been very trying he sat down and in half an hour gilberto returned with some bread some jerked beef and a number of other eatables done up in a bit of coffee sacking  dere dat last two tree days said the guide now lay low as americano say and gilberto come back one day or udder i take horses and say buenas noches and with this good night gilberto disappeared down the trail leaving walter to himself strange as it may seem the youth never saw or heard of either gilberto or carlos again     chapter xxii  the landing of the marines at guantanamo   while walter was in the depths of the cuban wilderness trying to escape from the spanish soldiers history so far as it concerned our war with spain was moving forward rapidly  as soon as it was felt that cervera could not escape from santiago bay without running the risk of a fearful battle with admiral sampsons or commodore schleys squadron preparations were made to send an army of invasion forward  for such an army a safe landingplace must be secured and with this in view the american warships began the bombardment of various places along the coast from santiago bay to guantanamo bay twenty odd miles farther eastward  the first of these heavy bombardments took place on the sixth of june and was directed against morro castle the batteries at punta gorda and zocapa and at the village of aguadores already mentioned aguadores is several miles to the eastward of santiago bay to the rear of the rocky promontory upon which morro castle is located and it was felt that if once a footing could be obtained here the actual invasion by the soldiers would become an easy matter the bombardment lasted many hours and the various batteries were much damaged and the spanish warship the reina mercedes was so badly riddled that she was later on sunk in the channel thus blocking the outlet to the bay more completely than ever no damage was done to the american ships  through this bombardment a landing was effected at baiquiri not far from aguadores by a small body of marines who burned up some spanish stores and spiked a number of oldfashioned guns  following this attack came one upon guantanamo and the other settlements clustered around the shores of the bay of that name here the fighting was as fierce as before but before it was over a body of marines from the oregon were landed and later on came six hundred marines from the panther the spaniards stood their ground for only a short while and then fled to the mountains and the american flag was hoisted amid a wild cheering from the troops at hand and those on the warships no sooner had the landingplaces at guantanamo baiquiri and aguadores been secured than the army of invasion under general shafter left key west for these points the particulars of which expedition have already been related in a young volunteer in cuba  walter slept like a rock during the first night in the cave being thoroughly exhausted by his long ride he did not awaken until long after the sun had come up and for the moment could not realize where he was  a scanty breakfast was speedily despatched and he walked out to inspect his surroundings mindful of what gilberto had told him about the enemy he was careful how he exposed himself and at the first sign of anything suspicious he ran to cover  thus the day passed away slowly in vain he tried to make out some of the warships far out at sea to his naked eye they were but specks on that ceaseless tide which glared like molten lead in the fierce rays of the sun  on the following night the youth underwent a curious experience he had just thrown himself down to rest when without warning the cave was filled with a light that was dazzling thinking a fire must have suddenly descended upon him he leaped up when as silently as it had come the light disappeared  now what in the world does that mean he asked himself and started for the cave opening when swish the light came back almost blinding him then he understood it all  its a searchlight from one of our ships he cried half aloud if only they could see me and take me on board he watched for the light to reappear but it never showed itself again being trained upon morro castle and the entrance to santiago harbor  on the third day in the cave walters stock of provisions gave out no one had come near him and the loneliness of his situation was maddening  i cant stand this any longer he mused i must get out if only to hunt for something to eat  fortunately for him gilberto had left him a pistol and several rounds of cartridges to be sure the weapon was an oldfashioned affair but it was better than nothing and soon the youth was out in the woods to the rear of the rocks trying to scare up something to shoot  the woods had been well ransacked by both spaniards and cubans but several hours hunt yielded two birds besides some halfripe plantains and some nuts walter was about to return to the cave to cook the birds when from a distance he heard loud shouting and presently came the rapid discharge of firearms  a battle of some kind is on he thought and ran to where he had discovered an oxcart trail he had scarcely reached the shelter of a clump of bushes when a detachment of cubans closely followed by two companies of spanish cavalrymen rushed past both parties firing as they moved  this is getting hot thought the youth and started to retreat when he heard more soldiers coming from the direction of the cave as there now seemed no help for it he crossed the trail and plunged along a side path leading eastwarda trail running directly to guantanamo  walter felt that the best thing to be done was to put distance between himself and his enemies and he did not stop running until several miles had been covered he had meanwhile crossed one small mountain stream and now he found himself on the bank of another there was no bridge and the watercourse looked rather dangerous to ford  i might as well follow the bank down to the ocean he reasoned but i must have something to eat first and finding a secluded nook he built a tiny fire and broiled his two little birds both of which made hardly a meal then obtaining the purest drink possible from the river he continued his journey  by nightfall walter had covered many miles yet no ocean came to view and now he felt that he must be lost in the wilds of the island as this conclusion forced itself home to him he smiled grimly  lost in cuba and i came down here to help man a gun on the brooklyn he muttered was there ever such a turningaround before i wonder what i had best do next  this was not an easy question to answer it was already dark under the thick trees and to spend the night in such a spot was not pleasant to contemplate  at last he came to a clearing here he was about to settle down under the shelter of a small cliff of rocks when something appeared that caused him to yell with all the strength of his lungs it was a snake five feet long and it advanced rapidly hissing as it came  walter had met snakes before harmless reptiles not half as big as the present one but he did not know but that this reptile might be poisonous and gaining the top of the rocks he blazed away with the pistol not once but several times the last shot hit the snake in the tail and away it darted out of sight and into the river  ugh what a horrible creature he murmured as he stood still watching for the possible reappearance of the reptile i wish i was out of this id give a years wages to be safe on board of the brooklyn once more  the words had just left walters lips when he heard a movement behind him turning swiftly he beheld a spanish soldier gazing at him from a distance of less than fifty feet the soldier had his rifle and now the weapon was aimed at the boys head  alto came the spanish command to halt americano  walters surprise was complete yet he kept his wits about him as the spaniard raised his gun the youth made a quick leap for the shelter of a nearby tree  bang went the mauser and the bullet clipped the tree bark then walter took aim and trembling in spite of himself pulled the trigger of his pistol the enemy was hit in the shoulder and uttered a deep cry of pain  if there are others with him im in for it now thought the boy and took to his heels along the bank of the watercourse from behind came a cry for help and another to arms and in less than a minute a whole company of spaniards were in wild pursuit a dozen shots rang out but walter was not hit and plunged on but he was no match for his pursuers and they gradually drew closer and closer then the youth stumbled and fell and ere he could arise he found himself surrounded     chapter xxiii  in a spanish prison   the spaniards who had taken walter a prisoner were the most villanous the youth had ever beheld they were all short thin and exceedingly yellow as though suffering from tropical complaints and looked more than half starved their clothing was in rags for they had been in the wilds of the island thousands of miles from home for nearly two years and a heartless or povertystricken military department had failed to supply them with what they absolutely needed  none of them could speak english and several talked volubly in spanish at which walter could do nothing but shake his head and shrug his shoulders he was motioned to arise and as he did so his pistol was taken from him and presently his hands were fastened tightly behind his back  the course of the party was along the river to a rude bridge over which walter was marched in doublequick time they emerged upon a narrow highway along which they encountered half a dozen detached spanish companies some moving eastward and others in the opposite direction im in for it now thought the youth escaping from this crowd will be out of the question  night was well advanced when they turned into a small settlement fronting guantanamo bay here were half a dozen log houses thatched with palm while not far off was the office of a mineral company now deserted by the proprietors for business in this section of cuba had long since come to a standstill  without ceremony walter was taken to one of the log huts and thrust inside the place was scarcely twenty feet square and was crowded with fifteen or sixteen insurgents whites and negroes who huddled on the floor making themselves as comfortable as possible in their miserable surroundings on the outside of the hut eight spanish soldiers stood on guard with rifles ready to shoot down the first prisoner that attempted to escape  un americano exclaimed one of the prisoners a bright looking cuban as he edged his way to walters side you are in a sorry plight boy  what a vilesmelling place murmured walter how long have you been here  two days and nights with only some stale bread and soup to eatand the soup was made of mouldy meat oh that we were free  silencio roared one of the guards and poked his rifle end into the doorway i will shoot the first prisoner who dares to speak again he added in spanish  walter wished to question him but did not dare and so remained silent it was past midnight and presently most of the prisoners went to sleep huddled in a corner the lad gave himself up to his dismal reflections  daybreak found the spanish soldiers very active and catching a glimpse of them through the open doorway walter felt that some important movement was contemplated as a matter of fact the marines from the panther had landed and the spaniards were going to do their best to either capture them or drive them back to our warships  before noon the firing in the distance was heavy and the spaniards could be seen rushing their commands hither and thither as though hardly knowing how to conduct the campaign which had been thrust upon them evidently they realized that landing force was too large for them for they gradually fell back occupying that night the settlement where the prison was located  on the day following the attack upon both sides was renewed the rattle of musketry was almost constant and before long several bullets hit the prison itself the prisoners were about to remonstrate at this when on looking out they discovered that their late guards had fled leaving them to do as they pleased  cuba libre yelled the insurgents and lost no time in piling into the open air not far away lay several dead spaniards and rushing up to the corpses they stripped them of their arms after which they disappeared into the brush  i wonder if the army of invasion has come was walters thought as he too sought the open air a short sword lay beside a writingtable under a nearby shelter and he appropriated the weapon im going to join our men or know the reason why and away he went toward the water which could now be seen quite plainly between the rocks and hills  the marines after fighting from early afternoon until the following morning were now intrenched on a small hill protected in front by a dense chaparral they were utterly worn out and it was found necessary to reÃ«nforce them by men from the marblehead and other vessels several fieldguns had been brought ashore and although the firing from the spaniards was heavy our gallant men held the ground they had first claimed  halt who comes there came the command from a thicket and walter stopped short although the words spoken in true english filled him with joy  are you an american questioned the youth eagerly  i am and who are you  walter russell cruiser brooklyn oh but am i not glad to get back among the boys again  from the brooklyn what are you doing ashore here questioned the marine a bronzed but evidently a goodnatured man of middle age  its a long story ive been a prisoner twice and i was afraid i was about done for when the guards up and ran away from the prison and let me and a crowd of cubans escape how can i get back to my ship  youre asking me too much now go down yonder and report to our commander i reckon there aint no call to rouse up the corporal of the guard with everybody utterly worn out youre true bluei can see that by the cut of your jib  inside of five minutes more walter found himself surrounded by half a dozen officers including a major of marines who questioned him closely regarding his adventures and concerning the various detachments of spanish soldiers that he had encountered  youve been through a good deal lad said the major slapping walter on the shoulder i dare say you wouldnt like to go through it again  no indeed the spaniards areare brutes exclaimed the youth i only hope we send them from cuba aflying i think they and the cubans must have been fighting for the past three years like a lot of cats and dogs its high time uncle sam took a hand this reply brought forth a hearty laugh from those gathered around walter young as he was had hit the nail right on the head as later events proved  the major of marines did not see how the lad could be transferred to the brooklyn which was a good many miles off in the direction of santiago youll have to remain here until some boat bound for commodore schleys flagship chances along he said at present only the marblehead suwanee and porter are here but others are coming and going constantly  and what of the army of invasion asked walter with keen interest  i believe it has already left key west i know it started from tampa several days ago  was the seventyfirst new york with the troops  they were why do you ask  my brother is a member of that regiment hurrah hell be down here soon concluded walter  he was now dismissed and lost no time in hunting up one of the marines cooks who speedily filled him up with meat bread and butter and coffee were not living like kings you see said the cook but grinning to see how the food disappeared  youre living like kings in comparison to the way the cubans and the spaniards are living if the army comes up and besieges santiago ill wager the city will go hungry in no time returned the boy  during the balance of the day the marines were kept busy resisting several additional attacks from the spaniards the onslaughts were heavy and determined but each time the enemy was beaten back and at nightfall old glory still waved from the flagstaff where it had originally been run up a foothold had been gained by our side which was not to be taken from us  walter had selected a cosy corner to rest in and was sleeping soundly when a sudden alarm rang out the dons they are coming over a thousand strong to arms everybody and then came a grand rush  the report was true the spanish column had organized a midnight attack feeling they knew the ground much better in the dark than would their opponents on they came yelling like demons while the marines stood their ground firmly and fearlessly  i must do my share of fighting thought the boy and bounced up with the rest he had already been supplied with a carbine and ammunition and now he lost no time in attaching himself to the nearest company at hand dont send me back captain i can shoot as well as the rest i think  all right lad come on was the answer company attention by columns of foursforward march and away they went up a small hill then came the order to halt and the company broke up into a broad skirmish line take aim fire and then and there walter did his first actual fighting for uncle sam and our own glorious stars and stripes  the determined front shown by our marines nonplussed the spaniards for a few minutes and they came to a halt but then they advanced again and the fire from each side became hot and irregular  the battle had thus waged for the best part of an hour and the americans felt that they must be beaten back by sheer force of numbers when reÃ«nforcements came up and in addition one of the warships steamed close to shore and threw the rays of her powerful searchlight upon the enemy as soon as the spaniards were located the warship trained its rapidfiring guns inland and then the enemy beat a hasty retreat  hurrah the fight is ours shouted walter enthusiastically see them run  it was lucky for us the warship came up put in a marine beside him those dagos aint going to give ground without a big fight thats certain  it was nearly daylight when the company returned to the camp and was dismissed walter was more worn out than ever but too excited to sleep at present id just as lief be a marine he observed to his side partner in the contest  oh dont worry your ships will have their hands full when cervera takes it into his head to come out and fight was the answer youll have no such walkover as dewey had at manilaill promise you that  at noon a lieutenant of marines came up to where walter stood watching a drill which was in progress are you walter russell of the brooklyn he asked  i am sir and walter saluted  then you had better hurry down to the shore there is a steam launch there and i heard the officer in command say he was bound for the iowa and the brooklyn if you want to get on your ship i presume he will take you along  walter waited to hear no more but ran for the landingplace with all possible speed the boat had come in with despatches and was to leave again inside of ten minutes the officer in charge was close at hand and the youths situation was speedily explained  all right ill take you was the brief answer go aboard and forward and the officer turned away walter did as directed and a few minutes later the steam launch left the landingplace and steamed down guantanamo bay toward the ocean or to be more particular perhaps the caribbean sea     chapter xxiv  back to the brooklyn again   the steam launch was the neatest craft of the kind walter had ever seen and he had come in contact with a great number while sailing on lake erie it was fiftyfive feet long about twelve feet wide and as beautiful a boat as a designer could plan it was manned by eight stalwart men all well drilled to their duties and carried in addition six marines each of whom was a sharpshooter and also a rapidfiring gun of small caliber  the launch rode the waves like a thing of life and easily made ten miles an hour soon guantanamo was left behind and they began to creep up the coast in the direction of baiquiri in the bow was a lookout who had a marine glass which was constantly turned shoreward  a flag said the lookout about noontime and immediately the launch came to a stop  where is it parkhurst asked the officer in charge of the craft  yonder just below that stretch of rocks sir answered the lookout and handed over his glasses the commander of the launch took a long look then ordered the craft turned to starboard and they steamed into a little harbor not a great distance from a tiny cuban settlement a small boat was thrown out the commander and two launch hands leaped in and it at once advanced then those on the larger craft saw a dozen men rush from the shelter of some brush one holding a white and the other a cuban flag  the small boat was beached in true nautical style and the cubans and americans entered into a conversation lasting the best part of half an hour letters were exchanged and then the party broke up as rapidly as it had gathered although walter did not know it the letter delivered by the american commander was for the rebel leader general calixto garcia while that received in return was for admiral sampson and general shafter all related to the landing of the army of invasion now so close at hand  the conference over the launch darted on her way and dinner was served to the officers and sharpshooters first and then to the crew and walter oh were doing some fine work along this coast said one of the crew to the youth while eating those dons will be greatly astonished some daywhen our boys in blue fall on em  it was night before the brooklyn came into view looking exactly as she had when walter had so unceremoniously left her how the youths heart beat at the sight of his ship how would those on board receive him and what would they say when his story was told  russell exclaimed the officer of the deck when he came up over the side why we all thought you had fallen overboard and been drowned  i came pretty near being drowned was the reply you cant imagine sir how glad i am to get back  but where have you been  ive been on the merrimac among the cubans and the spaniards and in a spanish prison besides being down to guantanamo bay with the marines from the panther sir  great scott boy do you expect me to believe all that burst out the officer in sheer astonishment  as you will sir its true though  butbutlet me see you said you were on the merrimac  yes sir  and on shore among the cubans and then among the enemy  yes sir  and then among the marines at guantanamo bay  exactly sir i escaped from a spanish prison and was lucky enough to fall in with the marines by accident i fought with them too sir  russell after you disappeared surgeon barker said you had been sickhad been troubled with some sort of fever in your head dont you believe you went out of your head entirely and imagined all this  no sir  well i reckon thats the truth of the matter and the best thing you can do is to turn yourself over to the surgeon again for further treatment how is your head and the officer of the deck placed his hand on walters forehead ah rather hot as i thought you had better go to bed and he turned away  i dont think ill go to bed just yet murmured walter and lost no time in reaching the berth deck here he came up behind si and caleb playing one of their favorite games of checkers while paul stood looking on  crown that man caleb was saying when he chanced to glance up walter or is it a ghost he fairly yelled and leaped up scattering board and men in all directions walter where on earth did you come from and he reached out his hand  it is walter back from the grave ejaculated si and grasped the other hand while paul caught the youth by the neck  we thought you were drowned said all three simultaneously  they said you had gone out of your mind and committed suicide added paul  well i didnt commit suicide and im as well as ever was the merry return butbuti dont believe youll think im telling the truth when i give you my story  that depends on what sort of a yarn you spin returned caleb dryly where have you beensinking cerveras fleet singlehanded  not quite but ive been pretty close to the fleet and pretty close to the spaniards and dropping on a box walter told his story interrupted every few minutes by some newcomer who advanced to shake him by the hand for since joining them he had made many friends among the jackies and petty officers  i dont wonder the officer of the deck wouldnt believe you lad remarked caleb when he had finished its a big yarn beats jonah and the whale all to piecesnot but what thats a true story seeing as how its in the good book you are certain you wasnt taken down with the fever while you were on shore  not enough to lose my mind  i believe walter put in si but if i were you i wouldnt tell this tale to the others he added in a lower tone theyd be jealous of you you know  i dont care im telling the simple truth answered walter stoutly  that evening word was passed to him to report at the captains cabin and he went just as soon as he could slip on his best suit of clothing wash up and comb his hair for on board of every manowar a visit to headquarters is a big thing to any of the crew and a sprucing up is consequently indispensable  this was the first time walter had visited the cabin of the brooklyn and the elegant surroundings immediately caught his eye but in days gone by before he had been compelled to live with the miserly job dowling he had been used to a home furnished just as handsomely and therefore the surroundings did not overawe him  there was a small table in the centre of the cabin at one end of which sat commodore schley looking over a map of the cuban coast at the other end of the table sat captain cook the firm and strict yet wellbeloved commander of the flagship  you sent for me sir said walter as he came in toed the mark and saluted  you are walter russell asked captain cook while commodore schley dropped the map and looked on with interest  yes sir  you have been absent from the ship ever since june the second or third  yes sir but i couldnt help it i was sick and fell overboardand ive had a whole lot of adventures since  so the officer of the deck tells me answered the captain dryly he looked at the commander of the squadron commodore schley would you like to ask russell any questions  at this the commodore smiled and pulled meditatively at the little goatee he wore russell you can tell us your story in detail but do not take over ten minutes he said and covered his eyes with his hands as if in deep thoughtone of his favorite attitudes  standing as before and still toeing the mark walter told his story again simply but forcefully whether his hearers were listening or not he could not tell for not a word was said until he had finished  then however came a flood of questions concerning the spot at which he had landed after leaving the merrimac the names of the various cuban and spanish leaders that he had encountered and the names of the marines with which he had fought he was also questioned about the trails and their conditions  could loaded wagons get over them in your estimation asked commodore schley  not very well sir in one place i saw an oxteam with a load of fruit and the load was in danger of being dumped every minute some of the paths are not fit for a packmule to use  what of the cubans you met were they well armed  a few of them had guns but most of them had nothing but their machetes sir ammunition i was told was very scarce  what of food  that was scarce too and walter smiled a good eater would starve to death on what both the spaniards and the cubans have to offer  do the spaniards expect an army of invasionthat is did you hear any talk on the subject  i caught a few words sir i cannot speak spanish myself  commodore schley mused for a moment that is all he said addressing captain cook the boy has certainly had some remarkable adventures he is better off than poor lieutenant hobson  thats true responded the commander of the brooklyn he turned to walter you can go russell if we want you again we will send for you  yes sir was the youths reply and saluting he turned and left the cabin the interview had been a very formal one but he was proud to think that he had come into personal contact with his gallant captain and his equally gallant commodore     chapter xxv  the bombardment of the santiago batteries   when walter returned to his friends he was immediately surrounded and asked what had happened in the cabin did the commodore slap you on the back and call you a bully boy queried si  well hardly answered walter with a quiet smile they plied me with questions and said i had had some remarkable adventures thats all  didnt praise you queried caleb  no  didnt rush up and shake hands even put in paul  not at all i saluted and toed the mark and kept toeing it until i left  at this pauls face fell why i thought you would be right in it walter he said  i guess youve been reading some dime and halfdime coloredcover novels paul i imagine that is the way they do in such books  thats it why ive got a story about deweys boy bodyguard the hero in that overheard a plot against dewey and dewey clasped him to his breast and made him a captain of marines  indeed and you believe such a yarn  dewey couldnt make the boy a captain of marines not if he was an admiral twice over put in caleb those yarns are pure trash paul you had better study some good book on gunnery and try to become a gun captain  i thought the story was slightly overdrawn said paul growing red in the face there is another about the boy hero of havana who saves general lees life at the time the americans are getting out of havana i suppose that is untrue too  to be sure paul general lee was in no great danger at that time of course some of the sensational papers had to make the most of it and they reported that he was travelling around with a sixshooter in his pocket and a detective dogging his footsteps as a matter of fact he walked around with nothing but a white cotton umbrella to keep the sun off  ill burn the whole batch of colored stuff up cried the apprentice and he did at the big galley fire no one on board ever caught him reading dime and halfdime novels again  although the marines had established themselves fairly well at and near guantanamo the spaniards were determined to drive them off and to hold this landing and a number of others several of the warships were kept busy bombarding the enemys strongholds and in firing with gatling guns at the spanish soldiers whenever they put into appearance along the coast  the day after walter came on board the brooklyn which remained on the blockade off santiago bay the texas marblehead and suwanee ran into guantanamo bay and attacked the fort at caimanera a small village not far from guantanamo the attack began at two oclock in the afternoon and in less than two hours the fort was in ruins and those who had garrisoned it were fleeing inland for their lives  caimanera was thus taken but to hold it was as difficult as it was to hold guantanamo many of the people were in sympathy with the spanish government and some went so far as to soak the streets and some of the houses with coal oil that the town might be burned down at a minutes notice  while this was going on admiral sampson determined to make another attack on the outer defences of santiago harbor only sparing morro castle in which it was understood that lieutenant hobson and his men were confined it was weary waiting for the transports to arrive with the army and something must be done to tear down the numerous fortifications the spaniards were constructing  the orders for the bombardment were issued on wednesday evening and at once a subdued but excited talk took place among the various crews of the blockading squadrons which now numbered the following ships along with a few others of lesser importance  first squadron under the direct command of admiral sampson the flagship new york battleships iowa and oregon protected cruiser new orleans gunboat mayflower torpedo boat porter and the sprightly scorpion the second squadron under commodore schley embraced the flagship brooklyn battleships massachusetts and texas and the marblehead and vixen other vessels such as the indiana dolphin and suwanee were kept busy plying between the blockading fleet and guantanamo bay and surroundings  it was halfpast three in the morning when the men were called up and served with coffee among the first on hand was walter now for a first real use of our gun he said to si ive been aching for this ever since i enlisted  before four oclock came the call to quarters and the men ran to their various stations and stripped for action most of them wearing little more than an undershirt and a pair of trousers the weather was frightfully hot and the interior of the cruiser was little better than a bakeoven possibly this was one reason why the thoughtful admiral planned the attack for so early in the day  silently the warships steamed for the mouth of the harbor and took up their various positions in a grand semicircle the heavy fighting ships in the centre and the torpedo boats on the ends ready to take care of any infantry fire should the spaniards hurry their soldiers to the shore the big ships kept at a distance of three thousand yardsnot quite two miles  were a long way off observed walter as he assisted in loading the polly as caleb had named his gun  twentynine hundred yards came the report from the rangefinder and the crew went to work to elevate the gun accordingly in the meantime the magazines had been opened the ammunition hoists set in motion and powder shot and shell were delivered everywhere from barbette to fightingtop  were near enough to blow em skyhigh if we strike em right muttered the old gunner who with the smell of powder in the air was in his element how about that hose stuben he went on to the hoseman  dot hose its all right alretty answered carl stuben a roundfaced german who was an american citizen even though he did speak the language but brokenly heretofore walter had had but little to do with the man yet they got along very well together  it was too dark to begin firing and for half an hour the ships lay quiet every man ready to obey a command the instant it was given this was a nervetrying test for walter who wondered how the thing would sound when all of the ships began firing  slowly it grew lighter and the men became more anxious the guns were trained on the shore batteries to the west of the harbor entrance while other ships covered the batteries on the east  boom it was a broadside from the new york directed against the battery below el morro instantly every other warship present responded in a deafening crash and a shock to be heard many miles away at once the air became filled with the smoke and on shore the dirt and masonry of the batteries were seen to fly in all directions  oh my gasped walter as the gun before him belched forth its mass of flame and smoke what a noise diddid we hit anything  i hope we did answered steve colton the second gun captain laconically and then came the order to unlock the breech of the gun as the breech fell back a cloud of smoke swirled into the sponson hood impregnated with the odor of saltpetre which caused walter and several of the others to cough violently never mind youll get used to it before you die went on colton  the gun being opened carl stuben caught up his hosepipe turned on the nozzle and sent a stream of cold water through the gun to both clean and cool the interior by the time this was accomplished the hoist had another shell ready and this was shoved in by the mechanical rammer brown prismatic powder followed with a small quantity of black prismatic powder behind it as a primer then the breechblock was swung into position and locked again and the electrical connections were adjusted  all this had been done almost in the time it takes to tell it but the next shot was not discharged at once since the various gunners had strict orders to take their time and make every discharge count it was not like a pitched battle where every moment counted  but though the gunners took their time there were so many ships and so many guns that the firing was continuousa spiteful cracking of rapidfiring guns mingled with the thunderclaps of the gigantic thirteeninch guns and the solid banging of the eightinch and eight and ten pounders  this is war and no mistake remarked walter in ten minutes his undershirt had become as black as a stovecloth and he himself looked almost like a negro in the meantime the perspiration was streaming from every pore of his body  war shouted caleb why lad this is nothing if only cervera would come out then you would see some fun  the order had been passed to lessen the charges in the big guns and elevate them more in order to secure a plunging fire the effect of this change in tactics was soon apparent as shot and shell began to drop directly into the spanish strongholds or behind them soon one of the batteries was completely silenced and a cheer went up from the warship nearest to it  it must not be imagined that the spaniards took this attack quietly no sooner had the american warships opened than they returned the fire with equal fierceness but although at an elevation and using guns which were stationary their aim was wild and only a few of their shots took effect  as one battery after another was silenced several of the warships elevated their guns still more and put in large charges of powder and as a result one shell was carried far up the harbor to where the vizcaya lay and burst directly over her deck doing considerable damage and injuring several sailors and an underofficer  presently a terrific explosion rent the air one of the shots from the texas had landed in a powder magazine and sent it skyward the spectacle thus caused was magnificent and for a moment all in the squadrons watched the timbers rocks and dirt as they sailed through the air some coming down inland and some falling with loud splashes into the sea  thats a shot worth making cried caleb hurrah for the man as trained that gun  and the cheer was given with a will     chapter xxvi  in which the army of invasion arrives   maybe i aint hot and tired walter i could sleep standing up and go in an icehouse and do it  it was si who spoke as he was washing himself in a bucket of water set on the guntrack the water had been fresh when si began his ablutions and was now dirty but the yankee youth was still far from clean for gun smoke and gun dirt have a disagreeable knack of getting into the pores of ones skin  the bombardment had lasted over an hour and every land battery had been silenced yet as the american ships drew away one or two guns spat out spitefully after them  youll feel all right in an hour or two si answered walter oh but wasnt it glorious i could stand such bombarding for a week what a sight it was when that powder magazine went up  such a bombardment costs uncle sam a good many thousand dollars put in caleb leaving the gun to get a drink of water from the tub standing by a week of it would put a big hole in his pocket large as it is  i presume that is so walton but say why dont we run in and finish things now we have knocked the batteries out  better ask the admiral lad hes the one who knows remember we didnt touch morro castle nor that fortification on smith cayand those spanish warships are somewhere around the bend out of sight i reckon the time aint quite ripe for running in yet if we run in now and do up that spanish fleet we havent men enough to take santiago itself we must wait until shafter arrives with his army  but why did we go at them at all for then  to keep em from becoming too well fortified now theyll have their hands full for several days repairing damages and in the meantime our army may arriveat least i hope it does  si had been right about the heat even in the united states we had a spell of uncommonly hot weather and down here under the tropical sun it was sizzling as walter expressed it during the noon hour no one thought of going on deck unless it was absolutely necessary refreshments of any kind were at a premium and when a society known as the colonial dames sent on a number of boxes of oranges and lemons for distribution the jackies could hardly contain themselves for joy cuban sugar was easily obtained and lemonade and orangeade became the order of the hour  having been away on shore walter had not felt the monotony on shipboard so much but those who had been on the blockade for nearly three weeks felt fearfully bored especially as reading matter was scarce every scrap of a newspaper was saved and passed around and poor paul was collared and tossed up in a canvas hammock for having burnt the pennydreadfuls previously mentioned  mail mail mail such was the welcome cry which rang through the brooklyn several days after the bombardment just described the news caused a commotion and all who could rushed on deck and peered eagerly over the side as several heavy mail sacks were hoisted on board hardly anybody could wait for the mail to be distributed  three letters for me and a bundle of newspapers cried walter joyfully heres luck and no mistake he studied the various postmarks for a moment one from boston in my uncles handwriting one from tampa florida and thats from ben and one fromyeshong kong china and that must be from dear old larry now which shall i read first oh i must hear from larry first and dropping on deck he tore open the letter from the other side of the world and perused it eagerly  well i never came from him a few minutes later si walton listen to this my brother larry was with dewey at manila and helped whip the dons oh but larrys the boy after all just read the letter for yourselves and he tossed it over  bens letter came next a rather short communication for ben had never been much of a boy to write       i am high private in the best company of the seventyfirst      regiment of new york he wrote we are down here at lakeland      near tampa getting into condition to invade cuba at present      things are slow and awfully hot but we look for livelier times      ahead and that keeps up our spirits my chum gilbert      pennington has joined theodore roosevelts rough riders i      hope we go to cuba together       i suppose you are quite a jack tar by this time and walk with      a regular swagger larry is now a bigger fellow than either of      us for he was on the olympia deweys flagship at the      battle of manila bay he wrote me all about it and said he      would write to you too so i suppose you already have the      letter       uncle job seems to be coming around to his senseswith giving      both you and me permission to take care of ourselves if i were      you i would not let up on him about going to boston those      heirlooms ought to be located and he is the man who must push      the work even if it does cost a few dollars i want fathers      watch and i am sure you and larry want the wedding rings       i have made many friends while in the army but i also have      two enemies gerald holgait and dwight montgomery and i am      afraid that sooner or later they will try to play me some mean      trick however i will be on my guard against them goodby and      good luck to you  i hope ben does come down mused walter and if he has any enemies of the jim haskett sort he had better look out and then he turned to the communication from job dowling       my dearest nephew began the guardian and the term of      address made walter smile your letter was a big surprise to      me and i aint over it yet that you should meet that thief      gets me and i dont understand it nohow however i packed my      valise my new one that cost me a dollar thirtyfive although      wilson says it is worth the money and the next day i took the      cars for boston on a ticket i got at cut rates although it was      tolerably dear even at that when i got to boston i introduced      myself to mr phil newell the onelegged man you used to work      for and he took me to police headquarters and now i am      stopping here at a boardinghouse on hammond street the police      sent a detective to me and he is going to find them heirlooms      and that rascal of a deck mumpers or whatever his name is or      know the reason why if he finds the things im to give him      two hundred dollars in cash if he dont i pay his travelling      expenses and no more i wouldnt make such a bargain but i      know all you boys want the things back and i cant do the      running after the thief its a waste of money but it cant be      helped i want to show you and ben and larry that your uncle      means well in spite of what you think of him       newell says for me to tell you he will send you a bundle of      newspapers he says he knows how lonely life on board of a      manofwar gets sometimes i hope you dont get hurt if you      get into a fight down in cuba keep out of the sun and write      when you can care of newells newsstandfor i stop there      every day after the detectives report the detective hopes to      get the things back before this week is out       your loving uncle       job dowling  the letter was a mere scrawl horribly misspelled and it took walter fully quarter of an hour to decipher it well uncle job is turning over a new leaf he thought as he put it away i only hope that detective is all right and dont hoodwink him into paying over his money for nothing i reckon the letters ben and i wrote him scared him pretty well otherwise he wouldnt agree to pay two hundred dollars if the heirlooms are recovered  caleb had read larrys letter with much interest one portion of it relating to the narrow escape from disaster during the battle interested him not a little  your brother had a close shave he said to fire a gun when the breech is unlocked is a fearful thing  i dont see how it could happen on board of such a ship as the brooklyn answered walter everything works like clockwork here  you dont know how a thing would work in the middle of a battle lad men get excited and sometimes the jarring of the shots breaks the electric connections more than likely that gunner was firing his piece by hand at the time ive done the same when the electric connection gave out last month i heard from a friend of mine a gunner on the new orleans that used to be a brazilian warship they couldnt get their electricfiring apparatus into shape nohow and had to do everything by handand that is the time accidents occur but somebody ought to have been watching that breechblockyour brother or somebody else and then caleb turned away to his duties  larry had written that he was now in hong kong and did not know whether he would go back to deweys squadron or return to the united states youll hear from me again soon one way or another he added in a postscript  for a day or two all of walters spare time was spent over the newspapers his former employer had been kind enough to send him but drills and other duties must not be neglected and now that the army of invasion was hourly expected discipline on the warships became more rigid than ever  at last one clear morning a cry echoed and reÃ«choed from one warship to another  the transports are in sight general shafters army has arrived  what a shouting cheering and yelling broke loose jackies flew to the deck and up the military masts and all other points of vantage yes the news was true over thirty transports were coming up from the direction of guantanamo bay having rounded cape maysi some hours previously the army of invasion had really arrived nearly seventeen thousand strong as that vast fleet came up convoyed by fourteen warships it presented a most imposing appearance and guns boomed loudly to welcome it  is the seventyfirst on board was walters question and when at last he heard that it was his heart beat quickly ben must be there he thought and ben was there and thinking of walter at the same time  santiago is doomed now said caleb as he surveyed the scene  thats so put in si tossing up his cap and old cervera must either come out and fight or haul down his colors oh but wont we just smash things when that army is landed  and walter agreed with both of them  as soon as it could be arranged the army was landed at baiquiri siboney and other points guantanamo being reserved as a coaling station for the warships after the first landing a strong detachment of regulars and rough riders was thrown out and then followed the battles of la guasima san juan and el caney described in detail in the previous volume of this series the soldier boys fought bravely and ben russell and his chum gilbert pennington were well to the front as we know  the landing of the troops was no easy matter for the surf ran high and it was feared that the spaniard might make a heavy onslaught at any instant all the small boats of the warships were called into use to land men and army stores and while this work was in progress many of the ships began to bombard various points along the coast for the purpose of confusing the enemy so that they would not realize the truth of what was taking place the ruse succeeded and during the landing the spaniards remained comparatively quiet hardly knowing in what direction to turn or what to do since the americans were covering over a hundred miles of rugged coastline  the debarkation at an end the brooklyn returned to her position on the blockade all hands knew that something important would soon happen and consequently everybody slept thenceforth with one eye open cervera must not be allowed to escape night or day under any circumstances was the order passed and it was to be obeyed to the letter     chapter xxvii  the spanish fleet and its commander   now that we are so anxious to catch admiral cervera and smash his ships i should like to know something about the man and his command remarked walter a few days after the army had landed he addressed george ellis who in his quiet gentlemanly way had taken a liking to the youth  the two were seated in the shadow of one of the forward guns taking it easy for the morning drills were over and it yet lacked half an hour to mess time slowly the brooklyn rose and sank on the waves of the caribbean sea four miles outside of santiago bay this was the usual distance in the daytime at night despite the danger of an attack by a torpedo destroyer the warships came in much closer and the glare of the searchlights never left morro castle or the narrow harbor entrance  i know very little about admiral cervera excepting that he has been in the spanish navy for many years and is said to be one of the finest gentlemen that ever trod the deck of a ship why he ever allowed himself to be bottled up like this is more than i can understand i imagine though that he was on his way to havana to break the blockade there when he heard that admiral sampson was coming for him one way and our commodore the other and he concluded that the best thing he could do would be to scoot into the bay yonder and save himself and possibly santiago they say he carried a lot of guns and ammunition for the spanish army he can distribute those as well at santiago as he can at havana for i understand general toral here is as hard up as blanco is at the other city  and what of the ships under him they say he has six do you know how big they are went on walter  he has four warships and two torpedo destroyers answered the chief yeoman i got that straight from lieutenant blue who went ashore for admiral sampson made a detour of seventy miles and from the top of a high hill saw the ships in the harbor through his powerful glasses  somebody said all the big ships were armored cruisers  that is true and three of them the vizcaya the almirante oquendo and the maria teresa are sister ships of seven thousand tons each each is about three hundred and sixty feet long and can speed at eighteen to nineteen knots an hour they carry about five hundred men each and every one has a main battery of two 11inch hontoria and ten 55inch hontoria guns with a secondary battery of eight 6pounders ten 1pounders several machine guns and they also carry six torpedo tubes each  and what of the fourth cruiser  she is the cristobal colon the fastest of the lot even though her displacement is two hundred tons short of the others they say she can run eighteen knots an hour with ease and twenty knots if she is put to it her armor belt is six inches thick alongside of twelve inches on the other cruisers she also carries about five hundred men and she has a main battery of two 10inch and five 6inch guns and a secondary battery of rapidfiring rifles 6 and 10 pounders and two maxim guns her torpedo tubes number four  then they are no small fry to battle with observed walter when their batteries break loose they ought to do some talking  they will talk we mustnt expect any walkover if cervera ever comes out of his hole  and what of the two torpedo boats  they are sister ships the pluton and furor each of three hundred and eighty tons displacement they say that each has a speed of twentyseven knots an hour and both are equipped with the latest appliances for such crafts carrying regular automatic and rapidfire guns and also fourteeninch schwartzkopff torpedo tubes  i should say they would be good things to keep out of the way of exclaimed walter  weve got our eyes wide open for them lad to be sure one or another of them may play us some dirty trick of a dark nightbut that is one of the risks to be taken in war times concluded the chief yeoman as a petty officer called him away  all on board the warships waited eagerly for news from the army of invasion it was known that the rough riders had had a severe skirmish at la guasima but that was all so far as the jackies went possibly the officers knew more but if so they kept the knowledge to themselves  another dull week will come to an end tomorrow remarked si as he and walter were on their way to the mess table oh but im sick of laying around looking at old morro if only those ships would come out wed sink them all in less than two hours i feel sure of it  sis growl was becoming a universal one even the officers grumbling a good deal all wanted to fight cerveras fleet and the more the spanish admiral kept himself hidden the more angry did they become many almost begged to have their ships forced into the harbor no matter what the consequencesthey stating that anything would be better than this everlasting waiting the blockade had now lasted five long weeks  in the meantime matters elsewhere had not been idle chagrined over deweys victory at manila spain resolved to send another fleet to the philippines by way of the suez canal taking for this purpose almost all the warships left in her home waters as soon as this was brought to light our own naval board decided to send an american fleet to the coast of spain and commodore watson was placed in command of the expedition but before the american warships could sail the spanish fleet having gone through the suez canal turned back for home and the american warships remained where they were and dewey was left unmolested at manila so far as spanish operations were concerned although the insurgents under general aguinaldo soon began to give him a great deal of trouble  saturday morning dawned misty but hot from a great distance could be heard the rattle of musketry showing that the army of invasion was slowly but surely advancing  theyre in it all right enough began si when there came a sudden call to quarters and at the same time the brooklyns engines began to move and she headed for santiago bay hullo what does this mean  perhaps we are going to force an entrance ejaculated walter hurrah if we do  better not count your chickens before they are hatched remarked caleb who had just rolled from his hammock  they soon learned the truth of the movement the shore batteries were again to be bombarded and this time not even morro castle was to be spared it having been ascertained that hobson and his men had been removed to safe quarters  down with old morro well show the dons a thing or two was the cry and off rushed the men to their guns their eyes brighter than they had been for many a day for morro castle had been an eyesore to all  the flagship new york was leading the fleet which as before soon ranged up in a semicircle inside of five minutes every vessel had her station  cast loose and provide  the now familiar cry was scarcely needed for the jackies were already at work stripped as before of all their superfluous clothing shot and powder were quickly handled and the flagship began the firing which immediately broke forth in all its fury deafening everybody and sending forth a great cloud of smoke which hung over the warships like a pall  morros flag is down came the shout it was true a gunner on the noble oregon had taken careful aim and cut the flagstaff in two the falling of the spanish emblem was greeted with a wild cheer at once the spaniards tried to put another flag up but it was some time ere they succeeded and then it was a tiny affair hardly visible excepting with a glass  well try for that battery yonder exclaimed caleb during the height of the bombardment i think those fellows have been firing this way ever since they started  he had scarcely spoken when bang something hit the armor plate directly under their gun hurling the gunner walter and several others back by the shock  theyve struck us but the shot didnt pierce our armor remarked caleb calmly as he got up all right you villains heres the compliment returned and he made his preparations with care  the shot following was the best they had yet placed it struck into a battery on the west shore of the harbor entrance ploughed up the foundation of a sixpound gun and sent the piece flying high into the air  my but that was immense cried walter while si and the others cheered wildly give them another  and they did give the battery another and then a dozen more until at last the place was silenced showing that what was left of the gunners had fled  at halfpast seven came the order to cease firing but it was fully twenty minutes later before the last of the warships guns were discharged by this time not only the batteries but also old morro were filled with gaping holes it is more than likely that if the fleet had sought to enter the harbor at this time it could have done so with comparative ease  the work at the gun had been very hot and as soon as they were able to do so walter and si scurried to the upper deck to get a bit of fresh air  it fairly stews the fat out of a fellow grumbled si running the perspiration from his forehead with his forefinger ill bet im ten pounds lighter than before this blockade began  never mind its one of the fortunes of war began walter when of a sudden a strange whir and a singing sound filled the air it was a shell fired from morro castle just as the brooklyn was turning away  look out yelled si and dropped down but the words were still on his lips when the shell exploded sending the fragments flying in all directions both boys were struck and with a groan walter fell senseless to the deck     chapter xxviii  the enemy is escaping   is he dead surgeon  oh doctor hell livesay hell live  caleb and si had followed the senseless form of walter to the sick bay of the warship the yankee youth with the blood streaming from a deep cut in his left cheek both were in distress for fear their comrade was seriously injured  yes hell live but he has had a narrow escape was the reply of the medical man in charge of the case the bit of shell scraped his left temple as you see had it come a little closer it would have gone through his brain  walter had been placed on a swinging cot and now his head was bound up before this operation was over he opened his eyes  whewhere am i he stammered whwhat hit me  praise god hes himself again murmured caleb reverently i was afraid he was a goner  so was i whispered si and i dont know how i could spare walterhe seems so like a brother  you must lie quiet for a while said the surgeon youll be all right by tonight and then he gave walter some medicine to brace his nerves for they had been sadly shattered by the shock the remainder of that saturday was spent in bed  on this memorable day the fighting on land had been even more fierce than on the sea the army of invasion had taken the various outposts of santiago and the very city itself now lay at general shafters mercy it was felt that a day or two longer would bring matters to a climax  when walter joined his comrades after supper he looked rather pale and scared almost silently he took sis hand and wrung it  you are all right he whispered  no hurt to speak of was the answer  but we were pretty close to death oh si i never realized before how quick one could be put out of this world  neither did i walter after this im going towellim going to attend church more regularly thats all i never did take much to sech matters afore like you do  its always well to be prepared for death siim going to try to be prepared after this was walters low answer and in the darkness of the berth deck they clasped hands again they understood each other pretty well these boys  on sunday morning the sun arose clear and strong and early in the day an awning was spread over the quarterdeck of the flagship brooklyn and preparations were made to pass a hot day as comfortably as possible we will rest today was the word passed around and the jackies were not sorry for the bombardment on saturday morning had tired them out  the brooklyn rested about three miles out from santiago bay and not far off lay the texas between the two ships the long green waves rose and fell only making a soft slishslish as they struck the vessels sides the jackies lolled here there and everywhere some talking some reading old newspapers which from frequent handling would scarcely hold together while a few studied the bibles they had brought with them  presently from the texas came the musical buglecall for church service id like to go on board of her once said walter to si as they listened to the bell that followed shes certainly a finelooking craft  three bells put in caleb as he came up come on lads first sunday in the month remember and the articles of war have got to be hearkened to  thats so i had forgotten answered walter and he and the others dropped below to don their cleanest and neatest rigs for general muster soon the call came and from all parts of the big cruiser the men hurried to their various divisions while the higher officers buckled on their swords and the executive officers prepared to make their inspections  on the quarterdeck near the hatchway sat commodore schley musing thoughtfully as he gazed over the waters in the direction of morro castle the fighting commodore undoubtedly felt as hot as anybody for he wore a thin black alpaca coat and an equally thin white summer hat he was now in sole command of the blockading fleet for the new york had carried admiral sampson many miles away to confer with general shafter  for some time there had been smoke in the harbor entrance in front of the warships and many were wondering what it meant must be a supply boat for the batteries said several underofficers and this theory was accepted as correct nevertheless commodore schley glanced toward that smoke more than once  we are going to have general muster commodore announced captain cook as he presented himself followed by executive officer mason and the commander of the fleet pro tem nodded but those keen eyes were still bent shoreward  suddenly from the forward bridge there came a yell through a megaphone a yell that electrified everybody who heard it  after bridge there report to the commodore and the captain that the enemys ships are coming out of the harbor  there was no necessity to report for commodore captain and all others heard the cry there was a second of silence could this news be true then came the command of the executive officer  clear ship for action  hurrah the enemy is coming out at last to your guns boys remember the maine these and a score of other cries rang out while men rushed hither and thither dropping one garment or another as they ran and kicking shoes right and left for no jackie will do work worth the counting unless he is barefooted everybody had on his best clothing but that did not matter and down into the grimy depths of the big vessel dropped the firemen coal heavers and all the rest of the black gang as they are termed for steam must be gotten up in a tremendous hurry or the enemy would surely get away ton after ton of coal was thrown onto the fires and the firemen coaxed and coaxed until the black lumps grew first red and then white and converted the water in the boilers into highpressure steam fire up for the sake of the ships honor fire up came in a hoarse cry down the speakingtube and the men did fire up as never before until all were ready to drop from the terrific heat and all this while the engineers were watching their engines oiling this part and that and making every pound of steam do its utmost to send the great armored cruiser dashing and hissing through the sea to that point where the spanish fleet was trying to escape  for admiral cervera could stand it no longer inside of the harbor with the army of invasion at the very outskirts of santiago and with the american fleet beyond his bay of refuge something must be done and done quickly he would run for itrun at the top of his speedand trust to luck if not providence to get out of range and reach cienfuegos or havana santiago bay was too hot to hold him  it was the big prow of the maria teresa that first showed itself quickly followed by the vizcaya oquendo and colon with the torpedo boats pluton and furor bringing up closely in the rear all were under a full head of steam and the thick smoke shot up in heavy clouds from every funnel for an instant all seemed to pause at the gateway to the sea then led by the maria teresa they turned westward along the coast to this side of the blockade now lay but three american warships the brooklyn texas and the little vixen if he could only get out of range of these admiral cervera felt that he would for the time being at least be safe  boom it was a threepounder fired from the iowa lying some distance to the eastward of the texas she too was flying the signal the enemy is escaping in red and white and blue flags beyond the iowa still further eastward lay the pride of the western coast the mighty oregon and it was this ship that first started up her engines in pursuit having by chance a good head of steam up and as the oregon turned in one direction the little resolute turned in the other to carry the news to the absent rearadmiral  three minutes had not yet passed yet a complete transformation had occurred on the brooklyn five hundred men had scuttled to as many different directions battle hatches had been lowered watertight compartments closed hose attached and decks wet down fire tubs filled magazines opened hoists put into operation and ammunition delivered to turret decks and to the fightingtops down below fire had been started under four fresh boilers and a dozen different connections between engines made  nor was this all splinter nets had been spread as before all useless woodwork thrown overboard and the surgeons operating tables made ready the warning gun from the iowa was followed by a gun from the texas and then the brooklyn helped to open the ball with her forward eightinch guns another great naval battle fully equal to that of manila bay was now on  its a question of do or die boys cried caleb as he worked over the heavy gun before him hustle now as you never hustled before or the dagos will get away now then polly do the best you can and bang went the gun with a noise that was deafening ten minutes later walter felt as if his hearing had left him entirely so incessant was the firing  the first fire from the enemy came from the maria teresa and was an eleveninch shell directed at the brooklyn hardly had this been discharged when the indiana coming up behind the iowa took a longrange chance and sent a shell directly upon the teresas deck doing not a little damage then the firing became general and shot and shell was hurled in every direction  so far the brooklyn had been headed directly for the harbor entrance commodore and captain being intent upon cutting off the enemys westward flight if possible this course soon brought the maria teresa vizcaya and the brooklyn into close proximity and presently all were lost to view in a dense cloud of smoke from which shot long streaks of fire as battery after battery was discharged at close range  give it to em was the cry that rang throughout the brooklyn dont let up on em we must do as well as dewey did and better remember the maine and three cheers for uncle sam such cries were truly inspiring but presently the men became silent as the work began to tell upon them and they realized what a fearful task still lay before them  the second ships flag is down was the welcome news which soon drifted down from the fightingtops it was true the vizcayas big silk flag had been riddled completely and the halyard shot away but soon another flag was run up later on the brooklyns flag also came down but it did not remain so more than two minutes before a jackie had it up again  the battle had but fairly begun and the brooklyn and the maria teresa were having it hot and heavy when suddenly the bow of the vizcaya began to turn swiftly at once a cry rang out that ship is going to ram the brooklyn see she is turning full toward her  the warning proved true the vizcaya was turned fairly and squarely for commodore schleys flagship bells were ringing on board of her for full speed ahead on and on she came like a demon of the deep in one wild terrible effort to ram the vessel walter was on and sink her     chapter xxix  the destruction of the spanish fleet   we are lost  that ship will cut us in half  give her a broadside boys before we go down  these and a hundred other cries rang out as the vizcaya came leaping over the waves on her awful mission of death and destruction then gun after gun roared out sending shot and shell on the enemys deck if this was their last hour on earth these brave jackies were going to make the most of it  but commodore captain and executive officer were all on the alert and were not to be caught napping as the vizcaya came on the necessary orders were given and the brooklyn began to turn in a twelvepoint circle to starboard like a flash she swept past the warship dashing on to destroy her and then the command rang out give her another broadside and the port guns twenty in number vomited out their deathdealing shots and shells raking the spanish deck from end to end and killing and wounding a great number of sailors and officers to this awful fire was added that from the oregon which now came up to assist the flagship realizing that the plan to ram the brooklyn was a failure the vizcaya started westward once more  it was now high time to turn attention to the two torpedoboat destroyers pluton and furor that were coming out of the harbor at a speed of twenty knots per hour once these destroyers gained the open sea to catch them would be impossible like long steel arrows glistening in the sunlight they darted through the greenish waves and for a moment hid themselves behind their big sisters  then on came the gloucester a converted yacht commanded by lieutenant wainwright wainwright had been executive officer of the maine when she was blown up in havana harbor and had vowed more than once to sink something if only he were given a chance like an avenging angel the gloucester but lightly armed bore down upon the torpedo boats and sent shot after shot into them then the destroyers began to turn as if to sink the little enemy who dared to molest them but now it was too latethe big warships were coming to the gloucesters aid  it was the oregon and the iowa that first came to the converted yachts assistance and as the destroyers turned first one way and then another as if to ram or to run a perfect hailstorm of shot and shell landed on their sides and decks churning up the water into a milkwhite froth and causing the destroyers to look like gigantic whales lashing themselves in their death throes the noise was even greater than it had been before and the smoke made the heavens above look as if a violent thunderstorm was at hand  finding they could not withstand such a combined attack and with the texas hurrying to the scene the destroyers turned tail as if to make for the shore as the turn was made a huge shell flying over the masts of the gloucester hit the pluton directly amidship and with a crash and a splutter she broke and sank leaving the still living members of her crew struggling in the boiling waters for their lives  left to herself the furor again paused like some wild animal seeking in vain for cover she started to get behind the oquendo but in spite of the fire from the shore batteries the gloucester went in after her with every available gun doing its utmost and fairly filling her with small holes at last the destroyer could stand it no longer and with a lurch she struck on a reef and began to break in a moment more the water poured over her sides and her crew was compelled to surrender the instant the surrender was made the converted yacht from being an angel of vengeance became an angel of mercy and to gallant lieutenantcommander wainwright fell the honor of rescuing hundreds of wounded and drowning spaniards who must otherwise have perished  such was the close of this running fight at the front the four big warships were still trying to push on with the brooklyn oregon iowa texas and indiana in the chase with a full head of steam the noble oregon reached a position between commodore schleys flagship and the texas and every vessel in the line belched forth its messengers of death and destruction  presently a cry echoed throughout the squadron regarding the oquendo she is on fire see she is burning in three places  the report was true a shell had burst near the quarterdeck of the warship and now high to the sky arose a column of yellowish red smoke then the flames burst out of her bow in vain the spaniards tried to man their firehose a shower of projectiles from the fightingtops of our own ships assailed them and drove them to shelter while the big guns continued to pump up shot and shell as never before  but the oquendo was no worse off than the maria teresa if as badly she staggered on and a few minutes later passed her sister ship as if looking for aid when aid could not be given  the maria teresa is on fire was the next cry but a few minutes later down goes cerveras flag hurrah boys weve got em on the run give it to em hot  yes the admirals flag was down and so was the mast that had held it would the spanish emblem go up again all watched anxiously and meanwhile the brooklyn continued to pour in her hottest fire  shes going ashore rang through the american flagship shes burning up and then came a heavy shot from the brooklyn another from the texas and staggering like a thing of life the maria teresa ran for the beach a mass of seething and roaring flames admiral cerveras doom was sealed five minutes later the oquendo was also cast on the shore  four of the enemys ships had been laid low but the great fight was by no means over shot and shell were flying around the vizcaya and cristobal colon but both warships kept on their way the colon slowly but surely forging to the front both spanish ships were returning the americans hot fire and many a shot hit the brooklyn and many a shell burst over her deck but as yet no serious damage had been inflicted  but a calamity was at hand as rapid in its execution as it was appalling near the forward eightinch turret george ellis was standing watching the struggle of the enemys ships to escape  ellis give us the range again shouted captain cook  ill have it in a moment captain answered the chief yeoman and took up his stadiometer making his calculation he turned to commodore schley who was but a short distance away it is fourteen hundred yards to the vizcaya sir he said  these were the last words he ever uttered for an instant after there was the whistling of a shell and those standing around were horrified to see elliss headless body drop to the deck below the poor fellow had been killed instantly in the very midst of his duties what a shock this was to those about him i will leave my readers to imagine never until now had they realized what this awful war meant poor ellis he was such a fine man murmured one comrade as he turned away and then his face grew even more sober but hes the first on board of this ship what of those poor dons yonder who are going down by the wholesale and though they were enemies his heart beat in sympathy for the poor wretches who were struggling madly amid shot shell fire and water for their lives fortunately the iowa was already coming to the succor of the defeated ones  were going to catch it now lad remarked caleb to walter as he pointed through a rift in the cloud of smoke hanging over the gun there are two of the enemys ships and they are both going to pound us where in the world are our other vessels  the oregon is coming up came from the afterdeck a minute later and the texas isnt far behind  around the gun it was suffocating and every hand was ready to drop indeed fainting fits were frequent but the most that could be done for a sufferer was to either throw some water over his head or yell out to the surgeons helpers to carry the men to the ward room for treatment as the brooklyn was struck here and there splinters began to fly and a number were injured although no one seriously  the texas had done wonderful work on the maria teresa and the oquendo and now did her best to keep to the front of the chase but the speed was too great for her and gradually she dropped behind although still continuing to throw shot and shell after the vizcaya that had dropped some distance behind the colon it was now apparent to all that if any vessel was going to get away it was to be the colon for her speed was greater than the vizcaya and as yet she had hardly been touched  the vizcaya boys the vizcaya came the cry from the quarterdeck dont let her screen the colon  well pound em both was the answer remember the maine remember manila bay  and then the mighty guns of the brooklyn and oregon roared out swifter than ever and the vizcaya doing her best to sink one or the other of the american warships was raked as if passing through a blizzard of fire until her men were forced again and again from their posts and at last the guns were abandoned then fire caught the craft in its awful embrace and rolling from side to side she too sought for a harbor of refuge but found none down came her colors and at the same instant she struck with a crash on the rocks the fight had started at quarter to ten now it was but quarter past elevenjust an hour and a halfand all the spanish ships but one had been destroyed such is the appalling swiftness of modern naval warfare where in olden days jack tars had fought for hours they now fought for minutes  but the destruction of the vizcaya had taken time and the colon was forging onward panting and throbbing like a thing of life trying to escape from unspeakable terrors down in the bowels of the warship the furnaces were at a white heat and the engineers had long since pushed their engines far past the danger point faster faster came the cry from the deck and tower it will be better to blow up than to allow the yankee pigs to sink us we must save at least one ship and the engines pounded and quivered threatening each instant to blow into a million pieces for once don quixote was making the run of his life  unable to stand the heat walter had obtained permission to lay off for a few minutes and get some fresh air a look from the spar deck had showed him the colon dashing far ahead enveloped in a thin line of smoke every few seconds a flash of fire would come from her stern guns but the marksmanship was poor and no serious damage was done to the brooklyn  the boy returned to his gun to find caleb and the others in deep perplexity something was wrong with a shell and it had become wedged in the gun and could not be pushed forward to its proper place or hauled back we cant use polly any more groaned caleb  ill fix her cried si doring and caught up a rammer in a moment the brave yankee lad was crawling out over the smoking piece toward the muzzle but he had scarcely reached the outward end of the gun than the brooklyn gave a lurch and down he slipped over the side and into space     chapter xxx  final scenes of the great fight   si has fallen overboard  the cry came from half a dozen throats at once and walters heart almost stopped beating so attached had he become to the yankee lad  if hes overboard hell be sucked under and drowned he groaned i wonder if i can see anything of him  without a second thought he leaped on the gun and began to crawl out on hands and knees as perilous a thing to do with the vessel going at full speed as one would care to undertake  come back roared caleb trying to detain him youll go overboard too  at that moment came a cry from below and looking down the steel side of the brooklyn walter beheld si clinging to a rope ladder one of several flung over to be used in case of emergency si are you all right he called loudly  ireckonii am came with a pant  but i had an awful tumble and the wind is about knocked out o me and then si began to climb up to the deck  hes on the ladder and hes all right shouted walter to those still behind the gun then a sudden idea struck him hand me another rammer stuben  mine cracious dont you try dot cried the hoseman you vos fall ofer chust like si  yes come in here put in caleb and paul also called upon him to return  im all right was the boys reply give it to me stuben and catching the rammer from the hoseman steve colton passed it forward in war we have got to take some risks he reasoned as caleb gave him a severe look  then why didnt you get out on the gun steve was the old gunners dry response and the second gun captain said no more  rammer in hand walter edged closer and closer to the muzzle of the polly the brooklyn was moving up and down over the long green waves sending the spray flying on both sides of the bow he gave one look down felt himself growing dizzy and then kept his eyes on the gun  illustration rammer in hand walter edged close to the muzzle  at last the muzzle was gained and not without difficulty the rammer was inserted the projectile had not been very tightly wedged and a firm pressure sent it backward so that caleb could catch it and pull it out through the breech then throwing the rammer aboard walter lost no time in coming in again he had been exposed to the direct fire of the enemy but no shot had come near him  boy youre too plucky exclaimed caleb catching him by the shoulder you ought to be flogged for your daring let me see your hands ah just as i thought both of em blistered go and put some sweet oil on em and a bit of flour ill bet the end of polly is redhot  well it is pretty hot replied walter and then he was glad enough to follow calebs advice for both hands smarted a good deal soon si joined him to get something for his hands also  the colon had now drawn out of range so firing would have been a useless waste of ammunition down to the gunners came the order cease firing and a moment later all hands on deck for an airing what a laughing and shouting ensued as the jackies poured up to secure the best viewing places they could within the ships regulations hot tired ready to drop from exhaustion they shook hands with each other sang laughed and whistled  three cheers for commodore schley came suddenly from somebody and the cheers came with vigor and a tiger and then came a cheer for captain cook and a cheer for the oregon coming up with ever increasing speed the oregons men cheered in return and for a moment one would have thought this was holidaymaking instead of grim war  the colon was close to shore while the brooklyn and the oregon lay from two to three miles out to sea some miles farther westward the cuban shore slopes southward to cape cruz if the colon kept on her present course she would have to make for the cape thus coming down toward the american warships we will catch her there said commodore schley confidently  the oregon was flying the signal remember the maine from her masthead and as she drew still closer to the brooklyn another shout of approval went up the two warships would fight the colon between them if only they could get within range  it was now noontime and a hasty mess was served all around and the men continued to air themselves something easy to do with the ponderous ship speeding the waters at an eighteenknot rate suddenly from the oregon came the boom of a thirteeninch gun and the shell fell just astern of the colon sending the water up like a fountain the battle was again on  now for it cried caleb as the spanish warship turned southward down the coast and the polly spoke up as fiercely as at any time during the contest  the spaniards are losing heart came the cry a few minutes later they aint doing half the firing they were  it was true the colon was running short of ammunition and her officers saw what a hopeless fight a contest with the brooklyn and oregon would prove to be with shot and shell falling all around him captain moreu hauled down his flag and sent his ship ashore at rio tarquino  the battle was won and deweys magnificent victory at manila which the world in general had declared was a miracle that could not be matched had been duplicated henceforth american warships and american sailors would stand as the equals of any nation on the face of the globe  and now that the contest was over what was to follow to me the hours that came after are even greater in honor than those glorious hours of victory already down the shore the work of rescuing the sailors and marines from the maria teresa oquendo and vizcaya had begun and now the crews of the brooklyn and oregon turned in to aid the wounded and the dying and those in danger of drowning on the colon boat after boat went out close to the sinking cruiser now burning fiercely with abandoned guns going off loose powder and shells exploding and magazines in danger of tearing all asunder amid such perils did our noble jackies work hauling man after man from the ship or from the water and taking them to our own warships there to be cared for as tenderly as though they were our own some of the spaniards could not understand this treatment they had been told that the americans were butchers and had no hearts and when they realized the truth many burst into tears of joy  when the battle was all over some of our officers and men could not comprehend what had been accomplishedthat a whole fleet of spanish warships had been destroyed that hundreds of men had been killed and many more wounded and taken prisoners and that the loss to our side had been but one man killed a handful wounded and no ship seriously damaged it was an act of providence said more than one and captain philip of the texas spoke thus to his crew as he gathered all around him on this nevertobeforgotten sunday so bright and clear  i wish to make confession that i have implicit faith in god and in the officers and crew of the texas but my faith in you is only secondary to my faith in god we have seen what he has done for us in allowing us to achieve so great a victory and i want to ask all of you or at least every man who has no scruples to uncover his head with me and silently offer a word of thanks to god for his goodness toward us all the thanks were given some dropping upon their knees to deliver them and this outpouring of hearts travelled from one ship to another throughout the entire fleet  poor ellis said walter the only seaman to give up his life its too bad and when george elliss body was buried with all naval honors he wept as bitterly as did anybody on board of the flagship  the victory had been gained but the work of the fleet was not yet over the army still occupied the outskirts of santiago and general shafter had sent word to general toral that unless he surrendered the city would be shelled monday morning at a conference with admiral sampson later on it was decided that the fleet should take part in the bombardment even if it was necessary to force an entrance into the harbor without delay our warships were gotten into condition for this task  but the bombardment did not comefor the reason that both on land and sea the enemy had had enough of fighting several days passed and the conditions of a surrender were discussed in the meantime lieutenant hobson and his men were released and turned over to us in exchange for a number of spanish prisoners several of the men remembered seeing walter and were glad to learn that the youth had escaped  the battle on sea had taken place on july the third and my readers can imagine what a glorious fourth of july followed not only among the soldiers and sailors but among our people at large all over the land cannons boomed pistols cracked rockets flared bells pealed forth and bands played for the marching of thousands it was a real oldfashioned yankee doodle time as one downeast paper put it and north south east and west united in celebrating as never before less than two weeks later santiago surrendered a peace protocol followed and the war with spain came to an end     chapter xxxi  together once moreconclusion   and now that business is finished an im most awfully glad on it yes i am  it was job dowling who spoke the uncle and guardian of the three russell boys was sitting by the side window of his home in buffalo in his lap lay a small flat package which had been wrapped in heavy brown paper and well sealed in his hand was an open letter which he had just finished reading  it was a dreadful price to pay thet detective he resumed but i couldnt git them hairlooms back no other way and im afraid the boys would raise the roof ef i didnt git em back its a comfort to know thet thief was caught and is going to be tried for even a wuss crime than stealin them rings an the watch an the australian diamond i hope they give him about twenty years in prison he paused to put the package away in his dilapidated secretary so ben is coming home this week i wonder what hell have to say when he faces me somehow i dont know wot im going to say myself and he dropped into his chair again  job dowling was a different man from what he had been the determined stand taken by larry walter and ben had opened his eyes to the knowledge that he had no mere children to deal with but boys who were almost men and who were fully capable of taking care of themselves his visit to new york when he was robbed of the russell heirlooms had caused him considerable loss of selfconfidence and the trip to boston after the thief had awakened him to the fact that after all he was of but little importance in this world his efforts to help the police recover the heirlooms had been laughed at and even the detective had shown him plainly that he was hindering more than he was helping finally he had returned home in disgust and the detective had finished the work on the case alone recovered everything and sent deck mumpers to jail to stand trial on half a dozen charges the detectives bill had been over two hundred dollars a sum the paying of which had nearly given job dowling a fit but now the whole thing was settled and he was awaiting bens return for the gallant young volunteer had been shot in the left arm on the day before santiago surrendered and was coming home on sick leave  ding ding it was a double ring at the frontdoor bell and before mrs graham the new housekeeper and a great improvement on the tartarlike mrs rafferty could get to the door job dowling was there himself  ben an walter he exclaimed as he found himself confronted by two nephews instead of one as expected weller how is this  how do you do uncle job exclaimed ben extending his hand  arent you glad to see me too uncle job put in walter  whyerof course of course came with a stammer and job dowling held out both of his bony hands come right in this is mrs graham my new workwoman and the lady of the house dressed in a neat wrapper and with a clean kitchen apron on came forward and bowed knows a sight more than mrs rafferty did went on the uncle in a whisper  i didnt know walter was coming on till day before yesterday continued ben we met quite by accident in new york and we made up to come on together and surprise you  i seei see job dowling was still very nervous and he could hardly tell why at one instant he thought he ought to quarrel with them the next that it would be quite proper to embrace them and tell them they were forgiven and could henceforth do as they saw proper but he chose a middle course and did neither sit down and make yourselves to hum and mrs graham you had best get a few extry chopsthree wont be enough tell boggs to send me the best on the stand  at this order walter nudged ben and both looked at each other and smiled hes reforming whispered the young sailor only give him time and hell be all right  yes mr dowling put in the housekeeper and you said something about pie yesterday when master ben should come what of that  ah yes so i did so i did the former miser wrinkled his brow how much does a pie cost  ten and twenty cents  boys do you think you could eat a twentycent pie  do we cried walter just try us and see uncle job and now he clasped his guardian half affectionately by the shoulder  then get the twentycent pie mrs graham and be sure an pick out the best youerhave the other things  yes sirpotatoes green corn and coffee  very good and as the housekeeper retired job dowling turned to the boys again and how is your arm ben not seriously hurt i trust  its only a scratch was the answer  and you walter  im all right but how have you been uncle job and what of that stolen stuff  oh im only tolerablegot quite some rheumatism the hairlooms is all safebut they cost me two hundred and twentyseven dollars an a half to git em and the guardian nodded to emphasize his words  well theyre worth it answered ben promptly and job dowling did not dare dispute the assertion where are they  in the desk ill show em to you and then ye can both tell me all about yer adventures on the water and in cuby  the heirlooms had just been brought out and ben was examining the watch when a form darkened the window openingthe form of a boy dressed in a natty sailor suit all looked up in wonder and all cried out in unison  larry  ben walter and uncle job came from the youth who had fought so gallantly under dewey at manila heres a family gathering for sure and with a light leap he cleared the windowsill and actually fell into his brothers arms while job dowling looked on with a half smile on his wrinkled face

                here we will bring to a close the story of walter russells adventures while fighting in cuban waters which has taken us through a thrilling naval campaign and shown us what true american pluck can accomplish even under the most trying circumstances  as my readers know the russell boys had a large inheritance coming to them and now that job dowling had come to his senses regarding a proper treatment of them it was to be hoped that matters would move much more smoothly for all concerned  through larry it was learned that his oldtime friend luke striker was still with dewey in philippine waters and had been promoted to the position of first guncaptain on board the olympia much to the old yankees credit and delight  frank bulkley bens soldier chum was still sick with the fever but was at his home in the metropolis and was out of danger which was much to be thankful for considering what awful havoc that fever had made with the army of invasion  walters friends were all on the brooklyn and it was not long before the lad was anxious to get back to them for he had become very much attached to the noble flagship that had rendered such a good account of herself in the mighty conflict with cerveras fleet  gilbert pennington bens friend of the rough riders was in cuba but expected to come north shortly gilbert had an offer of a position as bookkeeper with an importing firm in new york but was destined to see a good deal more of fighting ere he settled to work behind a desk  when ben spoke of trying for a commission and larry said he should remain in the navy both thought that fighting for the american army and navy was at an end this supposition was correct so far as spain was concerned but the insurgents in the philippines under general aguinaldo refused to recognize uncle sams authority and it was not long before a large army had to be sent to manila and other points to coÃ¶perate with dewey in restoring peace and order ben could not resist the temptation to join these soldiers in a distant clime and with more fighting in view larry hastened to rejoin the olympia in another volume to be entitled under otis in the philippines or a young officer in the tropics we shall follow the future adventures of these two brothers and shall also see more of gilbert pennington luke striker and several others of our old acquaintances  and now for
