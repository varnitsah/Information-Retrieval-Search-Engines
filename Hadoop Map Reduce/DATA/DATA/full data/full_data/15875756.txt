15875756	the great impersonation  by e phillips oppenheim    first published 1920    the great impersonation    chapter i  the trouble from which great events were to come began when everard dominey who had been fighting his way through the scrub for the last three quarters of an hour towards those thin spiral wisps of smoke urged his pony to a last despairing effort and came crashing through the great oleander shrub to pitch forward on his head in the little clearing it developed the next morning when he found himself for the first time for many months on the truckle bed between linen sheets with a cool bambootwisted roof between him and the relentless sun he raised himself a little in the bed  where the mischief am i he demanded  a black boy seated crosslegged in the entrance of the banda rose to his feet mumbled something and disappeared in a few moments the tall slim figure of a european in spotless white riding clothes stooped down and came over to domineys side  you are better he enquired politely  yes i am was the somewhat brusque rejoinder where the mischief am i and who are you  the newcomers manner stiffened he was a person of dignified carriage and his tone conveyed some measure of rebuke  you are within half a mile of the iriwarri river if you know where that is he repliedabout seventytwo miles southeast of the darawaga settlement  the devil then i am in german east africa  without a doubt  and you are german  i have that honour  dominey whistled softly  awfully sorry to have intruded he said i left marlinstein two and a half months ago with twenty boys and plenty of stores we were doing a big trek after lions i took some new askaris in and they made troublelooted the stores one night and there was the devil to pay i was obliged to shoot one or two and the rest deserted they took my compass damn them and im nearly a hundred miles out of my bearings you couldnt give me a drink could you  with pleasure if the doctor approves was the courteous answer here jan  the boy sprang up listened to a word or two of brief command in his own language and disappeared through the hanging grass which led into another hut the two men exchanged glances of rather more than ordinary interest then dominey laughed  i know what youre thinking he said it gave me quite a start when you came in were devilishly alike arent we  there is a very strong likeness between us the other admitted  dominey leaned his head upon his hand and studied his host the likeness was clear enough although the advantage was all in favour of the man who stood by the side of the camp bedstead with folded arms everard dominey for the first twentysix years of his life had lived as an ordinary young englishman of his positioneton oxford a few years in the army a few years about town during which he had succeeded in making a still more hopeless muddle of his already encumbered estates a few months of tragedy and then a blank afterwards ten yearsat first in the cities then in the dark places of africayears of which no man knew anything the everard dominey of ten years ago had been without a doubt goodlooking the finely shaped features remained but the eyes had lost their lustre his figure its elasticity his mouth its firmness he had the look of a man run prematurely to seed wasted by fevers and dissipation not so his present companion his features were as finely shaped cast in an even stronger though similar mould his eyes were bright and full of fire his mouth and chin firm bespeaking a man of deeds his tall figure lithe and supple he had the air of being in perfect health in perfect mental and physical condition a man who lived with dignity and some measure of content notwithstanding the slight gravity of his expression  yes the englishman muttered theres no doubt about the likeness though i suppose i should look more like you than i do if id taken care of myself but i havent thats the devil of it ive gone the other way tried to chuck my life away and pretty nearly succeeded too  the dried grasses were thrust on one side and the doctor entereda little round man also clad in immaculate white with yellowgold hair and thick spectacles his countryman pointed towards the bed  will you examine our patient herr doctor and prescribe for him what is necessary he has asked for drink let him have wine or whatever is good for him if he is well enough he will join our evening meal i present my excuses i have a despatch to write  the man on the couch turned his head and watched the departing figure with a shade of envy in his eyes  what is my preservers name he asked the doctor  the latter looked as though the questions were irreverent  it is his excellency the majorgeneral baron leopold von ragastein  all that dominey muttered is he the governor or something of that sort  he is military commandant of the colony the doctor replied he has also a special mission here  damned finelooking fellow for a german dominey remarked with unthinking insolence  the doctor was unmoved he was feeling his patients pulse he concluded his examination a few minutes later  you have drunk much whisky lately so he asked  i dont know what the devil its got to do with you was the curt reply but i drink whisky whenever i can get it who wouldnt in this pestilential climate  the doctor shook his head  the climate is good as he is treated he declared his excellency drinks nothing but light wine and seltzer water he has been here for five years not only here but in the swamps and he has not been ill one day  well i have been at deaths door a dozen times the englishman rejoined a little recklessly and i dont much mind when i hand in my checks but until that time comes i shall drink whisky whenever i can get it  the cook is preparing you some luncheon the doctor announced and it will do you good to eat i cannot give you whisky at this moment but you can have some hock and seltzer with bay leaves  send it along was the enthusiastic reply what a constitution i must have doctor the smell of that cooking outside is making me ravenous  your constitution is still sound if you would only respect it was the comforting assurance  anything been heard of the rest of my party dominey enquired  some bodies of askaris have been washed up from the river the doctor informed him and two of your ponies have been eaten by lions you will excuse i have the wounds of a native to dress who was bitten last night by a jaguar  the traveller left alone lay still in the hut and his thoughts wandered backwards he looked out over the bare scrubby stretch of land which had been cleared for this encampment to the mass of bush and flowering shrubs beyond mysterious and impenetrable save for that rough elephant track along which he had travelled to the broadbosomed river blue as the sky above and to the mountains fading into mist beyond the face of his host had carried him back into the past puzzled reminiscence tugged at the strings of memory it came to him later on at dinner time when they three the commandant the doctor and himself sat at a little table arranged just outside the hut that they might catch the faint breeze from the mountains herald of the swiftfalling darkness native servants beat the air around them with bamboo fans to keep off the insects and the air was faint almost to noxiousness with the perfume of some sickly exotic shrub  why youre devinter he exclaimed suddenlysigismund devinter you were at eton with mehorrocks housesemifinal in the racquets  and magdalen afterwards number five in the boat  and why the devil did the doctor here tell me that your name was von ragastein  because it happens to be the truth was the somewhat measured reply devinter is my family name and the one by which i was known when in england when i succeeded to the barony and estates at my uncles death however i was compelled to also take the title  well its a small world dominey exclaimed what brought you out here reallylions or elephants  neither  you mean to say that youve taken up this sort of political business just for its own sake not for sport  entirely so i do not use a sporting rifle once a month except for necessity i came to africa for different reasons  dominey drank deep of his hock and seltzer and leaned back watching the fireflies rise above the tallbladed grass above the stumpy clumps of shrub and hang like miniature stars in the clear violet air  what a world he soliloquised siggy devinter baron von ragastein out here slaving for god knows what drilling niggers to fight god knows whom a political machine i suppose future governorgeneral of german africa eh you were always proud of your country devinter  my country is a country to be proud of was the solemn reply  well youre in earnest anyhow dominey continued in earnest about something and iwell its finished with me it would have been finished last night if i hadnt seen the smoke from your fires and i dont much carethats the trouble i go blundering on i suppose the end will come somehow sometimecan i have some rum or whisky devinteri mean von ragasteinyour excellencyor whatever i ought to say you see those wreaths of mist down by the river theyll mean malaria for me unless i have spirits  i have something better than either von ragastein replied you shall give me your opinion of this  the orderly who stood behind his masters chair received a whispered order disappeared into the commissariat hut and came back presently with a bottle at the sight of which the englishman gasped  napoleon he exclaimed  just a few bottles i had sent to me his host explained i am delighted to offer it to some one who will appreciate it  by jove theres no mistake about that dominey declared rolling it around in his glass what a world i hadnt eaten for thirty hours when i rolled up here last night and drunk nothing but filthy water for days tonight fricassee of chicken white bread cabinet hock and napoleon brandy and tomorrow againwell who knows when do you move on von ragastein  not for several days  what the mischief do you find to do so far from headquarters if you dont shoot lions or elephants his guest asked curiously  if you really wish to know von ragastein replied i am annoying your political agents immensely by moving from place to place collecting natives for drill  but what do you want to drill them for dominey persisted i heard some time ago that you have four times as many natives under arms as we have you dont want an army here youre not likely to quarrel with us or the portuguese  it is our custom von ragastein declared a little didactically in germany and wherever we germans go to be prepared not only for what is likely to happen but for what might possibly happen  a war in my younger days when i was in the army dominey mused might have made a man of me  surely you had your chance out here  dominey shook his head  my battalion never left the country he said we were shut up in ireland all the time that was the reason i chucked the army when i was really only a boy  later on they dragged their chairs a little farther out into the darkness smoking cigars and drinking some rather wonderful coffee the doctor had gone off to see a patient and von ragastein was thoughtful their guest on the other hand continued to be reminiscently discursive  our meeting he observed lazily stretching out his hand for his glass should be full of interest to the psychologist here we are brought together by some miraculous chance to spend one night of our lives in an african jungle two human beings of the same age brought up together thousands of miles away jogging on towards the eternal blackness along lines as far apart as the mind can conceive  your eyes are fixed von ragastein murmured upon that very blackness behind which the sun will rise at dawn you will see it come up from behind the mountains in that precise spot like a new and blazing world  dont put me off with allegories his companion objected petulantly the eternal blackness exists surely enough even if my metaphor is faulty i am disposed to be philosophical let me ramble on here am i an idler in my boyhood a harmless pleasureseeker in my youth till i ran up against tragedy and since then a drifter a drifter with a slowly growing vice lolling through life with no definite purpose with no definite hope or wish except he went on a little drowsily that i think id like to be buried somewhere near the base of those mountains on the other side of the river from behind which you say the sun comes up every morning like a world on fire  you talk foolishly von ragastein protested if there has been tragedy in your life you have time to get over it you are not yet forty years old  then i turn and consider you dominey continued ignoring altogether his friends remark you are only my age and you look ten years younger your muscles are hard your eyes are as bright as they were in your school days you carry yourself like a man with a purpose you rise at five every morning the doctor tells me and you return here worn out at dusk you spend every moment of your time drilling those filthy blacks when you are not doing that you are prospecting supervising reports home trying to make the best of your few millions of acres of fever swamps the doctor worships you but who else knows what do you do it for my friend  because it is my duty was the calm reply  duty but why cant you do your duty in your own country and live a mans life and hold the hands of white men and look into the eyes of white women  i go where i am needed most von ragastein answered i do not enjoy drilling natives i do not enjoy passing the years as an outcast from the ordinary joys of human life but i follow my star  and i my willothewisp dominey laughed mockingly the whole things as plain as a pikestaff you may be a dull dogyou always were on the serious sidebut youre a man of principle im a slacker  the difference between us von ragastein pronounced is something which is inculcated into the youth of our country and which is not inculcated into yours in england with a little money a little birth your young men expect to find the world a playground for sport a garden for loves the mightiest german noble who ever lived has his work to do it is work which makes fibre which gives balance to life  dominey sighed his cigar dearly prized though it had been was cold between his fingers in that perfumed darkness illuminated only by the faint gleam of the shaded lamp behind his face seemed suddenly white and old his host leaned towards him and spoke for the first time in the kindlier tones of their youth  you hinted at tragedy my friend you are not alone tragedy also has entered my life perhaps if things had been otherwise i should have found work in more joyous places but sorrow came to me and i am here  a quick flash of sympathy lit up domineys face  we met trouble in a different fashion he groaned    chapter ii  dominey slept till late the following morning and when he woke at last from a long dreamless slumber he was conscious of a curious quietness in the camp the doctor who came in to see him explained it immediately after his morning greeting  his excellency he announced has received important despatches from home he has gone to meet an envoy from daressalaam he will be away for three days he desired that you would remain his guest until his return  very good of him dominey murmured is there any european news  i do not know was the stolid reply his excellency desired me to inform you that if you cared for a short trip along the banks of the river southward there are a dozen boys left and some ponies there are plenty of lion and rhino may be met with at one or two places which the natives know of  dominey bathed and dressed sipped his excellent coffee and lounged about the place in uncertain mood he unburdened himself to the doctor as they drank tea together late in the afternoon  i am not in the least keen on hunting he confessed and i feel like a horrible sponge but all the same i have a queer sort of feeling that id like to see von ragastein again your silent chief rather fascinates me herr doctor he is a man he has something which i have lost  he is a great man the doctor declared enthusiastically what he sets his mind to do he does  i suppose i might have been like that dominey sighed if i had had an incentive have you noticed the likeness between us herr doctor  the latter nodded  i noticed it from the first moment of your arrival he assented you are very much alike yet very different the resemblance must have been still more remarkable in your youth time has dealt with your features according to your deserts  well you neednt rub it in dominey protested irritably  i am rubbing nothing in the doctor replied with unruffled calm i speak the truth if you had been possessed of the same moral stamina as his excellency you might have preserved your health and the things that count you might have been as useful to your country as he is to his  i suppose i am pretty rocky  your constitution has been abused you still however have much vitality if you cared to exercise selfcontrol for a few months you would be a different manyou must excuse i have work  dominey spent three restless days even the sight of a herd of elephants in the river and that strange fierce chorus of night sounds as beasts of prey crept noiselessly around the camp failed to move him for the moment his love of sport his last hold upon the world of real things seemed dead what did it matter the killing of an animal more or less his mind was fixed uneasily upon the past searching always for something which he failed to discover at dawn he watched for that strangely wonderful transforming birth of the day and at night he sat outside the banda waiting till the mountains on the other side of the river had lost shape and faded into the violet darkness his conversation with von ragastein had unsettled him without knowing definitely why he wanted him back again memories that had long since ceased to torture were finding their way once more into his brain on the first day he had striven to rid himself of them in the usual fashion  doctor youve got some whisky havent you he asked  the doctor nodded  there is a case somewhere to be found he admitted his excellency told me that i was to refuse you nothing but he advises you to drink only the white wine until his return  he really left that message  precisely as i have delivered it  the desire for whisky passed came again but was beaten back returned in the night so that he sat up with the sweat pouring down his face and his tongue parched he drank lithia water instead late in the afternoon of the third day von ragastein rode into the camp his clothes were torn and drenched with the black mud of the swamps dust and dirt were thick upon his face his pony almost collapsed as he swung himself off nevertheless he paused to greet his guest with punctilious courtesy and there was a gleam of real satisfaction in his eyes as the two men shook hands  i am glad that you are still here he said heartily excuse me while i bathe and change we will dine a little earlier so far i have not eaten today  a long trek dominey asked curiously  i have trekked far was the quiet reply  at dinner time von ragastein was once more himself immaculate in white duck with clean linen shaved and with little left of his fatigue there was something different in his manner however some change which puzzled dominey he was at once more attentive to his guest yet further removed from him in spirit and sympathy he kept the conversation with curious insistence upon incidents of their school and college days upon the subject of domineys friends and relations and the later episodes of his life dominey felt himself all the time encouraged to talk about his earlier life and all the time he was conscious that for some reason or other his hosts closest and most minute attention was being given to his slightest word champagne had been served and served freely and dominey up to the very gates of that one secret chamber talked volubly and without reserve after the meal was over their chairs were dragged as before into the open the silent orderly produced even larger cigars and dominey found his glass filled once more with the wonderful brandy the doctor had left them to visit the native camp nearly a quarter of a mile away and the orderly was busy inside clearing the table only the black shapes of the servants were dimly visible as they twirled their fansand overhead the gleaming stars they were alone  ive been talking an awful lot of rot about myself dominey said tell me a little about your career now and your life in germany before you came out here  von ragastein made no immediate reply and a curious silence ebbed and flowed between the two men every now and then a star shot across the sky the red rim of the moon rose a little higher from behind the mountains the bush stillness always the most mysterious of silences seemed gradually to become charged with unvoiced passion soon the animals began to call around them creeping nearer and nearer to the fire which burned at the end of the open space  my friend von ragastein said at last speaking with the air of a man who has spent much time in deliberation you speak to me of germany of my homeland perhaps you have guessed that it is not duty alone which has brought me here to these wild places i too left behind me a tragedy  domineys quick impulse of sympathy was smothered by the stern almost harsh repression of the others manner the words seemed to have been torn from his throat there was no spark of tenderness or regret in his set face  since the day of my banishment he went on no word of this matter has passed my lips tonight it is not weakness which assails me but a desire to yield to the strange arm of coincidence you and i schoolmates and college friends though sons of a different country meet here in the wilderness each with the iron in our souls i shall tell you the thing which happened to me and you shall speak to me of your own curse  i cannot dominey groaned  but you will was the stern reply listen  an hour passed and the voices of the two men had ceased the howling of the animals had lessened with the paling of the fires and a slow melancholy ripple of breeze was passing through the bush and lapping the surface of the river it was von ragastein who broke through what might almost have seemed a trance he rose to his feet vanished inside the banda and reappeared a moment or two later with two tumblers one he set down in the space provided for it in the arm of his guests chair  tonight i break what has become a rule with me he announced i shall drink a whisky and soda i shall drink to the new things that may yet come to both of us  you are giving up your work here dominey asked curiously  i am part of a great machine was the somewhat evasive reply i have nothing to do but obey  a flicker of passion distorted domineys face flamed for a moment in his tone  are you content to live and die like this he demanded dont you want to get back to where a different sort of sun will warm your heart and fill your pulses this primitive world is in its way colossal but it isnt human it isnt a life for humans we want streets von ragastein you and i we want the tide of people flowing around us the roar of wheels and the hum of human voices curse these animals if i live in this country much longer i shall go on all fours  you yield too much to environment his companion observed in the life of the cities you would be a sentimentalist  no city nor any civilised country will ever claim me again dominey sighed i should never have the courage to face what might come  von ragastein rose to his feet the dim outline of his erect form was in a way majestic he seemed to tower over the man who lounged in the chair before him  finish your whisky and soda to our next meeting friend of my school days he begged tomorrow before you awake i shall be gone  so soon  by tomorrow night von ragastein replied i must be on the other side of those mountains this must be our farewell  dominey was querulous almost pathetic he had a sudden hatred of solitude  i must trek westward myself directly he protested or eastward or northwardit doesnt so much matter cant we travel together  von ragastein shook his head  i travel officially and i must travel alone he replied as for yourself they will be breaking up here tomorrow but they will lend you an escort and put you in the direction you wish to take this alas is as much as i can do for you for us it must be farewell  well i cant force myself upon you dominey said a little wistfully it seems strange though to meet right out here far away even from the byways of life just to shake hands and pass on i am sick to death of niggers and animals  it is fate von ragastein decided where i go i must go alone farewell dear friend we will drink the toast we drank our last night in your rooms at magdalen that sanscrit man translated it for us may each find what he seeks we must follow our star  dominey laughed a little bitterly he pointed to a light glowing fitfully in the bush  my willothewisp he muttered recklessly leading where i shall followinto the swamps  a few minutes later dominey threw himself upon his couch curiously and unaccountably drowsy von ragastein who had come in to wish him good night stood looking down at him for several moments with significant intentness then satisfied that his guest really slept he turned and passed through the hanging curtain of dried grasses into the next banda where the doctor still fully dressed was awaiting him they spoke together in german and with lowered voices von ragastein had lost something of his imperturbability  everything progresses according to my orders he demanded  everything excellency the boys are being loaded and a runner has gone on to wadihuan for ponies to be prepared  they know that i wish to start at dawn  all will be prepared excellency  von ragastein laid his hand upon the doctors shoulder  come outside schmidt he said i have something to tell you of my plans  the two men seated themselves in the long wicker chairs the doctor in an attitude of strict attention von ragastein turned his head and listened from domineys quarters came the sound of deep and regular breathing  i have formed a great plan schmidt von ragastein proceeded you know what news has come to me from berlin  your excellency has told me a little the doctor reminded him  the day arrives von ragastein pronounced his voice shaking with deep emotion he paused a moment in thought and continued the time even the month is fixed i am recalled from here to take the place for which i was destined you know what that place is you know why i was sent to an english public school and college  i can guess  i am to take up my residence in england i am to have a special mission i am to find a place for myself there as an englishman the means are left to my ingenuity listen schmidt a great idea has come to me  the doctor lit a cigar  i listen excellency  von ragastein rose to his feet not content with the sound of that regular breathing he made his way to the opening of the banda and gazed in at domineys slumbering form then he returned  it is something which you do not wish the englishman to hear the doctor asked  it is  we speak in german  languages was the cautious reply happen to be that mans only accomplishment he can speak german as fluently as you or i that however is of no consequence he sleeps and he will continue to sleep i mixed him a sleeping draught with his whisky and soda  ah the doctor grunted  my principal need in england is an identity von ragastein pointed out i have made up my mind i shall take this englishmans i shall return to england as sir everard dominey  so  there is a remarkable likeness between us and dominey has not seen an englishman who knows him for eight or ten years any school or college friends whom i may encounter i shall be able to satisfy i have stayed at dominey i know domineys relatives tonight he has babbled for hours telling me many things that it is well for me to know  what about his near relatives  he has none nearer than cousins  no wife  von ragastein paused and turned his head the deep breathing inside the banda had certainly ceased he rose to his feet and stealing uneasily to the opening gazed down upon his guests outstretched form to all appearance dominey still slept deeply after a moment or twos watch von ragastein returned to his place  therein lies his tragedy he confided dropping his voice a little lower she is insaneinsane it seems through a shock for which he was responsible she might have been the only stumbling block and she is as though she did not exist  it is a great scheme the doctor murmured enthusiastically  it is a wonderful one that great and unrevealed power schmidt which watches over our country and which will make her mistress of the world must have guided this man to us my position in england will be unique as sir everard dominey i shall be able to penetrate into the inner circles of societyperhaps even of political life i shall be able if necessary to remain in england even after the storm bursts  supposing the doctor suggested this man dominey should return to england  von ragastein turned his head and looked towards his questioner  he must not he pronounced  so the doctor murmured  late in the afternoon of the following day dominey with a couple of boys for escort and his rifle slung across his shoulder rode into the bush along the way he had come the little fat doctor stood and watched him waving his hat until he was out of sight then he called to the orderly  heinrich he said you are sure that the herr englishman has the whisky  the water bottles are filled with nothing else herr doctor the man replied  there is no water or soda water in the pack  not one drop herr doctor  how much food  one days rations  the beef is salt  it is very salt herr doctor  and the compass  it is ten degrees wrong  the boys have their orders  they understand perfectly herr doctor if the englishman does not drink they will take him at midnight to where his excellency will be encamped at the bend of the blue river  the doctor sighed he was not at heart an unkindly man  i think he murmured it will be better for the englishman that he drinks    chapter iii  mr john lambert mangan of lincolns inn gazed at the card which a junior clerk had just presented in blank astonishment an astonishment which became speedily blended with dismay  good god do you see this harrison he exclaimed passing it over to his manager with whom he had been in consultation domineysir everard domineyback here in england  the head clerk glanced at the narrow piece of pasteboard and sighed  im afraid you will find him rather a troublesome client sir he remarked  his employer frowned of course i shall he answered testily there isnt an extra penny to be had out of the estatesyou know that harrison the last two quarters allowance which we sent to africa came out of the timber why the mischief didnt he stay where he was  what shall i tell the gentleman sir the boy enquired  oh show him in mr mangan directed illtemperedly i suppose i shall have to see him sooner or later ill finish these affidavits after lunch harrison  the solicitor composed his features to welcome a client who however troublesome his affairs had become still represented a family who had been valued patrons of the firm for several generations he was prepared to greet a seedylooking and degenerate individual looking older than his years instead he found himself extending his hand to one of the best turned out and handsomest men who had ever crossed the threshold of his not very inviting office for a moment he stared at his visitor speechless then certain points of familiaritythe wellshaped nose the rather deepset grey eyespresented themselves this surprise enabled him to infuse a little real heartiness into his welcome  my dear sir everard he exclaimed this is a most unexpected pleasuremost unexpected such a pity too that we only posted a draft for your allowance a few days ago dear meyoull forgive my saying sohow well you look  dominey smiled as he accepted an easy chair  africas a wonderful country mangan he remarked with just that faint note of patronage in his tone which took his listener back to the days of his present clients father  itpardon my remarking ithas done wonderful things for you sir everard let me see it must be eleven years since we met  sir everard tapped the toes of his carefully polished brown shoes with the end of his walking stick  i left london he murmured reminiscently in april nineteen hundred and two yes eleven years mr mangan it seems queer to find myself in london again as i dare say you can understand  precisely the lawyer murmured i was just wonderingi think that last remittance we sent to you could be stopped i have no doubt you will be glad of a little ready money he added with a confident smile  thanks i dont think i need any just at present was the amazing answer well talk about financial affairs a little later on  mr mangan metaphorically pinched himself he had known his present client even during his school days had received a great many visits from him at different times and could not remember one in which the question of finance had been dismissed in so casual a manner  i trust he observed chiefly for the sake of saying something that you are thinking of settling down here for a time now  i have finished with africa if that is what you mean was the somewhat grave reply as to settling down here well that depends a little upon what you have to tell me  the lawyer nodded  i think he said that you may make yourself quite easy as regards the matter of roger unthank nothing has ever been heard of him since the day you left england  hisbody has not been found  nor any trace of it  there was a brief silence the lawyer looked hard at dominey and dominey searchingly back again at the lawyer  and lady dominey the former asked at length  her ladyships condition is i believe unchanged was the somewhat guarded reply  if the circumstances are favourable dominey continued after another moments pause i think it very likely that i may decide to settle down at dominey hall  the lawyer appeared doubtful  i am afraid he said you will be very disappointed in the condition of the estate sir everard as i have repeatedly told you in our correspondence the rent roll after deducting your settlement upon lady dominey has at no time reached the interest on the mortgages and we have had to make up the difference and send you your allowance out of the proceeds of the outlying timber  that is a pity dominey replied with a frown i ought perhaps to have taken you more into my confidence by the by he added whenerabout when did you receive my last letter  your last letter mr mangan repeated we have not had the privilege of hearing from you sir everard for over four years the only intimation we had that our payments had reached you was the exceedingly prompt debit of the south african bank  i have certainly been to blame this unexpected visitor confessed on the other hand i have been very much absorbed if you havent happened to hear any south african gossip lately mangan i suppose it will be a surprise to you to hear that i have been making a good deal of money  making money the lawyer gasped you making money sir everard  i thought youd be surprised dominey observed coolly however thats neither here nor there the business object of my visit to you this morning is to ask you to make arrangements as quickly as possible for paying off the mortgages on the dominey estates  mr mangan was a lawyer of the newfashioned schoolharrow and cambridge the bath club racquets and fives rather than gold and lawn tennis instead of saying god bless my soul he exclaimed great scott dropped a very modernlooking eyeglass from his left eye and leaned back in his chair with his hands in his pockets  i have had three or four years of good luck his client continued i have made money in gold mines in diamond mines and in land i am afraid that if i had stayed out another year i should have descended altogether to the commonplace and come back a millionaire  my heartiest congratulations mr mangan found breath to murmur youll forgive my being so astonished but you are the first dominey i ever knew who has ever made a penny of money in any sort of way and from what i remember of you in englandim sure youll forgive my being so franki should never have expected you to have even attempted such a thing  dominey smiled goodhumouredly  well he said if you inquire at the united bank of africa you will find that i have a credit balance there of something over a hundred thousand pounds then i have alsowell let us say a trifle more invested in firstclass mines do me the favour of lunching with me mr mangan and although africa will never be a favourite topic of conversation with me i will tell you about some of my speculations  the solicitor groped around for his hat  i will send the boy for a taxi he faltered  i have a car outside this astonishing client told him before we leave could you instruct your clerk to have a list of the dominey mortgages made out with the terminable dates and redemption values  i will leave instructions mr mangan promised i think that the total amount is under eighty thousand pounds  dominey sauntered through the office an object of much interest to the little staff of clerks the lawyer joined him on the pavement in a few minutes  where shall we lunch dominey asked im afraid my clubs are a little out of date i am staying at the carlton  the carlton grill room is quite excellent mr mangan suggested  they are keeping me a table until halfpast one dominey replied we will lunch there by all means  they drove off together the returned traveller gazing all the time out of the window into the crowded streets the lawyer a little thoughtful  while i think of it sir everard the latter said as they drew near their destination i should be glad of a short conversation with you before you go down to dominey  with regard to anything in particular  with regard to lady dominey the lawyer told him a little gravely  a shadow rested on his companions face  is her ladyship very much changed  physically she is in excellent health i believe mentally i believe that there is no change she has unfortunately the same rather violent prejudice which i am afraid influenced your departure from england  in plain words dominey said bitterly she has sworn to take my life if ever i sleep under the same roof  she will need i am afraid to be strictly watched the lawyer answered evasively still i think you ought to be told that time does not seem to have lessened her tragical antipathy  she regards me still as the murderer of roger unthank dominey asked in a measured tone  i am afraid she does  and i suppose that every one else has the same idea  the mystery mr mangan admitted has never been cleared up it is well known you see that you fought in the park and that you staggered home almost senseless roger unthank has never been seen from that day to this  if i had killed him dominey pointed out why was his body not found  the lawyer shook his head  there are all sorts of theories of course he said but for one superstition you may as well be prepared there is scarcely a man or a woman for miles around dominey who doesnt believe that the ghost of roger unthank still haunts the black wood near where you fought  let us be quite clear about this dominey insisted if the body should ever be found am i liable after all these years to be indicted for manslaughter  i think you may make your mind quite at ease the lawyer assured him in the first place i dont think you would ever be indicted  and in the second  there isnt a human being in that part of norfolk would ever believe that the body of man or beast left within the shadow of the black wood would ever be seen or heard of again    chapter iv  mr mangan on their way into the grill room loitered for a few minutes in the small reception room chatting with some acquaintances whilst his host having spoken to the maitre dhotel and ordered a cocktail from a passing waiter stood with his hands behind his back watching the inflow of men and women with all that interest which one might be supposed to feel in ones fellows after a prolonged absence he had moved a little to one side to allow a party of young people to make their way through the crowded chamber when he was conscious of a woman standing alone on the topmost of the three thickly carpeted stairs their eyes met and hers which had been wandering around the room as though in search of some acquaintance seemed instantly and fervently held to the few loungers about the room ignorant of any special significance in that studied contemplation of the man on the part of the woman their two personalities presented an agreeable almost a fascinating study dominey was six feet two in height and had to its fullest extent the natural distinction of his class together with the half military half athletic bearing which seemed to have been so marvellously restored to him his complexion was no more than becomingly tanned his slight moustache trimmed very close to the upper lip was of the same ruddy brown shade as his sleekly brushed hair the woman who had commenced now to move slowly towards him save that her cheeks at that moment at any rate were almost unnaturally pale was of the same colouring her redgold hair gleamed beneath her black hat she was tall a grecian type of figure large without being coarse majestic though still young she carried a little dog under one arm and a plain black silk bag on which was a coronet in platinum and diamonds in the other hand the majordomo who presided over the room watching her approach bowed with more than his usual urbanity her eyes however were still fixed upon the person who had engaged so large a share of her attention she came towards him her lips a little parted  leopold she faltered the holy saints why did you not let me know  dominey bowed very slightly his words seemed to have a cut and dried flavour  i am so sorry he replied but i fear that you make a mistake my name is not leopold  she stood quite still looking at him with the air of not having heard a word of his polite disclaimer  in london of all places she murmured tell me what does it mean  i can only repeat madam he said that to my very great regret i have not the honour of your acquaintance  she was puzzled but absolutely unconvinced  you mean to deny that you are leopold von ragastein she asked incredulously you do not know me  madam he answered it is not my great pleasure my name is domineyeverard dominey  she seemed for a moment to be struggling with some embarrassment which approached emotion then she laid her fingers upon his sleeve and drew him to a more retired corner of the little apartment  leopold she whispered nothing can make it wrong or indiscreet for you to visit me my address is 17 belgrave square i desire to see you tonight at seven oclock  but my dear lady dominey began  her eyes suddenly glowed with a new light  i will not be trifled with she insisted if you wish to succeed in whatever scheme you have on hand you must not make an enemy of me i shall expect you at seven oclock  she passed away from him into the restaurant mr mangan now freed from his friends rejoined his host and the two men took their places at the side table to which they were ushered with many signs of attention  wasnt that the princess eiderstrom with whom you were talking the solicitor asked curiously  a lady addressed me by mistake dominey explained she mistook me curiously enough for a man who used to be called my double at oxford sigismund devinter he was then although i think he came into a title later on  the princess is quite a famous personage mr mangan remarked one of the richest widows in europe her husband was killed in a duel some six or seven years ago  dominey ordered the luncheon with care slipping into a word or two of german once to assist the waiter who spoke english with difficulty his companion smiled  i see that you have not forgotten your languages out there in the wilds  i had no chance to dominey answered i spent five years on the borders of german east africa and i traded with some of the fellows there regularly  by the by mr mangan enquired what sort of terms are we on with the germans out there  excellent i should think was the careless reply i never had any trouble  of course the lawyer continued this will all be new to you but during the last few years englishmen have become divided into two classesthe people who believe that the germans wish to go to war and crush us and those who dont  then since my return the number of the donts has been increased by one  i am amongst the doubtfuls myself mr mangan remarked all the same i cant quite see what germany wants with such an immense army and why she is continually adding to her fleet  dominey paused for a moment to discuss the matter of a sauce with the head waiter he returned to the subject a few minutes later on however  of course he pointed out my opinions can only come from a study of the newspapers and from conversations with such germans as i have met out in africa but so far as her army is concerned i should have said that russia and france were responsible for that and the more powerful it is the less chance of any european conflagration russia might at any time come to the conclusion that a war is her only salvation against a revolution and you know the feeling in france about alsacelorraine as well as i do the germans themselves say that there is more interest in military matters and more progress being made in russia today than ever before  i have no doubt that you are right agreed mr mangan it is a matter which is being a great deal discussed just now however let us speak of your personal plans what do you intend to do for the next few weeks say have you been to see any of your relatives yet  not one dominey replied i am afraid that i am not altogether keen about making advances  mr mangan coughed you must remember that during the period of your last residence in london he said you were in a state of chronic impecuniosity no doubt that rather affected the attitude of some of those who would otherwise have been more friendly  i should be perfectly content never to see one of them again declared dominey with perfect truth  that of course is impossible the lawyer protested you must go and see the duchess at any rate she was always your champion  the duchess was always very kind to me dominey admitted doubtfully but i am afraid she was rather fed up before i left england  mr mangan smiled he was enjoying a very excellent lunch which it seemed hard to believe was ordered by a man just home from the wilds of africa and he thoroughly enjoyed talking about duchesses  her grace he began  well  the lawyer had paused with his eyes glued upon the couple at a neighbouring table he leaned across towards his companion  the duchess herself sir everard just behind you with lord st omar  this place must certainly be the rendezvous of all the world dominey declared as he held out his hand to a man who had approached their table seaman my friend welcome let me introduce you to my friend and legal adviser mr manganmr seaman  mr seaman was a short fat man immaculately dressed in most conventional morning attire he was almost bald except for a little tuft on either side and a few long fair hairs carefully brushed back over a shining scalp his face was extraordinarily round except towards his chin where it came to a point his eyes bright and keen his mouth the mouth of a professional humourist he shook hands with the lawyer with an empressement which was scarcely english  within the space of half an hour dominey continued i find a princess who desires to claim my acquaintance a cousin he dropped his voice a little who lunches only a few tables away and the man of whom i have seen the most during the last ten years amidst scenes a little different from these eh seaman  seaman accepted the chair which the waiter had brought and sat down the lawyer was immediately interested  do i understand then he asked addressing the newcomer that you knew sir everard in africa  seaman beamed knew him he repeated and with the first words of his speech the fact of his foreign nationality was established there was no one of whom i knew so much we did business togethera great deal of businessand when we were not partners sir everard generally got the best of it  dominey laughed luck generally comes to a man either early or late in life my luck came late i think seaman that you must have been my mascot nothing went wrong with me during the years that we did business together  seaman was a little excited he brushed upright with the palm of his hand one of those little tufts of hair left on the side of his head and he laid his plump fingers upon the lawyers shoulder  mr mangan he said you listen to me i sell this man the controlling interests in a mine shares which i have held for four and a half years and never drew a penny dividend i sell them to him i say at par well i need the money and it seems to me that i had given the shares a fair chance within five weeksfive weeks sir he repeated struggling to attune his voice to his civilised surroundings those shares had gone from par to fourteen and a half today they stand at twenty he gave me five thousand pounds for those shares today he could walk into your stock market and sell them for one hundred thousand that is the way money is made in africa mr mangan where innocents like me are to be found every day  dominey poured out a glass of wine and passed it to their visitor  come he said we all have our ups and downs africa owes you nothing seaman  i have done well in my small way seaman admitted fingering the stem of his wineglass but where i have had to plod sir everard here has stood and commanded fate to pour her treasures into his lap  the lawyer was listening with a curious interest and pleasure to this half bantering conversation he found an opportunity now to intervene  so you two were really friends in africa he remarked with a queer and almost inexplicable sense of relief  if sir everard permits our association to be so called seaman replied we have done business together in the great citiesin johannesburg and pretoria in kimberley and cape townand we have prospected together in the wild places we have trekked the veldt and been lost to the world for many months at a time we have seen the real wonders of africa together as well as her tawdry civilisation  and you too mr mangan asked have you retired  seamans smile was almost beatific  the same deal he said which brought sir everards fortune to wonderful figures brought me that modest sum which i had sworn to reach before i returned to england it is true i have retired from moneymaking it is now that i take up again my real lifes work  if you are going to talk about your hobby dominey observed you had better order them to serve your lunch here  i had finished my lunch before you came in his friend replied i drink another glass of wine with you perhaps afterwards a liqueurwho can say in this climate one is favoured one can drink freely sir everard and i mr mangan have been in places where thirst is a thing to be struggled against where for months a little weak brandy and water was our chief dissipation  tell me about this hobby the lawyer enquired  dominey intervened promptly i protest if he begins to talk of that hell be here all the afternoon  seaman held out his hands and rolled his head from side to side  but i am not so unreasonable he objected just one wordso very well then he proceeded quickly with the air of one fearing interruption this must be clear to you mr mangan i am a german by birth naturalised in england for the sake of my business loving germany grateful to england one third of my life i have lived in berlin one third at forest hill here in london and in the city one third in africa i have watched the growth of commercial rivalries and jealousies between the two nations there is no need for them they might lead to worse things i would brush them all away my aim is to encourage a league for the promotion of more cordial social and business relations between the people of great britain and the people of the german empire there have i wasted much of your time can i not speak of my hobby without a flood of words  conciseness itself mangan admitted and i compliment you most heartily upon your scheme if you can get the right people into it it should prove a most valuable society  in germany i have the right people all germans who live for their country and feel for their country loathe the thought of war we want peace we want friends and to speak as man to man he concluded tapping the lawyer upon the coat sleeve england is our best customer  i wish one could believe the latter remarked that yours was the popular voice in your country  seaman rose reluctantly to his feet  at halfpast two he announced glancing at his watch i have an appointment with a woollen manufacturer from bradford i hope to get him to join my council  he bowed ceremoniously to the lawyer nodded to dominey with the familiarity of an old friend and made his bustling goodhumoured way out of the room  a sound business man i should think was the formers comment i wish him luck with his league you yourself sir everard will need to develop some new interests why not politics  i really expect to find life a little difficult at first admitted dominey with a shrug of his shoulders i have lost many of the tastes of my youth and i am very much afraid that my friends over here will call me colonial i cant fancy myself doing nothing down in norfolk all the rest of my days perhaps i shall go into parliament  you must forgive my saying his companion declared impulsively that i never knew ten years make such a difference in a man in my life  the colonies dominey pronounced are a kill or cure sort of business you either take your drubbing and come out a stronger man or you go under i had the very narrowest escape from going under myself but i just pulled together in time today i wouldnt have been without my hard times for anything in the world  if you will permit me mr mangan said with an inherited pomposity on our first meeting under the new conditions i should like to offer you my hearty congratulations not only upon what you have accomplished but upon what you have become  and also i hope dominey rejoined smiling a little seriously and with a curious glint in his eyes upon what i may yet accomplish  the duchess and her companion had risen to their feet and the former on her way out recognising her solicitor paused graciously  how do you do mr mangan she said i hope you are looking after those troublesome tenants of mine in leicestershire  we shall make our report in due course duchess mangan assured her will you permit me he added to bring back to your memory a relative who has just returned from abroadsir everard dominey  dominey had risen to his feet a moment previously and now extended his hand the duchess who was a tall graceful woman with masses of fair hair only faintly interspersed with gray very fine brown eyes the complexion of a girl and to quite her own confession the manners of a kitchen maid stared at him for a moment without any response  sir everard dominey she repeated everard ridiculous  domineys extended hand was at once withdrawn and the tentative smile faded from his lips the lawyer plunged into the breach  i can assure your grace he insisted earnestly that there is no doubt whatever about sir everards identity he only returned from africa during the last few days  the duchesss incredulity remained wholly goodnatured but ministered to by her natural obstinacy  i simply cannot bring myself to believe it she declared come ill challenge you when did we meet last  at worcester house was the prompt reply i came to say goodbye to you  the duchess was a little staggered her eyes softened a faint smile played at the corners of her lips she was suddenly a very attractive looking woman  you came to say goodbye she repeated and  i am to take that as a challenge dominey asked standing very upright and looking her in the eyes  as you will  you were a little kinder to me he continued than you are today you gave methis he added drawing a small picture from his pocketbook and you permitted  for heavens sake put that thing away she cried and dont say another word theres my grownup nephew st omar paying his bill almost within earshot come and see me at halfpast three this afternoon and dont be a minute late and st omar she went on turning to the young man who stood now by her side this is a connection of yourssir everard dominey he is a terrible person but do shake hands with him and come along i am half an hour late for my dressmaker already  lord st omar chuckled vaguely then shook hands with his newfound relative nodded affably to the lawyer and followed his aunt out of the room mangans expression was beatific  sir everard he exclaimed god bless you if ever a woman got what she deserved ive seen a duchess blushfirst time in my life    chapter v  worcester house was one of those semipalatial residences set down apparently for no reason whatever in the middle of regents park it had been acquired by a former duke at the instigation of the regent who was his intimate friend and retained by later generations in mute protest against the disfiguring edifices which had made a millionaires highway of park lane dominey who was first scrutinised by an individual in buff waistcoat and silk hat at the porters lodge was interviewed by a majordomo in the great stone hall conducted through an extraordinarily victorian drawingroom by another myrmidon in a buff waistcoat and finally ushered into a tiny little boudoir leading out of a larger apartment and terminating in a conservatory filled with sweetsmelling exotics the duchess who was reclining in an easychair held out her hand which her visitor raised to his lips she motioned him to a seat by her side and once more scrutinised him with unabashed intentness  theres something wrong about you you know she declared  that seems very unfortunate he rejoined when i return to find you wholly unchanged  not bad she remarked critically all the same i have changed i am not in the least in love with you any longer  it was the fear of that change in you he sighed which kept me for so long in the furthest corners of the world  she looked at him with a severity which was obviously assumed  look here she said it is better for us to have a perfectly clear understanding upon one point i know the exact position of your affairs and i know too that the two hundred a year which your lawyer has been sending out to you came partly out of a few old trees and partly out of his own pocket how you are going to live over here i cannot imagine but it isnt the least use expecting henry to do a thing for you the poor man has scarcely enough pocket money to pay his travelling expenses when he goes lecturing  lecturing dominey repeated whats happened to poor henry  my husband is an exceedingly conscientious man was the dignified reply he goes from town to town with lord roberts and a secretary lecturing on national defence  dear henry was always a little cranky wasnt he dominey observed let me put your mind at rest on that other matter though caroline i can assure you that i have come back to england not to borrow money but to spend it  his cousin shook her head mournfully and a few minutes ago i was nearly observing that you had lost your sense of humour  i am in earnest he persisted africa has turned out to be my eldorado quite unexpectedly i must admit i came in for a considerable sum of money towards the end of my stay there i am paying off the mortgages at dominey at once and i want henry to jot down on paper at once those few amounts he was good enough to lend me in the old days  caroline duchess of worcester sat perfectly still for a moment with her mouth open a condition which was entirely natural but unbecoming  and you mean to tell me that you really are everard dominey she exclaimed  the weight of evidence is rather that way he murmured  he moved his chair deliberately a little nearer took her hand and raised it to his lips her face was perilously near to his she drew a little backand too abruptly  my dear everard she whispered henry is in the house besidesyes i suppose you must be everard just now there was something in your eyes exactly like his but you are so stiff have you been drilling out there or anything  he shook his head  one spends half ones time in the saddle  and you are really well off she asked again wonderingly  if i had stayed there another year he replied and been able to marry a dutch jewess i should have qualified for park lane  she sighed  its too wonderful henry will love having his money back  and you  she looked positively distressed  youve lost all your manners she complained you make love like a garden rake you should have leaned towards me with a quiver in your voice when you said those last two words and instead of that you look as though you were sitting at attention with a positive glint of steel in your eyes  one sees a woman once in a blue moon out there he pleaded  she shook her head youve changed it was a sixth sense with you to make love in exactly the right tone to say exactly the right thing in the right manner  i shall pick it up he declared hopefully with a little assistance  she made a little grimace  you wont want an old woman like me to assist you everard youll have the town at your feet youll be able to frivol with musical comedy flirt with our married beauties orim sorry everard i forgot  you forgot what he asked steadfastly  i forgot the tragedy which finally drove you abroad i forgot your marriage is there any change in your wife  not much i am afraid  and mr manganhe thinks that you are safe over here  perfectly  she looked at him earnestly perhaps she had never admitted even to herself how fond she had been of this scapegrace cousin  youll find that no one will have a word to say against you she told him now that you are wealthy and regenerate theyll forget everything you want them to when will you come and dine here and meet all your relatives  whenever you are kind enough to ask me he answered i thought of going down to dominey tomorrow  she looked at him with a new thing in her eyessomething of fear something too of admiration  butyour wife  she is there i believe he said i cannot help it i have been an exile from my home long enough  dont go she begged suddenly why not be brave and have her removed i know how tenderhearted you are but you have your future and your career to consider for her sake too you ought not to give her the opportunity  dominey could never make up his mind whether the interruption which came at that moment was welcome or otherwise caroline suddenly broke off in her speech and glanced warningly towards the larger room a tall greyhaired man dressed in oldfashioned clothes and wearing a pincenez had lifted the curtains he addressed the duchess in a thin reedy voice  my dear caroline he beganah you must forgive me i did not know that you were engaged we will not stay but i should like to present to you a young friend of mine who is going to help me at the meeting this evening  do bring him in his wife replied her voice once more attuned to its natural drawl and i have a surprise for you too henrya very great surprise i think you will find it  dominey rose to his feeta tall commanding figureand stood waiting the approach of the newcomer the duke advanced looking at him enquiringly a young man very obviously a soldier in mufti was hovering in the background  i must plead guilty to the surprise the duke confessed courteously there is something exceedingly familiar about your face sir but i cannot remember having had the privilege of meeting you  you see caroline observed i am not the only one everard who did not accept you upon a glance this is everard dominey henry returned from foreign exile and regenerated in every sense of the word  how do you do dominey said holding out his hand i seem to be rather a surprise to every one but i hope you havent quite forgotten me  god bless my soul the duke exclaimed you dont mean to say that youre really everard dominey  i am he beyond a doubt was the calm assurance  most amazing the duke declared as he shook hands most amazing i never saw such a change in my life yes yes i seesame complexion of coursenose and eyesyes yes but you seem taller and you carry yourself like a soldier dear dear me africa has done wonderfully by you delighted my dear everard delighted  youll be more delighted still when you hear the rest of the news his wife remarked drily in the meantime do present your friend  precisely so the duke acquiesced turning to the young man in the background most sorry my dear captain bartram the unexpected return of a connection of my wife must be my apology for this lapse of manners let me present you to the duchess captain bartram is just back from germany my dear and is an enthusiastic supporter of our causesir everard dominey  caroline shook hands kindly with her husbands protege and dominey exchanged a solemn handshake with him  you too are one of those then captain bartram who are convinced that germany has evil designs upon us the former said smiling  i have just returned from germany after twelve months stay there the young soldier replied i went with an open mind i have come back convinced that we shall be at war with germany within a couple of years  the duke nodded vigorously  our young friend is right he declared three times a week for many months i have been drumming the fact into the handful of woodenheaded englishmen who have deigned to come to our meetings i have made myself a nuisance to the house of lords and the press it is a terrible thing to realise how hard it is to make an englishman reflect so long as he is making money and having a good timeyou are just back from africa everard  within a week sir  did you see anything of the germans out there were you anywhere near their colony  i have been in touch with them for some years dominey replied  most interesting his questioner exclaimed you may be of service to us everard you may indeed now tell me isnt it true that they have secret agents out there trying to provoke unsettlement and disquiet amongst the boers isnt it true that they apprehend a war with england before very long and are determined to stir up the colony against us  i am very sorry dominey replied but i am not a politician in any shape or form all the germans whom i have met out there seem a most peaceful race of men and there doesnt seem to be the slightest discontent amongst the boers or any one else  the dukes face fell this is very surprising  the only people who seem to have any cause for discontent dominey continued are the english settlers i didnt commence to do any good myself there till a few years ago but i have heard some queer stories about the way our own people were treated after the war  what you say about south africa sir everard the young soldier remarked is naturally interesting but i am bound to say that it is in direct opposition to all i have heard  and i the duke echoed fervently  i have lived there for the last eleven years dominey continued and although i spent the earlier part of that time trekking after big game lately i am bound to confess that every thought and energy i possess have been centered upon moneymaking for that reason perhaps my observations may have been at fault i shall claim the privilege of coming to one of your first meetings duke and of trying to understand this question  his august connection blinked at him a little curiously for a moment behind his glasses  my dear everard he said forgive my remarking it but i find you more changed than i could have believed possible  everard is changed in more ways than one his wife observed with faint irony  dominey who had risen to leave bent over her hand  what about my dinner party sir she added  as soon as i return from norfolk he replied  dominey hall will really find you she asked a little curiously  most certainly  there was again that little flutter of fear in her eyes followed by a momentary flash of admiration dominey shook hands gravely with his host and nodded to bertram the servant whom the duchess had summoned stood holding the curtains on one side  i shall hope to see you again shortly duke dominey said as he completed his leavetaking there is a little matter of business to be adjusted between us you will probably hear from mr mangan in a day or two  the duke gazed after the retreating figure of this very amazing visitor when the curtains had fallen he turned to his wife  a little matter of business he repeated i hope you have explained to everard my dear that although of course we are very glad to see him back again it is absolutely hopeless for him to look to me for any financial assistance at the present moment  caroline smiled  everard was alluding to the money he already owes you she explained he intends to repay it at once he is also paying off the dominey mortgages he has apparently made a fortune in africa  the duke collapsed into an easychair  everard pay his debts he exclaimed everard dominey pay off the mortgages  that is what i understand his wife acquiesced  the duke clutched at the last refuge of a weak but obstinate man his mouth came together like a rattrap  theres something wrong about it somewhere he declared    chapter vi  dominey spent a very impatient hour that evening in his sittingroom at the carlton waiting for seaman it was not until nearly seven that the latter appeared  are you aware dominey asked him that i am expected to call upon the princess eiderstrom at seven oclock  i have your word for it seaman replied but i see no tragedy in the situation the princess is a woman of sense and a woman of political insight while i cannot recommend you to take her entirely into your confidence i still think that a middle course can be judiciously pursued  rubbish dominey exclaimed as leopold von ragastein the princess has indisputable claims upon me and my liberty claims which would altogether interfere with the career of everard dominey  with methodical neatness seaman laid his hat gloves and walking stick upon the sideboard he then looked into the connecting bedroom closed and fastened the door and extended himself in an easychair  sit opposite to me my friend he said we will talk together  dominey obeyed a little sullenly his companion however ignored his demeanour  now my friend he said beating upon the palm of one hand with the forefinger of his other i am a man of commerce and i do things in a business way let us take stock of our position three months ago this very week we met by appointment at a certain hotel in cape town  only three months dominey muttered  we were unknown to one another seaman continued i had only heard of the baron von ragastein as a devoted german citizen and patriot engaged in an important enterprise in east africa by special intercession of the kaiser on account of a certain unfortunate happening in hungary  i killed a man in a duel dominey said slowly with his eyes fixed upon his companions it was not an unforgivable act  there are duels and duels a fight between two young men in defence of the honour of or to gain the favour of a young lady in their own station of life has never been against the conventions of the court on the other hand to become the lover of the wife of one of the greatest nobles in hungary and to secure possession by killing the husband in the duel which his honour makes a necessity is looked upon very differently  i had no wish to kill the prince dominey protested nor was it at my desire that we met at all the prince fought like a madman and slipped after a wild lunge on to the point of my stationary sword  let that pass seaman said i am not of your order and i probably do not understand the etiquette of these matters i simply look upon you as a culprit in the eyes of our master and i feel that he has a right to demand from you much in the way of personal sacrifice  perhaps you will tell me dominey demanded what more he would have i have spent weary years in a godless and feverridden country raising up for our arms a great troop of natives i have undertaken other political commissions in the colony which may bear fruit i am to take up the work for which i was originally intended for which i was given an english education i am to repair to england and under such identity as i might assume after consultation with you at cape town i am to render myself so far as possible a persona grata in that country i do not wait for our meeting i see a great chance and i make use of it i transform myself into an english country gentleman and i think you will admit that i have done so with great success  all that you say is granted seaman agreed you met me at cape town in your new identity and you certainly seemed to wear it wonderfully you have made it uncommonly expensive but we do not grudge money  i could not return home to a povertystricken domain dominey pointed out i should have held no place whatever in english social life and i should have received no welcome from those with whom i imagine you desire me to stand well  again i make no complaints seaman declared there is no bottom to our purse nor any stint neither must there be any stint to our loyalty he added gravely  in this instance dominey protested it is not a matter of loyalty everard dominey cannot throw himself at the feet of the princess eiderstrom wellknown to be one of the most passionate women in europe whilst her love affair with leopold von ragastein is still remembered remember that the question of our identities might crop up any day we were friends over here in england at school and at college and there are many who still remember the likeness between us perfectly though i may play my part here and there there may be doubts there will be doubts no longer if i am to be dragged at the chariot wheels of the princess  seaman was silent for a moment  there is reason in what you say he admitted presently it is for a few months only what is your proposition  that you see the princess in my place at once dominey suggested eagerly point out to her that for the present for political reasons i am and must remain everard dominey to her as to the rest of the world let her be content with such measure of friendship and admiration as sir everard dominey might reasonably offer to a beautiful woman whom he met today for the first time and i am entirely and with all my heart at her service but let her remember that even between us two in the solitude of her room as in the drawingroom where we might meet it can be everard dominey only until my mission is ended you think perhaps that i lay unnecessary stress upon this i do not i know the princess and i know myself  seaman glanced at the clock at what hour was your appointment  it was not an appointment it was a command dominey replied i was told to be at belgrave square at seven oclock  i will have an understanding with the princess promised seaman as he took up his hat dine with me downstairs at eight oclock on my return    dominey descending about an hour later found his friend seaman already established at a small faraway table set in one of the recesses of the grill room he was welcomed with a little wave of the hand and cocktails were at once ordered  i have done your errand seaman announced since my visit i am bound to admit that i realise a little more fully your anxiety  you probably had not met the princess before  i had not i must confess that i found her a lady of somewhat overpowering temperament i fancy my young friend seaman continued with a twitch at the corner of his lips that somewhere about august next year you will find your hands full  august next year can take care of itself was the cool reply  in the meantime seaman continued the princess understands the situation and is i think impressed she will at any rate do nothing rash you and she will meet within the course of the next few hours but on reasonable terms to proceed as i drove back here after my interview with the princess i decided that it was time you made the acquaintance of the person who is chiefly responsible for your presence here  terniloff  precisely you have maintained my young friend seaman went on after a brief pause during which one waiter had brought their cocktails and another received their order for dinner a very discreet and laudable silence with regard to those further instructions which were promised to you immediately you should arrive in london those instructions will never be committed to writing they are here  seaman touched his forehead and drained the remaining contents of his glass  my instructions are to trust you absolutely dominey observed and until the greater events stir to concentrate the greater part of my energies in leading the natural life of the man whose name and place i have taken  quite so seaman acquiesced  he glanced around the room for a moment or two as though interested in the people satisfied at last that there was no chance of being overheard he continued  the first idea you have to get out of your head my dear friend if it is there is that you are a spy you are nothing of the sort you are not connected with our remarkably perfect system of espionage in the slightest degree you are a free agent in all that you may choose to say or do you can believe in germany or fear herwhichever you like you can join your cousins husband in his crusade for national service or you can join me in my efforts to cement the bonds of friendship and affection between the citizens of the two countries we really do not care in the least choose your own part give yourself thoroughly into the life of sir everard dominey baronet of dominey hall norfolk and pursue exactly the course which you think sir everard himself would be likely to take  this dominey admitted is very broadminded  it is common sense was the prompt reply with all your ability you could not in six months time appreciably affect the position either way therefore we choose to have you concentrate the whole of your energies upon one task and one task only if there is anything of the spy about your mission here it is not england or the english which are to engage your attention we require you to concentrate wholly and entirely upon terniloff  dominey was startled  terniloff he repeated i expected to work with him but  empty your mind of all preconceived ideas seaman enjoined what your duties are with regard to terniloff will grow upon you gradually as the situation develops  as yet dominey remarked i have not even made his acquaintance  i was on the point of telling you earlier in our conversation that i have made an appointment for you to see him at eleven oclock tonight at the embassy you will go to him at that hour remember you know nothing you are waiting for instructions let speech remain with him alone be particularly careful not to drop him a hint of your knowledge of what is coming you will find him absolutely satisfied with the situation absolutely content take care not to disturb him he is a missioner of peace so are you  i begin to understand dominey said thoughtfully  you shall understand everything when the time comes for you to take a hand seaman promised and do not in your zeal forget my friend that your utility to our great cause will depend largely upon your being able to establish and maintain your position as an english gentleman so far all has gone well  perfectly so far as i am concerned dominey replied you must remember though that there is your end to keep up berlin will be receiving frantic messages from east africa as to my disappearance not even my immediate associates were in the secret  that is all understood seaman assured his companion a little doctor named schmidt has spent many marks of the government money in frantic cables you must have endeared yourself to him  he was a very faithful associate  he has been a very troublesome friend it seems that the natives got their stories rather mixed up concerning your namesake who apparently died in the bush and schmidt continually emphasised your promise to let him hear from cape town however all this has been dealt with satisfactorily the only real dangers are over here and so far you seem to have encountered the principal ones  i have at any rate been accepted dominey declared by my nearest living relative and incidentally i have discovered the one farseeing person in england who knows what is in store for us  seaman was momentarily anxious  whom do you mean  the duke of worcester my cousins husband of whom you were speaking just now  the little mans face relaxed  he reminds me of the geese who saved the capitol he said a brainless man obsessed with one idea it is queer how often these fanatics discover the truth that reminds me he added taking a small memorandum book from his waistcoat pocket and glancing it through his grace has a meeting tonight at the holborn town hall i shall make one of my usual interruptions  if he has so small a following why dont you leave him alone dominey enquired  there are others associated with him was the placid reply who are not so insignificant besides when i interrupt i advertise my own little hobby  thesewe english are strange people dominey remarked glancing around the room after a brief but thoughtful pause we advertise and boast about our colossal wealth and yet we are incapable of the slightest selfsacrifice in order to preserve it one would have imagined that our philosophers our historians would warn us in irresistible terms by unanswerable scientific deduction of what was coming  my compliments to your pronouns seaman murmured with a little bow apropos of what you were saying you will never make an englishmani beg your pardon one of your countrymenrealise anything unpleasant he prefers to keep his head comfortably down in the sand but to leave generalities when do you think of going to norfolk  within the next few days dominey replied  i shall breathe more freely when you are securely established there his companion declared great things wait upon your complete acceptance in the country as well as in town as sir everard dominey you are sure that you perfectly understand your position there as regards yourerdomestic affairs  i understand all that is necessary was the somewhat stiff reply  all that is necessary is not enough seaman rejoined irritably i thought that you had wormed the whole story out of that drunken englishman  he told me most of it there were just one or two points which lay beyond the limits where questioning was possible  seaman frowned angrily  in other words he complained you remembered that you were a gentleman and not that you were a german  the englishman of a certain order dominey pronounced even though he be degenerate has a certain obstinacy generally connected with one particular thing which nothing can break we talked together on that last night until morning we drank wine and brandy i tore the story of my own exile from my breast and laid it bare before him yet i knew all the time as i know now that he kept something back  there was a brief pause during the last few minutes a certain tension had crept in between the two men with it their personal characteristics seemed to have become intensified dominey was more than ever the aristocrat seaman the plebian schemer unabashed and desperately in earnest he leaned presently a little way across the table his eyes had narrowed but they were as bright as steel his teeth were more prominent than usual  you should have dragged it from his throat he insisted it is not your duty to nurse fine personal feelings heart and soul you stand pledged to great things i cannot at this moment give you any idea what you may not mean to us after the trouble has come if you are able to play your part still in this country as everard dominey of dominey hall i know well enough that the sense of personal honour amongst the prussian aristocracy is the finest in the world and yet there is not a single man of your order who should not be prepared to lie or cheat for his countrys sake you must fall into line with your fellows once more it is not only your task with regard to terniloff which makes your recognition as everard dominey so important to us it is the things which are to come latercome enough of this subject i know that you understand we grow too serious how shall you spend your evening until eleven oclock remember you did not leave england an anchorite sir everard you must have your amusements why not try a music hall  my mind is too full of other things dominey objected  then come with me to holborn the little man suggested it will amuse you we will part at the door and you shall sit at the back of the hall out of sight you shall hear the haunting eloquence of your cousininlaw you shall hear him trying to warn the men and women of england of the danger awaiting them from the great and rapacious german nation what do you say  i will come dominey replied in spiritless fashion it will be better than a music hall at any rate i am not at all sure seaman that the hardest part of my task over here will not be this necessity for selfimposed amusements  his companion struck the table gently but impatiently with his clenched fist  man you are young he exclaimed you are like the rest of us you carry your life in your hands dont nourish past griefs cast the memory of them away theres nothing which narrows a man more than morbidness you have a past which may sometimes bring the ghosts around you but remember the sin was not wholly yours and there is an atonement which in measured fashion you may commence whenever you please i have said enough about that greatness and gaiety go hand in hand there you see i was a philosopher before i became a professor of propaganda good you smile that is something gained at any rate now we will take a taxicab to holborn and i will show you something really humorous  at the entrance to the town hall the two men at seamans instigation parted making their way inside by different doors dominey found a retired seat under a balcony where he was unlikely to be recognised from the platform seaman on the other hand took up a more prominent position at the end of one of the front rows of benches the meeting was by no means overcrowded overenthusiastic overanything there were rows of empty benches a good many young couples who seemed to have come in for shelter from the inclement night a few sturdy respectablelooking tradesmen who had come because it seemed to be the respectable thing to do a few genuinely interested and here and there although they were decidedly in the minority a sprinkling of enthusiasts on the platform was the duke with civic dignitaries on either side of him a distinguished soldier a member of parliament a halfdozen or so of nondescript residents from the neighbourhood and captain bartram the meeting was on the point of commencement as dominey settled down in his corner  first of all the duke rose and in a few hackneyed but earnest sentences introduced his young friend captain bartram the latter who sprang at once into the middle of his subject was nervous and more than a little bitter he explained that he had resigned his commission and was therefore free to speak his mind he spoke of enormous military preparations in germany and a general air of tense expectation against whom were these preparations without an earthly doubt against germanys greatest rival whose millions of young men even in this hour of danger preferred playing or watching football or cricket on saturday afternoons to realising their duty the conclusion of an illpointed but earnest speech was punctuated by the furtive entrance into the hall of a small boy selling evening newspapers and there was a temporary diversion from any interest in the proceedings on the part of the younger portion of the audience whilst they satisfied themselves as to the result of various cup ties the member of parliament then descended upon them in a whirlwind of oratory and in his best house of commons style he spoke of black clouds and of the cold breeze that went before the coming thunderstorm he pointed to the collapse of every great nation throughout history who had neglected the arts of selfdefence he appealed to the youth of the nation to prepare themselves to guard their womenkind their homes the sacred soil of their country and at that point was interrupted by a drowsy member of the audience with stentorian lungs who seemed just at that moment to have waked up  what about the navy guvnor  the orator swept upon the interrupter in his famous platform manner the navy he declared could be trusted at all times to do its duty but it could not fight on sea and land would the young man who had just interrupted do his and enroll his name for drill and national service that eveningand so on the distinguished soldier who was suffering from a cold fired off a few husky sentences only to the tune of rounds of applause the proceedings were wound up by the duke who was obviously with the exception of the distinguished soldier much more in earnest than any of them and secured upon the whole a respectful attention he brought in a few historical allusions pleaded for a greater spirit of earnestness and citizenship amongst the men of the country appealed even to the women to develop their sense of responsibility and sat down amidst a little burst of quite enthusiastic applausethe vote of thanks to the chairman was on the point of being proposed when mr seaman standing up in his place appealed to the chairman for permission to say a few words the duke who had had some experience with mr seaman before looked at him severely but the smile with which mr seaman looked around upon the audience was so goodnatured and attractive that he had no alternative but to assent seaman scrambled up the steps on to the platform coughed apologetically bowed to the duke and took possession of the meeting after a word or two of compliment to the chairman he made his confession he was a german citizenhe was indeed one of that bloodthirsty race some laughter he was also and it was his excuse for standing there the founder and secretary of a league doubtless well known to them a league for promoting more friendly relations between the business men of germany and england some of the remarks which he had heard that evening had pained him deeply business often took him to germany and as a german he would be doing less than his duty if he did not stand up there and tell them that the average german loved the englishman like a brother that the object of his life was to come into greater kinship with him that germany even at that moment was standing with hand outstretched to her relatives across the north sea begging for a deeper sympathy begging for a larger understanding applause from the audience murmurs of dissent from the platform and as to those military preparations of which they had heard so much with a severe glance at captain bartram let them glance for one moment at the frontiers of germany let them realise that eastwards germany was being continually pressed by an ancient and historic foe of enormous strength he would not waste their time telling them of the political difficulties which germany had had to face during the last generation he would simply tell them this great truththe foe for whom germany was obliged to make these great military preparations was russia if ever they were used it would be against russia and at russias instigationin his humble way he was striving for the betterment of relations between the dearly beloved country of his birth and the equally beloved country of his adoption such meetings as these instituted as it seemed to him for the propagation of unfair and unjustified suspicions were one of the greatest difficulties in his way he could not for a moment doubt that these gentlemen upon the platform were patriots they would prove it more profitably both to themselves and their country if they abandoned their present prejudiced and harmful campaign and became patrons of his society  seamans little bow to the chairman was goodhumoured tolerant a little wistful the dukes few words prefaced by an indignant protest against the intrusion of a german propagandist into an english patriotic meeting did nothing to undo the effect produced by this undesired stranger when the meeting broke up it was doubtful whether a single adherent had been gained to the cause of national service the duke went home full of wrath and seaman chuckled with genuine merriment as he stepped into the taxi which dominey had secured at the corner of the street  i promised you entertainment he observed confess that i have kept my word  dominey smiled enigmatically you certainly succeeded in making fools of a number of respectable and wellmeaning men  the miracle of it extends further seaman agreed tonight in its small way is a supreme example of the transcendental follies of democracy england is being slowly choked and strangled with too much liberty she is like a child being overfed with jam imagine in our dear country an englishman being allowed to mount the platform and spout undisturbed english propaganda in deadly opposition to german interests the socalled liberty of the englishman is like the cuckoo in his political nest countries must be governed they cannot govern themselves the time of war will prove all that  yet in any great crisis of a nations history dominey queried surely there is safety in a multitude of counsellors  there would be always a multitude of counsellors seaman replied in germany as in england the trouble for this country is that they would be all expressed publicly and in the press each view would have its adherents and the government be split up into factions in germany the real destinies of the country are decided in secret there are counsellors there too earnest and wise counsellors but no one knows their varying views all that one learns is the result spoken through the lips of the kaiser spoken once and for all  dominey was showing signs of a rare interest in his companions conversation his eyes were bright his usually impassive features seemed to have become more mobile and strained he laid his hand on seamans arm  listen he said we are in london alone in a taxicab secure against any possible eavesdropping you preach the advantage of our kaiserled country do you really believe that the kaiser is the man for the task which is coming  seamans narrow eyes glittered he looked at his companion in satisfaction his forehead was puckered his eternal smile gone he was the man of intellect  so you are waking up from the lethargy of africa my friend he exclaimed you are beginning to think as you ask me so shall i answer the kaiser is a vain bombastic dreamer the greatest egotist who ever lived with a diseased personality a ceaseless craving for the limelight but he has also the genius for government i mean this he is a splendid medium for the expression of the brain power of his counsellors their words will pass through his personality and he will believe them his what is more they will sound like his he will see himself the knight in shining armour all europe will bow down before this selfimagined caesar and no one except we who are behind will realise the asss head there is no one else in this world whom i have ever met so well fitted to lead our great nation on to the destiny she deservesand now my friend tomorrow if you like we will speak of these matters again tonight you have other things to think about you are going into the great places where i never penetrate you have an hour to change and prepare at eleven oclock the prince von terniloff will expect you    chapter vii  there had been a dinner party and a very small reception afterwards at the great embassy in carlton house terrace the ambassador prince terniloff was bidding farewell to his wifes cousin the princess eiderstrom the last of his guests she drew him on one side for a moment  your excellency she said i have been hoping for a word with you all the evening  and i with you dear stephanie he answered it is very early let us sit down for a moment  he led her towards a settee but she shook her head  you have an appointment at halfpast eleven she said i wish you to keep it  you know then  i lunched today at the carleton grill room in the receptionroom i came face to face with leopold von ragastein  the ambassador made no remark it seemed to be his wish to hear first all that his companion had to say after a moments pause she continued  i spoke to him and he denied himself to me i think that those were the most terrible seconds of my life i have never suffered more i shall never suffer so much again  it was most unfortunate the prince murmured sympathetically  this evening she went on i received a visit from a man whom i took at first to be an insignificant member of the german bourgeoisie i learnt something of his true position later he came to me to explain that leopold was engaged in this country on secret service that he was passing under the name which he gave mesir everard dominey an english baronet long lost in africa you know of this  i know that tonight i am receiving a visit from sir everard dominey  he is to work under your auspices  by no means the prince rejoined warmly i am not favourably inclined towards this network of espionage the school of diplomacy in which i have been brought up tries to work without such ignoble means  one realises that she said leopold is coming however tonight to pay his respects to you  he is waiting for me now in my study the ambassador asserted  you will do me the service of conveying to him a message from me she continued this man seaman pointed out to me the unwisdom of any association between myself and leopold under present conditions i listened to all that he had to say i reserved my decision i have now considered the matter i will compromise with necessity i will be content with the acquaintance of sir everard dominey but that i will have  for myself the ambassador reflected i do not even know what von ragasteins mission over here is but if in berlin they decide that for the more complete preservation of his incognito association between you and him is undesirable  she laid her fingers upon his arm  stop she ordered i am not of berlin i am not a german i am not even an austrian i am hungarian and though i am willing to study your interests i am not willing to place them before my own life i make terms but i do not surrender those terms i will discuss with leopold ah be kind to me she went on with a sudden change of voice since these few minutes at midday i have lived in a dream only one thing can quiet me i must speak to him i must decide with him what i will do you will help  an acquaintance between you and sir everard dominey he admitted is certainly a perfectly natural thing  look at me she begged  he turned and looked into her face underneath her beautiful eyes were dark lines there was something pitiful about the curve of her mouth he remembered that although she had carried herself throughout the evening with all the dignity which was second nature to her he had overheard more than one sympathetic comment upon her appearance  i can see that you are suffering he remarked kindly  my eyes are hot and inside i am on fire she continued i must speak to leopold freda has asked me to stay and talk to her for an hour my car waits arrange that he drives me home oh believe me dear friend i am a very human woman and there is nothing in the world to be gained by treating me as though i were of wood or stone tonight i can see him without observation if you refuse i shall take other means i will make no promises i will not even promise that i will not call out before him in the streets that he is a liar that his life is a lie i will call him leopold von ragastein  hush he begged her stephanie you are nervous i have not yet answered your entreaty  you consent  i consent he promised after our interview i shall bring the young man to fredas room and present him you will be there he can offer you his escort  she suddenly stooped and kissed his hand an immense relief was in her face  now i will keep you no longer freda is waiting for me  the ambassador strolled thoughtfully away into his own den at the back of the house where dominey was waiting for him  i am glad to see you the former said holding out his hand for five minutes i desire to talk to your real self after that for the rest of your time in england i will respect your new identity  dominey bowed in silence his host pointed to the sideboard  come he continued there are cigars and cigarettes at your elbow whisky and soda on the sideboard make yourself at home in that chair there africa has really changed you very little do you remember our previous meeting in saxony  i remember it perfectly your excellency  his majesty knew how to keep court in those days the ambassador went on one was tempted to believe oneself at an english country party however that much of the past you know of course that i entirely disapprove of your present position here  i gathered as much your excellency  we will have no reserves with one another the prince declared lighting a cigar i know quite well that you form part of a network of espionage in this country which i consider wholly unnecessary that is simply a question of method i have no doubt that you are here with the same object as i am the object which the kaiser has declared to me with his own lips is nearest to his heartto cement the bonds of friendship between germany and england  you believe sir that that is possible  i am convinced of it was the earnest reply i do not know what the exact nature of your work over here is to be but i am glad to have an opportunity of putting before you my convictions i believe that in berlin the character of some of the leading statesmen here has been misunderstood and misrepresented i find on all sides of me an earnest and sincere desire for peace i have convinced myself that there is not a single statesman in this country who is desirous of war with germany  dominey was listening intently with the air of one who hears unexpected things  but your excellency he ventured what about the matter from our point of view there are a great many in our country whom you and i know of who look forward to a war with england as inevitable germany must become we all believe the greatest empire in the world she must climb there as one of our friends once said with her foot upon the neck of the british lion  you are out of date the ambassador declared earnestly i see now why they sent you to me those days have passed there is room in the world for great britain and for germany the disintegration of russia in the near future is a certainty it is eastward that we must look for any great extension of territory  these things have been decided  absolutely they form the soul of my mission here my mandate is one of peace and the more i see of english statesmen and the more i understand the british outlook the more sanguine i am as to the success of my efforts this is why all this outside espionage with which seaman is so largely concerned seems to me at times unwise and unnecessary  and my own mission dominey enquired  its nature the prince replied is not as yet divulged but if as i have been given to understand it is to become closely connected with my own then i am very sure you will presently find that its text also is peace  dominey rose to his feet prepared to take his leave  these matters will be solved for us he murmured  there is just one word more on a somewhat more private matter terniloff said in an altered tone the princess eiderstrom is upstairs  in this house  waiting for a word with you our friend seaman has been with her this evening i understand that she is content to subscribe to the present situation she makes one condition however  and that  she insists upon it that i present sir everard dominey  the latter did not attempt to conceal his perturbation  i need scarcely point out to you sir he protested that any association between the princess and myself is likely to largely increase the difficulties of my position here  the ambassador sighed  i quite appreciate that he admitted both seaman and i have endeavoured to reason with her but as you are doubtless aware the princess is a woman of very strong will she is also very powerfully placed here and it is the urgent desire of the court at berlin to placate in every way the hungarian nobility you will understand of course that i speak from a political point of view only i cannot ignore the fact of your unfortunate relations with the late prince but in considering the present position you will i am sure remember the greater interests  his visitor was silent for a moment  you say that the princess is waiting here  she is with my wife and asks for your escort home my wife also looks forward to the pleasure of renewing her acquaintance with you  i shall accept your excellencys guidance in the matter dominey decided  the princess terniloff was a woman of world culture an artist and still an extremely attractive woman she received the visitor whom her husband brought to her in a very charming little room furnished after the style of the simplest french period and she did her best to relieve the strain of what she understood must be a somewhat trying moment  we are delighted to welcome you to london sir everard dominey she said taking his hand and i hope that we shall often see you here i want to present you to my cousin who is interested in you i must tell you frankly because of your likeness to a very dear friend of hers stephanie this is sir everard domineythe princess eiderstrom  stephanie who was seated upon the couch from which her cousin had just risen held out her hand to dominey who made her a very low and formal bow her gown was of unrelieved black wonderful diamonds flashed around her neck and she wore also a tiara fashioned after the hungarian style a little low on her forehead her manner and tone still indicated some measure of rebellion against the situation  you have forgiven me for my insistence this morning she asked it was hard for me to believe that you were not indeed the person for whom i mistook you  other people have spoken to me of the likeness dominey replied it is a matter of regret to me that i can claim to be no more than a simple norfolk baronet  without any previous experience of european courts  without any at all  your german is wonderfully pure for an untravelled man  languages were the sole accomplishment i brought away from my misspent school days  you are not going to bury yourself in norfolk sir everard the princess terniloff enquired  norfolk is very near london these days dominey replied and i have experienced more than my share of solitude during the last few years i hope to spend a portion of my time here  you must dine with us one night the princess insisted and tell us about africa my husband would be so interested  you are very kind  stephanie rose slowly to her feet leaned gracefully over and kissed her hostess on both cheeks and submitted her hand to the prince who raised it to his lips then she turned to dominey  will you be so kind as to see me home she asked afterwards my car can take you on wherever you choose to go  i shall be very happy dominey assented  he too made his farewells a servant in the hall handed him his hat and coat and he took his place in the car by stephanies side she touched the electric switch as they glided off the car was in darkness  i think she murmured that i could not have borne another moment of this juggling with words leopoldwe are alone  he caught the flash of her jewels the soft brilliance of her eyes as she leaned towards him his voice sounded even to himself harsh and strident  you mistake princess my name is not leopold i am everard dominey  oh i know that you are very obstinate she said softly very obstinate and very devoted to your marvellous country but you have a soul leopold you know that there are human duties as great as any your country ever imposed upon you you know what i look for from you what i must find from you or go down into hell ashamed and miserable  he felt his throat suddenly dry  listen he muttered until the hour strikes i must remain to you as to the world alone or in a crowdeverard dominey there is one way and one way only of carrying through my appointed task  she gave a little hysterical sob  wait she begged i will answer you in a moment give me your hand  he opened the fingers which he had kept clenched together and he felt the hot grip of her hand holding his passionately drawing it toward her until the fingers of her other hand too fell upon it so she sat for several moments  leopold she continued presently i understand you are afraid that i shall betray our love you have reason i am full of impulses and passion as you know but i have restraint what we are to one another when we are alone no soul in this world need know i will be careful i swear it i will never even look at you as though my heart ached for your notice when we are in the presence of other people you shall come and see me as seldom as you wish i will receive you only as often as you say but dont treat me like this tell me you have come back throw off this hideous mask if it be only for a moment  he sat quite still although her hands were tearing at his her lips and eyes beseeching him  whatever may come afterwards he pronounced inexorably until the time arrives i am everard dominey i cannot take advantage of your feelings for leopold von ragastein he is not here he is in africa perhaps some day he will come back to you and be all that you wish  she flung his hands away he felt her eyes burning into his this time with something more like furious curiosity  let me look at you she cried let me be sure is this just some ghastly change or are you an imposter my heart is growing chilled are you the man i have waited for all these years are you the man to whom i have given my lips for whose sake i offered up my reputation as a sacrifice the man who slew my husband and left me  i was exiled he reminded her his own voice shaking with emotion you know that so far as other things are concerned i am exiled now i am working out my expiation  she leaned back in her seat with an air of exhaustion her eyes closed then the car drove in through some iron gates and stopped in front of her door which was immediately opened a footman hurried out she turned to dominey  you will not enter she pleaded for a short time  if you will permit me to pay you a visit it will give me great pleasure he answered formally i will call if i may on my return from norfolk  she gave him her hand with a sad smile  let my people take you wherever you want to go she invited and remember she added dropping her voice i do not admit defeat this is not the last word between us  she disappeared in some state escorted through the great front door of one of londons few palaces by an attractive majordomo and footman in the livery of her house dominey drove back to the carlton where in the lounge he found the band playing crowds still sitting around amongst whom seaman was conspicuous in his neat dinner clothes and with his cherubic air of inviting attention from prospective new acquaintances he greeted dominey enthusiastically  come he exclaimed i am weary of solitude i have seen scarcely a face that i recognise my tongue is parched with inaction i like to talk and there has been no one to talk to i might as well have opened up my little house in forest hill  ill talk to you if you like dominey promised a little grimly glancing at the clock and hastily ordering a whisky and soda i will begin by telling you this he added lowering his tone i have discovered the greatest danger i shall have to face during my enterprise  what is that  a womanthe princess eiderstrom  seaman lit one of his inevitable cigars and threw one of his short fat legs over the other he gazed for a moment with an air of satisfaction at his small foot neatly encased in court shoes  you surprise me he confessed i have considered the matter i cannot see any great difficulty  then you must be closing your eyes to it willfully dominey retorted or else you are wholly ignorant of the princesss temperament and disposition  i believe i appreciate both seaman replied but i still do not see any peculiar difficulty in the situation as an english nobleman you have a perfect right to enjoy the friendship of the princess eiderstrom  and i thought you were a man of sentiment dominey scoffed i thought you understood a little of human nature stephanie eiderstrom is hungarian born and bred even race has never taught her selfrestraint you dont seriously suppose that after all these years after all she has sufferedand she has sufferedshe is going to be content with an emasculated form of friendship i talk to you without reserve seaman she has made it very plain tonight that she is going to be content with nothing of the sort  what takes place between you in private seaman began  rubbish his companion interrupted the princess is an impulsive a passionate a distinctly primitive woman with a good deal of the wild animal in her still plots or political necessities are not likely to count a snap of the fingers with her  but surely seaman protested she must understand that your country has claimed you for a great work  dominey shook his head  she is not a german he pointed out on the contrary like a great many other hungarians i think she rather dislikes germany and germans her only concern is the personal question between us she considers that every moment of the rest of my life should be devoted to her  perhaps it is as well seaman remarked that you have arranged to go down tomorrow to dominey i will think out a scheme something must be done to pacify her  the lights were being put out the two men rose a little unwillingly dominey felt singularly indisposed for sleep but anxious at the same time to get rid of his companion they strolled into the darkened hall of the hotel together  i will deal with the matter for you as well as i can seaman promised to my mind your greatest difficulty will be encountered tomorrow you know what you have to deal with down at dominey  domineys face was very set and grave  i am prepared he said  seaman still hesitated  do you remember he asked that when we talked over your plans at cape town you showed me a picture ofof lady dominey  i remember  may i have one more look at it  dominey with fingers that trembled a little drew from the breast pocket of his coat a leather case and from that a worn picture the two men looked at it side by side beneath one of the electric standards which had been left burning the face was the face of a girl almost a child and the great eyes seemed filled with a queer appealing light there was something of the same suggestion to be found in the lips a certain helplessness an appeal for love and protection to some stronger being  seaman turned away with a little grunt and commented  permitting myself to reassume for a moment or two the ordinary sentiments of an ordinary human being i would sooner have a dozen of your princesses to deal with than the original of that picture    chapter viii  your ancestral home mr mangan observed as the car turned the first bend in the grassgrown avenue and dominey hall came into sight damned fine house too  his companion made no reply a storm had come up during the last few minutes and as though he felt the cold he had dragged his hat over his eyes and turned his coat collar up to his ears the house with its great double front was now clearly visiblethe timeworn elizabethan red brick outline that faced the park southwards and the stonesupported grim and weatherstained back which confronted the marshes and the sea mr mangan continued to make amiable conversation  we have kept the old place weathertight somehow or other he said and i dont think youll miss the timber much weve taken it as far as possible from the outlying woods  any from the black wood dominey asked without turning his head  not a stump he replied and for a very excellent reason not one of the woodmen would ever go near the place  the superstition remains then  the villagers are absolutely rabid about it there are at least a dozen who declare that they have seen the ghost of roger unthank and a score or more who will swear by all that is holy that they have heard his call at night  does he still select the park and the terrace outside the house for his midnight perambulations dominey enquired  the lawyer hesitated  the idea is i believe he said that the ghost makes his way out from the wood and sits on the terrace underneath lady domineys window all bunkum of course but i can assure you that every servant and caretaker weve had there has given notice within a month that is the sole reason why i havent ventured to recommend long ago that you should get rid of mrs unthank  she is still in attendance upon lady dominey then  simply because we couldnt get any one else to stay there the lawyer explained and her ladyship positively declines to leave the hall between ourselves i think its time a change was made well have a chat after dinner if youve no objectionyou see weve left all the trees in the park he went on with an air of satisfaction beautiful place this in the springtime i was down last may for a night and i never saw such buttercups in my life the cows here were almost up to their knees in pasture and the bluebells in the home woods were wonderful the whole of the little painting colony down at flankney turned themselves loose upon the place last spring  some of the old wall is down i see dominey remarked with a frown as he gazed towards the enclosed kitchen garden  mr mangan was momentarily surprised  that wall has been down to my knowledge for twenty years he reminded his companion  dominey nodded i had forgotten he muttered  we wrote you by the by the lawyer continued suggesting the sale of one or two of the pictures to form a fund for repairs but thank goodness you didnt reply well have some workpeople here as soon as youve decided what youd like done im afraid he added as they turned in through some iron gates and entered the last sweep in front of the house you wont find many familiar faces to welcome you theres loveybond the gardener whom you would scarcely remember and middleton the head keeper who has really been a godsend so far as the game is concerned no one at all indoors exceptmrs unthank  the car drew up at that moment in front of the great porch there was nothing in the shape of a reception they had even to ring the bell before the door was opened by a manservant sent down a few days previously from town in the background wearing a brown velveteen coat with breeches and leggings of corduroy stood an elderly man with white side whiskers and skin as brown as a piece of parchment leaning heavily upon a long ash stick half a dozen maidservants new importations were visible in the background and a second man was taking possession of the luggage mr mangan took charge of the proceedings  middleton he said resting his hand upon the old mans shoulder heres your master come back again sir everard was very pleased to hear that you were still here and you loveybond  the old man grasped the hand which dominey stretched out with both of his  im right glad youre back again squire he said looking at him with curious intentness and yet the words of welcome stick in my throat  sorry you feel like that about it middleton dominey said pleasantly what is the trouble about my coming back  thats no trouble squire the old man replied thats a joyleastways to us its what it may turn out to be for you which makes one hold back like  dominey drew himself more than ever erecta commanding figure in the little group  you will feel better about it when we have had a day or two with the pheasants middleton he said reassuringly you have not changed much loveybond he added turning to the man who had fallen a little into the background very stiff and uncomfortable in his sunday clothes  i thankee squire the latter replied a little awkwardly with a motion of his hand towards his forehead i cant say the same for you sir them furrin parts has filled you out and hardened you ill take the liberty of saying that i should never have recognised you sir and thats sure  this is parkins mr mangan went on pushing his way once more into the foreground the butler whom i engaged in london and  there was a queer and instantaneous silence the little group of maidservants who had been exchanging whispered confidences as to their new masters appearance were suddenly dumb all eyes were turned in one direction a woman whose advent had been unperceived but who had evidently issued from one of the recesses of the hall stood suddenly before them all she was as thin as a lath dressed in severe black with grey hair brushed back from her head and not even a white collar at her neck her face was long and narrow her features curiously large her eyes filled with anger she spoke very slowly but with some trace in her intonation of a northcountry dialect  theres no place in this house for you everard dominey she said standing in front of him as though to bar his progress i wrote last night to stop you but youve shown indecent haste in coming theres no place here for a murderer get back where you came from back to your hiding  my good woman mangan gasped this is really too much  ive not come to bandy words with lawyers the woman retorted ive come to speak to him can you face me everard dominey you who murdered my son and made a madwoman of your wife  the lawyer would have answered her but dominey waved him aside  mrs unthank he said sternly return to your duties at once and understand that this house is mine to enter or leave when i choose  she was speechless for a moment amazed at the firmness of his words  the house may be yours sir everard dominey she said threateningly but theres one part of it at least in which you wont dare to show yourself  you forget yourself woman he replied coldly be so good as to return to your mistress at once announce my coming and say that i wait only for her permission before presenting myself in her apartments  the woman laughed unpleasantly horribly her eyes were fixed upon dominey curiously  those are brave words she said youve come back a harder man let me look at you  she moved a foot or two to where the light was better very slowly a frown developed upon her forehead the longer she looked the less assured she became  there are things in your face i miss she muttered  mr mangan was glad of an opportunity of asserting himself  the fact is scarcely important mrs unthank he said angrily if you will allow me to give you a word of advice you will treat your master with the respect to which his position here entitles him  once more the woman blazed up  respect what respect have i for the murderer of my son respect well if he stays here against my bidding perhaps her ladyship will show him what respect means  she turned around and disappeared every one began bustling about the luggage and talking at once mr mangan took his patrons arm and led him across the hall  my dear sir everard he said anxiously i am most distressed that this should have occurred i thought that the woman would probably be sullen but i had no idea that she would dare to attempt such an outrageous proceeding  she is still i presume the only companion whom lady dominey will tolerate dominey enquired with a sigh  i fear so the lawyer admitted nevertheless we must see doctor harrison in the morning it must be understood distinctly that if she is suffered to remain she adopts an entirely different attitude i never heard anything so preposterous in all my life i shall pay her a visit myself after dinneryou will feel quite at home here in the library sir everard mr mangan went on throwing open the door of a very fine apartment on the seaward side of the house grand view from these windows especially since weve had a few of the trees cut down i see that parkins has set out the sherry cocktails im afraid are an institution you will have to inaugurate down here youll be grateful to me when i tell you one thing sir everard weve been hard pressed more than once but we havent sold a single bottle of wine out of the cellars  dominey accepted the glass of sherry which the lawyer had poured out but made no movement towards drinking it he seemed during the last few minutes to have been wrapped in a brown study  mangan he asked a little abruptly is it the popular belief down here that i killed roger unthank  the lawyer set down the decanter and coughed  a plain answer dominey insisted  mr mangan adapted himself to the situation he was beginning to understand his client  i am perfectly certain sir everard he confessed that there isnt a soul in these parts who isnt convinced of it they believe that there was a fight and that you had the best of it  forgive me dominey continued if i seem to ask unnecessary questions remember that i spent the first portion of my exile in africa in a very determined effort to blot out the memory of everything that had happened to me earlier in life so that is the popular belief  the popular belief seems to match fairly well with the facts mr mangan declared wielding the decanter again in view of his clients more reasonable manner at the time of your unfortunate visit to the hall miss felbrigg was living practically alone at the vicarage after her uncles sudden death there with mrs unthank as housekeeper roger unthanks infatuation for her was patent to the whole neighbourhood and a source of great annoyance in miss felbrigg i am convinced that at no time did lady dominey give the young man the slightest encouragement  has any one ever believed the contrary dominey demanded  not a soul was the emphatic reply nevertheless when you came down fell in love with miss felbrigg and carried her off every one felt that there would be trouble  roger unthank was a lunatic dominey pronounced deliberately his behaviour from the first was the behaviour of a madman  the eugene aram type of village schoolmaster gradually drifting into positive insanity mangan acquiesced so far every one is agreed the mystery began when he came back from his holidays and heard the news  the sequel was perfectly simple dominey observed we met at the north end of the black wood one evening and he attacked me like a madman i suppose i had to some extent the best of it but when i got back to the hall my arm was broken i was covered with blood and half unconscious by some cruel stroke of fortune almost the first person i saw was lady dominey the shock was too much for hershe faintedand  and has never been quite herself since the lawyer concluded most tragic  the cruel part of it was dominey went on standing before the window his hands clasped behind his back that my wife from that moment developed a homicidal mania against mei who had fought in the most absolute selfdefence that was what drove me out of the country mangannot the fear of being arrested for having caused the death of roger unthank id have stood my trial for that at any moment it was the other thing that broke me up  quite so mangan murmured sympathetically as a matter of fact you were perfectly safe from arrest as it happened the body of roger unthank has never been found from that day to this  if it had  you must have been charged with either murder or manslaughter  dominey abandoned his post at the window and raised his glass of sherry to his lips the tragical side of these reminiscences seemed so far as he was concerned to have passed  i suppose he remarked it was the disappearance of the body which has given rise to all this talk as to his spirit still inhabiting the black wood  without a doubt the lawyer acquiesced the place had a bad name already as you know as it is i dont suppose theres a villager here would cross the park in that direction after dark  dominey glanced at his watch and led the way from the room  after dinner he promised ill tell you a few west african superstitions which will make our local one seem anemic    chapter ix  i certainly offer you my heartiest congratulations upon your cellars sir everard his guest said as he sipped his third glass of port that evening this is the finest glass of seventy ive drunk for a long time and this new fellow ive sent you downparkinstells me theres any quantity of it  it has had a pretty long rest dominey observed  i was looking through the cellarbook before dinner the lawyer went on and i see that you still have fortyseven and fortyeight and a small quantity of two older vintages something ought to be done about those  we will try one of them tomorrow night dominey suggested we might spend half an hour or so in the cellars if we have any time to spare  and another half an hour mr mangan said gravely i should like to spend in interviewing mrs unthank apart from any other question i do not for one moment believe that she is the proper person to be entrusted with the care of lady dominey i made up my mind to speak to you on this subject sir everard as soon as we had arrived here  mrs unthank was old mr felbriggs housekeeper and my wifes nurse when she was a child dominey reminded his companion whatever her faults may be i believe she is devoted to lady dominey  she may be devoted to your wife the lawyer admitted but i am convinced that she is your enemy the situation doesnt seem to me to be consistent mrs unthank is firmly convinced that whether in fair fight or not you killed her son lady dominey believes that too and it was the sight of you after the fight that sent her insane i cannot but believe that it would be far better for lady dominey to have some one with her unconnected with this unfortunate chapter of your past  we will consult doctor harrison tomorrow dominey said i am very glad you came down with me mangan he went on after a minutes hesitation i find it very difficult to get back into the atmosphere of those days i even find it hard sometimes he added with a curious little glance across the table to believe that i am the same man  not so hard as i have done more than once mr mangan confessed  tell me exactly in what respects you consider me changed dominey insisted  you seem to have lost a certain pliability or perhaps i ought to call it looseness of disposition he admitted there are many things connected with the past which i find it almost impossible to associate with you for a trifling instance he went on with a slight smile inclining his head towards his hosts untasted glass you dont drink port like any dominey i ever knew  im afraid that i never acquired the taste for port dominey observed  the lawyer gazed at him with raised eyebrows  not acquired the taste for port he repeated blankly  i should have said reacquired dominey hastened to explain you see in the bush we drank a simply frightful amount of spirits and that vitiates the taste for all wine  the lawyer glanced enviously at his hosts fine bronzed complexion and clear eyes  you havent the appearance of ever having drunk anything sir everard he observed frankly one finds it hard to believe the stories that were going about ten or fifteen years ago  the dominey constitution i suppose  the new butler entered the room noiselessly and came to his masters chair  i have served coffee in the library sir he announced mr middleton the gamekeeper has just called and asks if he could have a word with you before he goes to bed tonight sir he seems in a very nervous and uneasy state  he can come to the library at once dominey directed that is if you are ready for your coffee mangan  indeed i am the lawyer assented rising a great treat that wine one thing the london restaurants cant give us port should never be drunk away from the place where it was laid down  the two men made their way across the very fine hall the walls of which had suffered a little through lack of heating into the library and seated themselves in easychairs before the blazing log fire parkins silently served them with coffee and brandy he had scarcely left the room before there was a timid knock and middleton made his somewhat hesitating entrance  come in and close the door dominey directed what is it middleton parkins says you wish to speak to me  the man came hesitatingly forward he was obviously distressed and uneasy and found speech difficult his face glistened with the rain which had found its way too in long streaks down his velveteen coat his white hair was windtossed and disarranged  bad night dominey remarked  its to save its being a worse one that im here squire the old man replied hoarsely ive come to ask you a favour and to beg you to grant it for your own sake youll not sleep in the oak room tonight  and why not dominey asked  its next her ladyships  well  the old man was obviously perturbed but his master as though of a purpose refused to help him he glanced at mangan and mumbled to himself  say exactly what you wish to middleton dominey invited mr mangan and his father and grandfather have been solicitors to the estate for a great many years they know all our family history  i cant get rightly into touch with you squire and thats a fact middleton went on despairingly the shape of you seems larger and your voice harder i dont seem to be so near to you as id wished to say whats in my heart  i have had a rough time middleton dominey reminded him no wonder i have changed never mind speak to me just as man to man  it was i who first met you squire the old man went on when you tottered home that night across the park with your arm hanging helplessly by your side and the blood streaming down your face and clothes and the red light in your eyesmurderous fire they called it i heard her ladyship go into hysterics i saw her laugh and sob like a maniac and god help us thats what shes been ever since  the two men were silent middleton had raised his voice speaking with fierce excitement it was obvious that he had only paused for breath he had more to say  i was by your side squire he went on when her ladyship caught up the knife and ran at you and as you well know it was i seizing her from behind that saved a double tragedy that night and it was i who went for the doctor the next morning when shed stolen into your room in the night and missed your throat by a bare inch i heard her call to you heard her threat it was a madwomans threat squire but her ladyship is a madwoman at this moment and with a knife in her hand youll never be safe in this house  we must see dominey said quietly that she is not allowed to get possession of any weapon  aye make sure of that middleton scoffed with mother unthank by her side her ladyships mad because of the horror of that night but mother unthank is mad with hate and there isnt a week passes the old man went on his voice dropping lower and his eyes burning that roger unthanks spirit dont come and howl for your blood beneath their window if you stay here this night squire come over and sleep in the little room theyve got ready for you on the other side of the house  mr mangan had lost his smooth afterdinner appearance his face was rumpled and his coffee was growing cold this was a very different thing from the vague letters and rumours which had reached him from time to time and which he had put out of his mind with all the contempt of the materialist  it is very good of you to warn me middleton dominey said but i can lock my door can i not  lock the door of the oak room was the scornful reply and what good would that do you know well enough that the walls double on three sides and there are more secret entrances than even i know of the oak rooms not for you this night squire its hoping to get you there thats keeping them quiet  tell us what you mean middleton the lawyer asked with illassumed indifference when you spoke of the howling of roger unthanks spirit  the old man turned patiently around  just that sir he replied its round the house most weeks except for me odd nights and mrs unthank theres been scarcely a servant would sleep in the hall for years some of the maids they do come up from the village but back they go before nightfall and until morning there isnt a living soul would cross the pathno not for a hundred pounds  a howl you call it mr mangan observed  thats mostly like a dog thats hurt itself middleton explained equably like a dog that is with a touch of human in its throat as weve all heard in our time sir youll hear it yourself sir maybe tonight or tomorrow night  youve heard it then middleton his master asked  why surely sir the old man replied in surprise most weeks for the last ten years  havent you ever got up and gone out to see what it was  the old man shook his head  but i knew right well what that was sir he said and im not one for looking on spirits spirits there are that walk this world as we well know and the spirit of roger unthank walks from between the black wood and those windows come every week of the year but im not for looking at him theres evil comes of that i turn over in my bed and i stop my ears but ive never yet raised a blind  tell me middleton dominey asked is lady dominey terrified at theseervisitations  that i cant rightly say sir her ladyships always sweet and gentle with kind words on her lips for every one but theres the terror there in her eyes that was lit that night when you staggered into the hall squire and ive never seen it properly quenched yet so to speak she carries fear with her but whether its the fear of seeing you again or the fear of roger unthanks spirit i could not tell  dominey seemed suddenly to become possessed of a strange desire to thrust the whole subject away he dismissed the old man kindly but a little abruptly accompanying him to the corridor which led to the servants quarters and talking all the time about the pheasants when he returned he found that his guest had emptied his second glass of brandy and was surreptitiously mopping his forehead  that the latter remarked is the class of old retainer who lives too long if i were a dominey of the middle ages i think a stone around his neck and the deepest well would be the sensible way of dealing with him he made me feel positively uncomfortable  i noticed it dominey remarked with a faint smile im not going to pretend that it was a pleasant conversation myself  ive heard some ghost stories mangan went on but a spook that comes and howls once a week for ten years takes some beating  dominey poured himself out a glass of brandy with a steady hand  youve been neglecting things here mangan he complained you ought to have come down and exorcised that ghost we shall have those smart maidservants of yours off tomorrow i suppose unless you and i can get a little ghostlaying in first  mr mangan began to feel more comfortable the brandy and the warmth of the burning logs were creeping into his system  by the by sir everard he enquired a little later on where are you going to sleep tonight  dominey stretched himself out composedly  there is obviously only one place for me he replied i cant disappoint any one i shall sleep in the oak room    chapter x  for the first few tangled moments of nightmare slowly developing into a live horror dominey fancied himself back in africa with the hand of an enemy upon his throat then a rush of awakened memoriesthe silence of the great house the mysterious rustling of the heavy hangings around the black oak fourposter on which he lay the faint pricking of something deadly at his throatthese things rolled back the curtain of unreality brought him acute and painful consciousness of a situation almost appalling he opened his eyes and although a brave and callous man he lay still paralysed with the fear which forbids motion the dim light of a candle recently lit flashed upon the bodkinlike dagger held at his throat he gazed at the thin line of gleaming steel fascinated already his skin had been broken a few drops of blood were upon the collar of his pyjamas the hand which held that deadly assailing weaponsmall slim very feminine curving from somewhere behind the bed curtainbelonged to some unseen person he tried to shrink farther back upon the pillow the hand followed him displaying glimpses now of a soft whitesleeved arm he lay quite still the muscles of his right arm growing tenser as he prepared for a snatch at those cruel fingers then a voice camea slow feminine and rather wonderful voice  if you move it said you will die remain quite still  dominey was fully conscious now his brain at work calculating his chances with all the cunning of the trained hunter who seeks to avoid death reluctantly he was compelled to realise that no movement of his could be quick enough to prevent the driving of that thin stiletto into his throat if his hidden assailant should keep her word so he lay still  why do you want to kill me he asked a little tensely  there was no reply yet somehow he knew that he was being watched ever so slightly those curtains around which the arm had come were being parted through the chink some one was looking at him the thought came that he might call out for help and once more his unseen enemy read his thought  you must be very quiet the voice saidthat voice which it was difficult for him to believe was not the voice of a child if you even speak above a whisper it will be the end i wish to look at you  a little wider the crack opened and then he began to feel hope the hand which held the stiletto was shaking he heard something which sounded like quick breathing from behind the curtainsthe breathing of a woman astonished or terrifiedand then so suddenly that for several seconds he could not move or take advantage of the circumstance the hand with its cruel weapon was withdrawn around the curtain and a woman began to laugh softly at first and then with a little hysterical sob thrusting its way through that incongruous note of mirth  he lay upon the bed as though mesmerised finding at his first effort that his limbs refused their office as might the limbs of one lying under the thrall of a nightmare the laugh died away there was a sound like a scraping upon the wall the candle was suddenly blown out then his nerve began to return and with it his control over his limbs he crawled to the side of the bed remote from the curtains stole to the little table on which he had left his revolver and an electric torch snatched at them and with the former in his right hand flashed a little orb of light into the shadows of the great apartment once more something like terror seized him the figure which had been standing by the side of his bed had vanished there was no hiding place in view every inch of the room was lit up by the powerful torch he carried and save for himself the room was empty the first moment of realisation was chill and unnerving then the slight smarting of the wound at his throat became convincing proof to him that there was nothing supernatural about this visit he lit up halfadozen of the candles distributed about the place and laid down his torch he was ashamed to find that his forehead was dripping with perspiration  one of the secret passages of course he muttered to himself stooping for a moment to examine the locked folding doors which separated his room from the adjoining one perhaps when one reflects i have run unnecessary risks  dominey was standing at the window looking out at the tumbled grey waters of the north sea when parkins brought him hot water and tea in the morning he thrust his feet into slippers and held out his arms for a dressinggown  find out where the nearest bathroom is parkins he ordered and prepare it i have quite forgotten my way about here  very good sir  the man was motionless for a moment staring at the blood on his masters pyjamas dominey glanced down at it and turned the dressinggown up to his throat  i had a slight accident this morning he remarked carelessly any ghost alarms last light  none that i heard of sir the man replied i am afraid we should have difficulty in keeping the young women from london if they heard what i heard the night of my arrival  very terrible was it dominey asked with a smile  parkins expression remained immovable there was in his tone however a mute protest against his masters levity  the cries were the most terrible i have ever heard sir he said i am not a nervous person but i found them most disturbing  human or animal  a mixture of both i should say sir  you should camp out for the night on the skirts of an african forest dominey remarked there you get a whole orchestra of wild animals every one of them trying to freeze your blood up  i was out in south africa during the boer war sir parkins replied and i went big game hunting with my master afterwards i do not think that any animal was ever born in africa with so terrifying a cry as we heard the night before last  we must look into the matter dominey muttered  i have already prepared a bath sir at the end of the corridor the man announced if you will allow me i will show you the way  dominey when he descended about an hour later found his guest awaiting him in the smaller diningroom which looked out eastwards towards the sea a lofty apartment with great windows and with an air of faded splendour which came from the illcaredfor tapestries hanging in places from the wall mr mangan had contrary to his expectations slept well and was in excellent spirits the row of silver dishes upon the sideboard inspired him with an added cheerfulness  so there were no ghosts walking last night he remarked as he took his place at the table wonderful thing this absolute quiet is after london give you my word i never heard a sound from the moment my head touched the pillow until i woke a short while ago  dominey returned from the sideboard carrying also a wellfilled plate  i had a pretty useful nights rest myself he observed  mangan raised his eyeglass and gazed at his hosts throat  cut yourself he queried  razor slipped dominey told him you get out of the use of those things in africa  youve managed to give yourself a nasty gash mr mangan observed curiously  parkins is going to send up for a new set of safety razors for me dominey announced about our plans for the dayive ordered the car for twothirty this afternoon if that suits you we can look around the place quietly this morning mr johnson is sleeping over at a farmhouse near here we shall pick him up en route and i have told lees the bailiff to come with us too  mr mangan nodded his approval  upon my word he confessed it will be a joy to me to go and see some of these fellows without having to put em off about repairs and that sort of thing johnson has had the worst of it poor chap but there are one or two of them took it into their heads to come up to london and worry me at the office  i intend that there shall be no more dissatisfaction amongst my tenants  mr mangan set off for another prowl towards the sideboard  satisfied tenants you never will get in norfolk he declared i must admit though that some of them have had cause to grumble lately theres a fellow round by wells who farms nearly eight hundred acres  he broke off in his speech there was a knock at the door not an ordinary knock at all but a measured deliberate tapping three times repeated  come in dominey called out  mrs unthank entered severer more unattractive than ever in the hard morning light she came to the end of the table facing the place where dominey was seated  good morning mrs unthank he said  she ignored the greeting  i am the bearer of a message she announced  pray deliver it dominey replied  her ladyship would be glad for you to visit her in her apartment at once  dominey leaned back in his chair his eyes were fixed upon the face of the woman whose antagonism to himself was so apparent she stood in the path of a long gleam of morning sunlight the wrinkles in her face her hard mouth her cold steely eyes were all clearly revealed  i am not at all sure he said with a purpose in the words that any further meeting between lady dominey and myself is at present desirable  if he had thought to disturb this messenger by his suggestion he was disappointed  her ladyship desires me to assure you she added with a note of contempt in her tone that you need be under no apprehension  dominey admitted defeat and poured himself out some more coffee neither of the two noticed that his fingers were trembling  her ladyship is very considerate he said kindly say that i shall follow you in a few minutes  dominey following within a very few minutes of his summons was ushered into an apartment large and sombrely elegant an apartment of faded white and gold walls of chandeliers glittering with lustres of louise quinze furniture shabby but priceless to his surprise although he scarcely noticed it at the time mrs unthank promptly disappeared he was from the first left alone with the woman whom he had come to visit  she was sitting up on her couch and watching his approach a woman surely only a child with pale cheeks large anxious eyes and masses of brown hair brushed back from her forehead after all was he indeed a strong man vowed to great things there was a queer feeling in his throat almost a mist before his eyes she seemed so fragile so utterly sweetly pathetic and all the time there was the strange light or was it want of light in those haunting eyes his speech of greeting was never spoken  so you have come to see me everard she said in a broken tone you are very brave  he possessed himself of her hand the hand which a few hours ago had held a dagger to his throat and kissed the waxenlike fingers it fell to her side like a lifeless thing then she raised it and began rubbing softly at the place where his lips had fallen  i have come to see you at your bidding he replied and for my pleasure  pleasure she murmured with a ghastly little smile you have learnt to control your words everard you have slept here and you live i have broken my word i wonder why  because he pleaded i have not deserved that you should seek my life  that sounds strangely she reflected doesnt it say somewhere in the biblea life for a life you killed roger unthank  i have killed other men since in selfdefence dominey told her sometimes it comes to a man that he must slay or be slain it was roger unthank  i shall not talk about him any longer she decided quite calmly the night before last his spirit was calling to me below my window he wants me to go down into hell and live with him the very thought is horrible  come dominey said we shall speak of other things you must tell me what presents i can buy you i have come back from africa rich  presents  for a single wonderful moment hers was the face of a child who had been offered toys her smile of anticipation was delightful her eyes had lost that strange vacancy then before he could say another word it all came back again  listen to me she said this is important i have sent for you because i do not understand why quite suddenly last night after i had made up my mind i lost the desire to kill you it is gone now i am not sure about myself any longer draw your chair nearer to mine or no come to my side here at the other end of the sofa  she moved her skirts to make room for him when he sat down he felt a strange trembling through all his limbs  perhaps she went on i shall break my oath indeed i have already broken it let me look at you my husband it is a strange thing to own after all these yearsa husband  dominey felt as though he were breathing an atmosphere of turgid and poisoned sweetness there was a flavour of unreality about the whole situationthe room this child woman her beauty her deliberate halting speech and the strange things she said  you find me changed he asked  you are very wonderfully changed you look stronger you are perhaps betterlooking yet there is something gone from your face which i thought one never lost  you he said cautiously are more beautiful than ever rosamund  she laughed a little drearily  of what use has my beauty been to me everard since you came to my little cottage and loved me and made me love you and took me away from dour roger do you remember the school chidden used to call him dour rogerbut that does not matter do you know everard that since you left me my feet have not passed outside these gardens  that can be altered when you wish he said quickly you can visit where you will you can have a motorcar even a house in town i shall bring some wonderful doctors here and they will make you quite strong again  her large eyes were lifted almost piteously to his  but how can i leave here she asked plaintively every week sometimes oftener he calls to me if i went away his spirit would break loose and follow me i must be here to wave my hand then he goes away  dominey was conscious once more of that strange and most unexpected fit of emotion he was unrecognisable even to himself never before in his life had his heart beaten as it was beating now his eyes too were hot he had travelled around the word in search of new things only to find them in this strange faded chamber side by side with this suffering woman nevertheless he said quietly  we must send you some place where the people are kinder and where life is pleasanter perhaps you love music and to see beautiful pictures i think that we must try and keep you from thinking  she sighed in a perplexed fashion  i wish that i could get it out of my blood that i want to kill you then you could take me right away other married people have lived together and hated each other why shouldnt we we may forget even to hate  dominey staggered to his feet walked to a window threw it open and leaned out for a moment then he closed it and came back this new element in the situation had been a shock to him all the time she was watching him composedly  well she asked with a strange little smile what do you say would you like to hold as a wifes the hand which frightened you so last night  she held it out to him soft and warm her fingers even returned the pressure of his she looked at him pleasantly and once more he felt like a man who has wandered into a strange country and has lost his bearings  i want you so much to be happy he said hoarsely but you are not strong yet rosamund we cannot decide anything in a hurry  how surprised you are to find that i am willing to be nice to you she murmured but why not you cannot know why i have so suddenly changed my mind about youand i have changed it i have seen the truth these few minutes there is a reason everard why i should not kill you  what is it he demanded  she shook her head with all the joy of a child who keeps a secret  you are clever she said i will leave you to find it out i am excited now and i want you to go away for a little time please send mrs unthank to me  the prospect of release was a strange relief mingled still more strangely with regret he lingered over her hand  if you walk in your sleep tonight then he begged you will leave your dagger behind  i have told you she answered as though surprised that i have abandoned my intention i shall not kill you even though i may walk in my sleepand sometimes the nights are so longit will not be your death i seek    chapter xi  dominey left the room like a man in a dream descended the stairs to his own part of the house caught up a hat and stick and strode out into the sea mist which was fast enveloping the gardens there was all the chill of the north pole in that icecold cloud of vapour but nevertheless his forehead remained hot his pulses burning he passed out of the postern gate which led from the walled garden on to a broad marsh with dikes running here and there and lapping tongues of sea water creeping in with the tide he made his way seaward with uncertain steps until he reached a rough and stony road here he hesitated for a moment looked about him and then turned back at right angles soon he came to a little village a village of ancient cottages with seasoned redbrick tiles trim little patches of garden a church embowered with tall elm trees a triangular green at the crossroads on one side a low thatched buildingthe dominey arms on another an ancient square stone house on which was a brass plate he went over and read the name rang the bell and asked the trim maidservant who answered it for the doctor presently a man of youthful middleage presented himself in the surgery and bowed dominey was for a moment at a loss  i came to see doctor harrison he ventured  doctor harrison retired from practice some years ago was the courteous reply i am his nephew my name is stillwell  i understood that doctor harrison was still in the neighbourhood dominey said my name is domineysir everard dominey  i guessed as much the other replied my uncle lives with me here and to tell you the truth he was hoping that you would come and see him he retains one patient only doctor stillwell added in a graver tone you can imagine who that would be  his caller bowed lady dominey i presume  the young doctor opened the door and motioned to his guest to precede him  my uncle has his own little apartment on the other side of the house he said you must let me take you to him  they moved across the pleasant white stone hall into a small apartment with french windows leading out to a flagged terrace and tennis lawn an elderly man broadshouldered with weatherbeaten face grey hair and of somewhat serious aspect looked around from the window before which he was standing examining a case of fishing flies  uncle i have brought an old friend in to see you his nephew announced  the doctor glanced expectantly at dominey half moved forward as though to greet him then checked himself and shook his head doubtfully  you certainly remind me very much of an old friend sir he said but i can see now that you are not he i do not believe that i have ever seen you before in my life  there was a moments somewhat tense silence then dominey advanced a little stiffly and held out his hand  come doctor he said i can scarcely have changed as much as all that even these years of strenuous life  you mean to tell me that i am speaking to everard dominey the doctor interposed  without a doubt  the doctor shook hands coolly his was certainly not the enthusiastic welcome of an old family attendant to the representative of a great family  i should certainly never have recognised you he confessed  my presence here is nevertheless indisputable dominey continued still attracted by your old pastime i see doctor  i have only taken up fly fishing the other replied drily since i gave up shooting  there was another somewhat awkward pause which the younger man endeavoured to bridge over  fishing shooting golf he said i really dont know what we poor medical practitioners would do in the country without sport  i shall remind you of that later dominey observed i am told that the shooting is one of the only glories that has not passed away from dominey  i shall look forward to the reminder was the prompt response  his uncle who had been bending once more over the case of flies turned abruptly around  arthur he said addressing his nephew you had better start on your round i dare say sir everard would like to speak to me privately  i wish to speak to you certainly dominey admitted but only professionally there is no necessity  i am late already if you will excuse me doctor stillwell interrupted i will be getting on you must excuse my uncle sir everard he added in a lower tone drawing him a little towards the door if his manners are a little gruff he is devoted to lady dominey and i sometimes think that he broods over her case too much  dominey nodded and turned back into the room to find the doctor his hands in his oldfashioned breeches pockets eyeing him steadfastly  i find it very hard to believe he said a little curtly that you are really everard dominey  i am afraid you will have to accept me as a fact nevertheless  your present appearance the old man continued eyeing him appraisingly does not in any way bear out the description i had of you some years ago i was told that you had become a brokendown drunkard  the world is full of liars dominey said equably you appear to have met with one at least  you have not even the doctor persisted the appearance of a man who has been used to excesses of any sort  good old stock ours his visitor observed carelessly plenty of twobottle men behind my generation  you have also gained courage since the days when you fled from england you slept at the hall last night  where else i also if you want to know occupied my own bedchamberwith results dominey added throwing his head a little back to display the scar on his throat altogether insignificant  thats just your luck the doctor declared youve no right to have gone there without seeing me no right after all that has passed to have even approached your wife  you seem rather a martinet as regards my domestic affairs dominey observed  thats because i know your history was the blunt reply  uninvited dominey seated himself in an easychair  you were never my friend doctor he said let me suggest that we conduct this conversation on a purely professional basis  i was never your friend came the retort because i have known you always as a selfish brute because you were married to the sweetest woman on gods earth gave up none of your bad habits frightened her into insanity by reeling home with another mans blood on your hands and then stayed away for over ten years instead of making an effort to repair the mischief you had done  this observed dominey is history dished up in a somewhat partial fashion i repeat my suggestion that we confine our conversation to the professional  this is my house the other rejoined and you came to see me i shall say exactly what i like to you and if you dont like it you can get out if it werent for lady domineys sake you shouldnt have passed this threshold  then for her sake dominey suggested in a softer tone cant you forget how thoroughly you disapprove of me i am here now with only one object i want you to point out to me any way in which we can work together for the improvement of my wifes health  there can be no question of a partnership between us  you refuse to help  my help isnt worth a snap of the fingers i have done all i can for her physically she is a perfectly sound woman the rest depends upon you and you alone and i am not very hopeful about it  upon me dominey repeated a little taken aback  fidelity the doctor grunted is second nature with all good women lady dominey is a good woman and she is no exception to the rule her brain is starved because her heart is aching for love if she could believe in your repentance and reform if any atonement for the past were possible and were generously offered i cannot tell what the result might be they tell me that you are a rich man now although heaven knows when one considers what a lazy selfish fellow you were that sounds like a miracle you could have the great specialists down they couldnt help but it might salve your conscience to pay them a few hundred guineas  would you meet them dominey asked anxiously tell me whom to send for  pooh those days are finished with me was the curt reply i would meet none of them i am a doctor no longer i have become a villager i go to see lady dominey as an old friend  give me your advice dominey begged is it of any use sending for specialists  just for the present none at all  and what about that horrible woman mrs unthank  part of your task if you are really going to take it up she stands between your wife and the sun  then why have you suffered her to remain there all those years dominey demanded  for one thing because there has been no one to replace her the doctor replied and for another because lady dominey believing that you slew her son has some fantastic idea of giving her a home and shelter as a kind of expiation  you think there is no affection between the two dominey asked  not a scrap was the blunt reply except that lady dominey is of so sweet and gentle a nature  the doctor paused abruptly his visitors fingers had strayed across his throat  thats a different matter the former continued fiercely thats just where the weak spot in her brain remains if you ask me i believe its pandered to by mrs unthank come to think of it he went on the domineys were never cowards if youve got your courage back send mrs unthank away sleep with your doors wide open if a single night passes without lady dominey coming to your room with a knife in her hand she will be cured in time of that mania at any rate dare you do that  domineys hesitation was palpablealso his agitation the doctor grinned contemptuously  still afraid he scoffed  not in the way you imagine his visitor replied my wife has already promised to make no further attempt upon my life  well you can cure her if you want to the doctor declared and if you do you will have the sweetest companion for life any man could have but youll have to give up the idea of town houses and racing and yachting and grouse moors in scotland and all those sort of things i suppose youve been looking forward to youll have for some time at any rate to give every moment of your time to your wife  dominey moved uneasily in his chair  for the next few months he said that would be impossible  impossible  the doctor repeated the word seemed to roll it round in his mouth with a sort of wondering scorn  i am not quite the idler i used to be dominey explained frowning nowadays you cannot make money without assuming responsibilities i am clearing off the whole of the mortgages upon the dominey estates within the next few months  how you spend your time is your affair not mine the doctor muttered all i say about the matter is that your wifes cure if ever it comes to pass is in your hands and nowcome over to me here in the light of this window i want to look at you  dominey obeyed with a little shrug of the shoulders there was no sunshine but the white north light was in its way searching it showed the sprinkling of grey in his ruddybrown hair the suspicion of it in his closely trimmed moustache but it could find no weak spot in his steady eyes in the tan of his hard manly complexion or even in the set of his somewhat arrogant lips the old doctor took up his box of flies again and jerked his head towards the door  you are a miracle he said and i hate miracles ill come and see lady dominey in a day or so    chapter xii  dominey spent a curiously placid and to those with whom he was brought into contact an entirely satisfactory afternoon with mr mangan by his side murmuring amiable platitudes and mr johnson his agent opposite revelling in the unusual situation of a satisfied landlord and delighted tenants he made practically the entire round of the dominey estates they reached home late but dominey although he seemed to be living in another world was not neglectful of the claims of hospitality probably for the first time in their lives mr johnson and lees the bailiff watched the opening of a magnum of champagne mr johnson cleared his throat as he raised his glass  it isnt only on my own account sir everard he said that i drink your hearty good health i have your tenants too in my mind theyve had a rough time some of them and theyve stood it like white men so heres from them and me to you sir and may we see plenty of you in these parts  mr lees associated himself with these sentiments and the glasses were speedily emptied and filled again  i suppose you know sir everard the agent observed that what youve promised to do today will cost a matter of ten to fifteen thousand pounds  dominey nodded  before i go to bed tonight he said i shall send a cheque for twenty thousand pounds to the estate account at your bank at wells the money is there waiting put aside for just that one purpose andwell you may just as well have it  agent and bailiff leaned back in the tonneau of their motorcar half an hour later with immense cigars in their mouths and a pleasant rippling warmth in their veins they had the sense of having drifted into fairyland their philosophy however met the situation  its a fair miracle mr lees declared  a modern romance mr johnson who read novels murmured hello heres a visitor for the hall he added as a car swept by them  comfortablelooking gent too mr lees remarked  the comfortablelooking gent was otto seaman who presented himself at the hall with a small dressingbag and a great many apologies  found myself in norwich sir everard he explained i have done business there all my life and one of my customers needed looking after i finished early and when i found that i was only thirty miles off you i couldnt resist having a run across if it is in any way inconvenient to put me up for the night say so  my dear fellow dominey interrupted there are a score of rooms ready all that we need is to light a fire and an oldfashioned bedwarmer will do the rest you remember mr mangan  the two men shook hands and seaman accepted a little refreshment after his drive he lingered behind for a moment after the dressing bell had rung  what time is that fellow going he asked  nine oclock tomorrow morning dominey replied  not a word until then seaman whispered back i must not seem to be hanging after you too muchi really did not want to comebut the matter is urgent  we can send mangan to bed early dominey suggested  i am the early bird myself was the weary reply i was up all last night tomorrow morning will do  dinner that night was a pleasant and social meal mr mangan especially was uplifted everything to do with the domineys for the last fifteen years had reeked of poverty he had really had a hard struggle to make both ends meet there had been disagreeable interviews with angry tenants formal interviews with dissatisfied mortgagees and remarkably little profit at the end of the year to set against these disagreeable episodes the new situation was almost beatific the concluding touch perhaps was in parkins congratulatory whisper as he set a couple of decanters upon the table  i have found a bin of cockburns fiftyone sir he announced including the lawyer in his confidential whisper i thought you might like to try a couple of bottles as mr mangan seems rather a connoisseur sir the corks appear to be in excellent condition  after this mr mangan sighed it will be hard to get back to the austere life of a pall mall club  seaman very early in the evening pleaded an extraordinary sleepiness and retired leaving his host and mangan alone over the port dominey although an attentive host seemed a little abstracted even mr mangan who was not an observant man was conscious that a certain hardness almost arrogance of speech and manner seemed temporarily to have left his patron  i cant tell you sir everard he said as he sipped his first glass of wine what a pleasure it is to me to see as it were this recrudescence of an old family if i might be allowed to say so theres only one thing necessary to round the whole business off as it were  and that dominey asked unthinkingly  the return of lady dominey to health i was one of the few you may remember privileged to make her acquaintance at the time of your marriage  i paid a visit this morning dominey said to the doctor who has been in attendance upon her since her marriage he agrees with me that there is no reason why lady dominey should not in course of time be restored to perfect health  i take the liberty of finishing my glass to that hope sir everard the lawyer murmured  both glasses were set down empty only the stem of domineys was snapped in two mr mangan expressed his polite regrets  this old glass he murmured looking at his own admiringly becomes very fragile  dominey did not answer his brain had served him a strange trick in the shadows of the room he had fancied that he could see stephanie eiderstrom holding out her arms calling to him to fulfill the pledges of long ago and behind her  have you ever been in love mangan dominey asked his companion  i sir well im not sure the man of the world replied a little startled by the abruptness of the question its an oldfashioned way of looking at things now isnt it  dominey relapsed into thoughtfulness  i suppose so he admitted    that night a storm rolled up from somewhere across that grey waste of waters a storm heralded by a wind which came booming over the marshes shaking the latticed windows of dominey place shrieking and wailing amongst its chimneys and around its many corners black clouds leaned over the land and drenching streams of rain dashed against the looseframed sashes of the windows dominey lit the tall candles in his bedroom fastened a dressinggown around him threw himself into an easychair and fixing an electric reading lamp by his side tried to read very soon the book slipped from his fingers he became suddenly tense and watchful his eyes counted one by one the panels in the wall by the lefthand side of the bed the familiar click was twice repeated for a moment a dark space appeared then a woman stooping low glided into the room she came slowly towards him drawn like a moth towards that semicircle of candle her hair hung down her back like a girls and the white dressinggown which floated diaphanously about her was unexpectedly reminiscent of bond street  you are not afraid she asked anxiously see i have nothing in my hands i almost think that the desire has gone you remember the little stiletto i had last night today i threw it into the well mrs unthank was very angry with me  i am not afraid he assured her but  ah but you will not scold me she begged it is the storm which terrifies me  he drew a low chair for her into the little circle of light and arranged some cushions as she sank into it she suddenly looked up at him and smiled a smile of rare and wonderful beauty dominey felt for a moment something like the stab of a knife at his heart  sit here and rest he invited there is nothing to fear  in my heart i know that she answered simply these storms are part of our lives they come with birth and they shake the world when death seizes us one should not be afraid but i have been so ill everard shall i call you everard still  why not he asked  because you are not like everard to me any more she told him because something has gone from you and something has come to you you are not the same man what is it had you troubles in africa did you learn what life was like out there  he sat looking at her for a moment leaning back in his chair which he had pushed a few feet into the shadows her hair was glossy and splendid and against it her skin seemed whiter and more delicate than ever her eyes were lustrous but plaintive and with something of the childs fear of harm in them she looked very young and very fragile to have been swayed through the years by an evil passion  i learnt many things there rosamund he told her quietly i learnt a little of the difference between right doing and wrongdoing i learnt too that all the passions of life burn themselves out save one alone  she twisted the girdle of her dressinggown in her fingers for a moment his last speech seemed to have been outside the orbit of her comprehension or interest  you need not be afraid of me any more everard she said a little pathetically  i have no fear of you he answered  then why dont you bring your chair forward and come and sit a little nearer to me she asked raising her eyes do you hear the wind how it shrieks at us oh i am afraid  he moved forward to her side and took her hand gently in his her fingers responded at once to his pressure when he spoke he scarcely recognised his own voice it seemed to him thick and choked  the wind shall not hurt you or anything else he promised i have come back to take care of you  she sighed smiled like a tired child and her eyes closed as her head fell farther back amongst the cushions  stay just like that please she begged something quite new is coming to me i am resting it is the sweetest rest i ever felt dont move everard let my fingers stay in yoursso  the candles burned down in their sockets the wind rose to greater furies and died away only as the dawn broke through the storm clouds a pale light stole into the room still the woman slept and still her fingers seemed to keep their clutch upon his hand her breathing was all the time soft and regular her silky black eyelashes lay motionless upon her pale cheeks her moutha very perfectly shaped mouthrested in quiet lines somehow he realised that about this slumber there was a new thing with hot eyes and aching limbs he sat through the night dream after dream rose up and passed away before that little background of tapestried wall when she opened her eyes and looked at him the same smile parted her lips as the smile which had come there when she had passed away to sleep  i am so rested she murmured i feel so well i have had dreams beautiful dreams  the fire had burned out and the room was chilly  you must go back to your own room now he said  very slowly her fingers relaxed she held out her arms  carry me she begged i am only half awake i want to sleep again  he lifted her up her fingers closed around his neck her head fell back with a little sigh of content he tried the folding doors and finding some difficulty in opening them carried her out into the corridor into her own room and laid her upon the untouched bed  you are quite comfortable he asked  quite she murmured drowsily kiss me everard  her hands drew his face down his lips rested upon her forehead then he drew the bedclothes over her and fled    chapter xiii  there was a cloud on seamans goodhumoured face as muffled up in their overcoats he and his host walked up and down the terrace the next morning after the departure of mr mangan he disclosed his mind a little abruptly  in a few minutes he said i shall come to the great purpose of my visit i have great and wonderful news for you but it will keep  the time for action has arrived dominey asked curiously i hope you will remember that as yet i am scarcely established here  it is with regard to your establishment here seaman explained drily that i desire to say a word we have seen much of one another since we met in cape town the passion and purpose of my life you have been able to judge of those interludes which are necessary to a human being unless his system is to fall to pieces as dry dust you have also seen something i trust you will not misunderstand me when i say that apart from the necessities of my work i am a man of sentiment  i am prepared to admit it dominey murmured a little idly  you have undertaken a great enterprise it was without a doubt a miraculous piece of fortune which brought the englishman dominey to your camp just at the moment when you received your orders from headquarters your selfconceived plan has met with every encouragement from us you will be placed in a unique position to achieve your final purpose now mark my words and do not misunderstand me the very keynote of our progress is ruthlessness to take even a single step forward towards the achievement of that purpose is worth the sacrifice of all the scruples and delicacies conceivable but when a certain course of action is without profit to our purpose i see ugliness in it it distresses me  what the devil do you mean dominey demanded  i sleep with one ear open seaman replied  well  i saw you leave your room early this morning seaman continued carrying lady dominey in your arms  there were little streaks of pallor underneath the tan in domineys face his eyes were like glittering metal it was only when he had breathed once or twice quickly that he could command his voice  what concern is this of yours he demanded  seaman gripped his companions arm  look here he said we are too closely allied for bluff i am here to help you fill the shoes of another man so far as regards his estates his position and character which by the by you are rehabilitating i will go further i will admit that it is not my concern to interfere in any ordinary amour you might undertake buti shall tell you this my friend to your facethat to deceive a lady of weak intellect however beautiful to make use of your position as her supposed husband is not save in the vital interests of his country the action of a prussian nobleman  domineys passion seemed to have burned itself out without expression he showed not the slightest resentment at his companions words  have no fear seaman he enjoined him the situation is delicate but i can deal with it as a man of honour  you relieve me seaman confessed you must admit that the spectacle of last night was calculated to inspire me with uneasiness  i respect you for your plain words dominey declared the fact is that lady dominey was frightened of the storm last night and found her way into my room you may be sure that i treated her with all the respect and sympathy which our positions demanded  lady dominey seaman remarked meditatively seems to be curiously falsifying certain predictions  in what way  the common impression in the neighbourhood here is that she is a maniac chiefly upon one subjecther detestation of you she has been known to take an oath that you should die if you slept in this house again you naturally being a brave man ignored all this yet in the morning after your first night here there was blood upon your night clothes  domineys eyebrows were slowly raised  you are well served here he observed with involuntary sarcasm  that for your own sake as well as ours is necessary was the terse reply to continue people of unsound mind are remarkably tenacious of their ideas there was certainly nothing of the murderess in her demeanour towards you last night cannot you see that a too friendly attitude on her part might become fatal to our schemes  in what way  if ever your identity is doubted seaman explained the probability of which is i must confess becoming less every day the fact that lady dominey seems to have so soon forgotten all her enmity towards you would be strong presumptive evidence that you are not the man you claim to be  ingenious dominey assented and very possible all this time however we speak on what you yourself admit to be a side issue  you are right seaman confessed very well then listen a great moment has arrived for you my friend  explain if you please  i shall do so you have seen proof during the last few days that you have an organisation behind you to whom money is dross it is the same in diplomacy as in war germany will pay the price for what she intends to achieve ninety thousand pounds was yesterday passed to the credit of your account for the extinction of certain mortgages in a few months or a few years time some distant dominey will benefit to that extent we cannot recover the money it is just an item in our day by day expenses  it was certainly a magnificent way of establishing me dominey admitted  magnificent but safest in the long run seaman declared if you had returned a poor man everybodys hand would have been against you suspicions now absolutely unkindled might have been formed and more important perhaps than either you would not have been able to take your place in society which is absolutely necessary for the furtherance of our scheme  is it not almost time dominey enquired that the way was made a little clearer for me  that would have been my task this morning seaman replied but for the news i bring in passing however let me promise you this you will never be asked to stoop to the crooked ways of the ordinary spy we want you for a different purpose  and the news  what must be the greatest desire in your heart seaman said solemnly is to be granted the kaiser has expressed a desire to see you to give you his instructions in person  dominey stopped short upon the terrace he withdrew his arm from his companions and stared at him blankly  the kaiser he exclaimed you mean that i am to go to germany  we shall start at once seaman replied personally i do not consider the proceeding discreet or necessary it has been decided upon however without consulting me  i consider it suicidal dominey protested what explanation can i possibly make for going to germany of all countries in the world before i have had time to settle down here  that of itself will not be difficult his companion pointed out many of the mines in which a share has been bought in your name are being run with german capital it is easy to imagine that a crisis has arisen in the management of one of them we require the votes of our fellow shareholders you need not trouble your head about that and think of the wonder of it if only for a single day your sentence of banishment is lifted you will breathe the air of the fatherland once more  it will be wonderful dominey muttered  it will be for you seaman promised a breath of the things that are to come and now action how i love action that timetable my friend and your chauffeur  it was arranged that the two men should leave during the morning for norwich by motorcar and thence to harwich dominey having changed into travelling clothes sent a messenger for mrs unthank who came to him presently in his study he held out a chair to her which she declined however to take  mrs unthank he said i should like to know why you have been content to remain my wifes attendant for the last ten years  mrs unthank was startled by the suddenness of the attack  lady dominey has needed me she answered after a moments pause  do you consider he asked that you have been the best possible companion for her  she has never been willing to accept any other the woman replied  are you very devoted to my wife he enquired  mrs unthank grim and fierce though she was and appeared to be was obviously disconcerted by domineys line of questions  if i werent she demanded should i have been here all these years  i scarcely see he continued what particular claim my wife has had upon you i understand moreover that you are one of those who firmly believe that i killed your son is this attendance upon my wife a christian act thenthe returning of good for evil  exactly what do you want to say to me sir everard she asked harshly  i wish to say this dominey replied that i am determined to bring about my wifes restoration to health for that reason i am going to have specialists down here and above all things to change for a time her place of residence my own feeling is that she will stand a much better chance of recovery without your attendance  you would dare to send me away the woman demanded  that is my intention dominey confessed i have not spoken to lady dominey yet but i hope that very soon my influence over her will be such that she will be content to obey my wishes i look upon your future from the financial point of view as my care i shall settle upon you the sum of three hundred pounds a year  the woman showed her first sign of weakness she began to shake there was a curious look of fear in her eyes  i cant leave this place sir everard she cried i must stay here  why he demanded  lady dominey couldnt do without me she answered sullenly  that he replied is for her to decide personally from enquiries i have made i believe that you have encouraged in her that ridiculous superstition about the ghost of your son i also believe that you have kept alive in her that spirit of unreasonable hatred which she has felt towards me  unreasonable you call it the woman almost shouted you who came home to her with the blood on your hands of the man whom if only you had kept away she might one day have loved unreasonable you call it  i have finished what i had to say mrs unthank dominey declared i am compelled by important business to leave here for two or three days on my return i shall embark upon the changes with which i have acquainted you in the meantime he added watching a curious change in the womans expression i have written this morning to doctor harrison asking him to come up this afternoon and to keep lady dominey under his personal observation until my return  she stood quite still looking at him then she came a little nearer and leaned forward as though studying his face  eleven years she muttered do change many men but i never knew a man made out of a weakling  i have nothing more to say to you dominey replied except to let you know that i am coming to see my wife in the space of a few minutes    the motorhorn was already sounding below when dominey was admitted to his wifes apartment she was dressed in a loose gown of a warm crimson colour and she had the air of one awaiting his arrival expectantly the passion of hatred seemed to have passed from her pale face and from the depths of her strangely soft eyes she held out her hands towards him her brows were a little puckered the disappointment of a child lurked in her manner  you are going away she murmured  in a very few moments he told her i have been waiting to see you for an hour  she made a grimace  it was mrs unthank i think that she hid my things on purpose i was so anxious to see you  i want to talk to you about mrs unthank he said should you be very unhappy if i sent her away and found some one younger and kinder to be your companion  the idea seemed to be outside the bounds of her comprehension  mrs unthank would never go she declared she stays here to listen to the voice all night long sometimes she waits and listens and it doesnt come then she hears it and she is rested  and you he asked  i am afraid she confessed but then you see i am not very strong  you are not fond of mrs unthank he enquired anxiously  i dont think so she answered in a perplexed tone i think i am very much afraid of her but it is no use everard she would never go away  when i return dominey said we shall see  she took his arm and linked her hands through it  i am so sorry that you are going she murmured i hope you will soon come back will you come backmy husband  domineys nails cut into the flesh of his clenched hands  i will come back within three days he promised  do you know she went on confidentially something has come into my mind lately i spoke about it yesterday but i did not tell you what it was you need never be afraid of me any more i understand  what do you understand he demanded huskily  the knowledge must have come to me she went on dropping her voice a little and whispering almost in his ear at the very moment when my dagger rested upon your throat when i suddenly felt the desire to kill die away you are very like him sometimes but you are not everard you are not my husband at all you are another man  dominey gave a little gasp they both turned towards the door mrs unthank was standing there her gaunt hard face lit up with a gleam of something which was like triumph her eyes glittering her lips as though involuntarily repeated her mistress last words  another man    chapter xiv  there were times during their rapid journey when seaman studying his companion became thoughtful dominey seemed indeed to have passed beyond the boundaries of any ordinary reserve to have become like a man immeshed in the toils of a past so absorbing that he moved as though in a dream speaking only when necessary and comporting himself generally like one to whom all externals have lost significance as they embarked upon the final stage of their travels seaman leaned forward in his seat in the sombrely upholstered overheated compartment  your homecoming seems to depress you von ragastein he said  it was not my intention dominey replied to set foot in germany again for many years  the past still bites  always  the train sped on through long chains of vineyardcovered hills out into a stretch of flat country into forests of pines in the midst of which were great cleared spaces where notwithstanding the closely drawn windows the resinous odour from the fallen trunks seemed to permeate the compartment presently they slackened speed seaman glanced at his watch and rose  prepare yourself my friend he said we descend in a few minutes  dominey glanced out of the window  but where are we he enquired  within five minutes of our destination  but there is not a house in sight dominey remarked wonderingly  you will be received on board his majestys private train seaman announced the kaiser with his staff is making one of his military tours we are honoured by being permitted to travel back with him as far as the belgian frontier  they had come to a standstill now a bearded and uniformed official threw open the door of their compartment and they stepped on to the narrow wooden platform of a small station which seemed to have been recently built of fresh pine planks the train immediately they had alighted passed on their journey was over  a brief conversation was carried on between seaman and the official during which dominey took curious note of his surroundings around the station half hidden in some places by the trees and shrubs was drawn a complete cordon of soldiers who seemed to have recently disembarked from a military train which stood upon a siding in the middle of it was a solitary saloon carriage painted black with much gold ornamentation and having emblazoned upon the central panel the royal arms of germany seaman when he had finished his conversation took dominey by the arm and led him across the line towards it an officer received them at the steps and bowed punctiliously to dominey at whom he gazed with much interest  his majesty will receive you at once he announced follow me  they boarded the train and passed along a richly carpeted corridor their guide paused and pointed to a small retiringroom where several men were seated  herr seaman will find friends there he said his imperial majesty will receive him for a few minutes later the baron von ragastein will come this way  dominey was ushered now into the main saloon his guide motioned him to remain near the entrance and himself advancing a few paces stood at the salute before a seated figure who was bending over a map which a sternfaced man in the uniform of a general had unrolled before him the kaiser glanced up at the sound of footsteps and whispered something in the generals ear the latter clicked his heels together and retired the kaiser beckoned dominey to advance  the baron von ragastein your majesty the young officer murmured  dominey stood at attention for a moment and bowed a little awkwardly the kaiser smiled  it pleases me he said to see a german officer ill at ease without his uniform count you will leave us baron von ragastein be seated  sir everard dominey at your service majesty dominey replied as he took the chair to which his august host pointed  thorough in all things i see the latter observed sit there and be at your ease good reports have reached me of your work in africa  i did my best to execute your majestys will dominey ventured  you did so well the kaiser pronounced that my counsellors were unanimous in advising your withdrawal to what will shortly become the great centre of interest from the moment of receiving our commands you appear to have displayed initiative i gather that your personation of this english baronet has been successfully carried through  up to the present your majesty  important though your work in africa was the kaiser continued your present task is a far greater one i wish to speak to you for these few minutes without reserve first though drink a toast with me  from a mahogany stand at his elbow the kaiser drew out a longnecked bottle of moselle filled two very beautiful glasses passed one to his companion and raised the other  to the fatherland he said  to the fatherland dominey repeated  they set down their glasses empty the kaiser threw back the grey military cloak which he was wearing displaying a long row of medals and decorations his fingers still toyed with the stem of his wineglass he seemed for a moment to lose himself in thought his hard and somewhat cruel mouth was tightly closed there was a slight frown upon his forehead he was sitting upright taking no advantage of the cushioned back of his easychair his eyes a little screwed up the frown deepening for quite five minutes there was complete silence one might have gathered that turning aside from great matters he had been devoting himself entirely to the scheme in which dominey was concerned  von ragastein he said at last i have sent for you to have a few words concerning your habitation in england i wish you to receive your impressions of your mission from my own lips  your majesty does me great honour dominey murmured  i wish you to consider yourself the kaiser continued as entirely removed from the limits the authority and the duties of my espionage system from you i look for other things i desire you to enter into the spirit of your assumed position as a typical english country gentleman i desire you to study the labour question the irish question the progress of this national service scheme and other social movements of which you will receive notice in due time i desire a list compiled of those writers who in the reviews or by means of fiction are encouraging the suspicions which i am inclined to fancy england has begun to entertain towards the fatherland these things are all on the fringe of your real mission that i believe our admirable friend seaman has already confided to you it is to seek the friendship if possible the intimacy of prince terniloff  the kaiser paused and once more his eyes wandered to the landscape which rolled away from the plateglass windows of the car they were certainly not the eyes of a dreamer and yet in those moments they seemed filled with brooding pictures  the princess has already received me graciously dominey confided  terniloff is the dove of peace the kaiser pronounced he carries the sprig of olive in his mouth my statesmen and counsellors would have sent to london an ambassador with sterner qualities i preferred not terniloff is the man to gull fools because he is a fool himself he is a fit ambassador for a country which has not the wit to arm itself on land as well as by sea when it sees a nation mightier more cultured more splendidly led than its own creeping closer every day  the english appear to put their whole trust in their navy your majesty dominey observed tentatively  the eyes of his companion flashed his lips curled contemptuously  fools he exclaimed of what use will their navy be when my sword is once drawn when i hold the coast towns of calais and boulogne when my cannon command the straits of dover the days of insular nations are passed passed as surely as the days of englands arrogant supremacy upon the seas  the kaiser refilled his glass and domineys  in some months time von ragastein he continued you will understand why you have been enjoined to become the friend and companion of terniloff you will understand your mission a little more clearly than you do now its exact nature waits upon developments you can at all times trust seaman  dominey bowed and remained silent his companion continued after another brief spell of silent brooding  von ragastein he said my decree of banishment against you was a just one the morals of my people are as sacred to me as my oath to win for them a mightier empire you first of all betrayed the wife of one of the most influential noblemen of a state allied to my own and then in the duel that followed you slew him  it was an accident your majesty dominey pleaded i had no intention of even wounding the prince  the kaiser frowned all manner of excuses were loathsome to him  the accident should have happened the other way he rejoined sharply i should have lost a valuable servant but it was your life which was forfeit and not his still they tell me that your work in africa was well and thoroughly done i give you this one great chance of rehabilitation if your work in england commends itself to me the sentence of exile under which you suffer shall be rescinded  your majesty is too good dominey murmured the work for its own sake will command my every effort even without the hope of reward  that the kaiser said is well spoken it is the spirit i believe with which every son of my empire regards the future i think that they too more especially those who surround my person have felt something of that divine message which has come to me for many years i have for the sake of my people willed peace now that the time draws near when heaven has shown me another duty i have no fear but that every loyal german will bow his head before the lightnings which will play around my sword and share with me the iron will to wield it your audience is finished baron von ragastein you will take your place with the gentlemen of my suite in the retiringroom we shall proceed within a few minutes and leave you at the belgian frontier  dominey rose bowed stiffly and backed down the carpeted way the kaiser was already bending once more over the map seaman who was waiting outside the door of the anteroom called him in and introduced him to several members of the suite one a young man with a fixed monocle scars upon his face and a queer puppetlike carriage looked at him a little strangely  we met some years ago in munich baron he remarked  i acknowledge no former meetings with any one in this country dominey replied stiffly i obey the orders of my imperial master when i wipe from my mind every episode or reminiscence of my former days  the young mans face cleared and seaman by his side who had knitted his brows thoughtfully nodded understandingly  you are certainly a good actor baron he declared even your german has become a little english sit down and join us in a glass of beer luncheon will be served to us here in a few minutes you will not be recalled to the presence until we set you down  dominey bowed stiffly and took his place with the others the train had already started dominey gazed thoughtfully out of the window seaman who was waiting about for his audience patted him on the arm  dear friend he said i sympathise with you you sorrow because your back is now to berlin still remember this that the day is not far off when the sentence of exile against you will be annulled you will have expiated that crime which believe me although i do not venture to claim a place amongst them none of your friends and equals have ever regarded in the same light as his imperial majesty  a smiling steward in black livery with white facings made his appearance and served them with beer in tall glasses the senior officer there who had now seated himself opposite to dominey raised his glass and bowed  to the baron von ragastein he said whose acquaintance i regret not having made before today may we soon welcome him back a brother in arms a companion in great deeds hoch    chapter xv  sir everard dominey baronet the latest and most popular recruit to norfolk sporting society stood one afternoon some months after his return from germany at the corner of the long wood which stretched from the ridge of hills behind almost to the kitchen gardens of the hall at a reasonable distance on his left four other guns were posted on one side of him stood middleton leaning on his ash stick and listening to the approach of the beaters on the other seaman curiously out of place in his dark grey suit and bowler hat the old keeper whom time seemed to have cured of all his apprehensions was softly garrulous and very happy  that do seem right to have a squire dominey at this corner he observed watching a high cock pheasant come crashing down over their heads i mind when the squire your father sir gave up this corner one day to lord wendermere whom folks called one of the finest pheasant shots in england and though they streamed over his head like starlings hed nowt but a few cripples to show for his mornings work  come out with a bit of a twist from the left dont they dominey remarked repeating his late exploit  they do that sir the old man assented and no one but a dominey seems to have learnt the knack of dealing with them proper that foreign prince so they say is well on to his birds but i wouldnt trust him at this corner  the old man moved off a few paces to some higher ground to watch the progress of the beaters through the wood seaman turned to his companion and there was a note of genuine admiration in his tone  my friend he declared you are a miracle you seem to have developed the dominey touch even in killing pheasants  you must remember that i have shot higher ones in hungary was the easy reply  i am not a sportsman seaman admitted i do not understand sport but i do know this there is an old man who has lived on this land since the day of his birth who has watched you shoot reverently and finds even the way you hold your gun familiar  that twist of the birds dominey explained is simply a local superstition the wood ends on the slant and they seem to be flying more to the left than they really are  seaman gazed steadfastly for a moment along the side of the wood  her grace is coming he said she seems to share the dukes dislike of me and she is too great a lady to conceal her feelings just one word before i go the princess eiderstrom arrives this afternoon  dominey frowned then warned by the keepers shout turned around and killed a hare  my friend he said with a certain note of challenge in his tone i am not certain that you have told me all that you know concerning the princesss visit  seaman was thoughtful for a brief space of time  you are right he admitted i have not it is a fault which i will repair presently  he strolled away to the next stand where mr mangan was displaying an altogether different standard of proficiency the duchess came up to dominey a few minutes later  i told henry i shouldnt stop with him another moment she declared he has fired off about forty cartridges and wounded one hare  henry is not keen dominey remarked although i think you are a little hard on him are you not i saw him bring down a nice cock just now so far as regards the birds it really does not matter they are all going home  the duchess was very smartly tailored in clothes of brown leather mixture she wore thick shoes and gaiters and a small hat she was looking very well but a little annoyed  i hear she said that stephanie is coming today  dominey nodded and seemed for a moment intent on watching the flight of a pigeon which kept tantalisingly out of range  she is coming down for a few days he assented i am afraid that she will be bored to death  where did you become so friendly with her his cousin asked curiously  the first time we ever met dominey replied was in the carlton grill room a few days after i landed in england she mistook me for some one else and we parted with the usual apologies i met her the same night at carlton house terraceshe is related to the terniloffsand we came across one another pretty often after that during the short time i was in town  yes the duchess murmured meditatively that is another of the little surprises you seem to have all ready dished up for us how on earth did you become so friendly with the german ambassador  dominey smiled tolerantly  really he replied there is not anything so very extraordinary about it is there mr seaman my partner in one or two mining enterprises took me to call upon him he is very interested in east africa politically and as a sportsman our conversations seemed to interest him and led to a certain intimacyof which i may say that i am proud i have the greatest respect and liking for the prince  so have i caroline agreed i think hes charming henry declares that he must be either a fool or a knave  henry is blinded by prejudice dominey declared a little impatiently he cannot imagine a german who feasts with any one else but the devil  dont get annoyed dear she begged resting her fingers for a moment upon his coat sleeve i admire the prince immensely he is absolutely the only german i ever met whom one felt instinctively to be a gentlemannow what are you smiling at  dominey turned a perfectly serious face towards her not guilty he pleaded  i saw you smile  it was just a quaint thought you are rather sweeping are you not caroline  im generally right she declaredto return to the subject of stephanie  well  do you know whom she mistook you for in the carlton grill room  tell me he answered evasively  she mistook you for a baron leopold von ragastein caroline continued drily von ragastein was her lover in hungary he fought a duel with her husband and killed him the kaiser was furious and banished him to east africa  dominey picked up his shootingstick and handed his gun to middleton the beaters were through the wood  yes i remember now he said she addressed me as leopold  i still dont see why it was necessary to invite her here his companion observed a little petulantly she maycall you leopold again  if she does i shall be deaf dominey promised but seriously she is a cousin of the princess terniloff and the two women are devoted to one another the princess hates shooting parties so i thought they could entertain one another  bosh stephanie will monopolise you all the time thats whats shes coming for  you are not suggesting that she intends seriously to put me in the place of my double dominey asked with mock alarm  oh i shouldnt wonder and shes an extraordinarily attractive woman im full of complaints everard theres that other horrible little man seaman you know that the very sight of him makes henry furious i am quite sure that he never expected to sit down at the same table with him  i am really sorry about that dominey assured her but you see his excellency takes a great interest in him on account of this friendship league of which seaman is secretary and he particularly asked to have him here  well you must admit that the situation is a little awkward for henry she complained next to lord roberts henry is practically the leader of the national service movement here he hates germany and distrusts every german he ever met and in a small house party like this we meet the german ambassador and a man who is working hard to lull to sleep the very sentiments which henry is endeavouring to arouse  it sounds very pathetic dominey admitted with a smile but even henry likes terniloff and after all it is stimulating to meet ones opponents sometimes  of course he likes terniloff caroline assented but he hates the things he stands for however id have forgiven you everything if only stephanie werent coming that woman is really beginning to irritate me she always seems to be making mysterious references to some sentimental past in which you both are concerned and for which there can be no foundation at all except your supposed likeness to her exiled lover why you never met her until that day at the carlton  she was a complete stranger to me dominey asserted  then all i can say is that you have been unusually rapid if youve managed to create a past in something under three months caroline pronounced suspiciously i call her coming here a most barefaced proceeding especially as this is practically a bachelor establishment  they had arrived at the next stand and conversation was temporarily suspended a flight of wild duck were put out from a pool in the wood and for a few minutes every one was busy middleton watched his master with unabated approval  youre most as good as the old squire with them high duck sir everard he said thats true very few can touch em when theyre coming out nigh to the pheasants they cant believe in the speed of em  do you think sir everard shoots as well as he did before he went to africa caroline asked  middleton touched his hat and turned to seaman who was standing in the background  better your grace he answered as i was saying to this gentleman here early this morning hes cooler like and swings more level id have known his touch on a gun anywhere though  there was a glint of admiration in seamans eyes the beaters came through the wood and the little party of guns gossiped together while the game was collected terniloff his usual pallor chased away by the bracing wind and the pleasure of the sport was affable and even loquacious he had great estates of his own in saxony and was explaining to the duke his manner of shooting them middleton glanced at his hornrimmed watch  theres another hours good light sir he said would you care about a partridge drive or should we do through the home copse  if i might make a suggestion terniloff observed diffidently most of the pheasants went into that gloomylooking wood just across the marshes  there was a moments rather curious silence dominey had turned and was looking towards the wood in question as though fascinated by its almost sinisterlike blackness and density middleton had dropped some game he was carrying and was muttering to himself  we call that the black wood dominey said calmly and i am rather afraid that the pheasants who find their way there claim sanctuary what do you think middleton  the old man turned his head slowly and looked at his master somehow or other every scrap of colour seemed to have faded out of his bronzed face his eyes were filled with that vague horror of the supernatural common amongst the peasant folk of various localities his voice shook the old fear was back again  you wouldnt put the beaters in there squire he faltered not that theres one of them would go  have we stumbled up against a local superstition the duke enquired  thats not altogether local your grace middleton replied as the squire himself will tell you i doubt whether theres a beater in all norfolk would go through the black wood if you paid him red gold for ithere you lads  he turned to the beaters who were standing waiting for instructions a few yards away there were a dozen of them stalwart men for the most part clad in rough smocks and breeches and carrying thick sticks  theres one of the gentlemen here middleton announced addressing them who wants to know if youd go through the black wood of dominey for a sovereign apiecewatch their faces your gracenow then lads  there was no possibility of any mistake the very suggestion seemed to have taken the healthy sunburn from their cheeks they fumbled with their sticks uneasily one of them touched his hat and spoke to dominey  im one as as seen it sir as well as heard he said id sooner give up my farm than go nigh the place  caroline suddenly passed her arm through domineys there was a note of distress in her tone  henry youre an idiot she exclaimed it was my fault everard im so sorry just for one moment i had forgotten i ought to have stopped henry at once the poor man has no memory  domineys arm responded for a moment to the pressure of her fingers then he turned to the beaters  well no one is going to ask you to go to the black wood he promised get round to the back of hunts stubbles and bring them into the roots and then over into the park we will line the park fence how is that middleton  the keeper touched his hat and stepped briskly off  ill just have a walk with them myself sir he said them birds do break at fullers corner ill see if i can flank them youll know where to put the guns squire  dominey nodded one and all the beaters were walking with most unaccustomed speed towards their destination their backs were towards the black wood terniloff came up to his host  have i by chance been terribly tactless he asked  dominey shook his head  you asked a perfectly natural question prince he replied there is no reason why you should not know the truth near that wood occurred the tragedy which drove me from england for so many years  i am deeply grieved the prince began  it is false sentiment to avoid allusions to it dominey interrupted i was attacked there one night by a man who had some cause for offence against me we fought and i reached home in a somewhat alarming state my condition terrified my wife so much that she has been an invalid ever since but here is the point which has given birth to all these superstitions and which made me for many years a suspected person the man with whom i fought has never been seen since  terniloff was at once too fascinated by the story and puzzled by his hosts manner of telling it to maintain his apologetic attitude  never seen since he repeated  my own memory as to the end of our fight is uncertain dominey continued my impression is that i left my assailant unconscious upon the ground  then it is his ghost i imagine who haunts the black wood  dominey shook himself as one who would get rid of an unwholesome thought  the wood itself prince he explained as they walked along is a noisome place there are quagmires even in the middle of it where a man may sink in and be never heard of again every sort of vermin abounds there every unclean insect and bird are to be found in the thickets i suppose the character of the place has encouraged the local superstition in which every one of those men firmly believes  they absolutely believe the place to be haunted then  the superstition goes further dominey continued our locals say that somewhere in the heart of the wood where i believe that no human being for many years has dared to penetrate there is living in the spiritual sense some sort of a demon who comes out only at night and howls underneath my windows  has any one ever seen it  one or two of the villagers to the best of my belief no one else dominey replied  terniloff seemed on the point of asking more questions but the duke touched him on the arm and drew him to one side as though to call his attention to the sea fogs which were rolling up from the marshes  prince he whispered the details of that story are inextricably mixed up with the insanity of lady dominey i am sure you understand  the prince a diplomatist to his fingertips appeared shocked although a furtive smile still lingered upon his lips  i regret my faux pas most deeply he murmured sir everard he went on you promised to tell me of some of your days with a shotgun in south africa isnt there a bird there which corresponds with your partridges  dominey smiled  if you can kill the partridges which middleton is going to send over in the next ten minutes he said you could shoot anything of the sort that comes along in east africa with a catapult if you will stand just a few paces there to the left henry terniloff by the gate stillwell up by the lefthand corner mangan next eddy next and i shall be just beyond towards the oak clump will you walk with me caroline  his cousin took his arm as they walked off and pressed it  everard i congratulate you she said you have conquered your nerve absolutely you did a simple and a fine thing to tell the whole story why you were almost matteroffact i could even have imagined you were telling it about some one else  her host smiled enigmatically  curious that it should have struck you like that he remarked do you know when i was telling it i had the same feelingdo you mind crouching down a little now i am going to blow the whistle    chapter xvi  even in the great diningroom of dominey hall the mahogany table which was its great glory was stretched that evening to its extreme capacity besides the house party which included the right honourable gerald watson a recently appointed cabinet minister there were several guests from the neighbourhoodthe lord lieutenant of the county and other notabilities caroline with the lord lieutenant on one side of her and terniloff on the other played the part of hostess adequately but without enthusiasm her eyes seldom left for long the other end of the table where stephanie at domineys left hand with her crown of exquisitely coiffured redgold hair her marvellous jewellery her languorous grace of manner seemed more like one of the beauties of an ancient venetian court than a modern hungarian princess gowned in the rue de la paix conversation remained chiefly local and concerned the days sport and kindred topics it was not until towards the close of the meal that the duke succeeded in launching his favourite bubble  i trust everard he said raising his voice a little as he turned towards his host that you make a point of inculcating the principles of national service into your tenantry here  domineys reply was a little dubious  i am afraid they do not take to the idea very kindly in this part of the world he confessed purely agricultural districts are always a little difficult  it is your duty as a landowner the duke insisted to alter their point of view there is not the slightest doubt he added looking belligerently over the top of his pince nez at seaman who was seated at the opposite side of the table that before long we shall find ourselvesand in a shocking state of unpreparedness mind youat war with germany  lady maddeley the wife of the lord lieutenant who sat at his side seemed a little startled she was probably one of the only people present who was not aware of the dukes foible  do you really think so she asked the germans seem such civilised people so peaceful and domestic in their home life and that sort of thing  the duke groaned he glanced down the table to be sure that prince terniloff was out of hearing  my dear lady maddeley he declared germany is not governed like england when the war comes the people will have had nothing to do with it a great many of them will be just as surprised as you will be but they will fight all the same  seaman who had kept silence during the last few moments with great difficulty now took up the dukes challenge  permit me to assure you madam he said bowing across the table that the war with germany of which the duke is so afraid will never come i speak with some amount of knowledge because i am a german by birth although naturalised in this country i have as many and as dear friends in berlin as in london and with the exception of my recent absence in africa where i had the pleasure to meet our host i spent a great part of my time going back and forth between the two capitals i have also the honour to be the secretary of a society for the promotion of a better understanding between the citizens of germany and england  rubbish the duke exclaimed the germans dont want a better understanding they only want to fool us into believing that they do  seaman looked a little pained he stuck to his guns however  his grace and i he observed are old opponents on this subject  we are indeed the duke agreed you may be an honest man mr seaman but you are a very ignorant one upon this particular topic  you are probably both right in your way dominey intervened very much in the manner of a wellbred host making his usual effort to smooth over two widely divergent points of view there is no doubt a war party in germany and a peace party statesmen who place economic progress first and others who are tainted with a purely military lust for conquest in this country it is very hard for us to strike a balance between the two  seaman beamed his thanks upon his host  i have friends he said impressively in the very highest circles of germany who are continually encouraging my work here and i have received the benediction of the kaiser himself upon my efforts to promote a better feeling in this country and if you will forgive my saying so duke it is such illadvised and illfounded statements as you are constantly making about my country which is the only bar to a better understanding between us  i have my views the duke snapped and they have become convictions i shall continue to express them at all times and with all the eloquence at my command  the ambassador to whom portions of this conversation had now become audible leaned a little forward in his place  let me speak first as a private individual he begged and express my wellstudied opinion that war between our two countries would be simply race suicide an indescribable and an abominable crime then i will remember what i represent over here and i will venture to add in my ambassadorial capacity that i come with an absolute and heartfelt mandate of peace my task over here is to secure and ensure it  caroline flashed a warning glance at her husband  how nice of you to be so frank prince she said the duke sometimes forgets in the pursuit of his hobby that a private dinner table is not a platform i insist upon it that we discuss something of more genuine interest  there isnt a more vital subject in the world the duke declared resigning himself however to silence  we will speak the ambassador suggested of the way in which our host brought down those tall pheasants  you will tell me perhaps seaman suggested to the lady to his right how you english women have been able to secure for yourselves so much more liberty than our german wives enjoy  later on stephanie whispered to her host with a little tremble in her voice i have a surprise for you  after dinner domineys guests passed naturally enough to the relaxations which each preferred there were two bridge tables terniloff and the cabinet minister played billiards and seaman with a touch which amazed every one drew strange music from the yellow keys of the oldfashioned grand piano in the drawingroom stephanie and her host made a slow progress through the hall and picture gallery for some time their conversation was engaged solely with the objects to which dominey drew his companions attention when they had passed out of possible hearing however of any of the other guests stephanies fingers tightened upon her companions arm  i wish to speak to you alone she said without the possibility of any one overhearing  dominey hesitated and looked behind  your guests are well occupied she continued a little impatiently and in any case i am one of them i claim your attention  dominey threw open the door of the library and turned on a couple of the electric lights she made her way to the great open fireplace on which a log was burning looked down into the shadows of the room and back again at her hosts face  for one moment she begged turn on all the lights i wish to be sure that we are alone  dominey did as he was bidden the furthermost corners of the room with its many wings of bookfilled shelves were illuminated she nodded  now turn them all out again except this one she directed and wheel me up an easychair no i choose this settee please seat yourself by my side  is this going to be serious he asked with some slight disquietude  serious but wonderful she murmured lifting her eyes to his will you please listen to me leopold  she was half curled up in a corner of the settee her head resting slightly upon her long fingers her brown eyes steadily fixed upon her companion there was an atmosphere about her of serious yet of tender things domineys face seemed to fall into more rigid lines as he realised the appeal of her eyes  leopold she began i left this country a few weeks ago feeling that you were a brute determined never to see you again half inclined to expose you before i went as an impostor and a charlatan germany means little to me and a patriotism which took no account of human obligations left me absolutely unresponsive i meant to go home and never to return to london my heart was bruised and i was very unhappy  she paused but her companion made no sign she paused for so long however that speech became necessary  you are speaking princess he said calmly to one who is not present my name is no longer leopold  she laughed at him with a curious mixture of tenderness and bitterness  my friend she continued i am terrified to think besides your name how much of humanity you have lost in your new identity to proceed it suited my convenience to remain for a few days in berlin and i was therefore compelled to present myself at potsdam there i received a great surprise wilhelm spoke to me of you and though alas my heart is still bruised he helped me to understand  is this wise he asked a little desperately  she ignored his words  i was taken back into favour at court she went on for that i owe to you my thanks wilhelm was much impressed by your recent visit to him and by the way in which you have established yourself here he spoke also with warm commendation of your labours in africa which he seemed to appreciate all the more as you were sent there an exile he asked me leopold she added dropping her voice a little if my feelings towards you remained unchanged  domineys face remained unrelaxed persistently he refused the challenge of her eyes  i told him the truth she proceeded i told him how it all began and how it must last with meto the end we spoke even of the duel i told him what both your seconds had explained to methat turn of the wrist conrads wild lunge how he literally threw himself upon the point of your sword wilhelm understands and forgives and he has sent you this letter  she drew a small grey envelope from her pocket on the seal were the imperial hohenzollern arms she passed it to him  leopold she whispered please read that  he shook his head although he accepted the letter with reluctant fingers  read the superscription she directed  he obeyed her it was addressed in a strange straggling handwriting to sir everard dominey baronet he broke the seal unwillingly and drew out the letter it was dated barely a fortnight back there was neither beginning or ending just a couple of sentences scrawled across the thick notepaper   it is my will that you offer your hand in marriage to the princess stephanie of eiderstrom your union shall be blessed by the church and approved by my court  wilhelm   dominey sat as a man enthralled with silence she watched him  not on your knees yet she asked with faint but somewhat resentful irony can it be leopold that you have lost your love for me you have changed so much and in so many ways has the love gone  even to himself his voice sounded harsh and unnatural his words instinct with the graceless cruelty of a clown  this is not practical he declared think i am as i have been addressed here and as i must remain yet for months to comeeverard dominey an englishman and the owner of this housethe husband of lady dominey  where is your reputed wife stephanie demanded frowning  in the nursing home where she has been for the last few months he replied she has already practically recovered she cannot remain there much longer  you must insist upon it that she does  i ask you to consider the suspicions which would be excited by such a course dominey pleaded earnestly and further can you explain to me in what way i having already according to belief of everybody another wife living can take advantage of this mandate  she looked at him wonderingly  you make difficulties you sit there like the cold englishman whose place you are taking you whose tears have fallen before now upon my hand whose lips  you speak of one who is dead dominey interrupted dead until the coming of great events may bring him to life again until that time your lover must be dumb  then her anger blazed out she spoke incoherently passionately dragged his face down to hers and clenched her fist the next moment as though she would have struck it she broke down with a storm of tears  not so hardnot so hard leopold she implored oh yours is a great task and you must carry it through to the end but we have his permissionthere can be found a waywe could be married secretly at least your lipsyour arms my heart is starved leopold  he rose to his feet her arms were still twined about his neck her lips hungry for his kisses her eyes shining up into his  have pity on me stephanie he begged until our time has come there is dishonour even in a single kiss wait for the day the day you know of  she unwound her arms and shivered slightly her hurt eyes regarded him wonderingly  leopold she faltered what has changed you like this what has dried up all the passion in you you are a different man let me look at you  she caught him by the shoulders dragged him underneath the electric globe and stood there gazing into his face the great log upon the hearth was spluttering and fizzing through the closed door came the faint wave of conversation and laughter from outside her breathing was uneven her eyes were seeking to rend the mask from his face  can you have learnt to care for any one else she muttered there were no women in africa this rosamund dominey your reputed wifethey tell me that she is beautiful that you have been kindness itself to her that her health has improved since your coming that she adores you you wouldnt dare  no he interrupted i should not dare  then what are you looking at she demanded tell me that  her eyes were following the shadowed picture which had passed out of the room he saw once more the slight girlish form the loveseeking light in those pleading dark eyes the tremulous lips the whole sweet appeal for safety from a frightened child to him the strong man he felt the clinging touch of those soft fingers laid upon his the sweetness of those marvellously awakened emotions so cruelly and drearily stifled through a cycle of years the womans passion by his side seemed suddenly tawdry and unreal the seeking of her lips for his something horrible his back was towards the door and it was her cry of angry dismay which first apprised him of a welcome intruder he swung around to find seaman standing upon the thresholdseaman to him a very angel of deliverance  i am indeed sorry to intrude sir everard the newcomer declared with a shade of genuine concern on his round goodhumoured face something has happened which i thought you ought to know at once can you spare me a moment  the princess swept past them without a word of farewell or a backward glance she had the carriage and the air of an insulted queen a shade of deeper trouble came into seamans face as he stepped respectfully to one side  what is it that has happened dominey demanded  lady dominey has returned was the quiet reply    chapter xvii  it seemed to dominey that he had never seen anything more pathetic than that eager glance half of hope half of apprehension flashed upon him from the strange tired eyes of the woman who was standing before the log fire in a little recess of the main hall by her side stood a pleasant friendly looking person in the uniform of a nurse a yard or two behind a maid carrying a jewel case rosamund who had thrown back her veil had been standing with her foot upon the fender her whole expression changed as dominey came hastily towards her with outstretched hands  my dear child he exclaimed welcome home  welcome she repeated with a glad catch in her throat you mean it  with a selfcontrol of which he gave no sign he touched the lips which were raised so eagerly to his as tenderly and reverently as though this were some strange child committed to his care  of course i mean it he answered heartily but what possessed you to come without giving us notice how was this nurse  her ladyship has had no sleep for two nights the latter replied she has been so much better that we dreaded the thought of a relapse so mrs coulson our matron thought it best to let her have her own way about coming instead of telegraphing to you unfortunately we telegraphed to doctor harrison and i believe he is away  is it very wrong of me rosamund asked clinging to domineys arm i had a sudden feeling that i must get back here i wanted to see you again every one has been so sweet and kind at falmouth especially nurse alice here but they werent quite the same thing you are not angry these people who are staying here will not mind  of course not he assured her cheerfully they will be your guests tomorrow you must make friends with them all  there was a very beautiful woman she said timidly with red hair who passed by just now she looked very angry that was not because i have come  why should it be he answered you have a right herea better right than any one  she drew a long sigh of contentment  oh but this is wonderful she cried and you deari shall call you everard maynt iyou look just as i hoped you might will you take me upstairs please nurse you can follow us  she leaned heavily on his arm and even loitered on the way but her steps grew lighter as they approached her own apartment finally as they reached the corridor she broke away from him and tripped on with the gaiety almost of a child to the door of her room then came a little cry of disappointment as she flung open the door several maids were there busy with a refractory fire and removing the covers from the furniture but the room was half full of smoke and entirely unprepared  oh how miserable she exclaimed everard what shall i do  he threw open the door of his own apartment a bright fire was burning in the grate the room was warm and comfortable she threw herself with a little cry of delight into the huge chesterfield drawn up to the edge of the hearthrug  i can stay here everard cant i until you come up to bed she pleaded and then you can sit and talk to me and tell me who is here and all about the people you have no idea how much better i am all my music has come back to me and they say that i play bridge ever so well i shall love to help you entertain  the maid was slowly unfastening her mistresss boots rosamund held up her foot for him to feel  see how cold i am she complained please rub it i am going to have some supper up here with nurse will one of you maids please go down and see about it what a lot of nice new things you have everard she added looking around and that picture of me from the drawingroom on the table she cried her eyes suddenly soft with joy you dear thing what made you bring that up  i wanted to have it here he told her  im not so nice as that now she sighed a little wistfully  do not believe it he answered you have not changed in the least you will be betterlooking still when you have been here for a few months  she looked at him almost shylytenderly yet still with that gleam of aloofness in her eyes  i think she murmured i shall be just what you want me to be i think you could make me just what you want be very kind to me please she begged stretching her arms out to him i suppose it is because i have been ill so long but i feel so helpless and i love your strength and i want you to take care of me your own hands are quite cold she added anxiously you look pale too youre not ill everard  i am very well he assured her struggling to keep his voice steady forgive me now wont you if i hurry away there are guests hererather important guests tomorrow you must come and see them all  and help you  and help me    dominey made his escape and went reeling down the corridor at the top of the great quadrangular landing he stopped and stood with halfclosed eyes for several moments from downstairs he could hear the sound of pleasantly raised voices the music of a piano in the distance the click of billiard balls he waited until he had regained his selfpossession then as he was on the point of descending he saw seaman mounting the stairs at a gesture he waited for him waited until he came and taking him by the arm led him to a great settee in a dark corner seaman had lost his usual blitheness the goodhumoured smile played no longer about his lips  where is lady dominey he asked  in my room waiting until her own is prepared  seamans manner was unusually grave  my friend he said you know very well that when we walk in the great paths of life i am unscrupulous in those other hours alas i have a weaknessi love women  well dominey muttered  i will admit the other continued that you are placed in a delicate and trying position lady dominey seems disposed to offer to you the affection which notwithstanding their troubles together she doubtless felt for her husband i risk your anger my friend but i warn you to be very careful how you encourage her  a light flashed in domineys eyes for the moment angry words seemed to tremble upon his lips seamans manner however was very gentle he courted no offence  if you were to take advantage of your position withwith any other i would shrug my shoulders and stand on one side but this mad englishmans wife or rather his widow has been mentally ill she is still weakminded just as she is tenderhearted i watched her as she passed through the hall with you just now she turns to you for love as a flower to the sun after a long spell of cold wet weather von ragastein you are a man of honour you must find means to deal with this situation however difficult it may become  dominey had recovered from his first wave of weakness his companions words excited no sentiment of anger he was conscious even of regarding him with a greater feeling of kindness than ever before  my friend he said you have shown me that you are conscious of one dilemma in which i find myself placed and which i confess is exercising me to the utmost let me now advise you of another the princess eiderstrom has brought me an autograph letter from the kaiser commanding me to marry her  the situation seaman declared grimly but for its serious side would provide all the elements for a palais royal farce for the present however you have duties below i have said the words which were thumping against the walls of my heart  their descent was opportune some of the local guests were preparing to make their departure and dominey was in time to receive their adieux they all left messages for lady dominey spoke of a speedy visit to her and expressed themselves as delighted to hear of her return and recovery as the last car rolled away caroline took her hosts arm and led him to a chimney seat by the huge log fire in the inner hall  my dear everard she said you really are a very terrible person  exactly why he demanded  your devotion to my sex she continued is flattering but far too catholic your return to england appears to have done what we understood to be impossiblerestored your wifes reason a fieryheaded hungarian princess has pursued you down here and has now gone to her room in a tantrum because you left her side for a few minutes to welcome your wife and there remains our own sentimental little flirtation a broken and alas a discarded thing there is no doubt whatever everard that you are a very bad lot  you are distressing me terribly dominey confessed but all the same after a somewhat agitated evening i must admit that i find it pleasant to talk with some one who is not wielding the lightnings may i have a whisky and soda  bring me one too please caroline begged i fear that it will seriously impair the note which i had intended to strike in our conversation but i am thirsty and a handful of those turkish cigarettes too you can devote yourself to me with a perfectly clear conscience your most distinguished guest has found a task after his own heart he has got henry in a corner of the billiardroom and is trying to convince him of what i am sure the dear man really believes himselfthat germanys intentions towards england are of a particularly dovelike nature your right honourable guest has gone to bed and eddy pelham is playing billiards with mr mangan every one is happy you can devote yourself to soothing my wounded vanity to say nothing of my broken heart  always gibing at me dominey grumbled  not always she answered quietly raising her eyes for a moment there was a time everard before that terrible tragedythe last time you stayed at dunratterwhen i didnt gibe  when on the contrary you were sweetness itself he reflected  she sighed reminiscently  that was a wonderful month she murmured i think it was then for the first time that i saw traces of something in you which i suppose accounts for your being what you are today  you think that i have changed then  she looked him in the eyes  i sometimes find it difficult to believe she admitted that you are the same man  he turned away to reach for his whisky and soda  as a matter of curiosity he asked why  to begin with then she commented you have become almost a precisian in your speech you used to be rather slangy at times  what else  you used always to clip your final gs  shocking habit he murmured i cured myself of that by reading aloud in the bush go on please  you carry yourself so much more stiffly sometimes you have the air of being surprised that you are not in uniform  trifles all these things he declared now for something serious  the serious things are pretty good she admitted you used to drink whiskys and sodas at all hours of the day and quite as much wine as was good for you at dinner time now although you are a wonderful host you scarcely take anything yourself  you should see me at the port he told her when you ladies are well out of the way some more of the good please  all your best qualities seem to have come to the surface she went on and i think that the way you have come back and faced it all is simply wonderful tell me if that mans body should be discovered after all these years would you be charged with manslaughter  he shook his head i do not think so caroline  everard  well  did you kill roger unthank  a portion of the burning log fell on to the hearth then there was silence they heard the click of the billiard balls in the adjoining room dominey leaned forward and with a pair of small tongs replaced the burning wood upon the fire suddenly he felt his hands clasped by his companions  everard dear she said i am so sorry you came to me a little tired tonight didnt you i think that you needed sympathy and here i am asking you once more that horrible question forget it please talk to me like your old dear self tell me about rosamunds return is she really recovered do you think  i saw her only for a few minutes dominey replied but she seemed to me absolutely better i must say that the weekly reports i have received from the nursing home quite prepared me for a great improvement she is very frail and her eyes still have that restless look but she talks quite coherently  what about that horrible woman  i have pensioned mrs unthank to my surprise i hear that she is still living in the village  and your ghost  not a single howl all the time that rosamund has been away  there is one thing more caroline began hesitatingly  that one thing lacked forever the clothing of words there came a curious almost a dramatic interruption through the silence of the hall there pealed the summons of the great bell which hung over the front door dominey glanced at the clock in amazement  midnight he exclaimed who on earth can be coming here at this time of night  instinctively they both rose to their feet a manservant had turned the great key drawn the bolts and opened the door with difficulty little flakes of snow and a gust of icy wind swept into the hall and following them the figure of a man white from head to foot his hair tossed with the wind almost unrecognisable after his struggle  why doctor harrison dominey cried taking a quick step forward what brings you here at this time of night  the doctor leaned upon his stick for a moment he was out of breath and the melting snow was pouring from his clothes on to the oak floor they relieved him of his coat and dragged him towards the fire  i must apologise for disturbing you at such an hour he said as he took the tumbler which dominey pressed into his hand i have only just received lady domineys telegram i had to see youat once    chapter xviii  the doctor with his usual bluntness did not hesitate to make it known that this unusual visit was of a private nature caroline promptly withdrew and the two men were left alone in the great hall the lights in the billiardroom and drawingroom were extinguished every one in the house except a few servants had retired  sir everard the doctor began this return of lady domineys has taken me altogether by surprise i had intended tomorrow morning to discuss the situation with you  i am most anxious to hear your report dominey said  my report is good was the confident answer although i would not have allowed her to have left the nursing home so suddenly had i known there was nothing to keep her there lady dominey except for one hallucination is in perfect health mentally and physically  and this one hallucination  that you are not her husband  dominey was silent for a moment then he laughed a little unnaturally  can a person be perfectly sane he asked and yet be subject to an hallucination which must make the whole of her surroundings seem unreal  lady dominey is perfectly sane the doctor answered bluntly and as for that hallucination it is up to you to dispel it  perhaps you can give me some advice dominey suggested  i can and i am going to be perfectly frank with you the doctor replied to begin with then there are certain obvious changes in you which might well minister to lady domineys hallucination for instance you have been in england now some eight months during which time you have revealed an entirely new personality you seem to have got rid of every one of your bad habits you drink moderately as a gentleman should you have subdued your violent temper and you have collected around you where your personality could be the only inducement friends of distinction and interest this is not at all what one expected from the everard dominey who scuttled out of england a dozen years ago  you are excusing my wife dominey remarked  she needs no excuses was the brusque reply she has been a longenduring and faithful woman suffering from a cruel illness brought on to take the kindest view if it through your clumsiness and lack of discretion like all good women forgiveness is second nature to her it has now become her wish to take her proper place in life  but if her hallucination continues dominey asked if she seriously doubts that i am indeed her husband how can she do that  that is the problem you and i have to face the doctor said sternly the fact that your wife has been willing to return here to you whilst still subject to that hallucination is a view of the matter which i can neither discuss nor understand i am here tonight though to lay a charge upon you you have to remember that your wife needs still one step towards a perfect recovery and until that step has been surmounted you have a very difficult but imperative task  dominey set his teeth for a moment he felt the doctors keen grey eyes glowing from under his shaggy eyebrows as he leaned forward his hands upon his knees  you mean dominey suggested quietly that until that hallucination has passed we must remain upon the same terms as we have done since my arrival home  youve got it the doctor assented its a tangledup position but weve got to deal with itor rather you have i can assure you he went on that all her other delusions have gone she speaks of the ghost of roger unthank of the cries in the night of his mysterious death as parts of a painful past she is quite conscious of her several attempts upon your life and bitterly regrets them now we come to the real danger she appears to be possessed of a passionate devotion towards you whilst still believing that you are not her husband  dominey pushed his chair back from the fire as though he felt the heat his eyes seemed glued upon the doctors  i do not pretend the latter continued gravely to account for that but it is my duty to warn you sir everard that that devotion may lead her to great lengths lady dominey is naturally of an exceedingly affectionate disposition and this return to a stronger condition of physical health and a fuller share of human feelings has probably reawakened all those tendencies which her growing fondness for you and your position as her reputed husband make perfectly natural i warn you sir everard that you may find your position an exceedingly difficult one but difficult though it may be there is a plain duty before you keep and encourage your wifes affection if you can but let it be a charge upon you that whilst the hallucination remains that affection must never pass certain bounds lady dominey is a good and sweet woman if she woke up one morning with that hallucination still in her mind and any sense of guilt on her conscience all our labours for these last months might well be wasted and she herself might very possibly end her days in a madhouse  doctor dominey said firmly i appreciate every word you say you can rely upon me  the doctor looked at him  i believe i can he admitted with a sigh of relief i am glad of it  there is just one more phase of the position dominey went on after a pause supposing this hallucination of hers should pass supposing she should suddenly become convinced that i am her husband  in that case the doctor replied earnestly the position would be exactly reversed and it would be just as important for you not to check the affection which she might offer to you as it would be in the other case for you not to accept it the moment she realises with her present predispositions that you really are her lawful husband that moment will be the beginning of a new life for her  somehow they both seemed to feel that the last words had been spoken after a brief pause the doctor helped himself to a farewell drink filled his pipe and stood up the car which dominey had ordered from the garage was already standing at the door it was curious how both of them seemed disinclined to refer again even indirectly to the subject which they had been discussing  very good of you to send me back the doctor said gruffly i started out all right but it was a drear walk across the marshes  i am very grateful to you for coming dominey replied with obvious sincerity you will come and have a look at the patient in a day or two  ill stroll across as soon as youve got rid of some of this houseful the doctor promised good night  the two men parted and curiously enough dominey was conscious that with those few awkward words of farewell some part of the incipient antagonism between them had been buried left to himself he wandered for some moments up and down the great dimly lit hall a strange restlessness seemed to have fastened itself upon him he stood for a time by the dying fire watching the grey ashes stirred uneasily by the wind which howled down the chimney then he strolled to a different part of the hall and one by one he turned on by means of the electric switches the newly installed lights which hung above the sombre oil pictures upon the wall he looked into the faces of some of these dead domineys trying to recall what he had heard of their history and dwelling longest upon a gallant of the stuart epoch whose misdeeds had supplied material for every intimate chronicler of those days when at last the sight of a sleepy manservant hovering in the background forced his steps upstairs he still lingered for a few moments in the corridor and turned the handle of his bedroom door with almost reluctant fingers his heart gave a great jump as he realised that there was some one there he stood for a moment upon the threshold then laughed shortly to himself at his foolish imagining it was his servant who was patiently awaiting his arrival  you can go to bed dickens he directed i shall not want you again tonight we shoot in the morning  the man silently took his leave and dominey commenced his preparations for bed he was in no humour for sleep however and still attired in his shirt and trousers he wrapped a dressinggown around him drew a reading lamp to his side and threw himself into an easychair a book in his hand it was some time before he realised that the volume was upside down and even when he had righted it the words he saw had no meaning for him all the time a queer procession of womens faces was passing before his eyescaroline with her halfflirtatious wholly sentimental bon camaraderie stephanie with her voluptuous figure and passionlit eyes and then blotting the others utterly out of his thoughts and memory rosamund with all the sweetness of life shining out of her eager face he saw her as she had come to him last with that little unspoken cry upon her tremulous lips and the haunting appeal in her soft eyes all other memories faded away they were as though they had never been those dreary years of exile in africa the day by day tension of his precarious life were absolutely forgotten his heart was calling all the time for an unknown boon he felt himself immeshed in a world of cobwebs of weakness more potent than all his boasted strength then he suddenly felt that the madness which he had begun to fear had really come it was the thing for which he longed yet dreaded mostthe faint click the soft withdrawal of the panel actually pushed back by a pair of white hands rosamund herself was there her eyes shone at him mystically wonderfully her lips were parted in a delightful smile a smile in which there was a spice of girlish mischief she turned for a moment to close the panel then she came towards him with her finger upraised  i cannot sleep she said softly do you mind my coming for a few minutes  of course not he answered come and sit down  she curled up in his easychair  just for a moment she murmured contentedly give me your hands dear but how cold you must come nearer to the fire yourself  he sat on the arm of her chair and she stroked his head with her hands  you were not afraid then she asked when you saw me come through the panel  i should never be afraid of any harm that you might bring me dear he assured her  because all that foolishness is really gone she continued eagerly i know that whatever happened to poor roger it was not you who killed him even if i heard his ghost calling again tonight i should have no fear i cant think why i ever wanted to hurt you everard i am sure that i always loved you  his arm went very softly around her she responded to his embrace without hesitation her cheek rested upon his shoulder he felt the warmth of her arm through her white furlined dressinggown  why do you doubt any longer then he asked hoarsely that i am your husband  she sighed  ah but i know you are not she answered is it wrong of me to feel what i do for you i wonder you are so like yet so unlike him he is dead he died in africa isnt it strange that i should know it but i do  but who am i then he whispered  she looked at him pitifully  i do not know she confessed but you are kind to me and when i feel you are near i am happy it is because i wanted to see you that i would not stay any longer at the nursing home that must mean that i am very fond of you  you are not afraid he asked to be here alone with me  she put her other arm around his neck and drew his face down  i am not afraid she assured him i am happy but dear what is the matter a moment ago you were cold now your head is wet your hands are burning are you not happy because i am here  her lips were seeking his his own touched them for a moment then he kissed her on both cheeks she made a little grimace  i am afraid she said that you are not really fond of me  cant you believe he asked hoarsely that i am really everardyour husband look at me cant you feel that you have loved me before  she shook her head a little sadly  no you are not everard she sighed but she added her eyes lighting up you bring me love and happiness and life and  a few seconds before dominey felt from his soul that he would have welcomed an earthquake a thunderbolt the crumbling of the floor beneath his feet to have been spared the torture of her sweet importunities yet nothing so horrible as this interruption which really came could ever have presented itself before his mind half in his arms with her head thrown back listeninghe too horrified convulsed for a moment even with real physical fearthey heard the silence of the night broken by that one awful cry the cry of a mans soul in torment imprisoned in the jaws of a beast they listened to it together until its echoes died away then what was perhaps the most astonishing thing of all she nodded her head slowly unperturbed unterrified  you see she said i must go back he will not let me stay here he must think that you are everard it is only i who know that you are not  she slipped from the chair kissed him and walking quite firmly across the floor touched the spring and passed through the panel even then she turned around and waved a little goodbye to him there was no sign of fear in her face only a little dumb disappointment the panel glided to and shut out the vision of her dominey held his head like a man who fears madness    chapter xix  dawn the next morning was heralded by only a thin line of red parting the masses of blackgrey snow clouds which still hung low down in the east the wind had dropped and there was something ghostly about the still twilight as dominey issued from the back regions and made his way through the untrodden snow round to the side of the house underneath rosamunds window a little exclamation broke from his lips as he stood there from the terraced walks down the steps and straight across the park to the corner of the black wood were fresh tracks the cry had been no fantasy somebody or something had passed from the black wood and back again to this spot in the night  dominey curiously excited by his discovery examined the footmarks eagerly then followed them to the corner of the wood here and there they puzzled him they were neither like human footsteps nor the track of any known animal at the edge of the wood they seemed to vanish into the heart of a great mass of brambles from which here and there the snow had been shaken off there was no sign of any pathway if ever there had been one the neglect of years had obliterated it bracken brambles shrubs and bushes had grown up and degenerated only to be succeeded by a ranker and more dense form of undergrowth many of the trees although they were still plentiful had been blown down and left to rot on the ground the place was silent except for the slow drip of falling snow from the drooping leaves he took one more cautious step forward and found himself slowly sinking black mud was oozing up through the snow where he had set his feet he was just able to scramble back picking his way with great caution he commenced a leisurely perambulation of the whole of the outside of the wood  heggs the junior keeper an hour or so later went over the gun rack once more tapped the empty cases and turned towards middleton who was sitting in a chair before the fire smoking his pipe  i cant find masters number two gun mr middleton he announced thats missing  look again lad the old keeper directed removing the pipe from his mouth the master was shooting with it yesterday look amongst those loose uns at the far end of the rack it must be somewhere there  well that isnt the young man replied obstinately  the door of the room was suddenly opened and dominey entered with the missing gun under his arm middleton rose to his feet at once and laid down his pipe surprise kept him temporarily silent  i want you to come this way with me for a moment his master ordered  the keeper took up his hat and stick and followed dominey led him to where the tracks had halted on the gravel outside rosamunds window and pointed across to the black wood  what do you make of those he enquired  middleton did not hesitate he shook his head gravely  was anything heard last night sir  there was an infernal yell underneath this window  that was the spirit of roger unthank for sure middleton pronounced with a little shudder when he do come out of that wood he do call  spirits his master pointed out do not leave tracks like that behind  middleton considered the matter  they do say hereabout he confided that the spirit of roger unthank have been taken possession of by some sort of great animal and that it do come here now and then to be fed  by whom dominey enquired patiently  why by mrs unthank  mrs unthank has not been in this house for many months from the day she left until last night so far as i can gather nothing has been heard of this ghost or beast or whatever it is  that do seem queer surely middleton admitted  dominey followed the tracks with his eyes to the wood and back again  middleton he said i am learning something about spirits it seems that they not only make tracks but they require feeding perhaps if that is so they can feel a charge of shot inside them  the old man seemed for a moment to stiffen with slow horror  you wouldnt shoot at it squire he gasped  i should have done so this morning if i had had a chance dominey replied when the weather is a little drier i am going to make my way into that wood middleton with a rifle under my arm  then as gods above youll never come out squire was the solemn reply  we will see dominey muttered i have hacked my way through some queer country in africa  theres nowt like this wood in the world sir the old man asserted doggedly the bottoms rotten from end to end and the tops all poisonous the birds die there on the trees its chockful of reptiles and unclean things with green and purple fungi two feet high with poison in the very sniff of them the man who enters that wood goes to his grave  nevertheless dominey said firmly within a very short time i am going to solve the mystery of this nocturnal visitor  they returned to the house side by side just before they entered dominey turned to his companion  middleton he said you keep up the good old customs i suppose and spend half an hour at the dominey arms now and then  most every night of my life sir the old man replied from eight till nine im a man of regular habits and that do seem right to me that with the work done right and proper a man should have his relaxation  that is right john dominey assented next time you are there dont forget to mention that i am going to have that wood looked through i should like it to get about you understand  thatll fair flummox the folk was the doubtful reply but ill let em know squire therell be a rare bit of talk i can promise you that  dominey handed over his gun went to his room bathed and changed and descended for breakfast there was a sudden hush as he entered which he very well understood every one began to talk about the prospect of the days sport dominey helped himself from the sideboard and took his place at the table  i hope he said that our very latest thing in ghosts did not disturb anybody  we all seem to have heard the same thing the cabinet minister observed with interesta most appalling and unearthly cry i have lately joined every society connected with spooks and find them a fascinating study  if you want to investigate dominey observed as he helped himself to coffee you can bring out a revolver and prowl about with me one night from the time when i was a kid before i went to eton up till when i left here for africa we had a series of highly respectable and wellbehaved ghosts who were a credit to the family and of whom we were somewhat proud this latest spook however is something quite outside the pale  has he a history mr watson asked with interest  i am informed dominey replied that he is the spirit of a schoolmaster who once lived here and for whose departure from the world i am supposed to be responsible such a spook is neither a credit nor a comfort to the family  their host spoke with such an absolute absence of emotion that every one was conscious of a curious reluctance to abandon a subject full of such fascinating possibilities terniloff was the only one however who made a suggestion  we might have a battue in the wood he proposed  i am not sure dominey told them that the character of the wood is not more interesting than the ghost who is supposed to dwell in it you remember how terrified the beaters were yesterday at the bare suggestion of entering it for generations it has been held unclean it is certainly most unsafe i went in over my knees on the outskirts of it this morning shall we say halfpast ten in the gun room  seaman followed his host out of the room  my friend he said you must not allow these local circumstances to occupy too large a share of your thoughts it is true that these are the days of your relaxation still there is the princess for you to think of after all she has us in her power the merest whisper in downing street and behold catastrophe  dominey took his friends arm  look here seaman he rejoined its easy enough to say there is the princess to be considered but will you kindly tell me what on earth more i can do to make her see the position necessity demands that i should be on the best of terms with lady dominey and i should not make myself in any way conspicuous with the princess  i am not sure seaman reflected that the terms you are on with lady dominey matter very much to any one so far as regards the princess she is an impulsive and passionate person but she is also grande dame and a diplomatist i see no reason why you should not marry her secretly in london in the name of everard dominey and have the ceremony repeated under your rightful name later on  they had paused to help themselves to cigarettes which were displayed with a cabinet of cigars on a round table in the hall dominey waited for a moment before he answered  has the princess confided to you that that is her wish he asked  something of the sort seaman acknowledged she wishes the suggestion however to come from you  and your advice  seaman blew out a little cloud of cigar smoke  my friend he confessed i am a little afraid of the princess i ask you no questions as to your own feelings with regard to her i take it for granted that as a man of honour it will be your duty to offer her your hand in marriage sooner or later i see no harm in anticipating a few months if by that means we can pacify her terniloff would arrange it at the embassy he is devoted to her and it will strengthen your position with him  dominey turned away towards the stairs  we will discuss this again before we leave he said gloomily  dominey was admitted at once by her maid into his wifes sittingroom rosamund in a charming morning robe of pale blue lined with grey fur had just finished breakfast she held out her hands to him with a delighted little cry of welcome  how nice of you to come everard she exclaimed i was hoping i should see you for a moment before you went off  he raised her fingers to his lips and sat down by her side she seemed entirely delighted by his presence and he felt instinctively that she was quite unaffected by the event of the night before  you slept well he enquired  perfectly she answered  he tackled the subject bravely as he had made up his mind to on every opportunity  you do not lie awake thinking of our nocturnal visitor then  not for one moment you see she went on conversationally if you were really everard then i might be frightened for some day or other i feel that if everard comes here the spirit of roger unthank will do him some sort of mischief  why he asked  you dont know about these things of course she went on but roger unthank was in love with me although i had scarcely ever spoken to him before i married everard i think i told you that much yesterday didnt i after i was married the poor man nearly went out of his mind he gave up his work and used to haunt the park here one evening everard caught him and they fought and roger unthank was never seen again i think that any one around here would tell you she went on dropping her voice a little that everard killed roger and threw him into one of those swampy places near the black wood where a body sinks and sinks and nothing is ever seen of it again  i do not believe he did anything of the sort dominey declared  oh i dont know she replied doubtfully everard had a terrible temper and that night he came home covered with blood lookingawful it was the night when i was taken ill  well no more tragedies he insisted i have come up to remind you that we have guests here when are you coming down to see them  she laughed like a child  you say we just as though you were really my husband she declared  you must not tell any one else of your fancy he warned her  she acquiesced at once  oh i quite understand she assured him i shall be very very careful and everard you have such clever guests not at all the sort of people my everard would have had here and i have been out of the world for so long that i am afraid i shant be able to talk to them nurse alice is tremendously impressed i am sure i should be terrified to sit at the end of the table and caroline will hate not being hostess any longer let me come down at teatime and after dinner and slip into things gradually you can easily say that i am still an invalid though of course im not at all  you shall do exactly as you choose he promised as he took his leave  so when the shooting party tramped into the hall that afternoon a little weary but flushed with exercise and the pleasure of the days sport they found seated in a corner of the room behind the great round table upon which tea was set out a rather pale but extraordinarily childlike and fascinating woman with large sweet eyes which seemed to be begging for their protection and sympathy as she rose hesitatingly to her feet dominey was by her side in a moment and his first few words of introduction brought every one around her she said very little but what she said was delightfully natural and gracious  it has been so kind of you she said to caroline to help my husband entertain his guests i am very much better but i have been ill for so long that i have forgotten a great many things and i should be a very poor hostess but i want to make tea for you please and i want you all to tell me how many pheasants you have shot  terniloff seated himself on the settee by her side  i am going to help you in this complicated task he declared i am sure those sugar tongs are too heavy for you to wield alone  she laughed at him gaily  but i am not really delicate at all she assured him i have had a very bad illness but i am quite strong again  then i will find some other excuse for sitting here he said i will tell you all about the high pheasants your husband killed and about the woodcock he brought down after we had all missed it  i shall love to hear about that she assented how much sugar please and will you pass those hot muffins to the princess and please touch that bell i shall want more hot water i expect you are all very thirsty i am so glad to be here with you    chapter xx  arm in arm prince terniloff and his host climbed the snowcovered slope at the back of a long fir plantation towards the little beflagged sticks which indicated their stand there was not a human being in sight for the rest of the guns had chosen a steeper but somewhat less circuitous route  von ragastein the ambassador said i am going to give myself the luxury of calling you by your name you know my one weakness a weakness which in my younger days very nearly drove me out of diplomacy i detest espionage in every shape and form even where it is necessary so far as you are concerned my young friend he went on i think your position ridiculous i have sent a private despatch to potsdam in which i have expressed that opinion  so far dominey remarked i have not been overworked  my dear young friend the prince continued you have not been overworked because there has been no legitimate work for you to do there will be none there could be no possible advantage accruing from your labours here to compensate for the very bad effect which the discovery of your true name and position would have in the english cabinet  i must ask you to remember dominey begged that i am here as a blind servant of the fatherland i simply obey orders  i will grant that freely the prince consented but to continue i am now at the end of my first year in this country i feel able to congratulate myself upon a certain measure of success from that part of the cabinet with whom i have had to do i have received nothing but encouragement in my efforts to promote a better understanding between our two countries  the sky certainly seems clear enough just now agreed dominey  i have convinced myself the prince said emphatically that there is a genuine and solid desire for peace with germany existing in downing street in every argument i have had in every concession i have asked for i have been met with a sincere desire to foster the growing friendship between our countries i am proud of my work here von ragastein i believe that i have brought germany and england nearer together than they have been since the days of the boer war  you are sure sir dominey asked that you are not confusing personal popularity with national sentiment  i am sure of it the ambassador answered gravely such popularity as i may have achieved here has been due to an appreciation of the more healthy state of world politics now existing it has been my great pleasure to trace the result of my work in a manuscript of memoirs which some day when peace is firmly established between our two countries i shall cause to be published i have put on record there evidences of the really genuine sentiment in favour of peace which i have found amongst the present cabinet  i should esteem it an immense privilege dominey said to be given a private reading of these memoirs  that may be arranged was the suave reply in the meantime von ragastein i want you to reconsider your position here  my position is not voluntary dominey repeated i am acting under orders  precisely the other acquiesced but matters have changed very much during the last six months even at the risk of offending france england is showing wonderful pliability with regard to our claims in morocco every prospect of disagreement between our two countries upon any vital matter has now disappeared  unless dominey said thoughtfully the desire for war should come not from downing street but from potsdam  we serve an honourable master terniloff declared sternly and he has shown me his mind his will is for peace and for the great triumphs to which our country is already entitled by reason of her supremacy in industry in commerce in character and in genius these are the weapons which will make germany the greatest power in the world no empire has ever hewn its way to permanent glory by the sword alone we have reached our stations i see come to me after this drive is finished my host all that i have said so far has been by way of prelude  the weather had turned drier the snow was crisp and a little party of women from the hall reached the guns before the beaters were through the wood caroline and stephanie both took their places by domineys side the former however after a few minutes passed on to terniloffs stand stephanie and dominey were alone for the first time since their stormy interview in the library  has maurice been talking to you she asked a little abruptly  his excellency and i are to tell you the truth dominey confessed in the midst of a most interesting conversation  has he spoken to you about me  your name has not yet been mentioned  she made a little grimace in her wonderful furs and russian turban hat she made a rather striking picture against the background of snow  an interesting conversation in which my name has not been mentioned she repeated satirically  i think you were coming into it before very long dominey assured her his excellency warned me that all he had said so far was merely the prelude to a matter of larger importance  stephanie smiled  dear maurice is so diplomatic she murmured i am perfectly certain he is going to begin by remonstrating you for your shocking treatment of me  their conversation was interrupted for a few minutes by the sport dominey called the faithful middleton to his side for a further supply of cartridges stephanie bided her time which came when the beaters at last emerged from the wood  shocking stephanie repeated reverting to their conversation is the mildest word in my vocabulary which i can apply to your treatment of me honestly leopold i feel bruised all over inside my pride is humbled  it is because you look at the matter only from a feminine point of view dominey persisted  and you she answered in a low tone once the fondest and the most passionate of lovers only from a political one you think a great deal of your country leopold have i no claims upon you  upon everard dominey none he insisted when the time comes and leopold von ragastein can claim all that is his right believe me you will have no cause to complain of coldness or dilatoriness he will have only one thought only one hopeto end the torture of these years of separation as speedily as may be  the strained look passed from her face her tone became more natural  but dear she pleaded there is no need to wait your sovereign gives you permission your political chief will more than endorse it  i am on the spot dominey replied and believe me i know what is safest and best i cannot live as two men and keep my face steadfast to the world the prince however has not spoken to me yet i will hear what he has to say  stephanie turned a little haughtily away  you are putting me in the position of a supplicant she exclaimed tonight we must have an understanding  the little party moved on all together to another cover rosamund had joined them and hung on to domineys arm with delight the brisk walk across the park had brought colour to her cheeks she walked with all the free and vigorous grace of a healthy woman dominey found himself watching her as she deserted him a little later on to stand by terniloffs side with a little thrill of tangled emotions he felt a touch on his arm stephanie who was passing with another of the guns paused to whisper in his ear  there might be a greater dangerone that has evaded even your cautious mindin overplaying your part  dominey was taken possession of by caroline on their walk to the next stand she planted herself on a shooting stick by his side and commenced to take him roundly to task  my dear everard she said you are one of the most wonderful examples of the reformed rake i ever met you have even acquired respectability for heavens sake dont disappoint us all  i seem to be rather good at that dominey observed a little drearily  well you are the master of your own actions are you not she asked what i want to say in plain words is dont go and make a fool of yourself with stephanie  i have not the least intention of doing anything of the sort  well she has mark my words everard i know that woman she is clever and brilliant and anything else you like but for some reason or other she has set her mind upon you she looks at dear little rosamund as though she hadnt a right to exist dont look so sorry for yourself you must have encouraged her  dominey was silent fortunately the exigencies of the next few minutes demanded it his cousin waited patiently until there came a pause in the shooting  now let me hear what you have to say for yourself sir so far as i can see youve been quite sweet to your wife and she adores you if you want to have an affair with the princess dont begin it here youll have your wife ill again if you make her jealous  my dear caroline there will be no affair between stephanie and me of that you may rest assured  you mean to say that this is altogether on her side then caroline persisted  you exaggerate her demeanour he replied but even if what you suggest were true  oh i dont want a lot of protestations she interrupted i am not saying that you encourage her much because i dont believe you do all i want to point out is that having really brought your wife back almost to health you must be extraordinarily and wonderfully careful if you want to talk nonsense with stephanie do it in belgrave square  dominey was watching the gyrations of a falling pheasant his left hand was stretched out towards the cartridge bag which caroline was holding he clasped her fingers for a moment before he helped himself  you are rather a dear he said i would not do anything to hurt rosamund for the world  if you cant get rid of your old tricks altogether and must flirt she remarked well im always somewhere about rosamund wouldnt mind me because there are a few grey hairs in my sandy onesand here comes your man across the parklooks as though he had a message for you so long as nothing has happened to your cook i feel that i could face ill tidings with composure  dominey found himself watching with fixed eyes the approach of his rather sadfaced manservant through the snow parkins was not dressed for such an enterprise nor did he seem in any way to relish it his was the stern march of duty and curiously enough dominey felt from the moment he caught sight of him that he was in some respects a messenger of fate yet the message which he delivered when at last he reached his masters side was in no way alarming  a person of the name of miller has arrived here sir he announced from norwich he is i understand a foreigner of some sort who has recently landed in this country i found it a little difficult to understand him but her highnesss maid conversed with him in german and i understand that he either is or brings you a message from a certain doctor schmidt with whom you were acquainted in africa  the warning whistle blew at that moment and dominey swung round and stood at attention his behaviour was perfectly normal he let a hen pheasant pass over his head and brought down a cock from very nearly the limit distance he reloaded before he turned to parkins  is this person in a hurry he said  by no means sir the man replied i told him that you would not be back until three or four oclock and he is quite content to wait  dominey nodded  look after him yourself then parkins he directed we shall not be shooting late today very likely i will send mr seaman back to talk to him  the man raised his hat respectfully and turned back towards the house caroline was watching her companion curiously  do you find many of your acquaintances in africa look you up everard she asked  except for seaman dominey replied looking through the barrels of his gun who really does not count because we crossed together this is my first visitor from the land of fortune i expect there will be plenty of them by and by though colonials have a wonderful habit of sticking to one another    chapter xxi  there was nothing in the least alarming about the appearance of mr ludwig miller he had been exceedingly well entertained in the butlers private sittingroom and had the air of having done full justice to the hospitality which had been offered him he rose to his feet at domineys entrance and stood at attention but for some slight indications of military training he would have passed anywhere as a highly respectable retired tradesman  sir everard dominey he enquired  dominey nodded assent that is my name have i seen you before  the man shook his head i am a cousin of doctor schmidt i arrived in the colony from rhodesia after your excellency had left  and how is the doctor  my cousin is as always busy but in excellent health was the reply he sends his respectful compliments and his good wishes also this letter  with a little flourish the man produced an envelope inscribed   to sir everard dominey baronet  dominey hall  in the county of norfolk  england   dominey broke the seal just as seaman entered  a messenger here from doctor schmidt an acquaintance of mine in east africa he announced mr seaman came home from south africa with me he explained to his visitor  the two men looked steadily into each others eyes dominey watched them fascinated neither betrayed himself by even the fall of an eyelid yet dominey his perceptive powers at their very keenest in this moment which instinct told him was one of crisis felt the unspoken unbetokened recognition which passed between them some commonplace remark was uttered and responded to dominey read the few lines which seemed to take him back for a moment to another world   honoured and honourable sir  i send you my heartiest and most respectful greeting of the progress of all matters here you will learn from another source  i recommend to your notice and kindness my cousin the bearer of this lettermr ludwig miller he will lay before you certain circumstances of which it is advisable for you to have knowledge you may speak freely with him he is in all respects to be trusted  karl schmidt signed   your cousin is a little mysterious dominey remarked as he passed the letter to seaman come what about these circumstances  ludwig miller looked around the little room and then at seaman dominey affected to misunderstand his hesitation  our friend here knows everything he declared you can speak to him as to myself  the man began as one who has a story to tell  my errand here is to warn you he said that the englishman whom you left for dead at big bend on the banks of the blue river has been heard of in another part of africa  dominey shook his head incredulously i hope you have not come all this way to tell me that the man was dead  my cousin himself miller continued was hard to convince the man left his encampment with whisky enough to kill him thirst enough to drink it all and no food  so i found him dominey assented deserted by his boys and raving to silence him forever was a childs task  the task however was unperformed the other persisted from three places in the colony he has been heard of struggling to make his way to the coast  does he call himself by his own name dominey asked  he does not miller admitted my cousin however desired me to point out to you the fact that in any case he would probably be shy of doing so he is behaving in an absurd manner he is in a very weakly state and without a doubt he is to some degree insane nevertheless the fact remains that he is in the colony or was three months ago and that if he succeeds in reaching the coast you may at any time be surprised by a visit from him here i am sent to warn you in order that you may take whatever steps may be necessary and not be placed at a disadvantage if he should appear  this is queer news you have brought us miller seaman said thoughtfully  it is news which greatly disturbed doctor schmidt the man replied he has had the natives up one after another for crossexamination nothing can shake their story  if we believed it seaman continued this other european if he had business in this direction might walk in here at any moment  it was to warn you of that possibility that i am here  how much do you know personally seaman asked of the existent circumstances  the man shook his head vaguely  i know nothing he admitted i went out to east africa some years ago and i have been a trader in mozambique in a small way i supplied outfits for officers and hospitals and sportsmen now and then i have to return to europe to buy fresh stock doctor schmidt knew that and he came to see me just before i sailed he first thought of writing a very long letter afterwards he changed his mind he wrote only these few lines i brought but he told me those other things  you have remembered all that he told you dominey asked  i can think of nothing else was the reply after a moments pause the whole affair has been a great worry to doctor schmidt there are things connected with it which he has never understood things connected with it which he has always found mysterious  hence your presence here johann wolff seaman asked in an altered tone  the visitors expression remained unchanged except for the faint surprise which shone out of his blue eyes  johann wolff he repeated that is not my name i am ludwig miller and i know nothing of this matter beyond what i have told you i am just a messenger  once in vienna and twice in cracow my friend we have met seaman reminded him softly but very insistently  the other shook his head gently a mistake i have been in vienna once many years ago but cracow never  you have no idea with whom you are talking  herr seaman was the name i understood  it is a very good name seaman scoffed look here and think  he undid his coat and waistcoat and displayed a plain vest of chamois leather attached to the lefthand side of it was a bronze decoration with lettering and a number miller stared at it blankly and shook his head  information department bureau twelve passwordthe day is coming seaman continued dropping his voice  his listener shook his head and smiled with the puzzled ignorance of a child  the gentleman mistakes me for some one else he replied i know nothing of these things  seaman sat and studied this obstinate visitor for several minutes without speaking his finger tips pressed together his eyebrows gently contracted his visavis endured this scrutiny without flinching calm phlegmatic the very prototype of the bourgeois german of the tradesman class  do you propose dominey enquired to stay in these parts long  one or two daysa week perhaps was the indifferent answer i have a cousin in norwich who makes toys i love the english country i spend my holiday here perhaps  just so seaman muttered grimly the english country under a foot of snow so you have nothing more to say to me johann wolff  i have executed my mission to his excellency was the apologetic reply i am sorry to have caused displeasure to you herr seaman  the latter rose to his feet dominey had already turned towards the door  you will spend the night here of course mr miller he invited i dare say mr seaman would like to have another talk with you in the morning  i shall gladly spend the night here your excellency was the polite reply i do not think that i have anything to say however which would interest your friend  you are making a great mistake wolff seaman declared angrily i am your superior in the service and your attitude towards me is indefensible  if the gentleman would only believe the culprit begged that he is mistaking me for some one else  there was trouble in seamans face as the two men made their way to the front of the house and trouble in his tone as he answered his companions query  what do you think of that fellow and his visit  i do not know what to think but there is a great deal that i know seaman replied gravely the man is a spy a favourite in the wilhelmstrasse and only made use of on important occasions his name is wolffjohann wolff  and this story of his  you ought to be the best judge of that  i am dominey assented confidently without the shadow of a doubt i threw the body of the man i killed into the blue river and watched it sink  then the story is a fake seaman decided for some reason or other we have come under the suspicion of our own secret service  seaman as they emerged into the hall was summoned imperiously to her side by the princess eiderstrom dominey disappeared for a moment and returned presently having discarded some of his soaked shooting garments he was followed by his valet bearing a note upon a silver tray  from the person in mr parkins roomto mr seaman sir the man announced in a low tone  dominey took it from the salver with a little nod then he turned to where the youngest and most frivolous of his guests were in the act of rising from the tea table  a game of pills eddy he proposed they tell me that pool is one of your greatest accomplishments  im pretty useful the young man confessed with a satisfied chuckle give you a black at snooker what  dominey took his arm and led him into the billiardroom  you will give me nothing young fellow he replied set them up and i will show you how i made a living for two months at johannesberg    chapter xxii  the evening at dominey hall was practically a repetition of the previous one with a different set of guests from the outer world after dinner dominey was absent for a few minutes and returned with rosamund upon his arm she received the congratulations of her neighbours charmingly and a little court soon gathered around her doctor harrison who had been dining remained upon the outskirts listening to her lighthearted and at times almost brilliant chatter with grave and watchful interest dominey satisfied that she was being entertained obeyed terniloffs gestured behest and strolled with him to a distant corner of the hall  let me now my dear host the prince began with some eagerness in his tone continue and i trust conclude the conversation to which all that i said this morning was merely the prelude  i am entirely at your service murmured his host  i have tried to make you understand that from my own point of viewand i am in a position to know somethingthe fear of war between this country and our own has passed england is willing to make all reasonable sacrifices to ensure peace she wants peace she intends peace therefore there will be peace therefore i maintain my young friend it is far better for you to disappear at once from this false position  i am scarcely my own master dominey replied you yourself must know that i am here as a servant under orders  join your protests with mine the prince suggested i will make a report directly i get back to london to my mind the matter is urgent if anything should lead to the discovery of your false position in this country the friendship between us which has become a real pleasure to me must seriously undermine my own position  dominey had risen to his feet and was standing on the hearthrug in front of a fire of blazing logs the ambassador was sitting with crossed legs in a comfortable easychair smoking one of the long thin cigars which were his particular fancy  your excellency dominey said there is just one fallacy in all that you have said  a fallacy  you have come to the absolute conclusion dominey continued that because england wants peace there will be peace i am of seamans mind i believe in the ultimate power of the military party of germany i believe that in time they will thrust their will upon the kaiser if he is not at the present moment secretly in league with them therefore i believe that there will be war  if i shared that belief with you my friend the ambassador said quietly i should consider my position here one of dishonour my mandate is for peace and my charge is from the kaisers lips  stephanie with the air of one a little weary of the conversation broke away from a distant group and came towards them her beautiful eyes seemed tired she moved listlessly and she even spoke with less than her usual assurance  am i disturbing a serious conversation she asked send me away if i am  his excellency and i dominey observed have reached a culdesac in our argumentthe blank wall of goodnatured but fundamental disagreement  then i shall claim you for a while stephanie declared taking domineys arm lady dominey has attracted all the men to her circle and i am lonely  the prince bowed  i deny the culdesac he said but i yield our host i shall seek my opponent at billiards  he turned away and stephanie sank into his vacant place  so you and my cousin she remarked as she made room for dominey to sit by her side have come to a disagreement  not an unfriendly one her host assured her  that i am sure of maurice seems indeed to have taken a wonderful liking to you i cannot remember that you ever met before except for that day or two in saxony  that is so the first time i exchanged any intimate conversation with the prince was in london i have the utmost respect and regard for him but i cannot help feeling that the pleasant intimacy to which he has admitted me is to a large extent owing to the desire of our friends in berlin so far as i am concerned i have never met any one of any nation whose character i admire more  maurice lives his life loftily he is one of the few great aristocrats i have met who carries his nobility of birth into his simplest thought and action there is just one thing she added which would break his heart  and that  the subject upon which you two disagreea war between germany and this country  the prince is an idealist dominey said sometimes i wonder why he was sent here why they did not send some one of a more intriguing character  she shrugged her shoulders  you agree with that great frenchman she observed that no ambassador can remain a gentlemanpolitically  well i have never been a diplomat so i cannot say dominey replied  you have many qualifications i should think she observed cuttingly  such as  you are absolutely callous absolutely without heart or sympathy where your work is concerned  i do not admit it he protested  i go back to london tomorrow she continued a very miserable and unhappy woman i take with me the letter which should have brought me happiness the love for which i have sacrificed my life has failed me not even the whip of a royal command not even all that i have to offer can give me even five seconds of happiness  all that i have pleaded for dominey reminded her earnestly is delay  and what delay do you think she asked with a sudden note of passion in her tone would the leopold von ragastein of six years ago have pleaded for delay he found words then which would have melted an iceberg he found words the memory of which comes to me sometimes in the night and which mock me he had no country then save the paradise where lovers walk no ruler but a queen and i was she and now  dominey felt a strange pang of distress she saw the unusual softening in his face and her eyes lit up  just for a moment she broke off you were like leopold as a rule you know you are not like him i think that you left him somewhere in africa and came home in his likeness  believe that for a little time dominey begged earnestly  what if it were true she asked abruptly there are times when i do not recognise you there are words leopold used to use which i have never heard from your lips is not west africa the sorcerers paradise perhaps you are an imposter and the man i love is there still in troubleperhaps ill you play the part of everard dominey like a very king of actors perhaps before you came here you played the part of leopold you are not my leopold love cannot die as you would have me believe  now he said coolly you are coming round to my way of thinking i have been assuring you from the very first moment we met at the carlton that i was not your leopoldthat i was everard dominey  i shall put you to the test she exclaimed suddenly rising to her feet your arm if you please  she led him across the hall to where little groups of people were gossiping playing bridge and seaman the center of a little group of gullible amateur speculators was lecturing on mines they stopped to say a word or two here and there but stephanies fingers never left her companions arm they passed down a corridor hung with a collection of wonderful sporting prints in which she affected some interest into a small gallery which led into the ballroom here they were alone she laid her hands upon his shoulders and looked up into his eyes her lips drew nearer to his  kiss meupon the lips leopold she ordered  there is no leopold here he replied you yourself have said it  she came a little nearer upon the lips she whispered  he held her stooped down and their lips met then she stood apart from him her eyes were for a moment closed her hands were extended as though to prevent any chance of his approaching her again  now i know the truth she muttered  dominey found an opportunity to draw seaman away from his little group of investmentseeking friends  my friend he said trouble grows  anything more from schmidts supposed emissary seaman asked quickly  no i am going to keep away from him this evening and i advise you to do the same the trouble is with the princess  with the princess declared seaman i think you have blundered i quite appreciate your general principles of behaving internally and externally as though you were the person whom you pretend to be it is the very essence of all successful espionage but you should know when to make exceptions i see grave objections myself to your obeying the kaisers behest on the other hand i see no objection whatever to your treating the princess in a more human manner to your visiting her in london and giving her more ardent proofs of your continued affection  if i once begin  look here seaman interrupted the princess is a woman of the world she knows what she is doing and there is a definite tie between you i tell you frankly that i could not bear to see you playing the idiot for a moment with lady dominey but with the princess scruples dont enter into the question at all you should by no means make an enemy of her  well i have done it dominey acknowledged she has gone off to bed now and she is leaving early tomorrow morning she thinks i have borrowed some west african magic that i have left her lovers soul out there and come home in his body  well if she does seaman declared you are out of your troubles  am i dominey replied gloomily first of all she may do a lot of mischief before she goes and then supposing by any thousand to one chance the story of this cousin of schmidts should be true and she should find dominey out there still alive the princess is not of german birth you know she cares nothing for germanys future as a matter of fact i think like a great many hungarians she prefers england they say that an englishman has as many lives as a cat supposing that chap dominey did come to life again and she brings him home you say yourself that you do not mean to make much use of me until after the war has started in the parlance of this country of idioms that will rather upset the apple cart will it not  has the princess a suite of rooms here seaman enquired  over in the west wing good idea you go and see what you can do with her she will not think of going to bed at this time of night  seaman nodded  leave it to me he directed you go out and play the host  dominey played the host first and then the husband rosamund welcomed him with a little cry of pleasure  i have been enjoying myself so much everard she exclaimed everybody has been so kind and mr mangan has taught me a new patience  and now i think doctor harrison intervened a little gruffly its time to knock off for the evening  she turned very sweetly to everard  will you take me upstairs she begged i have been hoping so much that you would come before doctor harrison sent me off  i should have been very disappointed if i had been too late dominey assured her now say good night to everybody  why you talk to me as though i were a child she laughed well goodbye everybody then you see my stern husband is taking me off when are you coming to see me doctor harrison  nothing to see you for was the gruff reply you are as well as any woman here  just a little unsympathetic isnt he she complained to dominey please take me through the hall so that i can say goodbye to every one else is the princess eiderstrom there  i am afraid that she has gone to bed dominey answered as they passed out of the room she said something about a headache  she is very beautiful rosamund said wistfully i wish she looked as though she liked me a little more is she very fond of you everard  i think that i am rather in her bad books just at present dominey confessed  i wonder i am very observant and i have seen her looking at you sometimesof course rosamund went on as i am not really your wife and you are not really my husband it is very stupid of me to feel jealous isnt it everard  not a bit he answered if i am not your husband i will not be anybody elses  i love you to say that she admitted with a little sigh but it seems wrong somewhere look how cross the duchess looks some one must have played the wrong card  rosamunds farewells were not easily made terniloff especially seemed reluctant to let her go she excused herself gracefully however promising to sit up a little later the next evening dominey led the way upstairs curiously gratified at her lingering progress he took her to the door of her room and looked in the nurse was sitting in an easychair reading and the maid was sewing in the background  well you look very comfortable here he declared cheerfully pray do not move nurse  rosamund held his hands as though reluctant to let him go then she drew his face down and kissed him  yes she said a little plaintively its very comfortableeverard  yes dear  she drew his head down and whispered in his ear  may i come in and say good night for two minutes  he smileda wonderfully kind smilebut shook his head  not tonight dear he replied the prince loves to sit up late and i shall be downstairs with him besides that bully of a doctor of yours insists upon ten hours sleep  she sighed like a disappointed child  very well she paused for a moment to listen wasnt that a car she asked  some of our guests going early i dare say he replied as he turned away    chapter xxiii  seaman did not at once start on his mission to the princess he made his way instead to the servants quarters and knocked at the door of the butlers sittingroom there was no reply he tried the handle in vain the door was locked a tall gravefaced man in sombre black came out from an adjoining apartment  you are looking for the person who arrived this evening from abroad sir he enquired  i am seaman replied has he locked himself in  he has left the hall sir  left seaman repeated do you mean gone away for good  apparently sir i do not understand his language myself but i believe he considered his reception here for some reason or other unfavourable he took advantage of the car which went down to the station for the evening papers and caught the last train  seaman was silent for a moment the news was a shock to him  what is your position here he asked his informant  my name is reynolds sir was the respectful reply i am mr pelhams servant  can you tell me why if this man has left the door here is locked  mr parkins locked it before he went out sir he accompaniedmr miller i think his name wasto the station  seaman had the air of a man not wholly satisfied  is it usual to lock up a sittingroom in this fashion he asked  mr parkins always does it sir the cabinets of cigars are kept there also the winecellar key and the key of the plate chest none of the other servants use the room except at mr parkins invitation  i understand seaman said as he turned away much obliged for your information reynolds i will speak to mr parkins later  i will let him know that you desire to see him sir  good night reynolds  good night sir  seaman passed back again to the crowded hall and billiardroom exchanged a few remarks here and there and made his way up the southern flight of stairs toward the west wing stephanie consented without hesitation to receive him she was seated in front of the fire reading a novel in a boudoir opening out of her bedroom  princess seaman declared with a low bow we are in despair at your desertion  she put down her book  i have been insulted in this house she said tomorrow i leave it  seaman shook his head reproachfully  your highness he continued believe me i do not wish to presume upon my position i am only a german tradesman admitted to the circles like these for reasons connected solely with the welfare of my country yet i know much as it happens of the truth of this matter the matter which is causing you distress i beg you to reconsider your decision our friend here is i think needlessly hard upon himself so much the greater will be his reward when the end comes so much the greater will be the rapture with which he will throw himself on his knees before you  has he sent you to reason with me  not directly i am to a certain extent however his majordomo in this enterprise i brought him from africa i have watched over him from the start two brains are better than one i try to show him where to avoid mistakes i try to point out the paths of danger and of safety  i should imagine sir everard finds you useful she remarked calmly  i hope he does  it has doubtless occurred to you she continued that our friend has accommodated himself wonderfully to english life and customs  you must remember that he was educated here nevertheless his aptitude has been marvellous  one might almost call it supernatural she agreed tell me mr seaman you seem to have been completely successful in the installation of our friend here as sir everard what is going to be his real value to you what work will he do  we are keeping him for the big things you have seen our gracious master lately he added hesitatingly  i know what is at the back of your mind she replied yes before the summer is over i am to pack up my trunks and fly i understand  it is when that time comes seaman said impressively that we expect sir everard dominey the typical english country gentleman of whose loyalty there has never been a word of doubt to be of use to us most of our present helpers will be under suspicion the authorised staff of our secret service can only work underneath you can see for yourself the advantage we gain in having a confidential correspondent who can day by day reflect the changing psychology of the british mind in all its phases we have quite enough of the other sort of help arranged for plans of ships aerodromes and harbours sailings of convoys calling up of soldiersall these are the a b c of our secret service profession we shall never ask our friend here for a single fact but from his town house in berkeley square the host of cabinet ministers of soldiers of the best brains of the country our fingers will never leave the pulse of britains day by day life  stephanie threw herself back in her easychair and clasped her hands behind her head  these things you are expecting from our present host  we are and we expect to get them i have watched him day by day my confidence in him has grown  stephanie was silent she sat looking into the fire seaman keenly observant as always realised the change in her yet found something of mystery in her new detachment of manner  your highness he urged i am not here to speak on behalf of the man who at heart is i know your lover he will plead his own cause when the time comes but i am here to plead for patience i am here to implore you to take no rash step to do nothing which might imperil in any way his position here i stand outside the gates of the world which your sex can make a paradise i am no judge of the things that happen there but in your heart i feel there is bitterness because the man for whom you care has chosen to place his country first i implore your patience princess i implore you to believe what i know so wellthat it is the sternest sense of duty only which is the foundation of leopold von ragasteins obdurate attitude  what are you afraid that i shall do she asked curiously  i am afraid of nothingdirectly  indirectly then answer me please  i am afraid he admitted frankly that in some corner of the world if not in this country you might whisper a word a scoffing or an angry sentence which would make people wonder what grudge you had against a simple norfolk baronet i would not like that word to be spoken in the presence of any one who knew your history and realised the rather amazing likeness between sir everard dominey and baron leopold von ragastein  i see stephanie murmured a faint smile parting her lips well mr seaman i do not think that you need have many fears what i shall carry away with me in my heart is not for you or any man to know in a few days i shall leave this country  you are going back to berlinto hungary  she shook her head beckoned her maid to open the door and held out her hand in token of dismissal  i am going to take a sea voyage she announced i shall go to africa    the morrow was a day of mild surprises eddy pelhams empty place was the first to attract notice towards the end of breakfast time  wheres the pink and white immaculate the right honourable gentleman asked i miss my morning wonder as to how he tied his tie  gone dominey replied looking round from the sideboard  gone every one repeated  i should think such a thing has never happened to him before dominey observed he was wanted in town  fancy any one wanting eddy for any serious purpose caroline murmured  fancy any one wanting him badly enough to drag him out of bed in the middle of the night with a telephone call and send him up to town by the breakfast train from norwich their host continued i thought we had started a new ghost when he came into my room in a purple dressinggown and broke the news  who wanted him the duke enquired his tailor  business of importance was his pretext dominey replied  there was a little ripple of goodhumoured laughter  does eddy do anything for a living caroline asked yawning  mr pelham is a director of the chelsea motor works mangan told them he received a small legacy last year and his favourite taxicab man was the first to know about it  youre not suggesting she exclaimed that it is business of that sort which has taken eddy away  i should think it most improbable mangan confessed as a matter of fact he asked me the other day if i knew where their premises were  we shall miss him she acknowledged it was quite one of the events of the day to see his costume after shooting  his bridge was reasonably good the duke commented  he shot rather well the last two days mangan remarked  and he had told me confidentially caroline concluded that he was going to wear brown today now i think eddy would have looked nice in brown  the missing young mans requiem was finished by the arrival of the local morning papers a few moments later dominey rose and left the room seaman who had been unusually silent followed him  my friend he confided i do not know whether you have heard but there was a curious disappearance from the hall last night  whose dominey asked pausing in the act of selecting a cigarette  our friend miller or wolffdoctor schmidts emissary seaman announced has disappeared  disappeared dominey repeated i suppose he is having a prowl round somewhere  i have left it to you to make more careful enquiries seaman replied all i can tell you is that i made up my mind last night to interview him once more and try to fathom his very mysterious behaviour i found the door of your butlers sittingroom locked and a very civil fellowmr pelhams valet he turned out to betold me that he had left in the car which went for the evening papers  i will go and make some enquiries dominey decided after a moments puzzled consideration  if you please seaman acquiesced the affair disconcerts me because i do not understand it when there is a thing which i do not understand i am uncomfortable  dominey vanished into the nether regions spent half an hour with rosamund and saw nothing of his disturbed guest again until they were walking to the first wood they had a moment together after dominey had pointed out the stands  well seaman enquired  our friend dominey announced apparently made up his mind to go quite suddenly a bed was arranged for himor rather it is always therein a small apartment opening out of the butlers room on the ground floor he said nothing about leaving until he saw parkins preparing to go down to the station with the chauffeur then he insisted upon accompanying him and when he found there was a train to norwich he simply bade them both good night he left no message whatever for either you or me  seaman was thoughtful  there is no doubt he said that his departure was indicative of a certain distrust in us he came to find out something and i suppose he found it out i envy you your composure my friend we live on the brink of a volcano and you shoot pheasants  we will try a partridge for a change dominey observed swinging round as a single frenchman with a dull whiz crossed the hedge behind them and fell a little distance away a crumpled heap of feathers neat i think he added turning to his companion  marvellous seaman replied with faint sarcasm i envy your nerve  i cannot take this matter very seriously dominey acknowledged the fellow seemed to me quite harmless  my anxieties have also been aroused in another direction seaman confided  any other trouble looming dominey asked  you will find yourself minus another guest when you return this afternoon  the princess  the princess seaman assented i did my best with her last night but i found her in a most peculiar frame of mind we are to be relieved of any anxiety concerning her for some time however she has decided to take a sea voyage  where to  africa  dominey paused in the act of inserting a cartridge into his gun he turned slowly around and looked into his companions expressionless face  why the mischief is she going out there he asked  i can no more tell you that seaman replied than why johann wolff was sent over here to spy upon our perfect work i am most unhappy my friend the things which i understand however threatening they are i do not fear things which i do not understand oppress me  dominey laughed quietly  come he said there is nothing here which seriously threatens our position the princess is angry but she is not likely to give us away this man wolff could make no adverse report about either of us we are doing our job and doing it well let our clear consciences console us  that is well seaman replied but i feel uneasy i must not stay here longer too intimate an association between you and me is unwise  well i think i can be trusted dominey observed even if i am to be left alone  in every respect except as regards the princess seaman admitted your deportment has been most discreet  except as regards the princess dominey repeated irritably really my friend i cannot understand your point of view in this matter you could not expect me to mix up a secret honeymoon with my present commitments  there might surely have been some middle way seaman persisted you show so much tact in other matters  you do not know the princess dominey muttered    rosamund joined them for luncheon bringing news of stephanies sudden departure with notes and messages for everybody caroline made a little grimace at her host  youre in trouble she whispered in his ear all the same i approve i like stephanie but she is an exceedingly dangerous person  i wonder whether she is dominey mused  i think men have generally found her so caroline replied she had one wonderful love affair which ended as you know in her husband being killed in a duel and her lover being banished from the country still shes not quite the sort of woman to be content with a banished lover i fancied i noticed distinct signs of her being willing to replace him whilst she has been down here  i feel as though a blight had settled upon my house party dominey remarked with bland irrelevancy first eddy then mr ludwig miller and now stephanie  and who on earth was mr ludwig miller after all caroline enquired  he was a fat flaxenhaired german who brought me messages from old friends in africa he had no luggage but a walking stick and he seems to have upset the male part of my domestics last night by accepting a bed and then disappearing  with the plate  not a thing missing parkins spent an agonised half hour counting everything mr ludwig appears to be one of those unsolved mysteries which go to make up an imperfect world  well weve had a jolly time caroline said reminiscently tomorrow henry and i are off and i suppose the others i must say on the whole i am delighted with our visit  you are very gracious dominey murmured  i came perhaps expecting to see a little more of you she went on deliberately but there is a very great compensation for my disappointment i think your wife everard is worth taking trouble about she is perfectly sweet and her manners are most attractive  i am very glad you think that he said warmly  she looked away from him  everard she sighed i believe you are in love with your wife  there was a strange almost a terrible mixture of expressions in his face as he answereda certain fear a certain fondness a certain almost desperate resignation even his voice as a rule so slow and measured shook with an emotion which amazed his companion  i believe i am he muttered i am afraid of my feelings for her it may bring even another tragedy down upon us  dont talk rubbish caroline exclaimed what tragedy could come between you now youve recovered your balance you are a strong steadfast person just fitted to be the protector of anything so sweet and charming as rosamund tragedy indeed why dont you take her down to the south of france everard and have your honeymoon all over again  i cant do that just yet  she studied him curiously there were times when he seemed wholly incomprehensible to her  are you still worried about that unthank affair she asked  he hesitated for a moment  there is still an aftermath to our troubles he told her one cloud which leans over us i shall clear it up in timebut other things may happen first  you take yourself very seriously everard she observed looking at him with a puzzled expression one would think that there was a side of your life and a very important one which you kept entirely to yourself why do you have that funny little man seaman always round with you youre not being blackmailed or anything are you  on the contrary he told her seaman was the first founder of my fortunes  she shrugged her shoulders  i have made a little money once or twice on the stock exchange she remarked but i didnt have to carry my broker about in my pocket afterwards  seaman is a goodhearted little fellow and he loves companionship he will drift away presently and one wont see anything of him for ages  henry began to wonder she concluded drily whether you were going to stand for parliament on the anglogerman alliance ticket  dominey laughed as he caught middletons reproachful eye in the doorway of the farmers kitchen in which they were hunching he gave the signal to rise  i have had some thoughts of parliament he admitted butwell henry need not worry    chapter xxiv  the next morning saw the breakingup of domineys carefully arranged shooting party the prince took his hosts arm and led him to one side for a few moments as the cars were being loaded up his first few words were of formal thanks he spoke then more intimately  von ragastein he said i desire to refer back for a moment to our conversation the other day  dominey shook his head and glanced behind  i know only one name here prince  dominey then i will confess that you play and carry the part through perfectly i have known english gentlemen all my life and you have the trick of the thing but listen i have already told you of my disapproval of this scheme in which you are the central figure  it is understood dominey assented  that the prince continued is a personal matter what i am now going to say to you is official i had despatches from berlin last night they concern you  dominey seemed to stiffen a little  well  i am given to understand the ambassador continued that you practically exist only in the event of that catastrophe which i for one cannot foresee i am assured that if your expose should take place at any time your personation will be regarded as a private enterprise and there is nothing whatever to connect you with any political work  up to the present that is absolutely so dominey agreed  i am further advised to look upon you as my unnamed and unsuspected successor here in the event of war for that reason i am begged to inaugurate terms of intimacy with you to treat you with the utmost confidence and if the black end should come to leave in your hands all such unfulfilled work as can be continued in secrecy and silence i perhaps express myself in a somewhat confused manner  i understand perfectly dominey replied the authorities have changed their first idea as to my presence here they want to keep every shadow of suspicion away from me so that in the event of war i shall have an absolutely unique position an unsuspected yet fervently patriotic german living hand in glove with the upper classes of english society one can well imagine that there would be work for me  our understanding is mutual terniloff declared what i have to say to you therefore is that i hope you will soon follow us to london and give me the opportunity of offering you the constant hospitality of carlton house gardens  you are very kind prince dominey said my instructions are as soon as i have consolidated my position herean event which i fancy i may consider attainedto establish myself in london and to await orders i trust that amongst other things you will then permit me to examine the memoirs you spoke of the other day  naturally and with the utmost pleasure the ambassador assented they are a faithful record of my interviews and negotiations with certain ministers here and they reflect a desire and intention for peace which will i think amaze you i venture now upon a somewhat delicate question he continued changing the subject of their conversation abruptly as they turned back along the terrace lady dominey will accompany you  of that i am not sure dominey replied thoughtfully i have noticed prince if i may be allowed to say so your chivalrous regard for that lady you will permit me to assure you that in the peculiar position in which i am placed i shall never forget that she is the wife of everard dominey  terniloff shook hands heartily  i wanted to hear that from you he admitted you i felt instinctively were different but there are many men of our race who are willing enough to sacrifice a woman without the slightest scruple either for their passions or their policy i find lady dominey charming  she will never lack a protector in me dominey declared  there were more farewells and soon after the little procession of cars drove off rosamund herself was on the terrace bidding all her guests farewell she clung to domineys arm when at last they turned back into the empty hall  what dear people they were everard she exclaimed i only wish that i had seen more of them the duchess was perfectly charming to me and i never knew any one with such delightful manners as prince terniloff are you going to miss them very much dear  not a bit he answered i think i shall take a gun now and stroll down the meadows and across the rough ground will you come with me or will you put on one of your pretty gowns and entertain me downstairs at luncheon it is a very long time since we had a meal alone together  she shook her head a little sadly  we never have had she answered you know that everard and alas i know it but we are going on pretending arent we  he raised her fingers to his lips and kissed them  you shall pretend all that you like dear rosamund he promised and i will be the shadow of your desires no no tears he added quickly as she turned away remember there is nothing but happiness for you now whoever i am or am not that is my one aim in life  she clutched at his hand passionately and suddenly as though finding it insufficient twined her arms around his neck and kissed him  let me come with you she begged i cant bear to let you go ill be very quiet will you wait ten minutes for me  of course he answered  he strolled down towards the gun room stood by the fire for a moment and then wandered out into the courtyard where middleton and a couple of beaters were waiting for him with the dogs he had scarcely taken a step towards them however when he stopped short to his amazement seaman was there standing a little on one side with his eyes fixed upon the windows of the servants quarters  hullo my friend he exclaimed why i thought you went by the early train from thursford station  missed it by two minutes seaman replied with a glance towards the beaters i knew all the cars were full for the eleven oclock so i thought id wait till the afternoon  and where have you been to for the last few hours then  seaman had reached his side now and was out of earshot of the others  trying to solve the mystery of johann wolffs sudden departure last night come and walk down the avenue with me a short way  a very short distance then i am expecting lady dominey  they passed through the thin iron gates and paced along one of the back entrances to the hall  do not think me indiscreet seaman began i returned without the knowledge of any one and i kept out of the way until they had all gone it is what i told you before things which i do not understand depress me and behold i have found proof this morning of a further significance in wolffs sudden departure  proceed dominey begged  i learned this morning entirely by accident that mr pelhams servant was either mistaken or willfully deceived me wolff did not accompany your butler to the station  and how did you find that out dominey demanded  it is immaterial what is material is that there is a sort of conspiracy amongst the servants here to conceal the manner of his leaving do not interrupt me i beg early this morning there was a fresh fall of snow which has now disappeared outside the window of the room which i found locked were the marks of footsteps and the tracks of a small car  and what do you gather from all this dominey asked  i gather that wolff must have had friends in the neighbourhood seaman replied or else  well  my last supposition sounds absurd seaman confessed but the whole matter is so incomprehensible that i was going to sayor else he was forcibly removed  dominey laughed softly  wolff would scarcely have been an easy man to abduct would he he remarked even if we could hit upon any plausible reason for such a thing as a matter of fact seaman he concluded turning on his heel a little abruptly as he saw rosamund standing in the avenue i cannot bring myself to treat this johann wolff business seriously granted that the man was a spy well let him get on with it we are doing our job here in the most perfect and praiseworthy fashion we neither of us have the ghost of a secret to hide from his employers  in a sense that is true seaman admitted  well then cheer up dominey enjoined take a little walk with us and we will see whether parkins cannot find us a bottle of that old burgundy for lunch how does that sound  if you will excuse me from taking the walk seaman begged i would like to remain here until your return  you are more likely to do harm dominey reminded him and set the servants talking if you show too much interest in this mans disappearance  i shall be careful seaman promised but there are certain things which i cannot help i work always from instinct and my instinct is never wrong i will ask no more questions of your servants but i know that there is something mysterious about the sudden departure of johann wolff  dominey and rosamund returned about one oclock to find a note from seaman which the former tore open as his companion stood warming her feet in front of the fire there were only a few lines   i am following an idea it takes me to london let us meet there within a few days  s   has he really gone rosamund asked  back to london  she laughed happily then we shall lunch a deux after all delightful i have my wish  there was a sudden glow in domineys face a glow which was instantly suppressed  shall i ever have mine he asked with a queer little break in his voice    chapter xxv  terniloff and dominey one morning about six months later lounged underneath a great elm tree at ranelagh having iced drinks after a round of golf several millions of perspiring englishmen were at the same moment studying with dazed wonder the headlines in the midday papers  i suppose the ambassador remarked as he leaned back in his chair with an air of lazy content that i am being accused of fiddling while rome burns  every one has certainly not your confidence in the situation dominey rejoined calmly  there is no one else who knows quite so much terniloff reminded him  dominey sipped his drink for a moment or two in silence  have you the latest news of the russian mobilisation he asked they had some startling figures in the city this morning  the prince waved his hand  my faith is not founded on these extraneous incidents he replied if russia mobilises it is for defence no nation in the world would dream of attacking germany nor has germany the slightest intention of imperilling her coming supremacy amongst the nations by such crude methods as military enterprise servia must be punished naturally but to that in principle every nation in europe is agreed we shall not permit austria to overstep the mark  you are at least consistent prince dominey remarked  terniloff smiled  that is because i have been taken behind the scenes he said i have been shown as is the privilege of ambassadors the mind of our rulers you my friend he went on spent your youth amongst the military faction you think that you are the most important people in germany well you are not the kaiser has willed it otherwise bytheby i had yesterday a most extraordinary cable from stephanie  dominey ceased swinging his putter carelessly over the head of a daisy and turned his head to listen  is she on the way home  she is due in southampton at any moment now she wants to know where she can see me immediately upon her arrival as she has information of the utmost importance to give me  did she ever tell you the reason for her journey to africa  she was most mysterious about it if such an idea had had any logical outcome i should have surmised that she was going there to seek information as to your past  she gave seaman the same idea dominey observed i scarcely see what she has to gain in africa as a matter of fact he went on my life would bear the strictest investigation  the whole affair is singularly foolish the prince declared still i am not sure that you have been altogether wise even accepting your position i see no reason why you should not have obeyed the kaisers behest my experience of your society here is that love affairs between men and women moving in the same circles are not uncommon  that dominey urged is when they are all tarred with the same brush my behaviour towards lady dominey has been culpable enough as it is to have placed her in the position of a neglected wife would have been indefensible further it might have affected the position which it is in the interests of my work that i should maintain here  an old subject the ambassador sighed best not rediscussed behold our womenkind  rosamund and the princess had issued from the house and the two men hastened to meet them the latter looked charming exquisitely gowned and stately in appearance by her side rosamund dressed with the same success but in younger fashion seemed almost like a child they passed into the luncheon room crowded with many little parties of distinguished and interesting people brilliant with the red livery of the waiters the profusion of flowersall that nameless elegance which had made the place societys most popular rendezvous the women as they settled into their places asked a question which was on the lips of a great many english people of that day  is there any news  terniloff perhaps felt that he was the cynosure of many eager and anxious eyes he smiled lightheartedly as he answered  none if there were i am convinced that it would be good i have been allowed to play out my titanic struggle against sir everard without interruption  i suppose the next important question to whether it is to be peace or war is how did you play the princess asked  i surpassed myself her husband replied but of course no ordinary human golfer is of any account against dominey he plays far too well for any selfrespecting ger  the ambassador broke off and paused while he helped himself to mayonnaise  for any selfrespecting german to play against he concluded  luncheon was a very pleasant meal and a good many people noticed the vivacity of the beautiful lady dominey whose picture was beginning to appear in the illustrated papers afterwards they drank coffee and sipped liqueurs under the great elm tree on the lawn listening to the music and congratulating themselves upon having made their escape from london in the evershifting panorama of gailydressed women and flannelclad men the monotony of which was varied here and there by the passing of a diplomatist or a frenchman scrupulously attired in morning clothes were many familiar faces caroline and a little group of friends waved to them from the terrace eddy pelham in immaculate white and a long tennis coat with dark blue edgings paused to speak to them on his way to the courts  how is the motor business eddy dominey asked with a twinkle in his eyes  so so im not quite so keen as i was to tell you the truth the young man confided glancing around and lowering his voice so that no one should share the momentous information i was lucky enough to pick up a small share in jere moores racing stable at newmarket the other day i fancy i know a little more about geegees than i do about the inside of motors what  i should think very possibly that you are right dominey assented as the young man passed on with a farewell salute  terniloff looked after him curiously  it is the type of young man that he declared which we cannot understand what would happen to him in the event of a war in the event of his being called upon say either to fight or do some work of national importance for his country  i expect he would do it dominey replied he would do it pluckily wholeheartedly and badly he is a type of the upperclass young englishman oversanguine and entirely undisciplined they expect and their country expects for them that in the case of emergency pluck would take the place of training  the right honourable gerald watson stood upon the steps talking to the wife of the italian ambassador she left him presently and he came strolling down the lawn with his hands behind his back and his eyes seeming to see out past the golf links  there goes a man terniloff murmured whom lately i have found changed when i first came here he met me quite openly i believe even now he is sincerely desirous of peace and amicable relations between our two countries and yet something has fallen between us i cannot tell what it is i cannot tell even of what nature it is but i have an instinct for peoples attitude towards me and the english are the worst race in the world at hiding their feelings has mr watson i wonder come under the spell of your connection the duke of worcester he seemed so friendly with both of us down in norfolk  their womenkind left them at that moment to talk to some acquaintances seated a short distance way mr watson passing within a few yards of them was brought to a standstill by domineys greeting they talked for a moment or two upon idle subjects  your news i trust continues favourable the ambassador remarked observing the etiquette which required him to be the first to leave the realms of ordinary conversation  it is a little negative in quality the other answered after a moments hesitation i am summoned to downing street again at six oclock  i have already confided the result of my morning despatches to the prime minister terniloff observed  i went through them before i came down here was the somewhat doubtful reply  you will have appreciated i hope their genuinely pacific tone terniloff asked anxiously  his interlocutor bowed and then drew himself up it was obvious that the strain of the last few days was telling upon him there were lines about his mouth and his eyes spoke of sleepless nights  words are idle things to deal with at a time like this he said one thing however i will venture to say to you prince here and under these circumstances there will be no war unless it be the will of your country  terniloff was for a moment unusually pale it was an episode of unrecorded history he rose to his feet and raised his hat  there will be no war he said solemnly  the cabinet minister passed on with a lighter step dominey more clearly than ever before understood the subtle policy which had chosen for his great position a man as chivalrous and faithful and yet as simpleminded as terniloff he looked after the retreating figure of the cabinet minister with a slight smile at the corner of his lips  in a time like this he remarked significantly one begins to understand why one of our great writerswas it bernhardi i wonderhas written that no island could ever breed a race of diplomatists  the seas which engirdle this island the ambassador said thoughtfully have brought the english great weal as they may bring to her much woe the toonimble brain of the diplomat has its parallel of insincerity in the people whose interests he seems to guard i believe in the honesty of the english politicians i have placed that belief on record in the small volume of memoirs which i shall presently entrust to you but we talk too seriously for a summer afternoon let us illustrate to the world our opinion of the political situation and play another nine holes at golf  dominey rose willingly to his feet and the two men strolled away towards the first tee  by the by terniloff asked what of our cheerful little friend seaman he ought to be busy just now  curiously enough he is returning from germany tonight dominey announced i expect him at berkeley square he is coming direct to me    chapter xxvi  these were days to all dwellers in london of vivid impressions of poignant memories reasserting themselves afterwards with a curious sense of unreality as though belonging to another set of days and another world dominey long remembered his dinner that evening in the sombre handsomely furnished diningroom of his town house in berkeley square although it lacked the splendid proportions of the banqueting hall at dominey it was still a fine apartment furnished in the georgian period with some notable pictures upon the walls and with a wonderful ceiling and fireplace dominey and rosamund dined alone and though the table had been reduced to its smallest proportions the space between them was yet considerable as soon as parkins had gravely put the port upon the table rosamund rose to her feet and instead of leaving the room pointed for the servant to place a chair for her by domineys side  i shall be like your men friends everard she declared when the ladies have left and draw up to your side now what do we do tell stories i promise you that i will be a wonderful listener  first of all you drink half a glass of this port he declared filling her glass then you peel me one of those peaches and we divide it after which we listen for a ring at the bell tonight i expect a visitor  a visitor  not a social one he assured her a matter of business which i fear will take me from you for the rest of the evening so let us make the most of the time until he comes  she commenced her task with the peach talking to him all the time a little gravely a sweet and picturesque picture of a graceful and very desirable woman her delicate shape and artistic fragility more than ever accentuated by the sombreness of the background  do you know everard she said i am so happy in london here with you and i feel all the time so strong and well i can read and understand the books which were a maze of print to me before i can see the things in the pictures and feel the thrill of the music which seemed to come to me somehow before all dislocated and discordant you understand dear  of course he answered gravely  i do not wonder she went on that doctor harrison is proud of me for a patient but there are many times when i feel a dull pain in my heart because i know that whatever he or anybody else might say i am not quite cured  rosamund dear he protested  ah but dont interrupt she insisted depositing his share of the peach upon his plate how can i be cured when all the time there is the problem of you the problem which i am just as far off solving as ever i was often i find myself comparing you with the everard whom i married  do i fail so often to come up to his standard he asked  you never fail she answered looking at him with brimming eyes of course he was very much more affectionate she went on after a moments pause his kisses were not like yours and he was far fonder of having me with him then on the other hand often when i wanted him he was not there he did wild things mad things he seemed to forget me altogether it was that she went on that was so terrible it was that which made me so nervous i think that i should even have been able to stand those awful moments when he came back to me covered with blood and reeling if it had not been that i was already almost a wreck you know he killed roger unthank that night that is why he was never able to come back  why do you talk of these things tonight rosamund dominey begged  i must dear she insisted laying her fingers upon his hand and looking at him curiously i must even though i see how they distress you it is wonderful that you should mind so much everard but you do and i love you for it  mind he groaned mind  you are so like him and yet so different she went on meditatively you drink so little wine you are always so selfcontrolled so serious you live as though you had a life around you of which others knew nothing the everard i remember would never have cared about being a magistrate or going into parliament he would have spent his time racing or yachting hunting or shooting as the fancy took him and yet  and yet what dominey asked a little hoarsely  i think he loved me better than you she said very sadly  why he demanded  i cannot tell you she answered with her eyes upon her plate but i think that he did  dominey walked suddenly to the window and leaned out there were drops of moisture upon his forehead he felt the fierce need of air when he came back she was still sitting there still looking down  i have spoken to doctor harrison about it she went on her voice scarcely audible he told me that you probably loved more than you dared to show because someday the real everard might come back  that is quite true he reminded her softly he may come back at any moment  she gripped his hand her voice shook with passion she leaned towards him her other arm stole around his neck  but i dont want him to come back she cried i want you  dominey sat for a moment motionless like a figure of stone through the wideflung blindshielded windows came the raucous cry of a newsboy breaking the stillness of the summer evening and then another and sharper interruptionthe stopping of a taxicab outside the firm insistent ringing of the front doorbell recollection came to dominey and a great strength the fire which had leaped up within him was thrust back his response to her wave of passion was infinitely tender  dear rosamund he said that front doorbell summons me to rather an important interview will you please trust in me a little while longer believe me i am not in any way cold i am not indifferent there is something which you will have to be toldsomething with which i never reckoned something which is beginning to weigh upon me night and day trust me rosamund and wait  she sank back into her chair with a piquant and yet pathetic little grimace  you tell me always to wait she complained i will be patient but you shall tell me this you are so kind to me you make or mar my life you must care a little please  he was standing up now he kissed her hands fondly his voice had all the old ring in it  more than for any woman on earth dear rosamund    seaman in a light grey suit a panama and a white beflowered tie had lost something of the placid urbanity of a few months ago he was hot and tired with travel there were new lines in his face and a queer expression of anxiety about his eyes at the corners of which little wrinkles had begun to appear he responded to domineys welcome with a fervour which was almost feverish scrutinised him closely as though expecting to find some change and finally sank into an easychair with a little gesture of relief he had been carrying a small brown despatch case which he laid on the carpet by his side  you have news dominey asked  yes was the momentous reply i have news  dominey rang the bell he had already surmised from the dressingcase and coats in the hall that his visitor had come direct from the station  what will you have he enquired  a bottle of hock with seltzer water and ice if you have it seaman replied also a plate of cold meat but it must be served here and afterwards the biggest cigar you have i have indeed news news disturbing news magnificent news astounding  dominey gave some orders to the servant who answered his summons for a few moments they spoke trivialities of the journey when everything was served however and the door closed seaman could wait no longer his appetite his thirst his speech seemed all stimulated to swift action  we are of the same temperament he said that i know we will speak first of what is more than disturbinga little terrifying the mystery of johann wolff has been solved  the man who came to us with messages from schmidt in south africa dominey asked i had almost forgotten about him  the same what was at the back of his visit to us that night i cannot even now imagine neither is it clear why he held aloof from me who am his superior in practically the same service there we are from the commencement confronted with a very singular happening but scarcely so singular as the denouement wolff vanished from your house that night into an english fortress  it seems incredible dominey declared bluntly  it is nevertheless true seaman insisted no member of our service is allowed to remain more than one month without communicating his existence and whereabouts to headquarters no word has been received from wolff since that night in january on the other hand indirect information has reached us that he is in durance over here  but such a thing is against the law unheard of dominey protested no country can keep the citizen of another country in prison without formulating a definite charge or bringing him up for trial  seaman smiled grimly  thats all very well in any ordinary case he said wolff has been a marked man for years though wilhelmstrasse would soon make fuss enough if it were of any use but it would not be there are one or two englishmen in german prisons at the present moment concerning whose welfare the english foreign office has not even thought it worth while to enquire what troubles me more than the actual fact of wolffs disappearance is the mystery of his visit to you and his apprehension practically on the spot  they must have tracked him down there dominey remarked  yes but they couldnt thrust a pair of tongs into your butlers sittingroom extract johann wolff and set him down inside norwich castle or whatever prison he may be in seaman objected however the most disquieting feature about wolff is that it introduces something we dont understand for the rest we have many men as good and better and the time for their utility is past you are our great hope now dominey  it is to be then  seaman took a long and ecstatic draught of his hock and seltzer  it is to be he declared solemnly there was never any doubt about it if russia ceases to mobilise tomorrow if every statesman in servia crawls to vienna with a rope around his neck the result would still be the same the word has gone out the whole of germany is like a vast military camp it comes exactly twelve months before the final day fixed by our great authorities but the opportunity is too great too wonderful for hesitation by the end of august we shall be in paris  you bring news indeed dominey murmured standing for a moment by the opened window  i have been received with favour in the very loftiest circles seaman continued you and i both stand high in the list of those to whom great rewards shall come his majesty approves altogether of your reluctance to avail yourself of his permission to wed the princess eiderstrom von ragastein has decided well he declared these are not the days for marriage or giving in marriage these the most momentous days the world has ever known the days when an empire shall spring into being the mightiest since the continents fell into shape and the stars looked down upon this present world those are the words of the all highest in his eyes the greatest of all attributes is singleness of purpose you followed your own purpose contrary to my advice contrary to terniloffs you will gain by it  seaman finished his meal in due course and the tray was removed soon the two men were alone again seaman puffing out dense volumes of smoke gripping his cigar between his teeth brandishing it sometimes in his hand to give effect to his words a little of his marvellous caution seemed to have deserted him for the first time he spoke directly to his companion  von ragastein he said it is a great country ours it is a wonderful empire we shall build tonight i am on fire with the mighty things i have a list of instructions for you many details they can wait we will talk of our future our great and glorious destiny as the mightiest nation who has ever earned for herself the right to govern the world you would think that in germany there was excitement there is none the task of every one is allotted their work made clear to them like a mighty piece of gigantic machinery we move towards war every regiment knows its station every battery commander knows his positions every general knows his exact line of attack rations clothing hospitals every unit of which you can think has its movements calculated out for it to the last nicety  and the final result dominey asked is that also calculated  seaman with trembling fingers unlocked the little despatch box which stood by his side and took from it jealously a sheet of linenbacked parchment  you my friend he said are one of the first to gaze upon this this will show you the dream of our kaiser this will show you the framework of the empire that is to be  he laid out a map upon the table the two men bent over it it was a map of europe in which england a diminished france spain portugal and italy were painted in dark blue for the rest the whole of the space included between two lines one from hamburg to athens the other from finland to the black sea was painted a deep scarlet with here and there portions of it in slightly lighter colouring seaman laid his palm upon the map  there lies our future empire he said solemnly and impressively  explain it to me dominey begged  broadly speaking everything between those two lines belongs to the new german empire poland courland lithuania and the ukraine will possess a certain degree of autonomous government which will practically amount to nothing asia is there at our feet no longer will great britain control the supplies of the world raw materials of every description will be ours leather tallow wheat oil fats timberthey are all there for us to draw upon and for wealthindia and china what more could you have my friend  you take my breath away but what about austria  seamans grin was almost sardonic  austria he said must already feel her doom creeping upon her there is no room in middle europe for two empires and the house of hapsburg must fall before the house of hohenzollern austria body and soul must become part of the german empire then further down mark you roumania must become a vassal state or be conquered bulgaria is already ours turkey with constantinople is pledged greece will either join us or be wiped out servia will be blotted from the map probably also montenegro these countries which are painted in fainter red like turkey bulgaria and greece become vassal states to be absorbed one by one as opportunity presents itself  domineys finger strayed northward  belgium he observed has disappeared  belgium we shall occupy and enslave seaman replied our line of advance into france lies that way and we need her ports to dominate the thames holland and the scandinavian countries as you observe are left in the lighter shade of red if an opportunity occurs holland and denmark may be incited to take the field against us if they do so it means absorption if they remain as they probably will scared neutrals they will none the less be our vassal states when the last gun has been fired  and norway and sweden  seaman looked down at the map and smiled  look at them he said they lie at our mercy norway has her western seaboard and there might always be the question of british aid so far as she is concerned but sweden is ours body and soul more than any other of these vassal states it is our masters plan to bring her into complete subjection we need her lusty manhood the finest cannon food in the world for later wars if indeed such a thing should be she has timber and minerals which we also need but thereit is enough first of all men in this country my friend you von ragastein have gazed upon this picture of the future  this is marvellously conceived dominey muttered but what of russia with her millions how is it that we propose notwithstanding her countless millions of men to help ourselves to her richest provinces to drive a way through the heart of her empire  this seaman replied is where genius steps in russia has been ripe for a revolution any time for the last fifteen years we have secret agents now in every city and country place and throughout the army we shall teach russia how to make herself a free country  dominey shivered a little with an almost involuntary repulsion for the second time that almost satyrlike grin on seamans face revolted him  and what of my own work  seaman helped himself to a liqueur he was as a rule a moderate man but this was the third time he had replenished his glass since his hasty meal  my brain is weary friend he admitted passing his hand over his forehead i have a great fatigue the thoughts jump about this last week has been one of fierce excitements everything almost your daily life has been planned we shall go over it within a day or so meanwhile remember this it is our great aim to keep england out of the war  terniloff is right then after all dominey exclaimed  seaman laughed scornfully  if we want england out of the war he pointed out it is not that we desire her friendship it is that we may crush her the more easily when calais boulogne and havre are in our hands that will be in three months time then perhaps our attitude towards england may change a little now i go  dominey folded up the map with reluctance his companion shook his head it was curious that he too for the first time in his life upon the same day addressed his host differently  baron von ragastein he said there are six of those maps in existence that one is for you lock it away and guard it as though it were your greatest treasure on earth but when you are alone bring it out and study it it shall be your inspiration it shall lighten your moments of depression give you courage when you are in danger it shall fill your mind with pride and wonder it is yours  dominey folded it carefully up crossed the room unlocked a little safe and deposited it therein  i shall guard it according to your behest as my greatest treasure he assured his departing guest with a fervour which surprised even himself    chapter xxvii  there was something dramatic in the most lurid sense of the word about the brief telephone message which dominey received not so many hours later from carlton house terrace in a few minutes he was moving through the streets still familiar yet already curiously changed men and women were going about their business as usual but an air of stupefaction was everywhere apparent practically every loiterer was studying a newspaper every chance acquaintance had stopped to confer with his fellows war alternately the joke and bogey of the conversationalist stretched her grey hands over the sunlit city even the lightesthearted felt a thrill of apprehension at the thought of the horrors that were to come in a day or two all this was to be changed people went about then counting the russian millions the steamroller fetish was to be evolved the most peaceful stockbroker or shopkeeper who had never even been to a review in his life could make calculations of man power with a stump of pencil on the back of an old envelope which would convince the greatest pessimist that germany and austria were outnumbered by at least three to one but on this particular morning people were too stunned for calculations the incredible had happened the longdiscussed warthe nightmare of the nervous the derision of the optimisthad actually materialised the happygolucky years of peace and plenty had suddenly come to an end black tragedy leaned over the land  dominey avoiding acquaintances as far as possible his own mind in a curious turmoil passed down st jamess street and along pall mall and presented himself at carlton house terrace externally the great white building with its rows of flower boxes showed no signs of undue perturbation inside however the anteroom was crowded with callers and it was only by the intervention of terniloffs private secretary who was awaiting him that dominey was able to reach the inner sanctum where the ambassador was busy dictating letters he broke off immediately his visitor was announced and dismissed every one including his secretaries then he locked the door  von ragastein he groaned i am a broken man  dominey grasped his hand sympathetically terniloff seemed to have aged years even in the last few hours  i sent for you he continued to say farewell to say farewell and make a confession you were right and i was wrong it would have been better if i had remained and played the country farmer on my estates i was never shrewd enough to see until now that i have been made the catspaw of the very men whose policy i always condemned  his visitor still remained silent there was so little that he could say  i have worked for peace terniloff went on believing that my country wanted peace i have worked for peace with honourable men who were just as anxious as i was to secure it but all the time those for whom i laboured were making faces behind my back i was nothing more nor less than their tool i know now that nothing in this world could have hindered what is coming  every one will at least realise dominey reminded him that you did your best for peace  that is one reason why i sent for you was the agitated reply not long ago i spoke of a little volume a diary which i have been keeping of my work in this country i promised to show it to you you have asked me for it several times lately i am going to show it to you now it is written up to yesterday it will tell you of all my efforts and how they were foiled it is an absolutely faithful narrative of my work here and the english response to it  the prince crossed the room unlocked one of the smaller safes which stood against the side of the wall withdrew a moroccobound volume the size of a small portfolio and returned to dominey  i beg you he said earnestly to read this with the utmost care and to await my instructions with regard to it you can judge no doubt he went on a little bitterly why i give it into your keeping even the embassy here is not free from our own spies and the existence of these memoirs is known the moment i reach germany their fate is assured i am a german and a patriot although my heart is bitter against those who are bringing this blot upon our country for that reason these memoirs must be kept in a safe place until i see a good use for them  you mean if the governing party in german should change  precisely they would then form at once my justification and place english diplomacy in such a light before the saner portion of my fellow countrymen that an honourable peace might be rendered possible study them carefully von ragastein perhaps even your own allegiance to the party you serve may waver for a moment as you read  i serve no party dominey said quietly only my country  terniloff sighed  alas there is no time for us to enter into one of our old arguments on the ethics of government i must send you away von ragastein you have a terrible task before you i am bound to wish you godspeed for myself i shall not raise my head again until i have left england  there is no other commission dominey asked no other way in which i can serve you  none terniloff answered sadly i am permitted to suffer no inconveniences my departure is arranged for as though i were royalty yet believe me my friend every act of courtesy and generosity which i receive in these moments bites into my heart farewell  dominey found a taxicab in pall mall and drove back to berkeley square he found rosamund with a little troop of dogs just entering the gardens and crossed to her side  dear he asked taking her arm would you mind very much coming down to norfolk for a few days  with you she asked quickly  yes i want to be in retreat for a short time there are one or two things i must settle before i take up some fresh work  i should love it she declared enthusiastically london is getting so hot and every one is so excited  i shall order the touring car at three oclock dominey told her we shall get home about nine parkins and your maid can go down by train does that suit you  delightfully  he took her arm and they paced slowly along the hot walk  rosamund dear he said the time has come which many people have been dreading we are at war  i know she murmured  you and i have had quite a happy time together these last few months he went on even though there is still that black cloud between us i have tried to treat you as kindly and tenderly as though i were really your husband and you were indeed my wife  youre not going away she cried startled i couldnt bear that no one could ever be so sweet as you have been to me  dear he said i want you to thinkof your husbandof everard he was a soldier once for a short time was he not what do you think he would have done now that this terrible war has come  he would have done what you will do she answered with the slightest possible tremor in her tone he would have become a soldier again he would have fought for his country  and so must ifight for my country he declared that is why i must leave you for an hour now while i make some calls i shall be back to luncheon directly afterwards we must start i have many things to arrange first though life is not going to be very easy for the next few days  she held on to his arm she seemed curiously reluctant to let him go  everard she said when we are at dominey shall i be able to see doctor harrison  of course he assured her  there is something i want to say to him she confided something i want to ask you too are you the same person everard when you are in town as when you are in the country  he was a little taken aback at her questionasked too with such almost plaintive seriousness the very aberration it suggested seemed altogether denied by her appearance she was wearing a dress of black and white muslin a large black hat paris shoes her stockings her gloves all the trifling details of her toilette were carefully chosen and her clothes themselves gracefully and naturally worn socially too she had been amazingly successful only the week before caroline had come to him with a little shrug of the shoulders  i have been trying to be kind to rosamund she said and finding out instead how unnecessary it is she is quite the most popular of the younger married women in our set you dont deserve such luck everard  you know the proverb about the old roue he had replied  his mind had wandered for a moment he realised rosamunds question with a little start  the same person dear he repeated i think so dont i seem so to you  she shook her head  i am not sure she answered a little mysteriously you see in the country i still remember sometimes that awful night when i so nearly lost my reason i have never seen you as you looked that night  you would rather not go back perhaps  that is the strange part of it she replied there is nothing in the world i want so much to do theres an empty taxi dear she added as they reached the gate i shall go in and tell justine about the packing    chapter xxviii  within the course of the next few days a strange rumour spread through dominey and the districtfrom the farm labourer to the farmer from the school children to their homes from the village postoffice to the neighbouring hamlets a gang of woodmen from a neighbouring county with an engine and all the machinery of their craft had started to work razing to the ground everything in the shape of tree or shrub at the north end of the black wood the matter of the war was promptly forgotten before the second day every man woman and child in the place had paid an awed visit to the outskirts of the wood had listened to the whirr of machinery had gazed upon the great bridge of planks leading into the wood had peered in the hope of some strange discovery into the tents of the men who were camping out the men themselves were not communicative and the first time the foreman had been known to open his mouth was when dominey walked down to discuss progress on the morning after his arrival  its a dirty bit of work sir he confided i dont know as i ever came across a bit of woodland as was so utterly hopelessly rotten why the wood crumbles when you touch it and the men have to be within reach of one another the whole of the time though weve a matter of five hundred planks down there  come across anything unusual yet  we aint come across anything that isnt unusual so far sir my men are all wearing extra leggings to keep them from being bitten by them addersas long as my arm some of em and theres fungus there which when you touch it sends out a smell enough to make a man faint we killed a cat the first day as big and as fierce as a young tigress its a queer job sir  how long will it take  matter of three weeks sir and when weve got the timber out youll be well advised to burn it its not worth a snap of the fingersbegging your pardon sir the man went on the old lady in the distance there hangs about the whole of the time some of my men are half scared of her  dominey swung around on a mound a little distance away in the park rachael unthank was standing in her rusty black clothes unrelieved by any trace of colour her white cheeks and strange eyes even in the morning light she was a repellent figure dominey strolled across to her  you see mrs unthank he began  she interrupted him her skinny hand was stretched out towards the wood  what are those men doing sir everard dominey she demanded what is your will with the wood  i am carrying out a determination i came to in the winter dominey replied those men are going to cut and hew their way from one end of the black wood to the other until not a tree or a bush remains upright as they cut they burn afterwards i shall have it drained we may live to see a field of corn there mrs unthank  you will dare to do this she asked hoarsely  will you dare to tell me why i should not mrs unthank  she relapsed into silence and dominey passed on but that night as rosamund and he were lingering over their dessert enjoying the strange quiet and the wonderful breeze which crept in at the open window parkins announced a visitor  mrs unthank is in the library sir he announced she would be glad if you could spare her five minutes  rosamund shivered slightly but nodded as dominey glanced towards her enquiringly  dont let me see her please she begged you must go of courseeverard  yes dear  i know what you are doing out there although you have never said a word to me about it she continued with an odd little note of passion in her tone dont let her persuade you to stop let them cut and burn and hew till there isnt room for a mouse to hide you promise  i promise he answered  mrs unthank was making every effort to keep under control her fierce discomposure she rose as dominey entered the room and dropped an oldfashioned curtsey  well mrs unthank he enquired what can i do for you  its about the wood again sir she confessed i cant bear it all night long i seem to hear those axes and the calling of the men  what is your objection mrs unthank to the destruction of the black wood dominey asked bluntly it is nothing more nor less than a noisome pesthole its very presence there after all that she has suffered is a menace to lady domineys nerves i am determined to sweep it from the face of the earth  the forced respect was already beginning to disappear from her manner  theres evil will come to you if you do sir everard she declared doggedly  plenty of evil has come to me from that wood as it is he reminded her  you mean to disturb the spirit of him whose body you threw there she persisted  dominey looked at her calmly some sort of evil seemed to have lit in her face her lips had shrunk apart showing her yellow teeth the fire in her narrowed eyes was the fire of hatred  i am no murderer mrs unthank he said your son stole out from the shadow of that wood attacked me in a cowardly manner and we fought he was mad when he attacked me he fought like a madman and notwithstanding my superior strength i was glad to get away alive i never touched his body it lay where he fell if he crept into the wood and died there then his death was not at my door he sought for my life as i never sought for his  youd done him wrong the woman muttered  that again is false his passion for lady dominey was uninvited and unreciprocated her only feeling concerning him was one of fear that the whole countryside knows your son was a lonely a morose and an illliving man mrs unthank if either of us had murder in our hearts it was he not i and as for you dominey went on after a moments pause i think that you have had your revenge mrs unthank it was you who nursed my wife into insanity it was you who fed her with the horror of your sons socalled spirit i think that if i had stayed away another two years lady dominey would have been in a madhouse today  i would to heaven the woman cried that youd rotted to death in africa  you carry your evil feelings far mrs unthank he replied take my advice give up this foolish idea that the black wood is still the home of your sons spirit go and live on your annuity in another part of the country and forget  he moved across the room to throw open a window her eyes followed him wonderingly  i have heard a rumour she said slowly there has been a word spoken here and there about you ive had my doubts sometimes i have them again every time you speak are you really everard dominey  he swung around and faced her  who else  theres one she went on has never believed it and thats her ladyship ive heard strange talk from the people whove come under your masterful ways youre a harder man than the everard dominey i remember what if you should be an impostor  you have only to prove that mrs unthank dominey replied and a portion at any rate of the black wood may remain standing you will find it a little difficult thoughyou must excuse my ringing the bell i see no object in asking you to remain longer  she rose unwillingly to her feet her manner was sullen and unyielding  you are asking for the evil things she warned him  be assured dominey answered that if they come i shall know how to deal with them    dominey found rosamund and doctor harrison who had walked over from the village lingering on the terrace he welcomed the latter warmly  you are a godsend doctor he declared i have been obliged to leave my port untasted for want of a companion you will excuse us for a moment rosamund  she nodded pleasantly and the doctor followed his host into the diningroom and took his seat at the table where the dessert still remained  old woman threatening mischief the latter asked with a keen glance from under his shaggy grey eyebrows  i think she means it dominey replied as he filled his guests glass personally he went on after a moments pause the present situation is beginning to confirm an old suspicion of mine i am a hard and fast materialist you know doctor in certain matters and i have not the slightest faith in the vindictive mother terrified to death lest the razing of a wood of unwholesome character should turn out into the cold world the spirit of her angel son  what do you believe the doctor asked bluntly  i would rather not tell you at the present moment dominey answered it would sound too fantastic  your note this afternoon spoke of urgency the doctor observed  the matter is urgent i want you to do me a great favourto remain here all night  you are expecting something to happen  i wish at any rate to be prepared  ill stay with pleasure the doctor promised you can lend me some paraphernalia i suppose and give me a shakedown somewhere near lady domineys bytheby he began and hesitated  i have followed your advice or rather your orders dominey interrupted a little harshly it has not always been easy especially in london where rosamund is away from these associationsi am hoping great things from what may happen tonight or very soon  the doctor nodded sympathetically  i shouldnt wonder if you werent on the right track he declared  rosamund came in through the window to them and seated herself by domineys side  why are you two whispering like conspirators she demanded  because we are conspirators he replied lightly i have persuaded doctor harrison to stay the night he would like a room in our wing will you let the maids know dear  she nodded thoughtfully  of course there are several rooms quite ready mrs midgeley thought that we might be bringing down some guests i am quite sure that we can make doctor harrison comfortable  no doubt about that lady dominey the doctor declared let me be as near to your apartment as possible  there was a shade of anxiety in her face  you think that tonight something will happen she asked  tonight or one night very soon dominey assented it is just as well for you to be prepared you will not be afraid dear you will have the doctor on one side of you and me on the other  i am only afraid of one thing she answered a little enigmatically i have been so happy lately    dominey changed into ordinary morning clothes with a thick cord tied round his body a revolver in his pocket and a loaded stick in his hand spent the remainder of the night and part of the early morning concealed behind a great clump of rhododendrons his eyes fixed upon the shadowy stretch of park which lay between the house and the black wood the night was moonless but clear and when his eyes were once accustomed to the pale but sombre twilight the whole landscape and the moving objects upon it were dimly visible the habits of his years of bush life seemed instinctively in those few hours of waiting to have reestablished themselves every sense was strained and active every night soundof which the hooting of some owls disturbed from their lurking place in the black wood was predominantheard and accounted for and then just as he had glanced at his watch and found that it was close upon two oclock came the first real intimation that something was likely to happen moving across the park towards him he heard the sound of a faint patter curious and irregular in rhythm which came from behind a range of low hillocks he raised himself on his hands and knees to watch his eyes were fastened upon a certain spota stretch of the open park between himself and the hillocks the patter ceased and began again into the open there came a dark shape the irregularity of its movements swiftly explained it moved at first upon all fours then on two legs then on all fours again it crept nearer and nearer and dominey as he watched laid aside his stick it reached the terrace paused beneath rosamunds window now barely half a dozen yards from where he was crouching deliberately he waited waited for what he knew must soon come then the deep silence of the breathless night was broken by that familiar unearthly scream dominey waited till even its echoes had died away then he ran a few steps bent double and stretched out his hands once more for the last time that devils cry broke the deep stillness of the august morning throbbing a little as though with a new fear dying away as though the fingers which crushed it back down the straining throat had indeed crushed with it the last flicker of some unholy life  when doctor harrison made his hurried appearance a few moments later he found dominey seated upon the terrace furiously smoking a cigarette on the ground a few yards away lay something black and motionless  what is it the doctor gasped  for the first time dominey showed some signs of a lack of selfcontrol his voice was choked and uneven  go and look at it doctor he said its tied up hand and foot you can see where the spirit of roger unthank has hidden itself  bosh the doctor answered with grim contempt its roger unthank himself the beast  a little stream of servants came running out dominey gave a few orders quickly  ring up the garage he directed and i shall want one of the men to go into norwich to the hospital doctor will you go up and see lady dominey  the habits of a lifetime broke down parkins the immaculate the silent the perfect automaton asked an eager question  what is it sir  there was the sound of a window opening overhead at that moment parkins would not have asked in vain for an annuity dominey glanced at the little semicircle of servants and raised his voice  it is the end i trust of these foolish superstitions about roger unthanks ghost there lies roger unthank half beast half man for some reason or othersome lunatics reason of coursehe has chosen to hide himself in the black wood all these years his mother i presume has been his accomplice and taken him food he is still alive but in a disgusting state  there was a little awed murmur domineys voice had become quite matter of fact  i suppose he continued his first idea was to revenge himself upon us and this household by whom he imagined himself badly treated the man however was half a madman when he came to the neighbourhood and has behaved like one ever sincejohnson dominey continued singling out a sturdy footman with sound common sense get ready to take this creature into norwich hospital say that if i do not come in during the day a letter of explanation will follow from me the rest of you with the exception of parkins please go to bed  with little exclamations of wonder they began to disperse then one of them paused and pointed across the park moving with incredible swiftness came the gaunt black figure of rachael unthank swaying sometimes on her feet yet in their midst before they could realise it she staggered to the prostrate body and threw herself upon her knees her hands rested upon the unseen face her eyes glared across at dominey  so youve got him at last she gasped  mrs unthank dominey said sternly you are in time to accompany your son to the hospital at norwich the car will be here in two minutes i have nothing to say to you your own conscience should be sufficient punishment for keeping that poor creature alive in such a fashion and ministering during my absence to his accursed desire for vengeance  he would have died if i hadnt brought him food she muttered i have wept all the tears a womans broken heart could wring out beseeching him to come back to me  yet dominey insisted you shared his foul plot for vengeance against a harmless woman you let him come and make his ghoulish noises night by night under these windows without a word of remonstrance you knew very well what their accursed object wasyou with a delicate woman in your charge who trusted you you are an evil pair but of the two you are worse than your halfwitted son  the woman made no reply she was still on her knees bending over the prostrate figure from whose lips now came a faint moaning then the lights of the car flashed out as it left the garage passed through the iron gates and drew up a few yards away  help him in dominey ordered you can loosen his cords johnson as soon as you have started he has very little strength tell them at the hospital i shall probably be there during the day or tomorrow  with a little shiver the two men stooped to their task their prisoner muttered to himself all the time but made no resistance rachael unthank as she stepped in to take her place by his side turned once more to dominey she was a broken woman  youre rid of us she sobbed perhaps foreveryouve said harsh things of both of us roger isnt alwaysso bad sometimes hes more gentle than at others youd have thought then that he was just a baby living there for love of the wind and the trees and the birds if he comes to  her voice broke domineys reply was swift and not unkind he pointed to the window above  if lady dominey recovers you and your son are forgiven if she never recovers i wish you both the blackest corner of hell  the car drove off doctor harrison met dominey on the threshold as he turned towards the house  her ladyship is unconscious now he announced perhaps that is a good sign i never liked that unnatural calm shell be unconscious i think for a great many hours for gods sake come and get a whisky and soda and give me one    the early morning sunshine lay upon the park when the two men at last separated they stood for a moment looking out from the black wood came the whirr of a saw the little troop of men had left their tents the crash of a fallen tree heralded their mornings work  you are still going on with that the doctor asked  to the very last stump of a tree to the last bush to the last cluster of weeds dominey replied with a sudden passion in his tone i will have that place razed to the bare level of the earth and i will have its poisonous swamps sucked dry i have hated that foul spot he went on ever since i realised what suffering it meant to her my reign here may not be long doctori have my own tragedy to deal withbut those who come after me will never feel the blight of that accursed place  the doctor grunted his inner thoughts he kept to himself  maybe youre right he conceded    chapter xxix  the heat of a sulphurous afternoona curious parallel in its presage of coming storm to the fastapproaching crisis in domineys own affairshad driven dominey from his study on to the terrace in a chair by his side lounged eddy pelham immaculate in a suit of white flannels it was the fifth day since the mystery of the black wood had been solved  ripping old chap of you to have me down here the young man remarked amiably his hand stretching out to a tumbler which stood by his side the country when you can get ice is a paradise in this weather especially when londons so full of ghastly rumours and all that sort of thing whats the latest news of her ladyship  still unconscious dominey replied the doctors however seem perfectly satisfied everything depends on her waking moments  the young man abandoned the subject with a murmur of hopeful sympathy his eyes were fixed upon a little cloud of dust in the distance  expecting visitors today he asked  should not be surprised was the somewhat laconic answer  the young man stood up yawned and stretched himself  ill make myself scarce he said jove he added approvingly lingering for a moment jolly well cut the tunic of your uniform dominey if a country in peril ever decides to waive the matter of my indifferent physique and send me out to the rescue i shall go to your man  dominey smiled  mine is only the local yeomanry rigout he replied they will nab you for the guards  dominey stepped back through the open windows into his study as pelham strolled off he was seated at his desk poring over some letters when a few minutes later seaman was ushered into the room for a single moment his muscles tightened his frame became tense then he realised his visitors outstretched hands of welcome and he relaxed seaman was perspiring vociferous and excited  at last he exclaimed donner undmy god dominey what is this  thirteen years ago dominey explained i resigned a commission in the norfolk yeomanry that little matter however has been adjusted at a crisis like this  my friend you are wonderful seaman interrupted solemnly you are a man after my own heart you are thorough you leave nothing undone that is why he added lowering his voice a little we are the greatest race in the world drink before everything my friend he went on drink i must have what a day the very clouds that hide the sun are full of sulphurous heat  dominey rang the bell ordered hock and seltzer and ice seaman drank and threw himself into an easychair  there is no fear of your being called out of the country because of that i hope he asked a little anxiously nodding his head towards his companions uniform  not at present dominey answered i am a trifle over age to go with the first batch or two where have you been  seaman hitched his chair a little nearer  in ireland he confided sorry to desert you as i did but you do not begin to count for us just yet there was just a faint doubt as to what they were doing to do about internment that is why i had to get the irish trip off my mind  what has been decided  the government has the matter under consideration seaman replied with a chuckle i can certainly give myself six months before i need to slip off now tell me why do i find you down here  after terniloff left dominey explained i felt i wanted to get away i have been asked to start some recruiting work down here  terniloffleft his little volume with you  yes  where is it  safe dominey replied  seaman mopped his forehead  it needs to be he muttered i have orders to see it destroyed we can talk of that presently sometimes when i am away from you i tremble it may sound foolish but you have in your possession just the two thingsthat map and von terniloffs memoirswhich would wreck our propaganda in every country of the world  both are safe dominey assured him by the by my friend he went on do you know that you yourself are forgetting your usual caution  in what respect seaman demanded quickly  as you stooped to sit down just now i distinctly saw the shape of your revolver in your hip pocket you know as well as i do that with your name and the fact that you are only a naturalised englishman it is inexcusably foolish to be carrying firearms about just now  seaman thrust his hand into his pocket and threw the revolver upon the table  you are quite right he acknowledged take care of it for me i took it with me to ireland because one never knows what may happen in that amazing country  dominey swept it carelessly into the drawer of the desk at which he was sitting  our weapons from now on seaman continued must be the weapons of guile and craft you and i will have alas to see less of one another dominey in many ways it is unfortunate that we have not been able to keep england out of this for a few more months however the situation must be dealt with as it exists so far as you are concerned you have practically secured yourself against suspicion you will hold a brilliant and isolated place amongst those who are serving the great war lord when i do approach you it will be for sympathy and assistance against the suspicions of those farseeing englishmen  dominey nodded  you will stay the night he asked  if i may seaman assented it is the last time for many months when it will be wise for us to meet on such intimate terms perhaps our dear friend parkins will take vinous note of the occasion  in other words dominey said you propose that we shall drink the dominey cabinet hock and the dominey port to the glory of our country  to the glory of our country seaman echoed so be it my friendlisten  a car had passed along the avenue in front of the house there was the sound of voices in the hall a knock at the door the rustle of a womans clothes parkins a little disturbed announced the arrivals  the princess of eiderstrom anda gentleman the princess said that her errand with you was urgent sir he added turning apologetically towards his master  the princess was already in the room and following her a short man in a suit of sombre black wearing a white tie and carrying a black bowler hat he blinked across the room through his thick glasses and dominey knew that the end had come the door was closed behind them the princess came a little further into the room her hand was extended towards dominey but not in greeting her white finger pointed straight at him she turned to her companion  which is that doctor schmidt she demanded  the englishman by god schmidt answered  the silence which reigned for several seconds was intense and profound the coolest of all four was perhaps dominey the princess was pale with a passion which seemed to sob behind her words  everard dominey she cried what have you done with my lover what have you done with leopold von ragastein  he met with the fate dominey replied which he had prepared for me we fought and i conquered  you killed him  i killed him dominey echoed it was a matter of necessity his body sleeps on the bed of the blue river  and your life here has been a lie  on the contrary it has been the truth dominey objected i assured you at the carlton when you first spoke to me and i have assured you a dozen times since that i was everard dominey that is my name that is who i am  seamans voice seemed to come from a long way off for the moment the man had neither courage nor initiative he seemed as though he had received some sort of stroke his mind was travelling backwards  you came to me at cape town he muttered you had all von ragasteins letters you knew his history you had the imperial mandate  von ragastein and i exchanged the most intimate confidences in his camp dominey said as doctor schmidt there knows i told him my history and he told me his the letters and papers i took from him  schmidt had covered his face with his hands for a moment his shoulders were heaving  my beloved chief he sobbed my dear devoted master killed by that drunken englishman  not so drunk as you fancied him dominey said coolly not so far gone in his course of dissipation but that he was able to pull himself up when the great incentive came  the princess looked from one to the other of the two men seaman had still the appearance of a man struggling to extricate himself from some sort of nightmare  my first and only suspicion he faltered was that night when wolff disappeared  wolffs coming was rather a tragedy dominey admitted fortunately i had a secret service man in the house who was able to dispose of him  it was you who planned his disappearance seaman gasped  naturally dominey replied he knew the truth and was trying all the time to communicate with you  and the money seaman continued blinking rapidly one hundred thousand pounds and more  i understood that was a gift dominey replied if the german secret service however cares to formulate a claim and sue me  the princess suddenly interrupted her eyes seemed on fire  what are you you two she cried stretching out her hands towards schmidt and seaman are you lumps of earthclodscreatures without courage and intelligence you can let him stand therethe englishman who has murdered my lover who has befooled you you let him stand there and mock you and you do and say nothing is his life a sacred thing has he none of your secrets in his charge  the great god above us seaman groaned with a sudden white horror in his face he has the princes memoirs he has the kaisers map  on the contrary dominey replied both are deposited at the foreign office we hope to find them very useful a little later on  seaman sprang forward like a tiger and went down in a heap as he almost threw himself upon domineys outflung fist schmidt came stealing across the room and from underneath his cuff something gleamed  you are two to one the princess cried passionately as both assailants hesitated i would to god that i had a weapon or that i were a man  my dear princess a goodhumoured voice remarked from the window four to two the other way i think what  eddy pelham his hands in his pockets but a very alert gleam in his usually vacuous face stood in the windowed doorway from behind him two exceedingly formidablelooking men slipped into the room there was no fight not even a struggle seaman who had never recovered from the shock of his surprise and was now completely unnerved was handcuffed in a moment and schmidt disarmed the latter was the first to break the curious silence  what have i done he demanded why am i treated like this  doctor schmidt eddy asked pleasantly  that is my name sir was the fierce reply i have just landed from east africa we knew nothing of the war when we started i came to expose that man he is an impostora murderer he has killed a german nobleman  he has committed lese majeste seaman gasped he has deceived the kaiser he has dared to sit in his presence as the baron von ragastein  the young man in flannels glanced across at dominey and smiled  i say you two dont mean to be funny but you are he declared first of all theres doctor schmidt accuses sir everard here of being an impostor because he assumed his own name accuses him of murdering a man who had planned in cold bloodyou were in that by the by schmidtto kill him and then theres our friend here the secretary of the society for propagating better relations between the business men of england and germany complaining because sir everard carried through in germany for england exactly what he believed the baron von ragastein was carrying out herefor germany youre a curious thickheaded race you germans  i demand again schmidt shouted to know by what right i am treated as a criminal  because you are one eddy answered coolly you and von ragastein together planned the murder of sir everard dominey in east africa and i caught you creeping across the floor just now with a knife in your hand thatll do for you any questions to ask seaman  none was the surly reply  you are welladvised the young man remarked coolly within the last two days your house in forest hill and your offices in london wall have been searched  you have said enough seaman declared fate has gone against me i thank god that our master has abler servants than i and the strength to crush this island of popinjays and fools  popinjays seems severe eddy murmured in a hard tone however to get on with this little matter he added turning to one of his two subordinates you will find a military car outside take these men over to the guardroom at the norwich barracks i have arranged for an escort to see them to town tell the colonel ill be over later in the day  the princess rose from the chair into which she had subsided a few moments before dominey turned towards her  princess he said there can be little conversation between us yet i shall ask you to remember this von ragastein planned my death in cold blood i could have slain him as an assassin without the slightest risk but i preferred to meet him face to face with the truth upon my lips it was his life or mine i fought for my countrys sake as he did for his  the princess looked at him with glittering eyes  i shall hate you to the end of my days she declared because you have killed the thing i love but although i am a woman i know justice you were chivalrous towards me you treated leopold perhaps better than he would have treated you i pray that i shall never see your face again be so good as to suffer me to leave this house at once and unattended  dominey threw open the windows which led on to the terrace and stood on one side she passed by without a glance at him and disappeared eddy came strolling along the terrace a few moments later  nice old ducks those two dear heart he confided seaman has just offered forsyth my burly ruffian in the blue serge suit a hundred pounds to shoot him on the pretence that he was escaping  and what about schmidt  insisted on his rights as an officer and demanded the front seat and a cigar before the car started a pretty job dominey and neatly cleaned up  dominey was watching the dust from the two cars which were disappearing down the avenue  tell me eddy he asked theres one thing i have always been curious about how did you manage to keep that fellow wolff when there wasnt a war on and he wasnt breaking the law  the young man grinned  we had to stretch a point there old dear he admitted plans of a fortress eh  do you mean to say that he had plans of a fortress upon him dominey asked  picture postcard of norwich castle the young man confided but keep it dark can i have a drink before i get the little car going    the turmoil of the day was over and dominey after one silent but passionate outburst of thankfulness at the passing from his life of this unnatural restraint found all his thoughts absorbed by the struggle which was being fought out in the bedchamber above the old doctor came down and joined him at dinner time he met domineys eager glance with a little nod  shes doing all right he declared  no fever or anything  bless you no shes as near as possible in perfect health physically a different woman from what she was this time last year i can tell you when she wakes up shell either be herself again without a single illusion of any sort or  the doctor paused sipped his wine emptied his glass and set it down approvingly  or dominey insisted  or that part of her brain will be more or less permanently affected however i am hoping for the best thank heavens youre on the spot  they finished their dinner almost in silence afterwards they smoked for a few minutes upon the terrace then they made their way softly upstairs the doctor parted with dominey at the door of the latters room  i shall remain with her for an hour or so he said after that i shall leave her entirely to herself youll be here in case theres a change  i shall be here dominey promised    the minutes passed into hours uncounted unnoticed dominey sat in his easychair stirred by a tumultuous wave of passionate emotion the memory of those earlier days of his return came back to him with all their poignant longings he felt again the same tearing at the heartstrings the same strange unnerving tenderness the great worlds drama in which he knew that he too would surely continue to play his part seemed like a thing far off the concern of another race of men every fibre of his being seemed attuned to the magic and the music of one wild hope yet when there came what he had listened for so long the hope seemed frozen into fear he sat a little forward in his easychair his hands gripping its sides his eyes fixed upon the slowly widening crack in the panel it was as it had been before she stooped low stood up again and came towards him from behind an unseen hand closed the panel she came to him with her arms outstretched and all the wonderful things of life and love in her shining eyes that faint touch of the somnambulist had passed she came to him as she had never come before she was a very real and a very live woman  everard she cried  he took her into his arms at their first kiss she thrilled from head to foot for a moment she laid her head upon his shoulder  oh i have been so silly she confessed there were times when i couldnt believe that you were my everardmine and now i know  her lips sought his again his parched with the desire of years along the corridor the old doctor tiptoed his way to his room with a pleased smile upon his face
