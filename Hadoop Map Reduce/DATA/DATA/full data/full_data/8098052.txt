father barrys late interview with his bishop had been short devoid of controversy too angry to deny the convenient charge of modernism he sought the street personal appeal seemed futile to the young priest cast down by the will of a superior to escape from holy overheated apartments had been his one impulse facing a january blizzard his power to think consecutively returned while for a moment he faltered inclined to go back the icy air struck him full in the face as he staggered forward the only wayand one practically hopeless he choked appeal to the archbishop absorbed his mind as he pressed on weighing uncertain odds of ecclesiastical favor suddenly he realized that he had strayed from main thoroughfares was standing on a desolate bluff that rose significantly above colorless bottom lands and two frozen rivers wind sharpened to steel with miles of ceaseless shifting slashed his cheeks cut into his full temples his eyes he bowed before the gust so passionately charged with his own rebellion today he was a priest only in name for the first time since his assumption of orders he faced truth and a miserable pretense to catholic discipline desires half forgotten stood out duly exaggerated by recent disappointment an impulse sent him close to the precipitous ledge but he moved backward to give up life was not his wish he was defeated yet something held him as in a mirage of fallen hopes he saw a womans face and cried out he had done no wrong until the bishop cast him down he was confident able to justify esthetic joy in ritualistic service which took the place of a natural human tie now he knew that his work after all but expressed a womans exquisite charm for through plans and absorbing efforts in behalf of a splendid cathedral he had been fooled into thinking that he had conquered the disappointment of his earlier manhood the bishop had apparently smiled on a dazzling achievement and young father barry plunged zealously into a great undertaking to give his western city a noble structure for posterity became a ruling passion and in a few months his eloquence in the pulpit together with unremitting personal labor on plans and elevations had made the church a certainty thousands of dollars then hundreds of thousands fattened a building fund the bishop appeared to be pleased later he was astounded finally he grew jealous and eager to be rid of the priest who swayed with words and ruled where a venerable superior made slight impression consequently the charge of modernism fell like a bolt from a clear sky until today father barry had been absorbed in one idea his cathedral had taken the place of all that a young man might naturally desire when the woman he loved became free he still remained steadfast to his new ambition it seemed as if lost opportunity had attuned his idealistic nature to symbolic love which could express in visions and latent passion an actual renunciation that isabel doan understood and rejoiced in the mastery of his intellect gave him unconscious incentive in the place of impossible earthly love he had awakened a consistent dream without doubt mrs doans pure profile was a motif for classic results when he spoke to her of architectural plans showing drawings for a splendid nave and superb arches her keen appreciation always sent him forward with his work then like true inspiration visions came and went vista effects altars bright with golden treasures stirred him to constant endeavor he heard heavenly musicthe best his young rich city could procure day and night he worked and begged now all was over for the second time in life the man faced hopeless disappointment deprived of work removed from the large parish that for three years had hung on his every word and wish the priest stood adrift in the storm the ignominy of his downfall swept over him with every lash of an oncoming blizzard he seemed to feel the end the bishops untethered brogue still clashed in his sensitive ears the city he loved now ready for the best of everything no longer had a place for him he was cast out below him spread bottom lands dotted for miles with towering grain elevators packing plants and wholesale houses vitals of trade lay bare by vivisection as it were he traced the life of commerce felt gigantic heart beats of the lower town blending interests of two great states in all directions rival railroads made glistening lines through priceless bottoms father barry groaned progress seemed to taunt his acknowledged failure he turned his back but again he faced promise higher ledges and the upper town retold a story of established growth on every hand prosperity saluted him leading from bluffs the city reached eastward for miles as far as he could see domestic roof tops defined the course of streets houses crept to the edge of a retail district then jumped beyond on waiting acres of forest land splendid homes had arisen as if by magic through pangs of disappointment the priest made out the commanding site selected for his cathedral a blasted dream evoked passionate prophecy and the mirage of the church ordered and built by decrepit taste rose up before him the bishops unsightly work held him blinded by the storm abnormally keen to a cruel delusion he saw the end of his own laudable ambition to his imagination the odious brick box on the hillock seemed to be true a commonplace elevation with detached square towers was real with his brain maddened with hallucination harsh unmusical chimes began to sound above the blizzards roar again and again he heard the refrain too late too late the significance of a metallic summons almost stopped his breath yet fancy led him on to the open church he seemed to go within pressing forward against the crowd below a flaming altar stood the bishops bier in the open casket clad in robes of state the old man slept the sleep of death the brick monument to stubborn force echoed throughout with chanted requiem and whispered prayer incense clouded gorgeous vestments of officiating priests candles burned on every hand at the virgins shrine flowers lent fragrance to an impressive scene then he seemed to forget the great occasionthe bishop at last without power the kneeling praying throng longing for human love displaced all other feeling in the image of one woman he beheld another and isabel doan assumed the virgins niche     chapter ii   as the suspended priest went from the bluff the mirage of a few moments faded the bishop still lived  reaction and the determination to face an archbishop impelled him forward why should he submit to sentence without effort to save himself he drew the collar of his coat about his ears at last he was sensitive to physical discomfort air sharp as splintered glass cut through his lungs he bowed his head revolving in his mind the definite charge of modernism what had he really said in the pulpit like all impassioned extemporaneous speakers he could never quite recall his words when the occasion for their utterance had passed progress was undoubtedly his sinful theme yet until lately no heretical taint had been found in the young fathers sermons born a dreamer reared a catholic he attempted rigid selfexamination the task proved futile in italy he would have led catholic democrats in a great uprising despite the index he rejoiced in the books of forgazzar benedettos appeal to the pope to heal the four wounds of catholicism clung to his mind the great story touched him irresistibly sinful as it was he had committed benedettos bold accusations to memory il santo still drew him and he was angry and sore  he knew that in a moment of emotional uplift he had forgotten the danger of independent utterance the bonds of a catholic pulpit but today while he reverted to the sermon which had suspended him from the priesthood he could not repeat one offensive sentence clearly  the wind increased each moment a blizzard of three days duration might bring him time to think at the end of the storm every one would hear of his suspension the priest hurried on then he thought of his mother suddenly the dear soul had prior claim to mrs doan above bitterness the son recalled the date it was his thirtysecond birthday he told himself that nothing should keep him from the one who could best understand his predicament this dear sincere mother had counseled him before why not now the foolishness of troubling mrs doan was clear as he hastened on his way he began to wonder what his mother would really think of the bishops action would she accept her sons humiliation with serene unqualified spirit would her faith in a superiors judgment hold the suspended priest felt the terms for the true catholic he dreaded palliation of the bishops course but nohis mother could never do that in the case in question her boy must stand injured unjustly dealt with  father barry went on with definite intention his present wish was to spend a fatal birthday in the home of his boyhood fortunately it was monday father corrigan had charge of weekly services the younger mans absence would not be construed until after the blizzard it flashed through his mind that on the coming sunday he had hoped to make the address of his life now this last appeal in behalf of a great cathedral would never be uttered on his study desk were plans and detail drawings which must soon cumber a waste basket suddenly the young priest cast down humiliated turned from the tents of his people longed to cry out to hundreds who loved himwho believed in him but again his thoughts turned to his mother who would soon hold him in her loving arms cry with him beg him to be patient worthy of his bringing up then he knew that he was not a true catholic his binding vows all at once seemed pitiless to his thwarted ambition and human longing     chapter iii   when father barry reached the parsonage he found no use for a pass key pat murphy his faithful servant and acolyte was watching for him just within the door he drew the halffrozen priest across a small entry to a large warmed apartment answering today as both study and diningroom the rist of the house do be perishing the irishman explained the priest sank in front of a blazing coal fire tossing his gloves to the table he held his hands before the glow without comment they were wonderful hands denoting artistic temperament but with fingers too pliant too delicately slender for ascetic life philip barrys hands seemed formed for luxury and in accordance with their expression he had surrounded himself with both comfort and chaste beauty in the large low oldfashioned room in which he sat there was no false note pictures oriental rugs richly carved chairsall represented taste and expenditure somewhat prejudicial to a priests standing with his bishop that the greater part of everything in the little house had arrived as a gift from some admiring parishioner but added to the aged superiors disapproval of esthetic influence today father barry warmed his hands without the usual sense of comfortable homecoming pat murphy observed that for once his master showed no interest in a row of flower boxes piled on the table  will you not be undoing your birthday presents the irishman ventured the priest turned his back to the fire i must get warm i am frozen to the bone yet he moved forward one box held his eye like a magnet he knew instinctively that isabel doan had remembered his anniversary unmindful of all other offerings he broke the string and sank his face into a bed of ascension lilies he seemed to inhale a message his eyes felt wet pat murphy brought him back to earth the acolyte stood at his elbow may i not bring water for the posies he humbly begged father barry frowned untie the other flowers i will attend to these myself he surveyed the room at last reaching for an ample jar of dullgreen pottery the effect was marvelous like the woman who had sent them the lilies stood out with rare significance the priest glanced again into the empty box searching for the friendly note which never failed to come on his birthday as he supposed the envelope had slipped beneath a bed of green he broke the seal then read       my dear father barry how shall you like the settleddown age      of thirtytwo are we not both growing old and happy i am      thinking constantly of your splendid work and have sent with      the lilies a little check for the new cathedral i pray that      you will permit a poor heretic to share in your love for art      do as you think best with the moneyyet if some personal wish      of yours might stand as minea beautiful window perhapsi      should feel the joy of our joint endeavor       but remember the check is yours to burn in a furnace or to      pay out for stone you will know best what to do and in any      case the poor heretic may still hope for a bit of indulgence      from st peter meantime i am coming to hear you preach when      i tell you that i fear to have a young catholic on my hands      you will not be surprised that reginald teases each week to go      to father barrys pretty church he admires your vestments with      all his ardent little soul unfortunately at present my dear      boy has a miserable cold and a bad throat i am thinking of      taking him to southern california for the winter before our      departure i shall hope to see you       with kindest wishes for a happy birthday i am always your      friend       isabel chester doan  the note was dated two days back and the enclosed check stood for three thousand dollars father barry bowed his head again his eyes were wet when pat importuned him to come to luncheon he sat down with unconquerable emotion he could not endure the ordeal so pushed away his plate  if ye dont be tasting mate yell be fainting pat insisted the priest smiled miserably dont worryim only tired besides im going to my mother she will see that i need coddling pack my case i wish to start at once  the acolyte scanned the pile of boxes  the pink carnations i shall give to mother the other flowers you may carry to the hospital go as soon as possible the master commanded tell sister simplice to see that each patient has a posey the fruit i send to old mrs sharp explain that her confessor orders white grapes in place of a penance  and the lily flowersdo i be taking them to the hospital too  no the priest answered in no case meddle with the lilies he moved the jar to a position of honor on top of his desk these will remain fresh until i return do not touch them or let them freeze he leaned forward with caressing impulse then his eyes fell hard and sober on parchment rolls and detail drawings cherished plans for his cathedral plans now useless lay piled before him he closed his secretary  if any one callssay that i am from homeon business i must not be pursued  murphy grinned im on to the thrick and its not a day for resaving visitors a prolonged gust made his words plausible father barry tried to smile  you are a good fellow pat should i never come backconfess to father corrigan the priests mood was difficult as the irishman watched his adored master charge into the blizzard he frowned perplexedly he do run like lot afeared of soddom he exclaimed but its sick he isnadin rist at his mothers warkin day and night on his cathedral has all but laid him low pat poked the fire mike up at the bishops do be sayin nasty things and sure tis nothin but foolishness surmisin how the old bishop do be atin out his heart on account of a young prastes handsome face and takin ways mike be cursed for a jesute startin scandal from a kayhole he picked up the coal hod i must kape his lily posies as he bid me he pressed close to a frosted window through a clear spot in the glass he could see his master breasting the storm hes all but off his feet he muttered  murphy was father barrys own delightful discovery months back the priest had engaged the raw irish boy for household service then later promoted him to a post of honor about the altar to faithful pat there was little more to ask for outside of heaven reports which he sent home to ireland were set down on paper by mike who served in the upper household pats scribe published his friends felicity broadcast until at length even the bishop was fully informed of a popular young priests affairs without thought of injury to one whom he adored pat extolled the plans for the great cathedral which possibly might eclipse st peters at rome again and again the boy dwelt on father barrys popularity today as the acolyte looked through the frostglazed window scratching wider range with his thumb nail he had no doubt of his masters chance to become a prelate soon the old one would pass beyond he crossed himself devoutly peering hard at the tall retreating form now almost within reach of the corner an electric line but half a block away was father barrys goal as pat looked a gust sent the pedestrian onward with a plunge as usual the master carried his own suit case murphy muttered disapproval at the crossing the priest stopped to regain his breath his sole wish was to catch a car owing to the blizzard traffic might suspend but in the windcharged air he thankfully detected a distant hum the trolleys yet ran how fortunate and now very soon he would be with his motherpractically lost to a stormbound community how sweet the shelter waiting soon he might unburden his heartpour out his trouble before the only woman in the world who would really understand it then again he remembered isabel doanher check the letter hiding against his breast after all should he not restore the generous gift at once now that the original cathedral could not be built was it not a matter of personal honor to explain altered conditions cancelled both his own and his friends obligation mrs doan must take back her check that the bishop was powerless to claim the donation filled the priest with vindictive joy gradually duty to his mother ceased to govern him beyond everything else he wanted to see isabel doan he told himself that he had a right to do so honeyed sophistry provided motive for his desire he stood as it were at a point defined by opposing ways double tracks glistened before him one leading eight blocks distant to the lintel of his mothers door the other stretching in the opposite direction across the cityalmost to a certain stone mansion the priest was not in a mood of valiant resistance again he longed for isabel doans sympathy yet as he tarried at the crossing waiting still undecided which line to choose he could not dismiss the thought of his mother even now watching for her son he could fancy the dear lady sitting by the window expectant disappointed when no car stopped her sweet flushed face the adorable white hair parted and waved on each side of a forehead gently lined by time made a picture which he could not easily dismiss this mother was his ideal of age she seemed as rare as beautiful as an exquisite prayerrug grown soft and precious with mellow suns and golden years many times he had contrasted her with overdressed elderly women of his parish he had never wished her to be different in any respect  he would go to her now she would tell him what to do and after dinner when the dear lady was thinking of early bedtime he might slip away with isabel doans check he must return it in person he shifted from one foot to the other and beat his arms across his breast the charge of the blizzard was paralyzing down the way a car was cominga red one he was sure of itglad of it his mother would be waiting for him for the time he forgot a parallel track and that other destination directly west suddenly like songs of sirens he heard the buzz of opposing trolleys two cars would meet before his eyes but the red one still led yet how strange it had just stopped the yellow opponent came on the priest breathed hard fate seemed to be thrashing his will with the storm again the red car moved and the yellow one halted chance was playing a game he leaned expectant from the curb something had gone wrong for once more the red line had lost the trolley then an instant later a yellow car stood on the crossing father barry sprang over the tracks veered around to an open side jumped aboard     chapter iv   once within the eastbound car the suspended priest found valid excuse for what he had done even now he need not disappoint his mother as soon as he reached the house of mrs doan he could telephone the dear soul explain that urgent business detained him by dusk he would be free ready to pour out his heart to the best woman in the world in case the increasing storm should interfere with the cars there was always a hansom cab at a nearby stable his forethought pleased him and again he told himself that the present course of action was justified  to return mrs doans generous checksimply as he might return it to any friend who trusted himwas sufficient motive for either priest or man he settled comfortably in an empty seat then felt in the breast of his inside coat for isabels letter the straightforward wording appealed to him even more than at first how like this woman to put aside prudery how like her to wish to bestow through art a gift denied by love and she was soon going awayto far californiawith the little son whom she fairly adored there was no place in her pure affection for any man the boy seemed to be all that she asked for he frowned putting away the note for several moments he blankly gazed through the window with the certainty of his undoing he again blamed the bishop for all that was sinful to the soul of a priest he felt that he had lost his religion forever beads of perspiration stood on his forehead he was bitter bitter an hour before he had believed that he could find courage and intellectual ability to lay his case before an archbishop but now all was changed he no longer desired to remain a priest exalted sentiments were not to his credit when lip service made them detestable he felt no terror at the thought of excommunication as soon as he was man enough to tell the truth he might be free still with a last desperate confession could he ever rise from ignominy where should he find refuge perhaps in his knowledge of architecture and he might write books the elastic hope of an artistic temperament lured him until suddenly he once more remembered his mother how could he slay this trustful simple soul as the car sped across the city his mind turned to his childhood his boyhood his early manhood  ever since he could remember he had been everything to his dear mother when he was but a baby a scourge of cholera had taken away his father several years later a beautiful sister died and finally a grown brother then philip had become the widows sole companion the irish lady of gentle blood alone in a strange landfortunately a kind onethought only of her little son soon the lad swung a censer before the church altar while shortly his mother was termed wealthy by reason of wise investments and increasing values philip enjoyed judicious indulgence the devout catholic lived but for her son and her religion early in life she taught the boy to accept without question the authority of his church for a lad of poetic emotional temperament the duty of service fraught with certain reward seemed easy philip loved everything connected with his own little part in the chancel the impressive latin chanted by priests clad in gorgeous robes fired his imagination made him long to understand to become versed in a mysterious tongue high mass had always been dramatic something to enjoy exalted above play and mere physical exercise voices floating from the choir sounded like angels the boy adored the high soprano and enshrined her in his imagination with the goldcrowned virgin st joseph did not interest him but he spent much time admiring the yellow curls of mary young girls with bright hair stole his heart he associated all beautiful women with the virgin his little sweethearts invariably ruled him with shining tossing curls of gold  then at last the lad gave up attendance at the altar laid aside his lacetrimmed cotta to depart for college during four successful years the watchful mother felt no change in her sons religious nature but the shock came when he returned from an extended trip abroad she saw at once that something had influenced him to question the authority of his church the visit to rome had not strengthened philips faith he had become indifferent about confession often he was critical of officiating priests then one day the mother understood the full measure of her sons backsliding all at once he poured out his hearttold defiantly of his love for a girl not a catholic the poor lady knew the worst knew that philip had been with isabel chester in italy however the mothers terror and anxiety were both of short duration miss chesters family interfered almost at once and soon the young woman who had threatened the soul of philip barry became the wife of another man  as time went by the zealous faith of the widow was rewarded for one day philip expressed the wish to retire to a monastery the decision brought happy tears to the deluded mothers eyes her boys emotional nature did not disturb her own simple faith philip was saved but she asked for more and more came when her son was duly consecrated to the catholic priesthood the event stood out as the greatest day in her life  the young mans later career his brilliancy his popularity even his dream of the cathedral were all as nothing to the real cause of his mothers joy in all the womans years she had never doubted a syllable of her faith to give her son wholly to her church was a privilege so sweet that to lose it at last might take away her life again everything flashed through the mind of the priest verging on apostacy he bowed his head could he go through with his awful partforget his mother from the car window he saw tall naked elms a block away a corner near the home of mrs doan was almost reached behind denuded trees stood the stone house of the woman he wished to see questions scarcely faced were left unanswered as he jumped from the car a rushing gust almost knocked him down but he righted himself and pressed forward piercing air cut into his lungs the blizzard with all its sharp mad frenzy had arrived above the sky clear electrical was a sounding dome for oncoming blasts wings of wind beat him onward he fought his way with labored breath naked elms chastised by the gale motioned him and plunging he reached the vestibule to mrs doans tightly closed door     chapter v   the door opened on a city official you cant come in weve got a case of diphtheria he exclaimed im ready to placard the house  father barry pushed forward i go in at my own riskdo not try to stop me these people are my friends they are in troublei must see them  he passed by the officer into a wide hall maggie murphy pats cousin and reginald doans devoted nurse met him with swollen streaming eyes good father she sobbed will you not say prayers for our darlin hes that sick tis all but sure we must give him up in her excitement the girl spoke with native brogue  be quiet the priest implored this is no time for tears you must keep yourself in hand remember the boys mother and do your part in a tranquil way  maggie made the sign of the cross then led her confessor to the library where mrs grace a carefully preserved woman of middle age greeted him with outstretched hands isabel doans aunt had been weeping too but judiciously when she perceived father barry a desire to appear her best effaced lines of grief  dear dear father she faltered how very good of you to come how did you know she pressed an exquisite roman crucifix to her lips for unlike her niece mrs grace was a catholic  i heard only when i reached the door the priest admitted  a short time ago we thought our darling would die but now there is the slightest hope that we may keep him his mother is wild with suspense the lady wiped her eyes we can do absolutely nothing with isabel she refuses to leave reggies room even for a moment i am sure she has not closed her eyes since yesterday  the doctor must send her to bed at once said the priest  both he and the nurse have tried to do so but she will not go i believe she would die if reggie should be taken o dear father will you not say prayers  mrs grace sank to her knees wrapt and expectant maggie murphy flopped audibly in the hall while for philip barry the moment was fraught with indecision he seemed to think in flashes he wanted to cry out to publish himself to deny the very garb he wore then the next instant he longed to entreat for the life of isabel doans boy the sweeter side of his profession held him after all what difference did it make if he might give comfort to women in distress the prayers of notorious sinners had been answered on the spot why should not he the vilest of hypocrites yet honest for the time ask for the life of a dying boy he felt for his priests prayerbook fortunately he had not changed his coat since his rude awakening the little book he always carried was still in his breast pocket fairly touching mrs doans letter and enclosed check he found the place and began his knees trembled but his voice came strong and clear a last opportunity had nothing to do with what might follow this one moment was between god and his own conscience tenderness thrilled throughout him as he went on with familiar prayers in the hall maggie murphys sobs made passionate refrain for his importunate pleading then instinctively he felt the presence of isabel knew that she stood behind him he rose from the floor and faced her she answered his unspoken question with a smile he is better the doctor thinks the antitoxin has saved him in all his life philip barry had never seen such joy on a womans face  mrs grace sprang from her knees is reggie really better really better she repeated her intensity jarred  isabel smiled we think so she answered of course the doctor cannot tell just yet complications might occur but he hopes again her face was radiant  mrs grace crossed herself  the membrane in the throat is quite broken mrs doan went on the antitoxin worked wonderfully now we can only wait  and you should take needed rest the priest put in impulsively he seemed to have the right to dictate to this woman in trouble for as he stood by isabels side he began to realize how absolutely over were the once serious relations of their lives the two might be friendsnothing else mrs doan had no thought for a priest other than exalted friendship an accepted lack in her married life made it natural for her to bestow exquisite love on her child that which she had not been able to give her husband she now dispensed to his son the boy filled her heart you will take needed rest father barry again entreated when mrs grace frank and always tactless bemoaned the wan appearance of her niece  do go to bed isabel make up your lost sleep the lady urged you are a ghost i never saw you looking worse those dark circles below your eyes make you ten years older  the older womans crudeness stood out in marked contrast with her careful toilet anxiety had not deprived mrs grace of either rest or studied accessories  isabel shook her head i could not sleep she answered when the assistant nurse arrives i shall have less responsibility but until then i must stay with reggie my darlings eyes are always hunting for me you know i wear a masque the doctor insists upon it and when i cross the room my dear little boy cannot feel quite sure about his mother but now i have braided my hair and tied the ends with blue ribbon the nurse is just my height and we both wear white she glanced down at her summer frock brought from the attic for sudden duty reggie will know me by my colors  her pure garb together with ropes of golden hair falling down from a part made saintly ensemble once beforein romethe priest had seen her as she looked today then too dark circles deepened the violet of her wonderful eyes as now she had felt miserable in doubt the man who denied a selfish part in an unforeseen moment was suddenly conscious of his deadly sin but now he prayed asking for strength divorced from pretense and at last he believed that his main thought was a desire to help an afflicted household a wish to support friends in time of need he told himself that he might give reginald doan personal care simply as he had done before for other children less precious less beautiful for apart from the mother father barry loved her boy     chapter vi   throughout night the blizzard raged traffic was suspended no one ventured into the streets on foot the assistant nurse did not arrive and with quickened pulse but masterful will philip barry assumed her place in the sick childs chamber isabel had been persuaded to retire at midnight the terrific force of the storm brought her below to the library she could not sleep but sat in a chair by the fire somewhat comforted oak logs made grateful glow for the mother scarce able to resist the temptation to fly to her boy but she had promised to keep away in case she was needed she would be sent for  in her restless state she could not endure to be alone and rang for maggie the faithful girl reported at once while together the two made ready a tray for reginalds night watchers longing for action isabel prepared hot chocolate with her own hands a cold bird rolls and jelly completed a tempting repast the maid carried up the little supper her mistress waiting anxiously until she came back radiant with good news  hes better mamthe darlins much better maggie crossed herself father barry beats the doctor nurse says reggie minds him wonderful not even fretting for you now do be going back to a warm bed  isabel shook her head i would rather stay here she answered the wind sounds so loud from my room put on a log i shall toast sleep in my chair  if you dont mind ill stay with you the girl implored  that will not be necessary you had better go tomorrow you may be needed  maggie moved reluctantly from the room as mrs doan dropped into the depths of her chair the fire sent out a soft protecting glow touching her face with hope in flowing robe with unbound braids she seemed like a madonna dreaming of her child soon she slept wind plunging against the windows shrieking disappointment wasting its demons force in plaintive wail no longer disturbed her hours passed while she rested something she did not try to explain had happened the burden of doubt of crushing responsibility seemed to be lifted her aunts incompetence the excited maids praying about were forgotten help had come from an unexpected source and stranger than anything else she had been willing to accept it  and father barry caring for the sick child felt corresponding peace he was once more a priest in active service it seemed right natural that he should assume his present place in all his life he had never felt so strong so uplifted bitter feelings of the day were gone dismissed under incessant pressure and critical conditions to save the boy was his only thought he rejoiced in service more than ever before seemed to feel the worth of humility it came over him that to accept his suspension to respect the will of his superior and go into temporary seclusion might after all be best he thought of days in a monastery almost with longing once before he had sought shelter with good men who knew how to obey in his first boyish sorrow quiet had brought him relief in routine even in mild hardship he had believed that he had discovered a world outside of self he now hoped that a period of selfexamination with solitude would set him right fit him for the priests part he had chosen then reginald doan held out his tiny hands imploring help the man took him in his arms and held him and the little one found comfort for an hour father barry listened to the boys breathing with renewed hope when the nurse came the child was sleeping she smiled but ordered her patient beneath the covers of the bed  if you do not mind please see about the furnace williams may have dropped off we must take no chance on a night like this the slightest change in temperature would ruin all we have done she bent over the boy in watchful silence while the priest went out at the top of the staircase he took off his shoes he held one in each hand treading softly to the hall below the house gave forth the intense quiet of night but between the library curtains a stream of light lured him onward it was his part to guard the house from accident and he ventured into the room then stopped powerless to retreat isabel doan slept in her chair her rare face touched with ineffable peace shone in profile against dark cushions she seemed a modeled relief gentle breathing moved no fold of her loosely gathered robe not even her unbound hair stirred ever so lightly oblivion claimed the mother half ill from exhaustion close to the hearth a pair of tiny slippers rested motionless the priest tarried sinning within his heart it was but a momentyet long enough suddenly he knew that everything was changed isabel was no longer for him nor he for her their divergent lives could never come together he shrank from the room not looking back to escape without disturbing the sleeper impelled him into the very cellar then he sank to the floorto his knees for the second time since entering the house he prayed as a priest deliverance from self was the burden of his cry in his deplorable state he seemed adrift in the dark he might be neither man nor priest there was now no place for him in the world he had tried to forsake nor could he longer fulfill the false part in his mistaken calling an opening door restored his composure for despite his emotional nature philip barry knew well the cooler demand of time and place he spoke to the man in charge of the furnace then examined the gauge not a fraction of a degree must be overlooked he ordered peremptorily  and the boy said the man  better everything from now on depends on ourselves i came below to satisfy the nurse she cautioned me to say that the slightest change in temperature would be fatal to her little patient  as the priest spoke he turned about again he put away everything but the one object which detained him in mrs doans house to nurse her boy through a terrible night then to go outforeverfrom temptation he could not meet was his only thought     chapter vii   night wore on by morning the passion of the storm was abated the blizzard had not lifted but waves of wind burst less frequently on a world now white with frozen snow  early in the day the doctor arrived with the belated nurse the priest was virtually discharged from duty he would have gone away at once but for reginald who held tightly to his hand the sick boy was sweetly despotic in his little kingdom a childs appealing trust his angelic weakness claimed all that father barry could give reggiewont havenudder nurse he protested the young woman who had just arrived moved into the background while the boys mother sank to his side isabels face shone with joy the gladness of the moment half stopped her voice but she took her darlings tiny hand reginalds fingers clung to her own then with a satisfied smile he reached out eagerly to the priest hold nudder hand he implored to refuse was not to be thought of father barry knelt once more but now like a jewel in a clasp the precious body of the boy joined him to isabel on opposite sides of the bed both man and woman felt instant thrill of a despotic measure the sick childs eyes sought eagerly for his new nurse you can go home he announced take your trunk he coolly added he sighed contentedly looking first at his mother then at his friend the french clock on the dresser ticked moments the boy seemed to be asleep he was only planning fresh despotism mudder dear and fadder barry will make reggie well he summed up conclusively some dayim doin to buy fadder barry a wottomobilea nice butifulgreat big one  thank you said the priest the child spoke easily his improvement seemed marvelous  dear reggie must not talk be quiet darling isabel entreated mother dear and father barry will both stay with you but you must close your eyes and go to sleep unconscious of the priests emotion the mother had promised much the boy drooped his lids squeezing them hard below purple eyes dark lashes swept his cheeks then raised like curtains as he peeped on either hand isabel was faint with joy  darling she pleaded go to sleep  i cant keep shut the little fellow whimpered his head turned on the pillow i want fadder barry to put on his fine cape and his nice suit he begged suddenly recalling the priests vestments and i want to hear the little bell he persisted  yes dear reggie father barry answered when you are well you may come to churchmay hear the beautiful musicsee the little boys about the altar but now you must mind the doctor dont you remember just a little time ago you told him that you would be a good boy and do everything father barry wished if you talk your throat will get bad again you dont want it to hurt  sympathy wrought on the boys imaginative temperament he enjoyed his own little part i felt so bad he wailed he had naturally a broad accent despite his middle west locality his voice deep and full for so young a child inclined to unflattened vowels  i felt so bad he repeated in view of more attention  but now you will soon be well his mother quieted just think how good you should be when you are going to california  the promise in question acted like magic  tell reggie about the big ningen he coaxed  if you close your eyes isabel agreed the boys lashes shut down soon mother dear and reggie are going far away on a long train she began every morning the engineer will give his big engine a hot breakfasta great deal of coal and all the water it can drink the long long train will run ever so fast away out across the plains over the high mountains to california at first jack frost may try to catch the train but the engineer must run the faster then soon jack frost will go howling back east  i want fadder barry to come too the boy put in  if you talk i shall not go on his mother cautioned reggie may eat his breakfast and dinner and supper on the train at night he will sleep in a funny little bed maggie must watch that her boy doesnt roll on to the floor after a long time the train will stop mother and reggie and maggie will get out and  fadder barry too the boy persisted he did not open his eyes while tremulous lashes expressed his joy in the story  when reggie gets to california he wont have to wear mittens or carry his muff or put on his fur coat the mother continued regardless of comment it will be bright and warm so warm that reggie may play out of doors all day long there will be gardens filled with flowers mothers little boy may pick her a beautiful bouquet every morning  and fadder barry tooand maggieand the sick boy was reluctantly dropping to sleep the rhythm of his mothers voice and a satisfying story had worked a charm  in california the trees are full of birds that sing just like dickey only poor dickey has to live in his cage in california the birds are free to fly sometimes they fly over the great mountains sometimes down to the deep big ocean the boys dark lashes had ceased to quiver all day long yellow bees and bright butterflies play hide and seek among the flowers at night they all go to bed inside of roses tucked between pink and white blankets just like little boys and girls they sleepand sleepand sleepjust like reggie  the priest and isabel looked into each others eyes for a moment they held the tiny fingers of the boy then very gently each released a hand and moved from the bedside  the nurse came forward smiling you might both better go she commanded without comment the boys mother led the way in the hall below pat murphy stood in earnest conversation with his cousin maggie the girl looked frightened father barry approached without hesitation what is the matter he asked  the irishman waited confused i do be sint by sister simplice your motherthe old ladyshe have just gone he crossed himself  tell me again the priest commanded what do you mean  your motherdo be dead pat faltered     chapter viii   she has been gone an hour said sister simplice  father barry followed the nun half dazed to the upper hall for as yet he could not grasp the force of his own miserable late arrival outside the closed door of his mothers room he waited  tell me all he implored i must know the worstbefore i see her tell me everything what she said at the very last his voice broke into sobs as he dropped to a couch  sister simplice drifted to his side her words were low and calm only her delicate profile with slightly quivering nostrils expressed agitation she looked straight beyond not at the closed door like one rehearsing a part she began to speak father barrys head sank forward into his hands the nuns story fell gently mercifully softened as she went on the priest raised his eyes sister simplice dreaded the question burning on his lips  and she did not believe that i had neglected herforgotten to come to her on my birthday  she thought no ill of her son the nun answered when i came last night the danger of her first sudden attack seemed to be over she had rallied was perfectly conscious he will come in the morning when the storm is over she told us at midnight yes i said he will surely come day will bring him safe from his hiding place  father barry bowed his head  you remember that you telephoned in the early afternoon the storm had already interfered with service she could not catch your words felt only that you were detained upon some errand of mercy when pat murphy brought the flowers to the hospital he said nothing whatever of your movements this morning he happened to come with your mail just after the dear one passed away i sent him out to find you the priest wept softly we had no thought of the end when it came the nun went on so quickly so peacefully she left us she seemed to be much better with the dawn for the storm that kept you from her side had abated she was expecting you every moment she had no thought of death sister simplice crossed herself faithful nora had brought a cup of nourishment we were about to offer it when brightening like her old self she begged for a fresh shawl  i understand the priest faltered she wished to look neat and charming and it was all for me he burst out she wanted me to find her as usuallike her pretty self  yes the nun answered she asked for a shawl you admiredthe one with a touch of lavender nora brought a white cape from the closet but she motioned it away i wish my fine new shawl the one my son likes best she pleaded we were gone from the bedside but a moment both searching in the closet your dear mother was unconscious almost gone when we returned  sister simplice crossed herself again the priest could not speak stillness followed the nuns story only the ticking of a clock disturbed his pent thoughts suddenly the man burst forth as a boy  i should have come to her sooner he confessed i knew that she had not been well the week before but i thought her slight attack was from the stomach how could i dream of this she assured me that she felt like herself and the morning of my birthdayhe hesitatedthe morning of my birthday i was compelled to go to the bishop  yes the nun interruptedshe understoodknew how you were working for the cathedral her pride in your success was beautiful she asked for no hour which justly belonged to the service of your church  thank god she never knewdied believing in methought i had succeeded the priest cried passionately the nun lifted her crucifix  the blessed saints ordained that she should think nothing but good of her sonher priesther one earthly idol sister simplice clasped her hands have no fear for her soul a soulsuch as hersmust rise freed from transient torment soon she will follow from afarfollow her sons great earthly work father barry groaned  you do not understand do not know that i am almost glad that my mother has gonepassed safely beyond she was a good catholic if she had lived he rose to his feet and stood before the trembling sisterif she had lived to know the truth she might have rebelled have doubted  the sister flushed then turned pale nun that she was she had heard gossip the bishop has not put you aside she faltered she raised her crucifix he hasnt interfered with your workwith the building of the cathedral  the priest signified the worst my labor has been in vain he acknowledged i am ordered from the parish like an incompetent i thank god that she never knew  sister simplice shrank as from a blow the suspended priest saw by the motion of her lips that she was praying her slender fingers clung fiercely to the rosary she seemed to dread her own words she could not trust her voice dared not lift her face tears were slipping from beneath the delicate eyelids  forgive me cried her confessor i dare not tamper with your faith forget that you have been listening i implore you  the nun raised the dark fringes which had seemed a rebuke but before she spoke father barry was gone vanishing behind the closed door of his mothers death chamber     chapter ix   sister simplice told her beads in vain strange new rebellion threatened her accepted life like the young priest in the room beyond she doubted her right to wear the authorized habit of roman catholic faith tears scalded her cheeks she could not keep them back yet to weep over an earthly tie long cut away must be counted a sin against her soul the rosary slid from her grasp then she caught it passionately to her lips she had shed no tears for three whole years until today sister simplice had thought a victory won hospital work had seemed to bring relief to the woman unfitted for spiritual monotony in the convent she had been misjudged it was not until the mother superior comprehended the case and removed her unhappy charge to an active field that things went well nursing the sick the sister seemed to renounce the bridal veil which she had nearly worn she regained courage found joy in her patients actual service took unrest from her mind and heart gradually a romance interfering with devout prayers was put down the nun went her way untouched by criticism and it was doubtless intangible sympathy which had first made confidences easy between the sister and the priest their mutual struggle removed them from the spiritual line when both tacitly owned that human longing abides in spite of prayer but with the project of the cathedral absorbing the man the gentle nun forgave her confessor and implored passionately for new strength for herself in father barry the church had gained a splendid champion hospital work was a less brilliant opportunity but at last sister simplice looked forward to passing years of peace until today she had been happy even yet she hardly understood the change which threatened her usefulness she did not acknowledge that she had backslidden hysterical longing filled her womans heart she could not would not analyze it if she sinned she sinned it seemed good to cry in view of impending penance  the clock ticked away a full quarter while she sat in the hall alone with her thoughts then the door to the closed chamber opened and father barry passed out he was pale shaken instantly the nun became herself again she longed for service will you not come below and eat something she asked the priest shook his head  not yet he went on but on second thought turned tell nora she must not offer me a hearty luncheoni cannot eat it she may bring toast and tea to my room i must rest be alone  the nuns dismissal was plain the sister went softly downstairs hurt that she might not carry her confessors tray  father barry watched her glide beyond the landing then walked quickly to his boyhood chamber here his mother had changed nothing to retire at times to the little room was always like a snatched interview with himself as a rule the dear lady had begged her son to use the more stately guest chamber but today he shrank from the state apartment as one grown noted yet now waiting for ignominy to see his mother cold and lifeless had settled the halfconsidered step of the previous morning for at last the man believed that he must give up the priesthood he no longer wished to propitiate an archbishop with his mothers death he was free had she lived he might have gone on a hypocrite now all was changed he need not continue a false life fortunately he was rich in his mothers right he would not stay in the place which ought to despise him and he might live in any part of the known world at all events he would emulate an honest citizen he cast himself across the white counterpane of the bed and buried his face in the pillow his neat careful mother would never know that he had neglected to turn back the snowy spread outside the dying blizzard moaned fitfully now and then a long full gust came reinforced from distant plains but the fury of the storm was over he began to think of pressing matters it was tuesday on friday his precious mother must be buried he sobbed aloud would the bishop stay official disgrace until after the funeral suddenly his only dread was public dishonor to his dead as his mothers boy he wept long and passionately noras knock subdued outward emotion while he took the tray from her hands he saw that the faithful soul wanted to stop in the room longed to fuss over her young master but he gave no invitation and she went off grumbling at the door she turned its dyin youll be yourself ating no mateonly a bite of tasteless toast and the bishop that old the parting shot brought no response nora closed the door with offended spirit hell go under with all the bother of his cathedral she muttered to live long enough to see her young priest a bishop was the old womans earthly dream she touched a crucifix in full view of the closed chamber where her mistress lay cold and still then she hastened below to clean and garnish sister simplice had promised to stay until all was over and she had also sent for sister agnes sister agnes was cold and severe the servant saw no need of two nuns she went about the scrubbing and dusting glad that she might work without regard to arriving cards or visitors the good soul had prayed then wept until she could hardly see now at last she was busy again absorbed in material matters  meantime father barry forced down toast and tea details of his mothers funeral thronged his mind she must have everything beautiful all that a son could give her last mass should be splendid and again he wondered about the bishop would he officiate in spite of all the widows money would doubtless be remembered at a time like the present father barry felt for a little blank book and drew from his breast pocket mrs doans note and the enclosed check once more accident controlled his movements everything rushed back even in the midst of plans for his mothers mass he thought of the letter he would write to isabel she must know the truth why had he not told her was he yet unable to confess himself a hypocrite to this woman whom he had once hoped to marry after all he could return her check by mail for in writing he might explain an altered situation without demanding sympathy but if sympathy came if isabel understood the case as it really was then she should help him to start over again to go on with his life  he worked himself into an exalted attitude for the first time since the eventful interview with the bishop his selfesteem suggested a part removed from abject failure as upon the ledge of the stormbeaten bluff he felt once more a womans governing presence but the firm commanding knock of sister agnes brought him from clouds to sinking sands again he was miserablea false priest facing an austere nun who would shrink away in horror as soon as she heard of his shame the sister supplanting gentle simplice held out a letter closed with the bishops seal without waiting to read the suspended priest knew the import of his superiors forced retraction official action was rescinded until after his mothers funeral     chapter x   reginald doan was out of danger infant tyranny and convalescence had both begun over cleanswept plains the blizzard of three days duration moaned its last sharp protest the sun blinked out through yellow grit on a city lashed white and ghostly isabel ran to her boy with the first peep of day the little fellow still slept and she returned to a warm bed the clock on her dressing table struck eight before she was summoned to the sickroom the nurse opened the door smiling he has been wishing for you a night has done even more than the doctor expected  has he been quiet  most of the time but just before you came he was a wee bit naughty now hes going to be the best boy in the world  reginald stretched out his hands i wanted mother dear he sweetly confessed i cried just one minute  but you must not cry at all isabel told him if you cry you may not get well enough to start for california  the topic of travel was absorbing and soothing reginald lay quiet while his mother romanced of trains and engines and long dark tunnels genius for operating railroads had brought the boys father to the top with several millions the son would doubtless make good in the same way  today reginald clasped a toy locomotive in his baby hand interest in play was returning my ningins all weddy for california he exulted tomorrow im doing to div you a ticket  how kind said his mother  and im doing to div fadder barry a ticket too isabel made no reply i want fadder barry to come backi want him so bad the boy petitioned his accent seemed unduly broadened for the occasion long a fell like a wail  dont be naughty isabel pleaded father barry cannot possibly come her voice broke but she went on listen and i will tell you why you must not ask for him he has gone hometo his mother dear last night father barrys mother dear wished him to come to her but he did not understandhe stayed with reggie now reggie is getting well she rested a hand against her cheek to hide falling tears but i want fadder barry so bad the child protested his baby face took on the resolute charm his mother dreaded i do want fadder barry he persisted then with autocratic movement he called the nurse his countenance shone with expedient thought teletone he whispered teletone to fadder barry tell him to come back and bring his trunk the attendant left the room while the boy lay still and confident his purple eyes shone so darkly in their wonderful sockets that the mother doubted the wisdom of an evident ruse she waited anxiously until the nurse reappeared  did you teletone the boy asked  i tried to the woman answered but you see the wind has broken the wires the poor telephone has a sore throatjust like reggie it cannot speak  must the doctor make it well the childs sympathies were thoroughly aroused for the first time the new nurse achieved a victory and the illness of the telephone grew more alarming each moment  the boys mother went down to her breakfast both hungry and happy reginald was in judicious hands on a folded napkin was a letter stamped for quick delivery isabel tore open the envelope and saw her returned check with sharpened senses she began to read when at last she understood she was crying how unjust how unjust to his ambition to his struggle for accomplishment she choked she tossed the check aside and reread father barrys letter his unhappiness was her own her one thought was to help him to brace him against disappointment this brilliant manthis friendmust not be ruined there was some mistake those above him the people who adored their priest would see that he had fair treatment submission to a creed had not been part of isabels bringing up born and reared in an unorthodox atmosphere she had never been able to quite understand the power of philips church it was in fact this very attitude which had first made trouble between them the two had parted at rome both miserably conscious of their sacrifice yet each blaming the other afterward when the man became a priest successful eloquent exerting splendid influence appealing to people of all classes with his project for a cathedral that should mark an architectural epoch for the middle west the woman whom he had wished to marrynow residing in the same cityrejoiced that he had found a larger scope in life when she suddenly became a widow she held it a pleasure to follow up the desirable friendship which was now strictly outside of sentiment father barrys vestments covered the past the two met without embarrassment the priest was full of his cathedral the young mother absorbed in her little son then when mrs gracea catholicconfirmed at mature age and consequently overzealous arrived to live with her niece father barry came more frequently to the stone house behind the elms soon he was the acknowledged friend of the family realizing that mrs doans interest in his new church was almost pagan he still drew strange inspiration from her clear perception and balanced criticism without fear both man and woman accepted the cathedral as a bond which might prove to be more suitable than love isabels actions were never confused with a flirtation thus far she had escaped censorious tongues for mrs doan was a personage in the western city and universally admired but if she had escaped criticism her aunt stood for a full share of it the niece often despaired of her chaperone regretting that she had selected one devoid of the finer feelings however she tried to make the best of an uncongenial arrangement which had resulted from blood relationship and mrs gracea widow twice and vaguely considering a third venturewas not altogether responsible for a light head and superficial education she was generally adjudged amusing  today isabel was keenly sensible of great trouble the priests impending downfall his heroic part in reginalds recovery the sudden death of his mother were all sufficient reasons for her own straightforward determination she would go to himgo to him at oncewith no false shrinking perhaps even yet she might save himinduce him to appeal beyond his bishop the weakness evinced in his letter his wish to give up to drift into obscurityfilled her with courage which she did not really understand yes she must see him talk with him under his dead mothers roofpersuade him to hope then she remembered that she was a prisoner in her own home forbidden to leave it     chapter xi   mrs grace stood dressed for the evening she wore a rich black gown fitly relieved by transparent fillings a splendid rosary of pearls and carnelians clung around her throat while rare lace falling from the elbow drew attention to her plump arms and small white hands despite the womans fortyseven years she was youthful in appearance tonight she glanced into a fulllength mirror satisfied as if loath to part from her reflection she examined each detail of her elegant toilet  you are stunning said isabel knocking lightly on the open door for myself i thought it unnecessary to change my linen frock as she spoke she threw back a coat of sable i thought i might go as i am for i shall not enter the house you have not been with reginald so of course there is not the slightest reason for not going in at a time like this you can give father barry my lilies and ask him to see me for a few moments outside  simplicity becomes you mrs grace acknowledged you really look well without the slightest effort i have always been improved by good clothes even when i was a girl i shone in the latest styles i do love uptodate gowns she ran a comb through her fluffy pompadour which should have been silver but was counterfeit gold  good gracious isabel how your color has come back she enviously exclaimed when reginald first took sick you were ghostly now i believe you are fresher than ever i cant understand you being shut away from everything has actually done you good  mrs doan perceived the drift of her aunts compliment you are certainly stunning in your new gown she answered and you know i wish to get back to reggie as soon as possible will you not come  the older woman moved slowly from the mirror about the flowers isabel went on only mine were sentthe lilies the wreath you ordered will not be finished until tomorrow in time for service at the church grimes wrote me explaining that the piece was so large that it could not be delivered sooner  mrs grace accepted a disappointment tomorrow will answer i wish the wreath to be perfect she followed her niece downstairs and outside to the waiting carriage it was still cold but the blizzard was dead in a shroud of stars mrs grace settled expansively while isabel protected her lilies as best she could  it is after all fortunate that my wreath was not sent the aunt affirmed we never could have taken it inside and thomas might have objected to minding it on the box when i asked you to telephone about it i did not realize how crammed a coupe is the piece will be wonderful in the churchpink carnations orchids and maidenhair ferns i am sure it will be the biggest thing of the kind grimes has ever sent out i preferred a cross but so many were already ordered that i decided to have a wreath i do hope father barry will like the colorpink suits his dear mother much better than white dont you think so  mrs grace judged grief by circumference and perpendicular measurement it seemed as fitting to send her priest a wreath as large as a wagon wheel as it had been incumbent to wear the longest crape veil procurable during two distinct periods of widowhood isabels armful of lilies struck her as shockingly unconventional not even a ribbon confined the long green stems and to mrs grace this falling away from custom was highly amusing but isabel was isabel one never dared to count upon what she would do individuality was too strenuous for mrs grace besides every one paid for good form nowadays while it was much easier to adopt accepted practice than to run the risk of appearing eccentric original people were generally poortoo hard up to be altogether proper  i should think you might have tied your flowers with white gauze and put them in a box she said bluntly  father barry will like them as they are mrs doan answered  the older woman sank back a long feather on her large hat brushed isabels cheek the niece moved away in the corner of the carriage she held the lilies closer praying that her companion might restrain frank opinions fortunately both women enjoyed independent fortunes affluence represented distinct value for each one the aunt loved money for what it bought the niece for what it brought mrs grace reveled in splendid things isabel in unusual opportunities the one reverenced abundance the other freedom and the luxury of not overdoing anything neither one was congenial with the other yet for a time at least it seemed necessary for their conflicting tastes to remain politely sugared before the world aunt and niece appeared to be in wellbred harmony tonight the irritating chatter of mrs grace kept isabel silent shrugged in her corner she scarcely heard for suddenly she was wishing that she had written to her friend in trouble instead of going to him but for her aunt she would have turned back but isabel had done many difficult things things that other women shrank from her intuitions were fine and she seldom regretted a first impulse almost at once philip barrys letter seemed rewritten for her eyes sentence by sentence she pondered the tempestuous then broken despondent appeal yes he needed her she was glad that she had ventured to come to him a jar against the curb furnished mrs grace with petulant opportunity and while that lady settled her hat and adjusted her ermine isabel grew calm for an approaching ordeal as her aunt alighted hotly deploring the careless driving of a new coachman a flood of light burst from father barrys temporary refuge two women going forth from their dead friends little home tarried a moment with the son who stood in the illuminated doorway suddenly the priest accompanied them forward his eager eyes had clearly outlined a coupe and faultless horses she had come isabel was before his house he bade his neighbors a crisp good night and hurried to the side of mrs grace so good of you so good of you both he exclaimed searching beyond for the ladys niece still within the carriage mrs doan moved to the open door i was not intending to get out she told him softly i came only with aunt julia to bring these lilies for tomorrow to let you know that i understand when you have leisure to listen i want to help you to be brave and steadfast you cannotyou must not give up her voice swept over him like music  come in he commanded there is not the slightest danger for any one my only visitors are sister agnes and sister simplice both from the hospital  mrs grace evidently annoyed called from the footpath i am freezing  isabel accepted the priests hand running forward father barry insists that i come in she explained while all three entered the house nuns alert for notable callers stood in the hall mrs grace shed outer ermine and clung significantly to her splendid rosary in a room beyond she dropped upon her knees the lady addicted to posing had unusual opportunity the very atmosphere called for a graceful posture and devotional calm in the presence of her recently bereaved confessor flanked by praying nuns she took no thought of isabel standing apart an accepted heretic  mrs doan still wore her sable coat the armful of blossoms resting like snow against the fur she had stepped from darkness into light unconscious of her dazzling appearance clasping the lilies pressing them hard to still agitation she might have been a saint of catholic legend dispensing charity beneath flowers come said father barry close at her side come across the hall isabel knew that he was leading the way to his beloved dead she went softly not wishing to disturb the kneeling aunt and devout sisters father barry had spoken about his mother so often that at first she followed on as one entitled to a last privilege at the threshold of an oldfashioned parlor she hesitated come the priest entreated she would be glad to know that you had placed the flowers with your own hands ascension lilies were her joy she always chose them isabel moved slowly forward the room lighted with wax tapers was long and narrow at the extreme end stood the bier and improvised altar there were beautiful flowers on all sides the casket alone seemed to be waiting for the sons last offering  will you not put them here he touched gently the spot of honor i should like to have them with my own for i too have chosen lilies  she thought of reginald of the difficult part in the boys sick chamber which the priest had assumed and thankfully complied father barry watched her handle each lily with reverent touch one by one she laid them down then turned and smiled  how beautiful  to me they are the symbolic flowers of the world she answered  yes he told her they express my mothers life it was white pure true simplefragrant with love he sank his face touching the bed of bloom she lived perfectly he went on in tender revery i never knew such faithsuch faith in her friends in her church and now i have lost her lost her at the very time when she might have helped me but thank god she did not know thank god always that she never dreamed the truth about her boyabout the priest she almost worshipped and she could never have understood  i think she would have seen everything clearly as you would have wished her to see it mrs doan protested i am sure she must have counseled you to be strong begged you not to give up she would have told you to waitthen to appeal your case to an authority higher than a very unreasonable old man i do not understand your church government she acknowledged i am too ignorant to advise youyet surely there is some way otherwise there would be need of neither archbishops nor of a pope she spoke valiantly in her heretical judgment the vatican had no significance if its ruler refused to step outside to listen to individual cases of injustice  his holiness bless your dear soul bless you always the priest murmured huskily his eyes glowed but you do not understand do not see that it is not an ignominious downfall not the bishops power to keep me from going on with the cathedral that has changed everythingmade it impossible for me to remain a priest all the time i have been nothing but a hypocrite nothing but a coward  do not say such things she cried  but i speak truth nothing shall ever silence my honest tongue again you shall know at last why i went into a monastery took false vows adopted a sham profession  she raised her face appealingly her whole being implored him not to hurt her again after the lapse of years  forgive me he begged i am not blaming you no one but my miserable self i was not man enough to stand disappointment the only way i could live live without isabels eyes forbade him to finish but he persisted the only way i could go on with life was to forget through forms ceremonies and flattery when i began to work for the cathedral i had new hope in reality i was less a priest than before yet i was more of a man thank god i intended to do my part like an honest architect i wished to give my church something worth while  and you will do so yet she pleaded  not now i shall never act as priest again  his words fell slow and hard i cannot live falsely one day longer  the avowal deceived her and now she had no fear for herself only the thought to help the man drove her on not being a catholic she was vaguely sure of the priests words for isabel excommunication meant nothing but an unpleasant form which must eventually react on an intelligent victim she held out her hand  any one has the right to change i am glad that you have decided so splendidly it is like you to know when you have been wrong and now that you have really found out you can begin all overstudy architecturebuild something as great as the cathedral vows that have ceased to be real are much better broken  her words evolved a simple plan she had no understanding of the disgrace attending an apostate priest of the catholic faith father barry knew that she was innocent that she had no wish to tempt him but longing for all that he might still receive swept away his reason he thought only as a man  and you will help me  why not she answered  because you do not understand do not know what your asking me to begin life over implies his mothers face beneath the lid of the casket was no whiter than his own all that he had lived through in the last three days made fresh renunciation vain discarded vows fell away from him as a castoff garment he was simply begging life from the woman he loved  not here she pleaded do not forget where we are her voice broke you are still a priest your vows hold before the world i will not listen to you everything must be changedabsolutely changed before i can see youever again her anger restored him  i will do anything he promised  then go abroadat once she entreated voices admonished her to be prudent she moved away i will help you help you but you shall wait nothing must shadow your honest life to come she spoke in french fearing her words might reach the hall mrs grace stood outside the parlor door dreading to look upon death she yet resented her confessors neglect nuns had ceased to hold her from an evident living attraction as she swept into the room but she was scarcely satisfied for the length of the casket divided her niece from father barry the priest unconscious of an intruder wept out his shame above isabels lilies     chapter xii   isabel sat beneath the trees while reginald turned successful somersaults on the lawn the boy was well and strong adorable in blue overalls  mrs doans second season in the most beautiful town in southern california had begun she had forestalled the demand of tourists and was already established in a furnished house with a garden she was very happy and believed that she had found the idyllic spot of a lifelong dream today a glorious perspective of purple mountains spread out before her when she lifted her eyes from the bit of needlework which she was trying to finish for a friends firstborn having spent the previous season in a large hotel she rejoiced in seclusion now she might face the future without indefinite dread something she could not quite get rid of when thinking of the man whom she had undoubtedly influenced for philip barry was no longer in orders almost a year lay between his life as a priest and the strained difficult existence of one adrift beginning over feeling his way with a prejudiced public but he had gone abroad as isabel advised and at first excommunication appeared to be no harder to bear than his earlier catholic punishment  during months in paris he had wrought himself into lofty independence occupying his time with feverish writing the result was an unpublished book on the spirit of the cathedral disdaining many lurid accounts of his apostacy he had worked with his whole intellect thinking constantly of isabel yet withal he kept his promise through six months he had sent her no word of his welfare isabels pure name lent no color to a startling sensation exciting the entire middle west and catholics throughout the world with mrs grace alone suspicion rested for others mrs doan had no part in the priests unusual course fortunately but one stormy scene had ensued between the aunt and the niece then both women agreed to ignore a painful subject it was not until the second season in california when european letters began to come with unguarded frequency that mrs grace again grew chilly glancing askance at foreign postmarks she declined to ask the most trivial question concerning the man wholly excluded from the thoughts of a good catholic the ladys bitterness brewed fresh measure isabel was deeply hurt still as during the previous winter days passed without rupture to all appearances things were as usual it was not until mrs grace rebelled over quiet that isabel fully realized her aunts unfitness she now barely endured her chaperone while more than ever she regretted the womans unexecuted threat to return to apartments in a favorite hotel however mrs grace stayed on unsettling an otherwise contented household  isabel was obliged to keep open house without regard to chosen guests a dream of freedom seemed ruthlessly dispelled yet today she was happy at last free to indulge her thoughts early in the morning the restless relative had departed and should good fortune continue the touring car would not return before late afternoon isabel glanced down the gentle slope of her garden shut in from streets beyond by hedge rows that in springtime were snowbanks of cherokee roses early rain had cleansed the mountains the range was already prismatic sharpened into fresh beauty below a sky as blue as june no suggestion of winter touched the landscape as usual the paradox for november was summer overhead and autumn on the foothills old baldy still rose without his ermine on the mesa brown and yellow vineyards lay despoiled of crops lately pressed into vintage or dried into raisins what is known as the season had not begun to isabel the absence of the ubiquitous tourist together with simple demands upon time expressed a psalm of life which she might well have sung  as she sat under a tree sewing her mind went naturally to a land far distanta land which held philip barry for a letter had come that very morning the excommunicated priest was in paris awaiting her answer a year of probation was almost over yet he begged as a boy for shortened time while isabel worked she examined herself with judicial care the unerring precision of each tiny regular stitch seemed like testimony in her lovers case she sewed exquisitely at infrequent intervals and generally to compose her mind philip barrys wish to come to her at once had upset both her plans and her judgment should she let him crosstwo full months before the time agreed upon all that her answer might involve pricked into soft cambric she drew a thread again and again struck back sharply into dainty space for a hemstitched tuck it was hardso hardto refuse yet if he came came within the month then everything must be changed not only for herself but for reginald  isabel evaded the natural conclusion of the whole matter as she sat below the towering mountainsvery close they seemed todayshe had a sense of being in retreat from everyone she would take ample time to prove herself to feel sure that her wish for philip barrys love was not selfishness nothing must make her forget the boy and the possible consequence of his mothers marriage to an apostate catholic priest she sighed looking up at the purple peaks the very serenity of her environment developed the longing for happiness she was too young to accept blighting sacrifice and yet because of those two months on which she had counted she was undecided but withal she smiled he might have stayed away the year she murmured her sons glad shouts echoed on the lawn impatience is unreasonable why has he asked me to cable my answer he should have waited for my letter she told herself in flat denial to what she really wished  she sat idle stirring pepper boughs roused her from revery she looked above at swaying branches only to remember how admirably reginalds father had waited for everything half stoical force which described the mans power during a period of successful railroading had always restrained him when he died his unsoiled record and splendid business success had both been achieved through the mastery of waiting she smiled the curve of her lips charmed she was yet undecided yes the man she married had not been impatient he had waited three months for the one word she would not say at last when she became his wife he still waited for something she could never give him he did not complain again pepper branches trembled and a shower of tiny berries began to fall commotion ensued among leaves until a dark slender mocker shot out onto the back of reginalds fox terrier suspicion rage shrieked in the birds shrill war cry the beleaguered dog retreated beneath isabels chair the enemy flew off but came back finally to settle just below the cherished nest which his excitement had duly located egotism and pride made plain his secret  isabel laughed as she patted the dog crouching at her feet poor fellow she said you surely had no thought to harm domestic prospects then through the garden her boy rushed headlong a toy spade swung recklessly as maggie the nurse pursued jewels of moisture glistened on the childs warm forehead his cheeks glowed the violet of his eyes shone flowerlike he flung himself into waiting outstretched arms o mudder dear he cried i just love you so it most makes me cry the joy of his baby passion the depths reserved for years to come seemed the expression of another a stronger will and isabel knew that she had made ready her answer to philip barry     chapter xiii   shortly before five isabel heard the horn of the returning car she ran to a mirror and gazed at her reflection with new interest for after useless struggle with fate she had decided to let philip barry cross the water the telegram had been sent to new york and soon her message would vibrate over the atlantic cable early in the afternoon she had overhauled gowns not intended to be worn until several months later her changed toilet was a matter of significance almost a challenge to her aunt who would readily construe a transformation from half mourning to violet crepe and amethysts she listened to the horn dreading an ordeal fortunately intuitions concerning mrs grace always developed her own mastery and today isabel ignored the aunts startled expression and crude outcry as she hastened on to meet arriving guests  so glad to see you looking so well cried gay lewis a school acquaintance of years back i was afraid we might be late but luck is on our side and with my mother who so wishes to know you are our very dear friends mrs hartley and her son miss lewis assumed social responsibility with ease while mrs doan received the ladies she fairly drove the manor rather youthof the party forward  let me present you ned and remember i am doing something very sweet mrs doan is a darling to have us for tea do you not think so  you were kind to come said isabel looking at young hartley how did you manage to hit the hour exactly was there no trial of patience underneath your machine  not the least miss lewis volunteered as the strangers went onward to an immense livingroom you should have joined us not stayed at home on a day like this  hartleys adoring eyes renewed a previous invitation you will come next timetomorrow he implored  have we not had a delicious run said miss lewis speaking to the older women relaxing in chairs and ready for tea  yes indeed said her mother everything has been perfect  and mr hartley is such a precious driver the daughter went on he left his chauffeur on the roadcame home alonewithout a mishap you may fancy his skill from the time we madeninetynine miles was it not yes of course a regular bargain run and we started so late not until after ten with luncheon at one part of our way was simply drenched with fresh oil  just like a greasy river mrs grace complained  an outrage upon strangers who wish to enjoy the country chimed mrs lewis  i should think people who live hereand many of them own most expensive carswould protest it doesnt seem fair to spoil good sport by such aggravating conditions said mrs hartley  another biscuit ned dear i am shamefully hungry gay lewis who had passed too many seasons of unavailable conquest to be accounted young by debutantes leaned forward dear mrs hartley take two such jolly biscuit arent they our hostess must indulge us all we poor people who stop in a hotel  she turned to isabel assiduously occupied with a steaming samovar you do it like an old hand and i simply envy you this house miss lewis swept the immense rich room with alert eyes keen to artistic values you were lucky i am surprised that mrs grant consented to rent however i am told that her stay abroad is apt to be protracted you know she is most ambitious for her daughters  yes assented isabel she lives here only a few months each year  is there a mr grant asked mrs hartley  oh dear yes but he doesnt count his wife has the money and the taste too miss lewis volunteered  we must examine those antique brasses before we leave gay again addressed mrs hartley mrs grant has wonderful things she explained  i always want to clean tarnished brass up a bit the lady answered  of course i quite forgot your wonderful housekeeping  ned hartley flushed at his mothers philistine candor  in this particular room with its embrasures dull richness almost medieval simplicity i should hardly dare to shine any landladys cathedral candlesticks said mrs doan the humor in her remark was not too plain  how charmingly the whole outside approaches into the very house miss lewis put in there are no grounds in town quite so appealing i love dear wild spots in a garden when vegetation admits of them where everything grows the year round it is a mistake to be too tidy with nature  mrs grant is an artista geniusin her way the hostess rejoined she certainly understands semitropical opportunities whereas some of her neighbors seem only to think of the wellkept lawns of an eastern city  since the town has grown so large and shockingly up to date there is very little natural charm left anywhere said gay lewis really one has to have better gowns and more of them out here than in new york or chicago i never accepted so many invitations for inside affairs in my life before i positively have no time for tennis horseback or golf i just submit to the same things we do at home and spend almost every afternoon at bridge under electric light  isabel laughed i am threatening to abjure electricity altogether in this particular roomburn only candles and temple lamps i should like to try the effect of softened light on nerves she confided after sitting in a jungle of the garden i could come indoors and disregard everything but daydreams  the test would be worth while gay agreed and really i should like to have a daydream myself  absurd cried mrs grace the room is dark enough already with nothing but candles it would be worse than a maeterlinck play and how could one see cards by a temple lamp  wont you be seated isabel asked of ned hartley still standing you have worked so hard passing tea do enjoy yourself a momentous question went unanswered see i am dropping preserved cherries into your cuptrue russian brewing delicious the hostess promised  hartley moved a chair may i sit here he begged  of course you deserve my fervent attention shall i give you orange marmalade with your biscuit  anythingeverything he answered all but dead to the sustained prattle of the other women its awfully good of you to look out for me he added with an adoring glance and you will let me take you out in the machinetomorrow he pleaded  isabel smiled you are very kind  miss lewis was standing by the table with her cup we shall never let you rest until the thing is quite empty she declared cherries please instead of lemon as i said before you are a lucky lucky girl to drop into such a place  from a pillowed lair mrs grace protested dont tell her that she begged the house and garden are well enough to be sure yet after all one comes from home to be free from care i cannot understand isabels prejudice against hotels there is nothing so pleasant as a good one when one is a stranger in a strange land i like life something doing last winter we had bridge every afternoon and evening the guests at the archangel were delightfulso generous about buying prizes and of mornings the japanese auctions right down the street were so diverting of course we went every daygot such bargains even marked azon vases for almost nothing it was so easy to buy your christmas presents  how interesting said mrs hartley do the auctions take place every season  always in the spring and they are such an education mrs grace persisted then it is so exciting when you really want something of course one does not always know what to do with so many trifles for often one does not expect to get caught on a bid still the sport is great and usually the things are good enough to send east to relatives or else to give to maids about the hotel mrs grace laughed at her frank confession to be honest she continued i am bored to death by our present mode of life what isabel finds in housekeeping i cant understand  poor aunt julia mrs doan flushed at an unexpected chance i see that i have been very selfish she owned mischievously alas i am too content to give up after working hard to find so much then outside of personal delightthere is my boy he is the happiest little soul imaginable you should see him in his overalls how could i deprive him of his home for another whole year the mother pleaded  he was well enough last winter said mrs grace  dear aunt julia our friends will think that we are quarreling i had no idea that you were unhappy as soon as the archangel reopens you must take rooms and enjoy yourself as usual  the woman never prepared for a climax rose from her pillows take rooms at the archangel leave you unchaperoned she cried in blunt dismay why isabel doan what are you thinking of  i should not be alone the niece answered my old french governess madame sabot is begging to come to california by this time she is doubtless an ogress well able to guard me  a hot wave of suspicion swept the aunts countenance  for that small matter cried miss lewis i might do as well as madame take me for your chaperone wont you dear i should love to act in the capacity you know a mere infant companion is all that is necessary nowadaysthe best of form and i am positively old older than yourself she coolly owned miss lewis rose from her chair with vanishing hopes of ned hartleys continued devotion the boy was heeding isabels slightest word  you must over think my application she jested if mrs grace decides to join mother at the archangel i shall certainly hope to displace your french ogress meantime we must be going i have asked a man from the city to dinner he will put in an appearance before i am fit so sorry we cannot stop to see the boy in his nest i understand he slumbers on a roof topunder the starslike every one else out here isnt sleeping out of doors a fad so admirable for the complexion really one might leave the country with a decent bank balance if only one had nerve to rent an oak tree instead of rooms in a hotel she chattered gaily above the others to the verge of the waiting car  while the machine gathered power ned hartley hung on isabels promise just gained tomorrowtomorrow at three he impressed again miss lewis heard his invitation then blew the horn with ironic smile     chapter xiv   mrs grace had not accompanied the departing guests to the door as the machine sped away isabel realized her aunts displeasure and braced against a scene the time for plain words had arrived she went slowly into the livingroom building up as best she could a line of defense for certain attack by the glow of a wood fire wreathing flame up the wide chimney she saw her aunts face it was pale and tense with suspicion hate for the man once her idolized confessor had transformed the carefully preserved woman into one far from attractive she seemed to gather vituperative force beyond her strength for suddenly she stopped pacing the room to sink to a chair isabel turned frightened  aunt julia aunt julia what is the matter she spoke running forward  mrs grace motioned her away dont pretend she cried i have seen from the very beginningknown exactly what you were both doing isabel said nothing it was the older womans opportunity not building the cathedral was only an excuse for all that is still to come you have ruined a man who otherwise must have been a saint she buried her face in her hands which suddenly became gray and drawn beneath their weight of glistening gems in anger mrs grace looked old  what kind of a life do you expect to lead with a traitor to both his faith and his honor do you suppose for a moment that he will forget throw away his soul without longing to repent i wish you joy of your conquest isabel doan and remember i am telling you the truth even though you have turned me from your house after all my devotion mrs grace sobbed hysterically isabel was at first stunned by her aunts evil predictions then she tried to speak you neednt excuse him the angry woman forbade i have heard your loose arguments before now dont tell me that it is better to break a sacred vow than to keep it with rebellion i will not listen to you she crossed herself against possible harm read all the pagan books you can find but dont forget my words i must leave you as soon as possible for of course after my treatment this afternoon i cannot intrude  aunt julia isabel sank at her feet please let us part friends she pleaded you have been very good to me if only you could understandlet me tell you things which you do not know  mrs grace sprang up  and you intend to really marry that man isabel flamed scarlet you actually expect to go through with the farce of a religious service well you had better remember that marriage vows are more easily broken than any others dont be a foola prude about mere formif you care to keep a lover for mark my words the man who has been untrue to his church will find it much easier to forget a wife vindictive zeal gave mrs grace hard fluency and the insult which isabel had not expected made her own part clear she rose from the floor straight and firm  i feel that it is not too late for you to leave me this evening if you think differently i can take reginald and maggie into los angeles while you find another home after what you have said it is impossible for us to sleep beneath the same roof  her wounded womanhood stood out superbly she walked from the room above with her door locked against every one she burst into tears with burning face in the pillow she wept out her heart in all her life she had never felt so hurt and miserable would the world regard her marriage to philip barry in the same wretched light as her aunt then perhaps the catholic woman was right after all shea hereticmight not be able to hold the man who was now willing to give up everything for love and she had induced him to take the fatal step perhaps she did not understand the force of catholic vows  she sat up gazing through the window at the full top of a eucalyptus tree dark and wonderfully etched against lingering gold of sunset why should she be miserable in a world as lovely as the one about her she longed for the happiness which belonged to her youth and station again she recalled every word which she had said to philip barry at the side of his mothers casket to her straightforward nature she had advised him wisely with reason unbiased by dogmatic training with her soul honest as a childs she felt no shame for what she had done and it was now too late to hesitate she had sent the message and she must hold to it with her life her womanhood she bathed her eyes still going over the main facts of her lovers disgrace in the catholic world she came back always to the main point he only committed a mistake when he had gone into the priesthood without realizing the price he had tried in vain to live a life of selfdenial of enforced conformity whereas both attempts were totally unsuited to his temperament and mentality he had made a false step in the wrong direction why then should he go on it were better to stop than to stumble and fall when a lawyer failed in the profession none thought worse of him when he succeeded with literature and the doctor unable to grasp physical ills of casual patients carried no stain on his honor if he discovered some other calling it could not be right to denounce a physician in charge of souls because he would not go on with a spiritual travesty philips disappointment in regard to the cathedral his unjust treatment by his bishop his thwarted ambitionthese things she put to one side in a final summing up all seemed secondary to the confession of the man who had stood by the side of his dead catholic mother he had said that he could no longer continue his priesthood because he had ceased to be false with himself that to isabel made sufficient reason for all that had happenedfor all to follow she covered the case by direct standards of her own truthful nature this evening looking into the golden sunset she could find no justifiable bar to marriage with philip barry  when maggie tapped on the door she opened it calmly the girl was vaguely conscious of sudden disturbance come in said mrs doan mrs grace is leaving this evening she explained if possible you must help with her packing i shall not be down to dinner i am tired and will lie down outside with reginald you need not disturb me should i need you i can ring isabel had partly undressed  you wont have anything to eat the nursemaid questioned  nothing now perhaps later mrs doan hastened to put on a padded robe her hair fell about her shoulders  she separated the shining mass weaving it into braids as she went almost running to her sleeping son an upper balcony partially protected by canvas made his cozy nest at the south and east there was nothing to shut out the stars while at dawn peaks beyond the northern range rose dark and sharp through zones of burning rose isabel cast herself upon her own bed delicious air cooled her burning cheeks and she could hear the gentle regular breathing of her boy she had no thought of sleep her only wish was to escape to a place cut off from her aunts temporary territory now she would wait her heart was kind and in retreat she began to feel sorry for the woman with whom she had parted mrs grace was only half sister to isabels father and far back the little girl had wondered why her pretty aunty so often quarreled with her family once she heard her father declare that julias nose and hands seemed to guarantee a lady but she had caught no more at the time she did not understand since then she had grown older and wiser she sank upon the pillow gratefully below there was a stir of running feet a commotion at the telephone isabel tried to forget her own inhospitable part once she half rose from bed half believed that she would face her hysterical aunt with overtures of peace then she felt the foolishness of going through with everything again mrs grace was impossible after what had taken place sounds about the house continued the angry woman proposed to take her own time for packing and it was nearly midnight before isabel became sure that an unwelcome guest had gone above with the boy she watched the stars grow brighter listened to night calls of stirring birds wondered about philip barry at the other side of the world now at last she was alone in the house with reginald and the servants she got up and went below to find maggie crying in the hall the girl hid a crimson face and isabel knew that mrs grace had enlightened her in regard to a coming event as one catholic to another she had warned the nursemaid to protect her soul from evil influence  you may go to bed mrs doan commanded maggie turned away then came back her voice failed and she pointed to the dining room where a little supper was daintily set out she sobbed her way to the back of the house then above to her room isabel was alone she had hardly dreamed of freedom yet now it was here the fire in the livingroom still burned and like a child she took a bowl of milk and bread and sat down on a rug before glowing embers in spite of all she felt happy she was hungry too and after she had eaten every mouthful she sat onthinking of philip     chapter xv   it took isabel nearly a month to throw off the effect of her aunts angry departure at the end of that time the cheery french woman arrived to take the place of mrs grace who had gone from the town to st barnabas still later isabel heard with strange relief that her aunt no longer enjoyed california and was about to seek excitement in new york she felt glad that mrs grace would be at the far side of the continent before the coming of philip barry  isabel had not kept her engagement with ned hartley the morning after the trouble but the next day and for days following she toured in the machine with the elate boy and his mother mrs lewis and gay were often of the party to spin through a country growing fresher more enchanting with each welcome rain was a tonic isabel rebounded and at last philip had started for home she now thought of little else and her heart grew light as days slipped away to restore the man whom she had unduly influenced to bring him in touch with happiness to lead him in his new career to honor even to fame grew into a passionate hope as time went by philip was already hers she would make him forget help him to consecrate his talents anew to art and letters he must write books and be glad that he was no longer a priest bound with forms and obsolescent vows his brilliant mind should be free to develop his manhood to grow unrestrained isabels own unorthodox view was so wholly conceived out of intellect and evolving mercy that retribution and remorse were not pictured as possible punishments reserved for an apostate catholic once a priest  her one thought was to make the man who had suffered from an almost fatal mistake happy when once he felt the surging joy of love opportunity his past life would cease to trouble him isabel was young and confident she felt sure of everything the day wonderfully bright and exhilarating called her into the garden where she found reginald the boy had dug a flower bed with a tiny spade then too impatient to think of seeds had broken full blooming geraniums into stubby shoots and planted each one with a shout of laughter  see my garden mother dear he cried as isabel approached its all weddygrowed beautiful he clapped dirtstained hands and bounced about in his blue overalls  maggie raised a tearstained face from where she was sitting her only outlet seemed to be weeping to think that i must leave him she sobbed it breaks my heart to go and nothing but mike insisting that we get married could part me from my boy she wound her arms about her little charge mrs doan saw that the girl held a letter its to san francisco he bids me come she went on in her excitement she had lapsed into oldcountry expression and he thinks i can get married with no warnin married indeed married without a stitch but store clothes i would like to send him walkin back east with the chance of a better man  you must not do that said mrs doan now reconciled to the girls departure reginald was growing fast and with madame sabot and an english nurse in readiness to fill the irish maids place the boy would find his daily education an easy matter  poor maggies so sick mother dear the little fellow explained he threw his arms about the neck of his weeping nurse kissing her loudly now poor maggie is all well he exulted didnt reggie give maggie a nice big fat kiss he went back satisfied to his miniature garden while at the same moment ned hartley rushed down the terrace where are you all he cried his manner had grown free and confident since his first teadrinking in mrs doans drawingroom this morning his boyish face glowed with expectation do hurry he begged you are surely coming the mater is waiting in the machine and the days bully he pressed his wish at isabels side she led him beyond the range of maggies ears  i am afraid that i cannot go reginalds nurse is leaving at once she explained  but i have found your horses young hartley tempted you must come and pass judgment on the finest span in the country they are beautiesperfect beauties i ran the owner down by mere chance and well find him on a foothill ranch with the pair in question saddle horses too you simply must come if you really wish for a snap his enthusiasm was contagious  you are good isabel answered  then you should reward me with your company bring old madame and the boy  reginalds ears had caught the invitation come mother dear he cried come wight away his glee bubbled the uncomprehended tears of his nurse were forgotten as he placed his hand in neds  see the mischief you have wrought said isabel it is too late for reggie to go from homealmost time for his bath and nap she announced decidedly  but mother dear the blue eyes flashed mutiny but mother dear reggie must have a good time the ruling passion of the age possessed the infants soul to enjoy life topped every other thought  the child drew hartley forward with all his strength come right away he coaxed i want to get my red coat  but darling isabel protested you cannot go in the machine this morning here comes maggie to give you your bath go with her at once  a struggle was on you must go with nurse you may not have a good time this morning another day you shall ride in the automobile if you are obedient  the child surveyed his mother she showed no sign of weakening for an instant his lips trembled a cry half escaped them then he rushed into maggies arms  tomorrow reggie may go tomorrow he repeated with baby confidence two sturdy adorable legs went peaceably forward across the lawn with every step the boy evoked some happy future daya glad tomorrow  youre the slickest mater on record exclaimed hartley how do you do it i believe you might subdue a labor strike if you tried no man could resist you long and any fellow would be bound to do things make something of himself if only he might have you to keep him level that he had known mrs doan but a short time escaped his mind suddenly he was pushing his cause with youthful ardor if you could only care for me he cried only believe that i really would amount to something if you gave me the chance why cant i prove it to you indeed i would do everything that you wished me tobe as good as regupon my word isabel raised startled eyes in mute entreaty let me finish the boy implored i know just what you think so please do not tell me you have heard about the scrape at college all about my getting fired my fathers anger everything abominable and it is true all truei was an ass a perfect ass i admit it but you see im different now i can be a man even if i didnt get through college by the skin of my teeth if you would only marry me father would overlook everything set me up in any kind of business i liked and besides the mater has much more money than dad shes simply crazy about youalmost as crazy as i am  my dear boy cried isabel feeling very wise and old you must stop if you say another foolish word our pleasant friendship will have to end right here  but it isnt foolish to love you to be mad with good resolutions for your sake he pleaded of course if you wont listen to me now i must wait and i will waitwait just like reguntil tomorrow his whole being reflected new resolve  then be reasonable go back to college finish the course your position in life demands please your father be good they moved slowly to the house  and i may hope when i get my sheepskin  no no she cried i meant nothing of the kind i could never never marry you even if she hesitatedit can never be she finished  then there is some one else  there is some one else she answered in a voice so true that its cadence hurt the more  ned looked upon the ground then he lifted hopeless eyes of course i am an ass i always was one but you will come out in the machine i havent the nerve to explain and ill help you find the horsesfor the other man he choked out  isabel could not refuse the humble request     chapter xvi   the luxurious touring car sped away in the tonneau mrs hartley and madame chatted with no suspicion of neds unhappy state the morning was glorious  please come the boy had begged then added if you dont the mater will want to know the reason why  we must be the best of friends isabel whispered as she took her place in front  is ze country not devine cried the old french woman so like la riviera my southern france  mrs hartley coughed the dust is a drawback she complained  but it does not rise in ze nostrildrive upon ze face there is no wind to make rough ze flesh the other argued at san francisco ze little stone rise from ze ground hit ze eye and in chicago ze wind blow fierce make sore ze throat mrs hartley tightened her veil ze south california is gooddear madame hartleygood beyond every land but france madame sabot laughed like a happy child am i not blessed to stay in ze paradise to live wis my angel children since ten years i have no homeonly trouble tes grande she cried ze tree i forget ze name  eucalyptus prompted isabel turning backward  ucaliptus madame repeated not trim like ze lombardy poplar but so tall so tall  the giant stood by the wayside the round smooth trunk expanding each year from beneath girders of loosening bark lifted a weight of inaccessible white blossoms to the sky peeled to a shining mauve the mighty stalk shot up to swaying dull green branches from lower irregular limbs long ribbons of sloughing fiber hung in the gentle breeze until rain or a transient gust sent them rattling to the ground when threatening moisture lay along the range the giant eucalyptus loved to plunge into inky clouds to bend anon a towering helmet of sable plumes this every artist saw and in her own excitable way the french woman felt the passion of the wayside monarch  tres grande she cried with parting wave of her hand  i see no beauty in a eucalyptus said mrs hartley if i had a place here i should not have one of them aboutsuch untidy trees it would drive me distracted to see loose strings swinging overhead then when the fiber drops it is even more annoying falling leaves are bad enough but falling bark i could never endure that at lakesideour country placemr hartley and ned rave over dried maple leaves but i assure you i have them raked up each morning i really could not endure the autumn if i permitted myself to be buried under dead leaves i should be too blue with rheumatic gout i am miserable enough  but ze california will make ze cure not one bad head since i find ze happy land old madame declared  the chatter at the back of the car made rare entertainment for isabel who listened by reason of ned hartleys unsociable mood the boy was deep in sulks he ran the machine so carelessly that his mother began to complain  dont be cross please be nice mrs doan begged softly  they were skirting the foothills headed for an upland ranch  wont you prepare me a little for what i am to seetell me about the horses she coaxed  there isnt much to tell ned answered out of gloom i just happened to notice the span in town then i traced their owner through a livery stable groom you may not like them he added with trying unconcern  i am sure that i shall love them and it was good of you to go to so much trouble the boys rudeness should be ignored did you know that i have always been wild about horses he made no response and she went on ever since i was a small girl i have loved to gallop over the country now i am going to indulge myself have not only a carriage span but two saddle horsesthe very best ones we can find  i presume reginald is about to mount ned was madly jealous the question brought a flush to isabels cheeks  i expect him to ride she answered but of course on a pony  the automobile landed in a rut then bounded upward and onward why ned cried mrs hartley what is the matter if you cant run the machine more evenly you had better bring adolph when next we come out the rebuke was smothered in a rhapsody by madame behold she cried behold ze landscape but the too evident attempt to allay the mothers criticism fell flat the lady continued to suffer with every jar neither the dazzling contour of the lifting range nor a wonderful valley sweeping from foothills to the distant glistening sea could distract her mind from personal complaints  it was a relief when a sudden detour landed the machine on a cross way leading through interlacing pepper trees to a small but attractive bungalow a pretty neatly dressed young woman sat on the porch sewing she rose as the car stopped  good morning she said my husband is with the horses she pointed to whitewashed paddocks at the left some distance beyond the peppers please keep going the road leads straight my husband will hear the machine  thank you said mrs doan you are fortunate to have such a location for your home you must enjoy living here  oh we do of course not every one cares for a foothill ranch but we are never lonely she had a flowerlike face and her simple refinement was charming i hope you will like the horses she went on now that we have decided to let two of them go the quicker the better she laughed musically then explained my husband has often refused to part with his famous four since they won the chariot race two years ago you have heard about new years day in pasadena all strangers look forward to the flower parade followed by genuine roman chariot races and the running of thoroughbreds four abreast is fine her blue eyes kindled  i should think your husband would try again said ned  oh he will but with a different four he does not wish to repeat his victory with the same horses for last year there was trouble  possibly he might part with the noted quartette if two of them answered for the saddleare not too wild mrs doan added  oh no the young wife answered hawley would never consider selling delia or her running mate we could not let those two go she flushed with her ingenuous confidence delia is named for me a little romance in which she took leading part must always insure her pasture on our ranch  come with us in the machine said mrs hartley do be good enough to show us delia said mrs doan we are now doubly interested in your husbands horses  isabel smiled in her rare way the woman of the foothills had once been a school teacher and felt the irresistible charm of the beautiful strangers manner to peer at life below the mesa was an opportunity and the ranchers young wife threw aside a fresh gingham apron and entered the car she sat in the center half turned in a revolving chair where her eyes covertly caught the elegant but simple effect of mrs doans morning toilet she had never seen any one so neatly put up against ravages of wind and dust isabels earlier freshness remained and the large purple hat securely veiled for touring seemed duly created to protect her golden hair the older ladies were kind and the little woman of the foothills enjoyed the short spin through the avenue of peppers to paddocks beyond  you never lock your door mrs hartley questioned  no indeed no one would think of stealing up here every one is honest where every one sleeps eats and lives out of doors  of course said isabel how wonderful this upland country is i envy you a home beneath the mountains how close they are she swept the range in contemplative joy then her eyes dropped to paddocks outlined by whitewashed fences but naturally adorned within with huge live oaks the spreading trees made shelter for all seasons happy horses she exclaimed i am not surprised they won the chariot races  the ranchers wife looked pleased my husband is very proud of his stock she answered and here he is  cole met them tall and sun browned  without further pleasantry the party plunged into business the little woman who had brought the strangers thither realized an impending sacrifice to part from any one of a noted four was hardly to be borne then she remembered that hawley needed money that lithe slender delia and her running mate were not to be sold when a purchase price became definite she smiled although she felt like crying the trade assumed reality and ned hartley emerging from sulks became interested but his good nature did not last for soon he understood that isabel doan was about to buy thoroughbred horses for the enjoyment of another man the boy was mad with jealousy he was sorry that he had urged the trip to the foothills then all at once he felt superior very like a martyr in view of all that he suffered and proposed to suffer for years to come meantime cole put his horses through telling paces no points of the beautiful pair were overlooked mrs doan acknowledged her wish to close the bargain but the rancher evinced no haste finally it was agreed that the span should go to town for a week a friend of coles would take care of them while mrs doan might drive each day with the privilege of returning them in case the trade went through a permanent coachman and a groom would be duly recommended isabels appointments from her own stable had recently arrived and now she could hardly wait to try the thoroughbreds in different styles of vehicles  i shall accept your kind offer she declared smiling and you will remember the saddle horses i wish for two beauties as soon as possible she was radiant thinking first of philip of all that she was making ready for his new lifea life which must be perfect automobiles shall never make me give up the joy of owning horses she declared  ned hartley bit his lip and turned away down in the valley he saw emerald growth flashing in sunshine spreading acres of orange orchard trees always dressed in green swept onward from cleansed mountains and reviving foothills to a distant line of bluethe ocean the landscape was glorious but the boy felt bitter and would not regard it he joined the ranchers wife with pretext of renewed interest in her favorite mrs cole was feeding delia sugar as hartley approached we call her our baby she explained i never dare meet her without offering sugar i always carry a few lumps with me today the highspirited animal stood eating from the hand of her mistress so gentle that ned could hardly reconcile her present range with that of the track  will she run in the chariot races the first of january he asked not caring yet wishing to appear at ease  mrs cole shook her dark head i think not she answered my husband hardly expects to drive this year next season with two young horses trained for running with delia and her mate he will try again last new years there was a great deal of trouble about prize money in spite of the evident dishonorable driving of a certain man who fouled my husbands chariot oh but it was exciting  ned begged for the story the ranchers wife went on  hawley had virtually won the race had taken the pole from his opponent on the first dash just beyond the judges stand he was holding his advantage without difficulty when beyond the second turn his right wheel was deliberately knocked off of course the big race of the day was ruined the management of the tournament has done everything to induce hawley to run his four this season but he has refused her cheeks flushed with the thought of her husbands humiliation  will the man who fouled the chariot be permitted to drive again hartley asked with interest in foothill scandal  mrs cole looked proudly away to the sunbrowned man approaching please do not speak of last years race she pleaded i dare not let hawley know how i distrust the neighbor who fouled his chariot but of course nothing was proved it was but the word of one man against another for the trouble took place too far from the judges stand to be exactly defined with some it passed as an accident then you know it was all so quickthe thundering by of the chariotsthe crash she clasped her hands as cole came nearer then smiled at mrs doan who seemed a vision of happiness  terms had been agreed upon and the horses were to be taken to town at once but mrs hartley had grown impatient not wishing to make the lady late for luncheon isabel brought her own affair to an abrupt close i am sure to keep them i love the beautiful creatures already she declared as the machine shot away  the little woman of the foothills did not return in the car  if the horses must go i am glad that she is to own them she cried when her husband named the price do you suppose she will marry the young man  cole shook his head doubtfully cant say for sure but if sulks are any indication should say the boy was down on his luck i think there must be another one and by george he ought to be president or at least a senator to splice with such a woman  im not a bit jealous his wife answered i think just as you do i think shes the most gracious being i ever met  shes a prize package all right cole said and she has a mind of her own the way she settled on the horses in less than twenty minutes shows that shes used to money most women would have taken three weeks to decide coming back to haggle at least a dozen times he cast his arm around his wifes trim waist urging her gently down the road im as hungry as a wolf he confessed lets get something to eat then well drive the span to pasadena and price pianos well have a corker one that plays itself  she cried out joyously after all she might have something too like the favored woman who could look then choose at will isabel spinning away from the foothills was still happy with thoughts of the mornings transaction very soon her stable would be ready for use the span saddle horses a pony for reginald were all in her mind and she must have a touring car and an electric runabout besides the house was already equipped with servants including a firstclass celestial cook who achieved culinary mysteries with smiles and good nature madame had arrived to stay and when the english nurse displaced maggie life might move along with the spirit of arcady then he would come philip her once forbidden lover     chapter xvii   weeks later washouts on the desert demoralized all overland trains and isabel waited impatiently for the belated limited then at seven in the evening she heard philip barrys voice over the telephone in an hour he promised to be with her during the morning she had wandered about the garden trying in vain to picture the meeting with the man whom she had not seen for nearly a year by afternoon she was in a fever of suspense throughout the house she had arranged flowers with her own hands had cut great bunches of roses for the livingroom a few candles were already lighted while blazing logs made homelike cheer isabel stood before the fire waiting she could not sit on a chair with the clock in the hall ticking away loud seconds tonight she wore soft white with pearls her lover would be pleased to see her out of black she wished his first moment to be full of joy  ma belle angele madame cried again and again french ecstacy continued until isabel begged for no more compliments she kissed the old brown cheeks then with sudden impulse fled above to her sleeping boy reaction had come at the end of a long long day the felicitous moment she had fancied was suddenly uncertain something she dared not define frightened her all at once reginalds soft breathing seemed reproachful  dear little son she whispered mother loves you none the less and hewill love you too she put her bare arm about the boys warm body and kissed his cheek tears came into her eyes she hardly knew whether she felt glad or sad good night little son father barry is comingfather barry who loves us both something told her to hope and the clock in the hall was striking eight all that had happenedall which was yet to happenseemed like a dream she had waited so anxiously heard so often through the long day faraway trains whistling through the valley tonight she scarce believed her summons when it came but the maid had opened the outside door and isabel heard it shut a mans voice spoke her name philip barry was below at the landing of the staircase she reached weakly for a card dropped it then went slowly down  philip waiting in the bright rich room saw her coming he stood unconscious of his lately changed appearance his evening clothes a london tailor had assured him that he was now properly dressed for the way of the world and at last his priests garb was forgotten his worshipful face slightly thin expressed only joy as he ran forward but something was wrong with isabel something seemed to be lost from the lover imploring at her side and she shrank holding him aloof for judgment  what is it he cried am i not welcome he scanned her face with passionate longing do you regretregret letting me come  no no she faltered only wait wait until i get used to you  he took her at her word and moved away hunger tried his soul but he made a braver lover than he had been a priest  what did you expect he asked at last  father barry she was crying  he gathered her close  be patient she begged the train was so lateso long long comingandand you see i must get used to your vest not being fastened in the back  he smiled pitifully will you ever forget ever be able to go beyond those mistaken years can you not go back to the time when we first knew each other  yes we will both go back i will forget i promise you but tell me she was dazzling in her excitementtell me if you are sure have you never been sorry for what i made you do you might have gone on might have overcome things which seemed beyond your power it was because i came that night in the midst of your trouble when you were not strong enough to drive me from you if i had stayed away she put the situation plainly waiting for his answer as a soul on trial she was jealous now even of a possible passing regret if i had stayed away she repeated  i should have left the priesthood he told her simply i had found outknew certainly that i could not go on even before i saw you your coming to me when my mother went but gave me hope brought rescue before god i am now honest  she threw her arms about his neck all that she had withheld was waiting love blazed in her starry eyes on her wonderful lips every doubt had gone with philips last words everything seemed clearstraightened out hours sped as moments there was so much to talk about so much to explain away each one went back to the beginning and to a time forbidden even in memory to an honorable wife to a priest intermediate existence was soon wiped out then isabel thought of her boy now philips boy as well they would bring the child up jointly she was glad very glad and you will love him always she implored he has not forgotten you kisses your picture every day you shall help me with his education i am so anxious not to make mistakes you know reggies warm live temperament you will advise me  i was not wise about my own career but i will do my best for the boy philip humbly promised  isabel saw for the first time how much he had suffered he looked older haggard despite his happiness but his face had assumed grave sweetness the old assurance of a once popular priest was gone dependence upon love would give him courage to begin over the fullness of isabels rich nature swept outward to his need we shall be happy i feel it i feel it she whispered joyously     chapter xviii   isabel awoke fully conscious of the day just dawning from her bed in the halfopen sleeping porch she peered into a roseate east with her whole heart she went out to meet the sun slowly lifting from a rampart of dark mountains this was isabels wedding day at high noon she was to be married to philip barry she rested on her elbow waiting for the transcendent moment she was a sun worshiper for the time and not a cloud subdued the oncoming spectacle as isabel watched the sable range took on softest blue while snowcrowned peaks rose dazzling in the distance over the world the sun poured light and this was her wedding day it was still too early for a bath too soon to begin her simple bridal toilet and she fell back on the pillow the white broadcloth gown and coat with feathertrimmed hat were ready and the night before philip had brought a bouquet of dewyeyed forgetmenots she had chosen the flowers in preference to all others there was very little to do no more than for an afternoon call she smiled over enjoined simplicity glad that neither bridesmaids nor guests should claim thoughts which might all belong to philip during the past two months in which she had spent a part of each day with her lover she had grown confident they were both happy isabel no longer feared for the man beginning his fresh career for his bookat last finishedhad been sent to an eastern publisher philip had not heard definitely but there was reason to believe that the house in question would be glad to bring out a finely illustrated work on cathedrals which might readily appeal to a cultured class of readers already isabel felt elated over her lovers beginning the field of letters seemed more choice more set apart since philip had decided to compete for honors in imagination she saw her future husbands prolific volumes how proudly she would dust the dark green row marked barry she remembered that the name was preëmpted by a master scotch novelist and decided that philip barry should appear in full on the backs of the new authors uniform edition she had read only parts of her lovers work but it had been exciting to handle a real manuscript one which must go forth to win philip alone understood the uncertain odds against disappointment in a fight for fresh life he felt no desire for anything but honest work the book had started upon a journey east a month before and now each day isabel watched her lovers face for news of its unqualified acceptance the collection of exquisite cathedral viewsactual paintingsdone in paris and submitted by a noted artist would doubtless enhance the value of the work yet it was after all philips part which timed the womans heart to feverish interest and today was her wedding day from now on the book and its author were both hers she stirred lightly in bed again looking through the open flaps of her canvas room a wonderful world was at last awake every bird evoked gladness and isabel too was glad then suddenly the boy slipped from his cot to snuggle within her arms enchantment of sleep lurked around his dewy eyes and night had brushed his rounded cheeks with cool fresh bloom he kissed his mother again and again youve got most a bushel he cried now i is going to love you he was speaking more plainly each day gradually ceasing to be a baby i like to stay with mother dearin this nice bed he said contentedly his arms held tighter the mothers heart felt chill she seemed to be turning the boy away the childs words hurt her as she had never dreamed they could she began to speak of a pony about to arrive which she had purposely withheld against a trying time to come today is the day for the pony she announced bravely mothers boy is to go out in his new cart with madame is to drive like a man all afternoon  but i want mother dear to come too the child insisted  mother dear will come another day today she is obliged to go to church and then her voice failed she had given her boy no idea of the change actually at hand had weakly depended on accident and his love for philip how now could she make the little fellow understand she began again today mother must go to church and  will philip dear go too the boy asked eagerly  yes said isabel glad of an opening wedge  and will the little bell ring  isabel despaired would reginald never forget the catholic services which he had once witnessed were yet vivid and despite effort to dissociate barry with a priests part the child was not well pleased with the conventional garb of his adored friend recently he had innocently inquired for the butiful hat formerly worn before the altar the boys regret was so genuine that philip felt his pale cheeks deepen the mother had tactfully explained that father barry of old no longer preached in a church and that now philip dear had come to stay the little boy without understanding adopted the change and philip dear had soon become both his playfellow and his teacher  this morning isabel tried in vain to pass over the hard part of a day that after all could not be happy until she had settled an important matter  sweetheart she implored then flushed precious boy listen dont ask any more questions and mother will tell you all about the pony reginald placed his small hand over his mouth  im doing to keep stiller he promised  very well said isabel pressing him to her heart the pony is sure to come right after luncheon mother may be away but madame and carolyn will both be here reggie must be very good and drive like a man all afternoon in his cart perhaps when madame has gone for a ride carolyn will take her place and stop for little elizabeth would not that be fine  great said reginald then added i suppose shell have to bring every one of her dolls  why not  oh well dont you see so many dolls would take so much room then elizabeth says ive got to be her husband  why not said his mother laughing  becausebecause i just want to be your husband he cuddled closer isabel wept miserably in his curls  dont oh dont she pleaded she smothered the boy with kisses until he cried out for release then she sat up in bed with the child in her arms reginald darling you must listen mother is going to be married to philip dear today at the church she hurried on before the astonished boy could speak after mother is married to philip dear reggie will have a kind father to love him to take care of him always  will he be father barry again the boy inquired eagerly  no no she hastened to explain just fatherreggies dear father  i think it will be nice the boy acknowledged he was still for a long time with his cheek against his mothers isabel had not intended taking the child to church but suddenly she changed her mind  would reggie like to come like to see mother married to philip dear the questions fell gently but the boy sprang up shouting  may i he cried with true desire to remember his manners oh may i may i mother darlinggoody goody goody  i think you may she answered  he kept repeating goody goody then all at once he grew sober something still troubled him will philip dear be your father too he demanded  no darling not my father only my husband  he waited a moment evidently sifting the whole matter his full baby lips trembled will philip dear be your husband all the time he asked his mother nodded then i suppose elizabeth will make me be her husband he heaved a little sigh which was masculine resignation personified well i dont care he exclaimed valiantly for you see mother dear im going to have a father and a pony too goody goody goody     chapter xix   everything was at last arranged and carolyn dressed the boy for his mothers wedding the little fellow looked proud and sober in his best white suit with a tiny bunch of isabels forgetmenots for a bridal favor he sat very still and grown up all the way to the church built after an english model and picturesquely hidden among green hills the beautiful chapel made a complete surprise when the carriage stopped on the country road madame took reginalds tiny gloved hand and led him forward while isabel moved slowly after them as all three entered the church bells began to sound and a man came quickly forward to say that an episcopal clergyman and philip barry were both waiting at the foot of the chancel madame guided her charge to a stall used by choir boys now absent here the old french woman and the boy stood expectant isabel came on alone vaguely conscious of her way then suddenly she felt protectedloved for philip had reached her side the clergyman entered the chancel the man and woman to be joined in wedlock heard him begin the service his words fell distinctly and soon isabel and philip listened to the solemn charge administered before marriage that if either of you know any impediment why ye may not be lawfully joined together in matrimony ye do now confess it rang over their heads into their souls with momentary questioning force but the pause enjoined by the church ended and no voice had accused the apostate priest the clergyman went on glad that the stern proviso was passed isabel faintly smiled then glanced at philip he was pale undaunted she put her hand in his and followed his deep responses with a clear voice it seemed natural that he should remember the bar to their earlier happiness isabel moved slowly to the altar by the side of the man she trusted she felt no fear the sunlight of human love the influence of home a chance for intellectual freedomall these should make philip forget a miserable restless year and at last the two were kneeling prayers and the benediction had made them one the first test was over soon they were signing the parish register and could now leave the sacristy the boy and madame were waiting again the bells sounded philip led the way to the carriage and a moment later all were driving off together along the wayside early poppies lifted golden chalices to nuptial health while a meadow lark extolled the day all about buzzing insects piped joy isabel was glad that she had selected the tiny country chapel for her marriage  and the drive home was a pleasant one restraint lifted as the boy prattled and madame overflowed in french isabel and philip gave out to each other without fear or confusion then came the gay arrival with servants waiting and the boys pony and cart in readiness for a time postponed but the mother no longer dreaded temporary parting for now she was sure of her little sons will power since the confidence of early morning her heart had felt free throughout luncheon she planned for the boys amusement during a month set apart for the honeymoon there was much to be said about letters and surprises which were to arrive each day then when mother dear came back reginald must drive her out into the country later the advent of kites would afford opportunity for an indulgent new father the child was altogether satisfied isabel found no difficulty in slipping above for a change she had almost feared to make when she came down dressed for traveling her son was so happy with his pony and cart that the equipage marking a brides departure seemed to be purely incidental to the main interest of the afternoon  with quick embraces a farewell hand wave isabel and philip were gone the old slipper flung by madame hit the carriage and fell to the ground     chapter xx   at last said philip and his wife responded with a happy smile the afternoon trip to st barnabas had begun the two were sitting in the pullman at liberty to forget everything in the world but their wedding journey as yet it was too soon to regard the future the present was all satisfying isabel began to speak of their marriage ceremony as most brides are apt to do how simple and easy it all was she declared i shall always love that darling chapel among the hills did you feel the spring coming through the open windows and did you hear the meadow lark on our way back oh i loved it all  her husband smiled at her natural joy then peering into philips face isabel saw again that his cheeks were thin if anything he was more distinguished looking yet already she feared for his health he had been working too hard and the next month must do wonders for the man she loved at st barnabas we shall live out of doors every moment of the day she declared i can hardly wait to show you that wonderful country it will be perfect to go about in the saddle how glad i am that we sent the horses on ahead and in full time  you are a fairy wife instead of a fairy godmother said philip  nonsense she answered i am absolutely selfish i love the saddle far better than my dinner and my only fear is that i may tire you out  no danger im going to astonish you besides you have given me the easiest horse  she denied the charge one is as fine a mount as the other i shall never cease to be thankful to our friend cole and isnt it nice that he is to take care of the horses during our stay at the hotel  pretty nice for him said philip  and for us too she persisted i really did not wish to leave madame and reginald without a coachman of course i could have let tom come but he is altogether too fond of a good time parker threatens to find another groom every week besides she hesitated then laughed besides i wanted cole and his little wife to have a treat they will both enjoy getting away from the foothills  i called you a good fairy now i am sure of it said her husband she smiled  of what use is an income if we may not enjoy it  absolutely good for nothing he answered  and its almost selfishness to do little favors that in reality cost only the thought some day we must do something bigfound an art institute perhaps on this very coast she was thinking of his lost cathedral then i should love to help talented young girls with no way of reaching head waters he looked at her proudly there are so many things neededso many appeals to choose from that we will surely find the right place for a little money philip remembered the check which she had sent him over a year ago  now her desire to make the whole world glad was part of her new happiness but soon they talked of other matters or else looked out through the wide window at charming changing landscape all afternoon the train climbed the rugged coast range often boring its way through a tunneled mountain at five oclock they had tea on a small table when a wonderful sunset touched every hill and spur of their upland road evening came all too soon stars began to peep and suddenly domestic lights twinkled across a populous valley then near by the great pacific beat eternal measure on silver sands it was eight oclock when the train stopped in st barnabas at the rear of a noted caravansary flaming electrical welcome philip had already engaged rooms resigning his checks and suit cases to a waiting porter he led isabel down the footpath through a garden of palms and flowers the way seemed fairyland while on either hand the breath of blossoms filled the night  my wifemy precious wife he said softly at their feet stretches of shasta daisies lay as snow isabel pressed her husbands arm  could any place be more perfect for our honeymoon she asked  lapping of waves reached the garden the newly wed pair did not hasten yet all too soon the flowerbordered path ended beneath lighted arches the two went slowly forward while just how to pass unconcernedly from the clerks desk to the elevator made them really seem like bride and groom for the first time each secretly acknowledged happy bewildered selfconsciousness the blazing corridor filled with beautifully gowned women and men in evening dress groups of older people back from an early dinner strains of music calling late diners to waiting tables gave instant local color to both time and place philip scrawling personal decoration on the hotel daybook grew careful and wrote the new appendage to his name with telltale neatness however it was soon over neither looking to right nor left the couple bolted past groups of curious women were all but safe in the protecting elevator when a familiar voice spoke isabels name gay lewis alert for sensation faced the grating of the rising lift delighted to see you she called after them and philip barrys wife answered with the smile prescribed under all conditions for a bride  as they rose above philip looked questioningly at isabel an old school friend of mine she told him he made a wry face  have you many more of them about the hotel she laughed softly  i cannot say one never knows whom one may meet in california  they were leaving the elevator following a boy with keys to their rooms i hope we shall not be surprised on every side the man persisted isabel caught his hand  never mind she whispered ill take care of you but you must be nice to gay lewis we are simply destined to meet the world over and gay has a way of saying things the bell boy was beyond hearing distance not that she has anything to say about us of slightest interest to strangers she hastened to add philip saw the flush on her cheeks was she already beginning to dread unavoidable notoriety the thought sobered him now he understood but isabel should not suffer if being polite to every one in christendom could help matters  i shall bend to the higher criticism do my best to impress miss lewis he declared with assumed gayety  then isabel exclaimed as the door to their spacious sittingroom flew open the place was a bower of roses did you tell them to do it she asked  philip forgot a passing shadow and smiled an affirmative answer  it is lovely the loveliest room i was ever in she declared how dear of you philip stopped by the window enjoying his wifes girlish joy she sank her face into every separate bunch of flowers oh these dear dear pink ones she cried  american beauties nodded above her head and she stood on a footstool to inhale their fragrance on a round table covered with a white cloth was a huge bowl of bride roses fitting emblem for the day philips surprise had been perfect the delicate forethought which had ordered her bower which stipulated for the little dinner to be served in the sittingroom away from curious eyes touched her beyond words her husband was indeed a lover she ran to him with outstretched arms as never before she knew the depth of a longdenied moment and later when she laid aside her coat and hat to sit at the first little dinner alonebut for the deferential waiter coming in and going outshe kept thinking of all that they had in store of their happiness to come  philip was never as gay never so like the boy of years backthe boy who had loved the girl both were beginning over again and time between had taught them the price of joy  on this night we toast each other said philip lifting his glass there is just one cold bottle for our little hot bird i drink to my wife  his eyes glowed isabel touched his glass with her own to the dearest husband in the whole big world she responded then kissed him he held her away from him feasting on her beauty but she begged for freedom and took her place at the opposite side of the table we must behave she cautioned hes coming i hear him down the hall  i will be circumspect philip promised but im losing my appetite i dont feel glad of salad and the rest lets fire him before the coffee i want to sip mine with my wife on my knee  for shame she chided as the waiter tapped the door with a loaded tray do seem to be hungry if we send things back untouched we shall be the talk of the hotel kitchen laughter was a natural part of the little dinner it is just like playing party she declared when the man again disappeared  please pass the sugar philip begged wont you kiss me again  not now she refused we must remember that reginald is learning table manners if we act too badly through our honeymoon he may notice shortcomings when we get home besides hes comingthe waiters coming be dignified  will coffee ever begin philip complained  very soon they both laughed  which shall i use a fork or a spoon for my frozen pudding  your forkby all means now please talk sensibly hes just outside  philip thought of the king who dined without servants and wished that he too had built a table for the occasion one with a dummy lift in its center to bring up food and to carry away the dishes  isabel watched with playful eyes until the last of his pudding was gone then she dismissed the waiter black coffee and a first cigar for the benedict state were both enjoyed without interruption the evening lengthened philip saw his wife flit about the rooms with joyous air of proprietorship reginalds picture stood on the table beside the bride roses  something told him to go below on a natural pretext for their trunks were late when he went out isabel did not stir everything was so wonderful so much more wonderful than she had fancied but at last she began to move about smiling she hung her traveling coat in the closet and brushed her hat her suit case was unlocked and unstrapped and she drew forth things which were needed she loosened her hair plaiting it as usual two golden braids hung down her back then she slipped into a soft robe of silk and lace and stood by the window facing the sea waiting for her husband     chapter xxi   philip and isabel spent much time in the saddle heavy rains of the season had suspended leaving the country fresh and fragrant heathertoned effects on mountains round about the sky so azure that the depths of blue seemed immeasurable drew the newly wedded pair each morning they always found cole waiting with their horses it soon grew to be an event for less favored guests of the hotel to watch the couple mount then gallop off isabel had no suspicion of the incessant comment created by her slightest public movement with philip it was different but for his wifes complete satisfaction he would have chosen a retreat on the foothills above the sea he knew of such a place and longed to leave the crowded hotel where all were talking behind his back whispering of his abolished priesthood impugning his motives testing his action by opposing scales of ignorant enthusiasm and bitter prejudice for he constantly heard unguarded remarks felt the prick of gossip as he passed from one place to another isabel was all unconscious of her husbands sensitive state for philip had kept his word treating gay lewis and in fact every one whom he met with due consideration miss lewis hung on his slightest word while at the same time she established isabel with an elect coterie of young wives whose husbands played tennis or polo at the hotel country club afternoons were often passed in watching sports in the open sometimes philip and isabel cantered into the club grounds in time for a simple luncheon frequently they joined new acquaintances at table then again they sat apart by themselves relaxing after a long ride through the valley or on the wonderful mountain road as yet undesecrated by automobiles for at st barnabas the ubiquitous motor car is somewhat restrained the famous mountain drive is still a tradition and sacred to the family carriage and happy tots on ponies philip and isabel never grew tired of walking their horses around curves which made the winding way a panorama of sky mountains valley and sea there is nothing more lovely in the world isabel would exclaim each time they left the upland for the return sweep past beautiful villas and gardens then came a gallop by the ocean but on other days they took a different direction going past the mission riding as it were beyond the pale of sacred history into territory where heretics alone might disregard the murmured prayers of monks it was strange how the work of the old fathers dominated the landscape at points the mission held the skyline and on every side its twin towers proclaimed the beauty of simple strength to the man cast out from catholic favor there was inanimate reproach in every elemental line of the early church against the blue a perspective of pure spanish architecture fascinated him his thoughts went outagainst his willto the cathedral he had longed to perpetuate romish emotion fostered at birth imbibed with his pious mothers milk rose unbiddena challenge to his love for isabel his wife always seemed to conquer and he stifled the dread that threatened as he turned his back on the mission then suddenly it loomed once more again he felt its compelling powers its binding simplicity meanwhile no suspicion of philips struggle entered isabels mind for her own keen delight in the church was serene the mission to her was an esthetic opportunity a relic that a comparatively new world ought to be proud of she was a purist in art and after a second visit to st barnabas she loved every line of the historic mission yet she had not asked her husband to go inside of a now forbidden place she longed to enjoy once more the marvelous view from the twin towers but as doing so would involve philip she had given up the idea their honeymoon was already perfect each day she felt happier more certain that she had been wise to marry philip once she marveled at a young priests power now the manher husbandheld her with the same irresistible fascination for philip was a wonderful lover both implied and manifest and besides after a fortnights trial isabel pronounced him the most charming comrade also there were moments when the two felt willing for a silent interval when neither one spoke or demanded attention it was at such times only that philip unconsciously brooded over the ecclesiastical tragedy of his life  but isabel blindly rejoiced in her husbands balance while each gay canter past the mission brought fresh assurance of his good sense then suddenly one morning he asked her to dismount for an interior view of the old church she did not hesitate it seemed manly natural that he should be strong enough to put aside personal feeling should be able to enjoy an esthetic opportunity at hand and she shrewdly divined that he was tired of denying his interest in the supreme tourist sight of the locality by going through the mission his noticeable attitude might be changed she had no appreciation of his risk from the catholic standpoint as she walked forward by his side she felt neither embarrassment nor fear after all they were both strangers coming with thousands of others who looked departed and left an offering of money the gold of heretics had really restored the mission the man once a priest led his wife beneath an historic arch of the long gallery here the two stopped three browncloaked monks sat on a bench enjoying the sun  we should like to go through the mission said philip  the oldest brother of the trio arose you are welcome he answered pleasantly  the two younger monks got up quickly passed before the visitors crossed a whitewashed anteroom unlocked a solid door then sprung it back in the face of oncoming isabel but despite the haste of a fleeing order she had caught a glimpse of the sacred garden beyond and it did not occur to her disqualified judgment to regard herself as a natural temptation for carnal thoughts she simply smiled at the rude opportunity enjoined by holiness as she followed the brother in charge of the regulation tour for strangers she kept wondering about the tall handsome monk who had used a pass key on the spring lock of the oaken door  he was a splendid specimen of manhood and isabel could still see his fine head his modeled jaw and chin the strong mouth above all the swinging freedom of his limbs underneath his rough brown habit she regretted the unattractive personality of the attending brother yet at the same time she triedas she always triedto repay a debt with simple gratitude it was soon plain that the austere monk regarded her with favor  as they went from one small whitewashed room to another pausing to examine some rude relic of early mission days isabel led in the conversation it is all very interesting she declared and the church has been so consistently restored she went on i do not wonder that you are proud of the only mission in california which has not been treated to some shocking innovation even the dear old church at san gabriel has taken on a modern redwood ceiling utterly devoid of arts religion  the brothers thin lips drew apart in a quizzical smile you must become a catholic and help us to preserve the crumbling architecture of the good fathers he suggested  i should love to help the work along she answered they had finished with the small chilly almost antiseptically treated rooms open to strangers and were now standing at the foot of the old stairway leading above to the towers on account of previous experience isabel regarded the high stone steps with trepidation the brother not intending to mount bade them take their time then meet him again outside in the sunshine philip offered to help his wife with an initial lift but she refused assistance declaring that to be game when mounting historic steps was the only way i may not be able to move tomorrow but today i shall not think of future punishment she gayly jested philip went behind to guard her as she took the penitential climb and at last both were resting in the ancient belfry close to the old bells from spain below the sacred garden lay plain to their view philip pictured the first sinful man peering into forbidden eden then he remembered that adam still had eve     chapter xxii   philip stood looking down with his hand lightly resting on isabels shoulder beyond the fountain before the timeworn cloister sat an aged brother surrounded by monks it was plain that the old brother was ill perhaps nearing the end of a chosen life on earth for he was speaking to the young monks who seemed to hang on every word hovering around his chair with awkward masculine devotion in all probability these same vigorous men would carry the old brother on his bier to the little cemetery where he might displace the whitened bones of some monk long dead and forgotten  as philip gazed down on the scene below translating as well he might the end of justified means to catholic grace his eyes filled with tears for some unaccountable reason the dying monk suggested his mother the reproach which she had never given him in life now seemed to ascend from the old gardenfrom the invalid brother leaning back on pillows philip turned away and isabel saw that he was hurt instantly her hand held his let us go she implored but he smiled back refusal  i was just thinking of my mother he confessed you must not forget that she was a catholic consistent and happy to the end of her days i could not help associating her in my mind with the good brother below us i have been told that an old monk has never been known to pass away with regret only the young ones sometimes feel restless in the cloister  he had not spoken in this manner before isabel covertly scanned his countenance his cheeks held a slight hollow almost imperceptible except when his face was turned in a certain way standing with his back to the light in the arch of the belfry his eyes seemed too bright for normal condition isabel remembered the strain of his past year  let us not climb above onto the roof she pleaded still he would not forego the broader view and helped her to cross from one tower to the other as they halted spellbound to breathe mountain air to drink salt breeze isabel again looked at her husband he was smiling in sensuous pleasure it came to her joyously that time alone could heal his wounded spirit it seemed manly that he should be able to delight in his present environment without prejudice that he should face phases of catholic power without pain it were preposterous to try to wipe out the realm of romish influence for to do that meant to give up old world cathedrals and universal art inspired by popes and cardinals yes philip was wise to tread his new way freely as a free man  but when they had descended from the tower isabel stood undecided are you sure that you wish to enter the church she asked  her husband hesitated with eyes on the stone floor the flashing recollection of an awful interdict held him then he looked up i am no longer a catholic he acknowledged coldly i have the right to see the interior of the mission church like any other american citizen come let us hasten  isabel followed dimly conscious of his defiant mood the brother waiting without led them across ancient flagstones to timeworn steps of generous dimension in fancy philip saw flocking darkfaced indians of early days mounting to service the work of the unselfish fathers accused him even before he entered the fine old edifice but he went on with intent to stifle all but esthetic feeling he felt relieved when his wife assumed a questioning attitude that was cordially appreciated by the brother in charge  here in the old church by the side of a brownhabited monk isabel shone as usual it became clear to philip that his wife and not himself attracted their guide he walked on listening to the brothers story of early mission life and art with no outward sign of inculcated knowledge at every curtained confessional before spanish pictures of saints at every sacred shrine he told himself defiantly that he played no dishonorable part the curious temper of the observer condoned his bold action he was a stranger within the gates he went forward to the foot of the chancel as a man in a dream that less than two years back he might have penetrated with full right beyond to the flowerdressed altar brought him a momentary pang but he stifled it and looked at isabel did she knowunderstand her serene face expressed no undercurrent of emotion the reserve force of splendid womanhood had walled in her husbands past with natural incidental impersonal interest for everything at hand then as they stood on listening to the brothers fervent account of work done by early mission indians notes from the organ broke the strain while presently a baritone voice of wonderful quality floated below from the choir loft isabel turned in surprise even at the far end of the church she saw clearly the two young monks who had gone through the heavy door to the secret garden the tall lithelimbed monk was the singer his cloister brother accompanied him on the organ  how beautiful she exclaimed sitting down by philip in a convenient pew they are practicingfor service she asked  the brother in charge nodded he seemed disappointed that his own rhetorical opportunity should be eclipsed by the mere song of a youngster but the charming heretic no longer listened to a story of dark slowmoving converts her eyes had ceased to rest on fantastic colored designs carved by early indians and now transferred to the new wooden ceiling of the old church the voice in the choir loft held her and with a womans will she chose to end the brothers attentions besides philip seemed worn with sacred tradition  we have enjoyed everything very much she said with enthusiasm if we may come another day for a glimpse of the old cemetery we should now prefer to listen to the music she smiled one hand extended as the brother hesitated she drew a goldpiece from her glove when philip too responded with natural impulse the brown monk moved away he turned once to look back then went on they caught the gleam in his eyes after all they had paid in full were not intruders in the mission always open to a curious public     chapter xxiii   philip and isabel were in full time for luncheon the wife noticed that her husband ate his toast and squab with appetite his cheeks were flushed from the canter back to the hotel while during the half hour at table he appeared both happy and talkative  shall you mind if i go off this afternoon for golf he asked as they went from the diningroom  isabels face expressed satisfaction her husband had hardly left her side since their arrival she believed in casual separation she knew instinctively that philip must feel renewed interest in his own sex to be quite the man he had been before his trouble of months back  go by all means she encouraged as they went from the elevator to their rooms golf must be your game it will do you a world of good to follow the links  and you wont miss me  not a bit she answered besides i want to expect you back i wish to feel the pang of parting so that i may know how very very lonely i used to be she spoke lightly but he knew that in reality she did not jest and the manyour opponent in golf she asked  philip stooped and kissed her how do you know that i am not going to tread the turf with a fair lady he teased  i should be awfully jealous she confessed he knew that she spoke the truth it came over him at the time that men were few who might claim such love as isabels in her starry eyes he read salvation felt the depth of her womanly will inadequate power to repay his debt made him humble he kissed her again holding her close with adoring tenderness then he told her that he was about to play golf with the great publisher whom he had recently met the triumph on her lips amused him  build no aircastles he begged but she freed herself from his arms and danced like a child  what a chance she cried you must make him your friend i saw last evening that he was immensely interested in you and now he may ask you to write for his magazine isabels estimate of her husbands genius of his ability to rush into print in one of the foremost monthly publications in the country was fresh proof of her blind passion  dont think such foolish things dear little girl philip commanded the road to solicited manuscripts is a long way offas yet i shall have to get my stuff back many many times before i can count on an indulgent editor he spoke humbly yet withal the eternal spark of hope had kindled for his literary career  shall you tell him of your bookabout the spirit of the cathedral  philip shook his head that might frighten him he would think that i had an ax to grind  but you have sent your manuscript to another publishing house she persisted  that is true he assented but until i hear definitely i do not care to talk of my forthcoming book besides the man is here for rest and change if i am able to make him my friend he may possibly tell me things above all i must not bore him with my own uncertain achievements he laughed tugging at his golf shoe but you shall try your art on the man this evening i have promised to present him  i will do my best isabel answered and by reason of the dance tonight the bride may wear white satin she is irresistible in la robe empire  philip faced her i see all my manuscripts accepted at once he said jestingly  of course now run along do not keep our great man waiting i shall rest for an hour then write to madame and reginald  and you are really able for a ball after the high steps of the mission tower  it was the first time that he had spoken of their mornings experience isabel was overjoyed at his light reference to the visit to the old church  to dance will limber me beyond doubt she declared with a wave of her hand she watched him pass down the hall to the elevator then she went back to her sittingroom  at last she felt the glad sense of partnership ambition for the man she loved threatened to become more absorbing than all else in her life suddenly her boy seemed to reproach her on the table his lifelike portrait begged for notice she caught up the silver frame  darling little son she murmured mother will soon be at homemore than ever your playmate your companion she put the picture down and sat with her head resting between her hands her thoughts were now all with reginald what was he doing was he out in his pony cart was dainty baby elizabeth along giving the dolls an airing then above all did the boy miss his mother dear she drew a crumpled half sheet of paper from an envelope bless his dear little heart she again murmured reginalds zigzag message together with round spots wonderfully colored to represent kisses drew her lips she responded to a realistic fancy smiling above her sons confident masterpiece then she reread a letter from madame all were moving along and the child was happy  her old friends idiomatic expression kept her smiling to the end while she realized anew the good fortune which had brought the french woman to california in future reginald might have every chance with his french the mother decided to make luncheon with the boy at table a time set apart for french conversation philip too spoke the foreign tongue and again isabel planned for reginalds liberal education and she meant to study herself by the side of a talented husband how full life promised to become but with every consistent hope her own ambition was subordinate to love to love to be loved by philip by reginald by friends constituted the little world she longed to conquer and tonight she wished to shine at the ball not as a woman evoking admiration from the crowd but as philips wife if she might help to bring him fresh power she was satisfied nor did isabel deny her own evident advantage she was too familiar with standards of beauty not to be glad of a rich inheritance yet in all her life she had never been vain for to be vain is to be selfish pinned upon a revolving personal pivot isabel had always thought first of others today her mind was full of schemes for philip for reginald and for old madame if philip agreed she wished to live permanently in california she had already put her closed house in the west on the market the city which had once been home no longer claimed her interest and philip must never go back to the scene of his past humiliation she reached for a traveling portfolio and began to write to reginald here and there she pasted bright pictures to illustrate a little story which would be sure to delight her boy when she had finished she dashed off a letter in french to madame then fearing that philip might be late she laid out his dinner clothes she was not in need of companionship and a couch close to the wide window facing the sea lured her she would rest waves splashed a rhythm of contentment out beyond the breakers a buoy creaked in vain for her nerves were as sound as her boys she did not mind the incessant grind she was happysatisfied     chapter xxiv   the saturday evening hop which so often was a perfunctory recurrence blossomed into an occasion when a score of united states naval officers entered the hotel the great fleet had not then made the gallant dash around the horn but for several years preceding this noted achievement stray battleships had touched along the western coast the ship in question bound for manila was now anchored over night outside the breakers of st barnabas corridors of the hotel palpitated when privileged men off the manofwar burst upon the scene in less than a minute maneuvers in the ballroom eclipsed those of the outlying battleship as anxious mammas steered young daughters to open port lines drew taut and merciless for all untouched by the accolade of station while on every side sat groups of elderly onlookers  officers in immaculate evening dress ready for change eager to dance with pretty women moved easily about and soon surcharged conditions were overcome by general satisfaction  by isabels side gay lewis shone with reflected prominence nor did the girl deny the evident truth when flocking ensigns marked her for second choice  you are a dear she reiterated after each opportunity due to her friend i have not had a chaperone for a long time now i see my blunder for philip barrys wife was the undoubted toast of the navy men  in a day when dancing has degenerated into pathetic uncertainty the advent of willing ensigns might well be put down as something new and exhilarating isabel forgot her strenuous climb to the mission roof she had not enjoyed a ball for full five years and she was like a girl surrounded by a swarm of admirers tonight the great publisher had no chance with epaulets to right and left but the afternoon at golf had been successful philip and his new friend stood together on the outskirts each duly conscious of his own inadequate worth  it behooves us to tread modestlywe fellows who have adopted a sober career the editor declared i never could learn my mother kept me at dancing school until i had tramped the toes of every little girl in the class then one day she gave me up he laughed drolly while his eyes took in the swift unconscious movement of mrs barry and her partner a tall young ensign  we are not in china and fortunately i may speak to you of your wife he went on as a comparatively new acquaintance i beg to congratulate you you are too fortunate in a world where many are not  barry stiffened the other sensed misapprehension  i have never been married he explained i am denied the pleasure of admiring my own wife those days at dancing school took away all possible hope for years i could hardly shake hands with a girl of my own age then you see i got wedded to single lifespent my days passing upon loves of fictitious heroes and heroines  too bad said philip deeply interested  sometimes i think i should have made a much better judge of literature if i had only asked a woman to share my criticisms and bear my remorse when i turn down very readable things you see a man who has not married can never be quite as sure as one who knows the taste of both good and evil the woman which thou gavest me may do a lot of mischief but when the crash comes she generally compensates for my part i doubt if adam would have gone back into the garden with any interest whatever after eve found pastures new outside  and you believe that a married man is capable of better work than a single one philip was growing curious  undoubtedly the editor answered i have in my mind a certain writer of note one who but for persistent bachelorhood might have risen to highest rank in fiction as it is he has always fallen short of the real emotion a certain class reading his books fail to detect mere description in supposedly passionate episodes but to those of deeper consciousness and experience he has counterfeit feeling this particular novelist works from matrimonial patternstraces all that he draws i am older than yourself and you will pardon me for saying it but your wife should help you to achieve almost anything  philip flushed the pride of possession came over him afresh when isabel whirled past with a smile which he knew could never be untrue above her radiance beauty he felt her exquisite womanhood tonight he believed that she would lead him to pastures newoutside throughout the evening philip stayed by the editor gradually making his way into the mans confidence while adhering to a first determination which withheld the fact of his own unprinted book then at midnight isabel miss lewis and three young officers captured the onlookers and forced them away to supper  it was a gay little party the round table at which all sat became an excuse for a full hours enjoyment and as isabel had promised she did her best to make the editor who might possibly help philip her own friend also the undertaking was not difficult if dancing school trials had left an eternal scar on the bachelors unclaimed heart tonight he showed no unwillingness to devote himself to isabel philip was amused then he remembered his wifes unfailing charm he had never seen her unsympathetic or rude when she really cared to please she could not be soon forgotten by any one selected for her favor and tonight as usual the elderly publisher and the young ensigns from the ship all went under to a womans gracious way nor was miss lewis annoyed  of course she said afterward no one ever attempts to eclipse isabel for dont you see she would not care in the least and that being the case no other woman would be foolish enough to tryand then fail and gay was at her best during supper philip had never liked her as well as when the party broke up there was after all something fine and straightforward about the girl who appeared to drift with the tide of hotel pastimes philip told himself that as a priest he had been narrow in many of his judgments the evening had stimulated his respect for the world his emotional nature went out again to things he had once given up isabels beauty held him in passionate bonds and he felt incentive for new work his book which came next to his wifefor no one writes seriously without the sense of humanized accomplishmentsuddenly went up in his own estimation the evening with a real publisher had stiffened his confidence and for the first time since his marriage he merged love for isabel with the success of the spirit of the cathedral but his personal undercurrent passed unnoticed to his wife he seemed detached from all but the present as she drew him away from the shining ballroom she exulted to herself unusual and lighter opportunity seemed to be what her husband most needed  the battleship hauled anchor at dawn the men had already started for the tug and a trip across the breakers the hotel was despoiled of glory corridors were soon dim and lonely to isabel the night had proved her husbands ease with a life comparatively new and untried she felt young contented ready for all which might come not a fear for philip crossed her mind as she went to her rooms she had been exhilarated throughout the evening but now she was glad to rest philip unfastened her gown halting to kiss her bare shoulders to tell her about their friend the magazine editor as she slipped out of her ball finery she was like a girl after a first night of conquest later he listened to her gentle regular breathing as he lay by her side it seemed yet a dream that she was really his wife events of the past began to fill his mind then reaction which so often came with excess of feeling kept him awake for hours but at last he dropped away only to rouse up at intervals the outgoing tide seemed to carry him to the anchored ship gleaming beyond the incessant yet broken passion of the sea forbade sleep with every tardy lap of waves he grew more restless and dawn broke all at once a desire to witness the departure of the manofwar drew him from bed isabel slumbered as a child and philip went softly to the window and looked out the sea rose and fell an arctic green there was no mist and he could see the great ship clearly a streamer of black smoke floated across the morning sky already there were signs of departure philip dressed quickly and quietly it occurred to him that isabel might be shocked to awaken and find him gone he smiled as he slipped into the sittingroom to indite a line to the sleeping beauty but his wife did not stir when he pinned the note to his own empty pillow he went back to the adjoining apartment for his field glasses then out of the door through quiet halls to a side entrance below where he found an open way     chapter xxv   philip watched the maneuvers of the battleship from the shore at the foot of the hotel his glasses were strong and he could make out regular disciplined movements of men on board what a life he thought to be always waiting for war ready for action in any part of the world regardless of human personal ties the monster breasting waves seemed as horrible as it was majestic the man who was once a priest had never wished to be a soldier this morning he sensed the command to draw anchor felt the significance of carnage for the sea saw the ship move against a skyline clear with oncoming day it took unchallenged sway the man followed with his glasses he stood fascinated by almost imperceptible motion against morning sky a black streamer rested then gradually trailed to invisible distance as broadside perspective dropped away the manofwar was gone but philip still stood on the shore early day had taken possession of his will he seemed rooted to the wet sand beneath his feet was isabel awake had she yet missed him he looked back at the hotel rising above lawn and palm trees he could see no signs of life and it occurred to him that a brisk walk might atone for his restless night the fresh air stimulated him as he went forward without thought of destination he left the ocean for the esplanade the esplanade for the long business street of the town as he went on he began to see people and to realize for the first time that it was sunday many were going to early mass and he was not among them at a corner he saw a modern catholic church the old mission now had its rival in the new brick building several maids from the hotel got off a car to hurry onward a woman in front went faster as she neared the church but turned half round and looked at philip he felt her insinuating survey as he strode rapidly away then he recognized reginald doans former nurse it was undoubtedly maggie and she knew him for all that he had once been he could not be mistaken that maggie had deceived isabel and followed mrs grace to st barnabas was plain with that ladys departure for the east the girl must have ceased to be her maid maggies surprise seemed evident and at best the encounter was disagreeable philip hurried on with the sense of being watched he walked past gardens not seeing flowers freshened by nights cool touch and mornings breath suddenly he was cast down depressed by something impalpable  but he went on and on in absentminded mood taking no note of locality not realizing his distance from the closely settled town he followed the track of a car line dimly conscious of the way until without warningthe mission faced him he might have known still he had the habit of losing himself when isabel was not his leader and they seldom went out except on their horses miserable angry he stood afar irresistibly called by sounding bells  he saw men and women go up the wide worn steps to early mass then like an outcast he turned away to board a car returning to the hotel isabel would be waiting wondering what had become of him and he would not tell her would never let her know of his childish trip the mission had become an obsession he saw it in his dreams and heard about it on all sides every artist painted it and carriage drivers on the streets urged him to take a seat for the inevitable trip children showed him their post cards adorned with a picture of the historic church or else some scene taken in the cloister garden the mission was getting onto his nerves he was almost beginning to hate it he would never see it again and with the thought he looked back at the graceful stretch of the low sunkissed monastery following on like a little brother to the close protection of the old fathers abler work it was so beautiful so simple that he could not deny his knowledge of architecture his sense of fitness kept his thoughts with the unselfish monks of the past he could not forget when from boyhood he had been trained in church history he had always been best in his class and how his dear mother would have loved the old church at last the car was moving at last he might get away  his back was to the mission and the run to town would not take long after all he might not be very late and as he had hoped he found the hotel still quiet only a few early risers were down for breakfast when he went to the diningroom to order isabels tray sent up to her room then he took the elevator he entered by the same door through which he had departed walking softly to his wifes bedside she seemed not to have stirred during his absence but the note was gone from the pillow he leaned down and kissed her and at the same instant half bare arms tightened around his neck then she laughed  sleeping beauties never wake up unless they are kissed she told him he doubled his charm as she raised on her elbow  did you think i was never coming back he asked i took a long walk after the ship got away went farther than i intended  i thought so she said men never remember the return trip but i have hardly missed you i read my love letter then went right to sleep i did not wake until i heard the telephone of course i answered it and whom do you suppose was speaking  doubtless one of your numerous admirers her husband gallantly answered  no this time it was your admirer but i came in for honorable mention i am so flattered almost glad that you were not here to respond to our friend the editor  now she was wide awake the soft disarrangement of night still hung about her hair her eyes sparkled as the morning she sat up leaning forward  he has invited us to go out with him this afternoon in his touring car i said we would come you are willing  of course philip answered smiling at her eagerness  mr and mrs tiltonjones and gay lewis are asked we are to start about three  philip puckered his brow why the tiltonjonesesi wonder isabel saw that he did not care for the couple  they are relatives of our host she explained one cannot turn down cousins in california or for that matter acquaintances you must be nice to them for last night both expressed the wish to know you she was anxious for her husbands popularity with strangers that he should hold his new place without criticism was always in her mind  isabel knew the world and when she married an apostate priest she had considered its way all outside of love she had even prepared herself for first almost inevitable rebuff time would show where she and philip both stood a desirable few who obstinately disapproved should not annoy her and at last they too might forget to her surprise she had felt no condemnation a mere marriage notice passed from paper to paper with miraculous decency isabel read no highly colored version of either her own beauty or of philips sensational conduct if anything unpleasant appeared she did not see it this morning as she sat up in bed enjoying the breakfast which her husband had thoughtfully ordered she was more than thankful more than happy     chapter xxvi   and you do not care for the tiltonjones combination she asked  philip shook his head i fail to admire either of them although i least of any one should cast a presumptuous stone perhaps i am unduly prejudiced i have known several hyphenated jones people before and for some reason i never got on with them you see i was always addressing the wife as plain mrs jonesperpetually overlooking the leanto addition  isabels laugh rippled how very clever her husband was i shall keep you from forgetting this afternoon she promised i am so glad to go out in a machine really i do not believe i could sit the saddle today and this is too nice she declared as she poured the coffee are you not going down then she extended a steaming cup take this she begged they have sent plenty for two suppose we have breakfast together  but there is only one cup  what matter when we have a full pot of coffee and just see the toast and rolls  philip sat facing his wife amused as he always was when he had only to obey  you drink first she commanded  tell me when to stop i might take all  you may i never really enjoy coffee until i have finished  she was irresistible and all this loveliness this unconsciousness was now but for his own eyes isabel was his wife today he felt that he had sinned only by once becoming a priest bound by unnatural vows  god had created a pair in the beginning decreed that man should not live without sympathy without love he was thinking of couples bound as prisoners everything seemed so natural for isabel and himself except when he did not sleep or went back too far the white satin empire gown lay extended on the couch  philip pointed drolly across the room then touched the sleeve of isabels dainty night robe i like this gown best you seem about eighteen months hardly old enough to be reggies fond mamma  for shame she cried still she was pleased with mention of her boy she began to talk of the little fellow to wonder what he was doing on this very sunday morning  the breakfast above proved to be a happy thought husband and wife took turns from the single cup there was gayety and byplay  we have not left a crumb said isabel i never ate such good toast you know we are to have dinner at onethe regulation hour for the day we shall subsist until then she poured the last drop from the coffee pot this is our loving cup let us drink to every one that is marriedin the big world  philip smiled that wouldnt do too many miss the whole thing he answered  i suppose so she agreed she had almost forgotten the time when life had not been full and satisfying now it is all so wonderfulso sure she added softly  but of course honeymoons have got to be sillyreal sillyjust like this breakfast after a while we shall both be serious enough with your literary work and reg growing up  she bounded from bed to her dressing room dropping philip a courtesy in return for his previous jest i will come forth full grown she promised your friend the editor shall never suspect that i still love dolls  she kept her word and after dinner when she stood with philip on the veranda of the hotel she had exchanged the way of a child for one of womanly charm the day was glorious and already gay lewis and the tiltonjoneses were on hand a moment later the host of the afternoon led his party to the waiting car the three ladies occupied the tonneau while tiltonjones and philip faced them the new york publisher sat in front with the chauffeur at the outset gay lewis announced her satisfaction nothing could be as fine as this she declared a pierce arrow is next to flying of course for some time to come i shall not be permitted to shoot upward but if it were not for mother i should accept my first invitation  could you really dare to board an airship mrs tiltonjones put in  certainly said gay i dare say i was born only for sport i love it better than anything else in the world i never think of danger when i am amusing myself  i am sorry that we cannot enjoy the afternoon according to latest ideals the host answered however i must depend upon miss lewis to direct our course which way shall we take he asked  they had already started on a trip through the little city  i am greatly flattered gay replied but really i have no choice when i am in a machine it is just go go go with me i can almost arrive at kiplings meter as i sit sit sit bobbing up and down again every one laughed  and you dont mind a rough road mrs tiltonjones demanded with literal surprise  not as much as most people miss lewis answered i for one shall not complain this afternoon i never felt a more comfortable car  it moves along perfectly said isabel who had thus far been quiet  and will no one dictate our way the host again inquired as he spoke the chauffeur shot onward in the direction of the mission philip alone felt the significance of the drivers plan but he made up his mind once and for all that nothing imaginary should disturb his peace of mind or ever again come as a phantom between himself and isabel he no longer seemed to shrink from a farewell view of the old church this would be the last one nor was he perturbed when later the machine stopped on the verge of the broad pavement leading to steps beyond not until mrs tiltonjones cried out begging to peep within the mission now resounding with voices of singing monks did he fully understand then he knew knew that to refuse to go inside on account of afternoon service was to virtually acknowledge himself a disgraced man in an instant he decided his wife hesitated but he insisted that she should get out of the car everything happened quickly with all pressing forward philip began to climb the stone flight to the church there was no escape he must act as a man isabel felt his arm beneath her own she did not speak gay lewis walked on the other side and mrs tiltonjones now joined the row  what terrible steps the lady complained im not a catholic so dont appreciate a penance but i am delighted to have a look inside the monks sing wonderfully just hear them she chattered on to the very door evidently she had not heard of philips former career isabel was relieved and entered the church with a sense of unexpected pleasure she thought she detected the baritone of the brother whom she had once heard then the voice stilled a priest was intoning  now all catholics were devoutly kneeling murmuring evening prayers philip barry stood beside isabel with his head slightly bowed others of the party used casual time for glancing about the mission to the man who had once been a priest the voice of the officiating father the supplicating swell of confessions born of human transgression the impalpable impression of detached souls coming back to worship were realities all too startling philip had overestimated his strength he lifted his eyes and saw beyondfar down the long aisletall lighted candles on the holy altar in brass vases he discerned stalks of flaming poinsettias like blood splashed against the dorsal the scarlet flowers flanked the golden treasury of the hidden host the man had been too long a catholic to forget but prayers were over the choir of brownhooded monks had burst into praise and ushers peered here and there for vacant sittings then with dismay the excommunicated priest followed his friends and isabel the entire length of the old church to a pew directly in front of the chancel  he had not counted on the conspicuous placing of a noticeable party he leaned forward with his head in his hands instinctively the usual petition moved his lips but he sat up and gazed before him with blinding realization of his own false attitude why had he entered again he recalled honest worshippers of the morning going up worn stones to early service at length coming forth into sunlight with rapt or tranquil faces and about him were the same reverential men and women philip barrys religious feeling had always been emotional rather than spiritual still he had been born a catholic the beauty of impressive ritualism the mysticism of the elevated cup moved his esthetic nature dreamer that he was he knew again the power of his inculcated early training he thought of his mother until today every tense effort to recall her sympathetic soul had been vain now an impalpable presence reproached himseparated him as it were from isabel in a momentary vision he saw the dear face and form of his lost one to his imaginative mind beautiful old hands stretched out to save him from impending disaster then everything before his eyes became clear and he sat still at the foot of the chancel a condemned man something whispered that to be an outcast from his church would gradually starve his soul perhaps he should turn to stone forget the worth of isabels priceless love and devotionwhat then he shuddered at the thought of possible suffering for his wife again the congregation knelt again he was glad to bow his head for the first time since his marriage the dread of disappointing isabel gripped him that he should have an insatiate longing for something outside of their close relation filled him with terror no she must never know he stood up at the end of familiar prayers responding silently to the rich voices above in the choir at the back of the church the monks had begun a gloria after all he would be able to control himself then suddenly there was mysterious agitation moving to and fro of priests and officiating brothers to visiting protestants the commotion in the chancel was not appalling monks passing hither and thither priests turning splendid vestments to front and back seemed but part of an impressive service  for philip barry duly educated to catholic power aware of a ruling orders justified opportunity there was a plain conclusion he stood as one summoned unable to move waiting for sentence enjoined by his own unpardonable presumption and above floated the gloria intent on the music isabel did not turn did not see philips livid face as he stood on powerless to leave the church yet knowing the full penalty of remaining voices of singing monks withheld judgment then finally with the deep amen a solemn file of officiating brothers marched from the sanctuary the time had come still philip barry could not move priests turned from the holy altar with plain intent beginning to disrobe in stately shame each placed his golden vestment upon a bench clad in their cassocks all went out save the avenger of the awful hour now in authority philip saw him signal as he came slowly forward to the verge of the chancel behind the communion rail he stopped and raised a restraining hand above in the choir loft the organ was dumb not a murmur broke a frightful stillness the lone priest waited every ear strained with his first deliberate utterance he was looking straight at philip barry at last he spoke  owing to the presence in this sacred mission of an excommunicated priest the service is at an end the congregation is dismissed let it go out at once with downcast eyes and prayers upon the lips of all true catholics he walked to the altar and extinguished the last candle scarcely turning as he drifted from sight of the awestricken crowd the dazed man singled out for disgrace stooped to the floor for his hat rose again to his full imperious height smiling piteously at isabelthen he fell backward caught in the arms of his friend     chapter xxvii   philip and isabel were now at home but the wife had not been able to turn her husbands mind from his late public humiliation she was frightened miserable would philip always be as nowcrushed silent with the one he loved best she buried her face in her hands her cheeks burned while her eyes remained dry she dared not weep dared not break down before the changed listless man whom she would save at any cost to her own anguish as first days of homecoming dragged away she began to see that she had been presumptuous after all her marriage was not to be a happy one she knew that philip adored her even more than before the fatal afternoon at the mission when he had fallen unconscious at her side yet something obstinate and heartrending had come between them tragic doubt seemed to be freezing her husbands tenderness with passionate dread of misjudging him she withheld from day to day the question she could not ask she felt that above all she must wait until the shock of his cruel punishment had ceased to be vivid during sleepless nights when she knew for the first time the price of a catholic priests apostasy there came also the realization of personal unjust punishment nor did she acknowledge wrong for either philip or herself they had done no wrong they were created for each other and their only mistake had been the last imprudent visit to a forbidden place she grieved over her own ignorance which had permitted philip to incur the risk which had turned against him she was bitter and because of a defensive attitude she could not understand her husbands crushed condition the joy of those first two weeks at st barnabas had departed isabel knew that she was a constant reproach to the stricken man utterly changed and gently silent through days when she tried to distract his mind from a forbidden subject driving him herself about the country growing more lovely with each hour of spring she felt the mutual strain to be almost intolerable lurid newspaper accounts of philips disgrace had helped to convert their once happy drives into perfunctory humble attempts to escape notice now they went alone in a runabout avoiding every evidence of ostentation country roads lured them from town and led them on to unfrequented foothill slopes where blue buckthorn adorned sweetsmelling upland acres below the purple range deepened with march shadows swept by fickle sunlight playing over crags and into canyons the couple passed long intervals when neither one of them spoke heartbreaking reticence tied their tongues each guessed the thoughts of the other  all about was the bewildering call of fresh life yet they could not respond to natures glad outburst deciduous orchards flushing buds early almond blossoms pure as snow wild flowers buckthorn edging miles of stony wash with tender blue seemed only to evoke prolonged silence the beauty of everything hurt them for they were both unhappy and afraid to speak plainly then at night when each lay wide awake blessing darkness which at last hid their faces relaxing after false smiles and feigned composure everything had to be thought out once more what would come of it all philip barrys wife dared not press the question she was young and she could not give up easily her dream of love a passionate undercurrent of hope still helped her to endure the tense situation trivialities of everyday life assisted her in deceiving her household she was gentle with her boy and thoughtful for old madame servants saw no change in their mistress a battle had begun and believing in the odds of destiny isabel marshalled reserve force and smiled before her little world but at heart she was frightened again and again she remembered the awful moment when she had believed her husband to be dead now she imagined the sweeter side of a withheld tragedy for would philip forget ever be the same man he had been before he went down disgraced in the eyes of a frightened throng fleeing from evil influence only a few protestants understood but these had come to the rescue bearing the prostrate stranger into open airout of the dreadful place isabel followed silently behind like a widow giving up her dead when they laid her husband down on the worn stone platform before the mission she had begged piteously not to halt an instant but a doctor stayed her anguish with the assurance of philips beating heart and she had dropped unbelieving to his side every one had been kindvery kind but it seemed hours while she waitedwaited and at last they told her that philip had only fainted all that followed was still fresh in her mind and now as days passed she found it impossible to forget vivid details of the quick departure from st barnabas of a miserable unexpected homecoming  now her main hope was her husbands book that might save him yet raise his selfrespect to normal she awaited eagerly a letter of acceptance to watch for it without appearing to do so was difficult once she had missed the postman still undoubtedly she would have heard in the event of good news and good news was sure today something seemed to cheer her in spite of philips depression perhaps it was spring glorious spring march had come in as a veritable lamb and after balmy days isabel dreaded lowering clouds and rain as long as she could drive philip over the country time must appear to pass naturally while in temporary confinement it would be harder to keep up pretenses already what is known in california as a weather breeder seemed to overcharge the senses and even as isabel left the foothills for the the homeward downgrade spin she felt a change by early evening clouds were forming above the mountains next day the sun refused to shine and by night it rained so hard that march took on an eastern temper and announced a storm isabel was disturbed at the prospect of seclusion once she had loved rain as well as sunshine but now she listened to the incessant downpour with sinking heart if only the publishers letter would come she realized anew her husbands strange condition which instead of lifting was getting worse despondency was gnawing at his selfrespect he was ill shattered beyond his own control and his wife felt powerless to call a physician for philip had been obdurate with their homecoming had refused to consult a doctor isabel feared to press the matter yet wondered if she were wise to wait perhaps philips sudden fall had been more than mere fainting the shock of public dishonor might have broken a blood vessel of his braina vessel so tiny that consciousness had soon returned she told herself that at the end of the storm she would unburden her full story to a reliable specialist then bring him to see her husband she could no longer endure the strain alone the determination brought her comfort while with the force of her definite will she began to plan for intervening hours of rain first of all the open fire of the livingroom should not die down a moment like a vestal watching her lamp she piled on wood until the dark paneled walls reflected the glow of a rising blaze then she enticed philip and reginald and madame about the hearth cheer within made compelling contrast to a dreary outside and all day long she strove to divert her husbands mind from desperate musing madame read in french or the boy manipulated toy automobiles between the rugs and when these things failed the latest liveliest music was run off on a really fine mechanical piano which until now had been practically forgotten by early bedtime the strenuous day seemed an improvement on previous ones with pensive opportunity in the open isabel was hopeful glad to believe that philip would sleep she felt weary herself and sank to rest without the usual effort of nights past and rain fell on     chapter xxxviii   very early in the morning a cloud burst flooded the valley little rivers ran on thoroughfares and town gutters widened into dashing streams isabel awakened with a start to hear the water in the arroyo seco roaring like some mad thing released rampant swollen an oncoming charge from the mountains struck a stony vent transforming a dry volcanic bed into a running torrent at intervals lightning flashed lurid sheets with distant rumbling thunder the storm had broken into alarming fury  are you awake asked isabel knowing too well that philip was not sleeping  yes he confessed shall i get up and look after the windows  she knew that he was trying to appear thoughtful she assured him that every part of the house had been made secure before retiring the two lay still listening to the tempest  isnt it frightful isabel said timidly  i like it her husband answered  the wail of the storm seemed a dirge to pent thoughts philip offered no tenderness to allay her fear and she was afraid suddenly there came a rush of wind and a blasting zigzag charge with terrible instantaneous crashing thunder the clap reverberated unchained through the mountains in a second of powerful light isabel forgot personal terror forgot everything but philips face for at last she knew the truth saw the unchecked anguish of his tortured soul it was all worse than she had thought he was illvery ill her arms went out about his neck her stored up tears fell free against his cheek isabels selfcontrol was lost she could no longer hide her fear she had waited patiently she would speak  tell me oh tell me she implored i cannot bear iti shall die if you do not tell me the secret she had caught gave her fierce strength you wish to leave me you are sorry you want to go away because you think it is a sin to love me you are miserable because you gave upleft your church everything was bursting from her like the tempest i could let you go she sobbed but i cannot believe that we have done wrong it is too cruel i cannot give you up your god never meant you to suffer alone if you go back they will make you suffernever let you forget andand you could not forget that i am your wifethat you love me  she clung to him in fear would he answer herdeny what she said you do love me she softened at the thought and kissed his forehead we love each other as god meant we should we will blot out the past live you shall be another man she was pleading her own case with philips her tears had ceased to fall we will do good jointly do something to better the world a world outside of narrow creeds and inhuman dogma she would not acknowledge the advantage of his lost opportunity individual power for accomplishment was as honorable as to bow beneath a yoke her argument had been forming through miserable days life is beautiful most beautiful when we may help others to enjoy it when your book comes out  philip sprang up tearing loose her arms then he fell back she thought again that he was dead she tried to turn on light and failed something had been struck in the garden the terrific bolt must have severed main electric wires trembling in darkness she thought of a wax taper on the dressing table and felt about for matches in a momentary flash through the window she found what she sought but she dreaded to look at philip what ifshe approached the bed then he sat up and spoke to her as one utterly despairing  never speak of the book again he implored he sank on the pillow and she waited for him to go on i should have told youforgive me he said at last the manuscript has come back  isabel burst into fresh tears she seemed powerless to remember her husbands alarming condition no no she sobbed you cannot mean itthere is some mistake the book will make you famous it cannot fail  but it has failed he answered with momentary strength they do not care to publish it it stands dishonored likethe man who wrote it  she blanched at his words come back your manuscript returned she faltered you cannot mean it where is the letter i must see it  he smiled piteously pointing to a closed desk at the other side of the room where she found the pasteboard box loosely held in brown paper the name of a prominent publishing house was stamped outside the wrapper and inside was the letter  she read reread with burning cheeksa polite commercial decision then she ran to philip her eyes were blazing with champion light her courage had returned great love for the stricken man gone down before a flood of disappointment enveloped her being the force of her wonderful nature rose up for fresh battle  darling she pleaded you are too ill to understand she caught his hand as she crept close to his side they like your bookknow that it is fine but they are afraid of the cost of publishing it the pictures have frightened them and they are too commercial to take the risk of a sumptuous volume one refusal is nothing our new friend will know the value of your work and the manuscript must go to him at once the positive current of her magnetic will the plausibility of her conviction above all her tenderness seemed a divine anodyne for philips sinking soul yet he dared not hope the shaft of disgrace had been sunk too straight he was too ill to resist remorse too weak to deny the penalty for broken vows too hopeless to defy authority which had thrust him down and trodden upon his selfrespect on the verge of fatal prostration no sins were blacker than his own darkest of all appeared a selfish love forced upon innocent isabel dishonored man that he was she must share his shame he closed his weary eyes  his wife clung to his hand but one thought possessed herto call a nerve specialist time had passed for deliberation now she would act  darling she whispered i am going to send for a doctor he protested and she went on softly pleading her right you will not stop me this time as you did when first we came home you are not well i cannot bear to see you growing worse when i might bring relief she felt him bending to her stronger nature and with streaks of day showing through an atmosphere of mist her will power seemed to be restored  he was so quiet that she believed him to be sleeping she dared not move still holding his hand thinking of all which morning might bring forth that unreasonable dread of life was beginning to threaten philips reason she did not know nor could she understand the condition of a person trained to religious conformity then suddenly cast adrift without spiritual sounding line it had not occurred to her to doubt her husbands power to live on contentedly without settled sectarian belief a religious education had not entered into her own childhood and as she grew older she formulated views and ethical standards which could not be called orthodox her mind had developed independently  what an apostate priest might suffer she could not readily divine that philip had been born with power to move his fellowmen through spoken thoughts she did not seriously consider nor did she understand that a vital preacher is distinct in his calling as she lay with closed eyesyet wide awakeshe built only on the wisdom of a specialist who shouldwho musthelp her  then suddenly philip spoke  yes dear she answered i thought you were sleeping  dont send for a doctor he pleaded let me restjust herei will soon be better his face touched her own and she felt that his eyes were moist a tear rolled down between their cheeks     chapter xxix   a lull following the tempest seemed an anodyne for broken rest philip forgot his anguish through exhaustion while isabel dropped into slumber which always restored her power to hope perfect health sustained her she clung to the determination to hold her dearly bought happiness despite discouraging odds at broad daylight she lay awake and watchful by the side of her husband through open casements the wet sweetness of the morning recharged her nerves birds twittered excitedly from drenched trees the nearby arroyo sent outward a song of drops piling over stones isabel recalled a time when she had been awakened by the musical splash of roman fountains then as now philip barry claimed her thoughts set them bounding to the irresistible measure of falling water during those days she had listened to the rhythmic call in the old palace garden only to wonder about philip and the possible outcome of their fresh young love it seemed a long way back since those ideal weeks this morning as she lay still and anxious her mind began to revert to incidental happenings which had parted a boy and a girl but to join them later under tense conditions she turned with caution and peered into philips face his secret had touched his countenance with unconscious despair his cheeks were growing hollow around his compressed mouth isabel saw deepening lines she felt again that her husband could be saved only with the help of a discerning specialist time seemed precious and she slipped softly from the sleepers side to her own room it was early for a bath but her firm young flesh cried out for refreshment as she plunged into cool water strength came as the result of a regular habit and she dressed quickly then went below only wing the chinese cook was at his post maids kept awake by the storm had overslept isabel wandered through a closed house to find her faithful celestial already at work his white garments noiseless shoes and optimistic smile always gave her pleasure good morning she said  wing turned in evident dismay why you up so early he asked with the childlike freedom of the oriental those girls heap lazy not come down yethouse all dark he spread his slender brown hands in feigned disgust i gless you not know that big tree fall over las night most hit my klitchen you come see he threw open the screen pointing beyond isabel saw a monterey pine low and done for by the storm heavy drenched branches crushed and aromatic rose from the ground to the top of a nearby porch which had just escaped them years of growth and vigor were down with a blast from the surcharged sky she seemed to feel the human significance of the fallen pine  poor thing she exclaimed peering into upturned limbs of the vanquished tree poor thing  wing beamed his white teeth flashed credulous interest you think that tree get hurtall same me he demanded isabel saw that she was planting fresh superstition on celestial soil  i am not quite sure she answered still a great tree could hardly tear away from earth without feeling it it must have suffered she maintained unconsciously she was thinking of her husband that philip had been uprooted cast down like the pine filled her with dread as she went quickly from the kitchen but the storm which left the house in total darkness during the night had also interfered with telephone service after vain attempts to communicate with the central office she dashed off a note to a wellknown nerve specialist she begged him to come at once explaining that her husband was too ill to leave his bed from the terrace she watched the gardener depart with her note she felt at last like one who stakes all on a final venture would the doctor come soon would philip resent the visit above all how should she break the news to the invalid who begged to be left alone dont call a doctor he had pleaded and again she wondered if she had been wise in a grave emergency the house was now astir belated maids were at work soon shrill exclamations arose from the wet garden madame had discovered the fallen pine to fly below with the boy reginald was proudly equipped with rubber boots his red coat flashed as he outran his excited companion isabel translated the french womans lament for the lost tree then the boy cried out in distress his mother reached his side to find him in tears holding a dead oriole the once gay golden little creature lay limp in the childs hand  poor birdy see hes all all broken he bemoaned cant you mend him mother dear cant you make him stand up  he has been hurt by the storm isabel explained stroking the feathers of the little victim perhaps he lived in the pine tree we may find his nest  reginald began to search along the path while isabel found a sharpened stick when she came to a clump of ferns she bent and quickly dug a tiny bed in the wet earth her son running back saw that the oriole was gone  there wasnt any nest he shouted gazing incredulously at his mothers empty hand and i suppose the poor birdys all mended why didnt you wait i wantedi wanted to see him fly away fresh tears betokened the boys disappointment isabel felt justified in the deception as she led the child indoors he would understand soon enough  wing had just brought back a dainty tray with everything on it declined by the master the good fellow was greatly distressed boss not eathe die sure he muttered  isabel went above she felt again that she had done right in calling a physician and strove for courage to announce the approaching visit when she entered her husbands room he seemed to be dozing she did not rouse him perhaps after all sleep would prove to be philips best medicine and something whispered that her apparent anxiety was not good for the broken man she loved she went out acknowledging a mistake when philip awoke she would tell him about the doctor with incidental lightness then sooner than she expected she heard an automobile and knew that her note had been timely the specialist was at handin the hall below she could not prepare philip for an unwelcome call but she was eager to unburden her heart willing to rest her fear with one who ought to assume it and at once she told of her husbands early education of the first success of his priesthood of his ambition for a great middle west cathedral of the bishops unjust course of philips natural struggle followed with excommunication from the church then all too soonbefore he could readjust his lifeof the public humiliation in the old mission she kept nothing back but her own hard part as the wife of an apostate priest the dread that she had been the sole cause of a brilliant mans undoing she bravely acknowledged philip could not forget could not supplement his relinquished work with domestic happiness  yet he adores me she confessed it is not just that he should sufferas he does his heart is breaking he feels it a sin to love meto go on with happiness  and you said dr judkin  she tried to smile women can bear more than men her voice broke  the man by her side felt her charm knew that she was valiant in love still he saw disappointment in her tense resistance i am afraid that you too will soon need attention he abruptly told her sometimes a wife spoils her husband without realizing it men who think a great deal about themselves are not considerate  she was offended and replied coldly you do not know him it is unjust to judge of a patient before you have seen him  i stand reproved the doctor admitted  isabel forgave him his very bluntness brought her hope suddenly she felt faith in the man whom she had summoned she believed that he was masterful and she must turn to some one  please come she invited you shall see my husband  dr judkin stood aside for her to pass and she went above choosing words which should explain his early call then at the top of the staircase she stopped  be good enough to wait she begged i must prepare himgo in first then she flew forward for the smell of burning paper had caught her nostrils the door to philips apartment was fastened she had been locked out she rushed to a balcony running before the windows of her husbands room in an instant she stood within and she had not come a moment too soon a fresh tragedy faced her she hardly breathed philip on his knees in front of the fireplace did not hear her enter the ecstasy of delirium possessed him his whole body trembled as he showered an igniting pile with his rejected manuscript the spirit of the cathedral was smoking isabel saw rising flame desert a blackened sketch of a famous duomo but to lick a painting of great st peters once more dominant romish power appeared to threaten the curse of the church seemed about to blaze anew for philip  her heart thumped as she flew to his side how can you she pleaded you have forgotten your friendwho trusted you you must not spoil his beautiful pictures her hand reached out and coolly rescued scorching sheets of the unpublished book but you did not mean to hurt an artists work she gently added she held a ruined sketch before the sick mans staring eyes you did not remember you did not mean to be unfair to your friend the tenderness of her frightened loving soul broke over the shattered man as she led him away to bed he went like an obedient child then she unlocked the door and summoned the doctor     chapter xxx   two trained nurses had been installed isabel no longer held her place at philips bedside she was virtually banished from her husbands room the courage which she had evinced during previous weeks seemed to be going fast now she hardly dared to hope a silent house already took on the atmosphere of disaster even reginald was not permitted to shout in the garden and withal spring was at hand seemingly to brighten the whole world outside of philips closed apartments the sap of fresh life ran in the veins of every living thing in the valley on the foothills above in the mountains the season had advanced without a check while throughout the southwest blooming fruit trees and millions of roses prepared the land for easter  to isabel sensuous beauty on every side seemed cruel her heart felt desolate she went through each day wishing for night while with darkness she longed for sunlight suspense was beginning to drain her vitality she did not complain but the doctor saw her brace herself against each discouraging outcome of days that dragged for philips last collapse had turned her from his side she was barely a memory to the man she loved at first she had rebelled then accepted conditions enjoined by dr judkin and consulting specialists only one thing helped her to endure the strain of a cruel separation  philips booknow speaking to her heart as she knew it would speakbrought strange proud comfort she felt exalted that shehis wifehad saved the manuscript from the flames during a week she fairly lived in the scorched pages of the spirit of the cathedral and gradually she began to see why the work had been refused personal feeling and blind enthusiasm were at last tempered she could read with a cool intellect the laodicean attitude of a shrewd publisher hurt her less than at first for the fact still remained that philip had produced something fine although he occasionally dropped his impassioned theme to give vent to slight discord nothing had really been lost from his original motif reading between the lines isabel detected the natural temptation under which he had worked certain paragraphs all unaided by a magnetic voice and delivery read too much like his former sermons sometimes overcharged almost vindictive handling of romish background was evident in those first weeks in paris after he had deserted the priesthood and been cast out of the church he had written without restraint he had said things best left unsaid yet as isabel read on she marvelled at philips virile touch at the masterful dramatic power of his pen his word pictures drawn from vivid exceptional opportunity required no literal illustration still she studied the sketches of the associate artist finally selecting one fourth of the cathedrals submitted then she read over again the stronger chapters of the singed manuscript it was late into night before she weighed the possible chances of her husbands book he had labored so intelligently that her hand seemed to be guided by his own as she omitted paragraphs which undoubtedly influenced the publishers to refuse a somewhat prejudiced work  isabel felt free to decide for philip his extremity excused her arbitrary action she was sure that in his normal condition he would agree to all that she had done when scorched pages had been replaced by fresh ones she would send the revised manuscript to the publisher she had met at st barnabas the one who had witnessed the withstayed tragedy in the mission she believed that her new friend could appreciate the significance of a book written by one who not only criticised expertly but knew as well the human side of a great cathedral her thoughts went back to a time when philipa priesthad outlined plans for the noble church he hoped to build then nothing seemed too big for his young city isabel smiled and began to read once more  suddenly tears came to her eyes she put aside the manuscript after all what right had she to tamper with her husbands work from philips higher standpoint painted or stone saints and angels looking down from gothic heights meant nothing to her outside of their mere artistic value she saw with fresh dread that philip was still a catholic early education and his lost mothers devout influence kept him apart from natural happiness he should have remained a priest a power in his church she remembered how once she had stood with him in st petersin front of the pieta he had then almost forgotten her presence the wrapt significance of his expression ought to have warned her she felt once more that she would never be able to share her husbands feeling for an old masters sacred ideal and later when the two were passing the noted bronze of st peter she recalled that she had failed to hide her repulsion for the throng straining to kiss the statues jutting shining toe philip divined her thoughts and flushed it comforts them he had whispered over here the poor have so little in their lives what seems absurd to you is for them salvation  tonight isabel remembered everything now bearing on her husbands tragic state her heart grew heavy with fear with vague foreboding     chapter xxxi   philips physical condition had improved during six weeks of masterful nursing isabel was at last permitted to see him for ten short minutes then she kept her promise and went from the room this morning she sank into a chair mutely listening to the doctors voice  he has come out much better than i expected he confessed our nurses have left nothing undone the patient has responded to the limit of his burneddown condition we shall save him  she lifted a face wet with tears oh she begged may i helpdo some little thing i have waited so long it has been hard hard to see other women always at his side when his wife might not even give him a glass of water  rebellion which she had hidden through past days burst forth may i not let one of the nurses go i long to do my natural part  dr judkin stopped pacing listen to me he commanded she braced herself for fresh disappointment knowing well the superior wisdom of the mans despotic practice listen he repeated you have already done what few women can dosubmitted magnificently to a passive part and you have helped me more than you will ever know she felt a new demand back of his words now is the crucial test of your will power i have been waiting anxiously for this particular point in your husbands case the physical collapse has been arrested and he is now ready for a complete change of scene he needs a sea voyage with continued quiet but nothing familiar to arouse consciousness of past events  oh she cried i may take him abroad perhaps to japan i can go to any part of the world which you think best for him her voice rang joy color ran into her cheeks you have been so good to meso patient with my own impatience and i knew that you could save him something told me that first awful morning that you would help me that you would be my friend  the doctor stood powerless to tell her his real decision through weeks he had felt the passionate suffering beneath her wellbred composure character had stilled her bursting heart he frowned looking down at a pattern in the rug  you have not quite understood me he said at last the change of which i speak must be absolute entirely outside ofoftempting association as yet the patient must sink reviving interest in life to the dead level of his nurse to the advent of meals served on the deck of a quiet ship  you mean that i should engage a private yacht isabel eagerly asked i know of one owned by a friend who will let me have it shall i wire at once  again the man by her side was baffled of late his brusque announcements had perceptibly softened today knowing as only a physician does the tragedy of certain marital relations this womans great love rebuked his ruthless plan still he must speak make a professional edict clear but you are not to accompany your husband he abruptly told her you might undo the work of weeks make the patients ultimate recovery doubtful  his words came hard plain isabel sat stunned and silent  philip barry will come back from his voyage another man the doctor deliberately promised and the separation will not be as hard as it now seems after the fight for your husbands life and reason you may feel that we are about to conquer tahitithe isle of restwill restore him wholly  isabel did not answer only tightly clasped hands betrayed her agitation the doctor went on  i have taken the voyage to tahiti myself five years ago i was a nervous wreck when i sailed from san francisco twentyone days later when i landed at the society islands at tahiti i was a new man weeks on the water without a word from the world behind me had worked a miracle on the upper deck of the comfortable little ship i forgot my troubles through pure joy of existence all day long i rested body and brain with evening the bloodred sun plunged into a molten sea then blue sky suddenly changed to violet and deepening shadow brought out the starsthe southern cross i began to feel like a different person  an eloquent outburst awakened no response the doctor saw that he must speak decidedly his next words fell with brutal authority  your husband must be made ready to start for san francisco at once a boat leaves port los angeles day after tomorrow it is best that our patient should avoid the train and in going by water he will have half a day and a night to rest in some good hotel the ship sails at noonon the seventeenth  he was beginning to think that mrs barrys silence meant compliance resignation seemed to be a part of her marvelous character and at last she unclasped her hands pressing them before her eyes but he heard her gently sobbing  dont he humbly entreated you must not forget what i have promised you shall have your husband backwell he will put all behind him forget everything but his wife  she did not answer dr judkin waited until her hands left her eyes then she began to speak with fresh determination  why can i not go too on the same boat just to be near him in case he needs me i should not let him know that i was on board not make even a signunlesshe missed me oh let me go with him it is not fair that another woman should have my placemy absolute right to be near him he is my husband i cannot bear it  tempered passion could no longer conceal her feeling she was blazing with jealous rebellion for the time being the nurse who had given satisfaction was an enemya woman usurping the place of philips wife yet the specialist knew that she would submit she loved too perfectly to withstand reason suddenly he saw his way out of a tense situation  i had forgotten to tell you he interrupted i am going to send my assistant dr ward our patient is so much better that it seems to be time for an absolute change even in regard to his nurse when philip barry returns he will be another man dr ward is the best of company a splendid fellow with rare common sense he saw her tremble we will engage a special ship steward to assist and everything shall be done for your husbands comfort  her face lifted like a smitten flower the blaze in her eyes subsided she looked into the doctors face as a conquered child i have been very weakvery unreasonable she faltered now i will do everything that you think bestmake you no more trouble she tried to laugh i am going to be goodgood like reg  then we shall get out of the woods he answered and mindyou are not to grow thin while philip barry grows fat in tahiti if you are really going to be good you must relax put away anxiety when philip comes home he must see you in the height of bloom i first want you to go to bed at least for a week then you may take to the saddle cultivate friends enjoy yourself as every one should in gods countryin springtime  today dr judkin seemed pleased with the world his patient was more than promising while mrs barry appealed to him irresistibly he put out his hand doggedly determined to save her husband keep a brave heart he prescribed everything is now going our way  but once outside he asked himself if courage such as isabels deserved the test of possible disappointment what after all must be the outcome of philip barrys recovery would he realize fresh obligation to a womans almost divine love would he be able to put out of his own life withering emotions of regret dr judkin had not known his patient before the total collapse of weeks back and he could not consistently answer hard questions to vouch for the mans future behavior was after all impossible and yet he had just promised isabel to save him for years to come the futility of finite judgment the mistakes of theoretical practice the guesswork involved in a case such as barrys tempered the specialists confidence he went flying on his way depressed then he remembered that isabel seemed to be an absolute exception to many of the wives belonging to her apparently enviable station she gave out for joy of giving love such as hers refused to be measured by modern standards or a husbands limitations     chapter xxxii   isabel was parted from philip she had watched him sail from port los angeles then quickly entered a waiting touring car dr judkins fears were groundless as the homeward trip had proved to be pleasant almost like a vent for the wifes tense feeling it was clear that she had staked everything on her husbands ocean voyage despite a hard separation she was hopeful she seemed determined to accept present conditions meanwhile living for the fulfillment of happier months to come  and with her usual force she at once began to engage in active matters dr judkins injunction to rest was forgotten she seemed to be suddenly strong the doctors rash promise intoxicated her philip just gone was dearer than ever she said over and over that he would come back well able to respond to fresh opportunities he should find them waiting and friends too it was yet early in the day isabel dressed carefully ordered her carriage and went forth to pay visits new acquaintances must see that she was not a crushed wife she wanted to tell every one that her husband was getting better the splendid pride of her young nature rose up for conquest pity was not for isabel and after a pleasant outing she returned to find the house withal more cheerful than for weeks back nurses had gone and reginalds unrestrained shouts echoed at will  mother darling mother darling the little fellow had cried how pretty your dress is have you been getting married this afternoon please read me a story like you used to he demanded  i will tell you one isabel said gently then she gathered her son in her arms his head rested against her breast as she began to tell him about faraway tahiti she colored a simple narrative until it glowed with personal interest the boy listened happily a little brown hand held her own fairer one turning her jeweled rings while she pictured father philips boat the island in the middle of the ocean native boys and girls selling garlands the possibility of whales of flying fish and everything else that naturally belonged to the story with philip as her hero isabel felt able to spin indefinite situations for sea or land spring twilight seemed to cast its spell over mother and son the english nurse came twice before the tale of tahiti was finished reginald unmindful of a supper of bread and milk paid no heed to an invitation and for some new reason isabel encouraged her boy to disregard hitherto accepted authority  when i have eated a lot and get all weddy for bed ill come back the little fellow at last promised i want some more lapping and another story about the big whales then ill say my french prayer he hopped away on one leg isabel heard his voice piping triumph im coming back im coming back goody goody she said i might then the door closed  isabel sat on thinking of past silent weeks asking herself if her boy had not been harshly treated dear little chap he might now make noise later the child kept his word rushing down in night clothes for his good night lapping for one more story after all time was passing and tomorrow philip would be in san francisco then by noon of the next day he would sail for tahiti isabel decided once more to keep her mind employed during her husbands absence madame pined to play cribbage and evening was well spent before the two friends bade each other good night the old french woman had won several rubbers and retired in high spirits while the younger one went softly to her boys bedside  as usual reginald lay tucked in his white nest on an upper balcony a half moon shut out by falling canvas shot beams across a screen of interlacing vines the sleeping boy was bathed in radiance his arms rested outside the covers and one little brown hand still held a toy locomotive isabel bent and touched her sons soft brow his relaxed beauty thrilled her as often before the boy reminded her of bellinis sleeping childthe one lying across the madonnas lapin the academy at venice she had boldly rebelled that the wonderful picture was unstarred in the great masters collection of holy children tonight her motherheart still deplored an arbitrary test of art she drew aside a curtain gazing upward to the sky a star too brilliant for the moons effacement looked down while seemingly no erring human judgment could check a heavenly tribute to her sleeping boy she went from his side strangely happy but she did not enter philips closed room rather she desired to shut out those weeks of torture and anxiety she thought of dr judkins rash promise of the time when her husband would come back well of his book which she had fortunately saved from the flames and it was now time to hear definitely from the manuscript almost four weeks since it had gone upon its journey eastward the publisher had written at once announcing his interest in philips work yet of course the matter could not be decided too hastily isabel had waited patiently now that she was alone it seemed harder to endure a new kind of suspense what if the manuscript came back no no that must not happen not again she dared not dwell on a crushing possibility and went to bed driving the thought from her after all she would accept dr judkins advice and take to the saddle she would ride tomorrowthroughout the bright spring morning miss lewis who had fortunately returned to town should use one of the horses then perhaps gay could stop for a short visitstay until after philips boat had sailed she buried her face in the pillow     chapter xxxiii   miss lewis was pleased to accept a welcome invitation next morning the two friends mounted early for a canter through the valley isabel rode her husbands horse while gay exulted over the restive temper of mrs barrys more spirited animal  you darling she cried when finally she controlled the pretty creature too keen for a race afterward the thoroughbreds from the foothills went side by side miss lewis was in high spirits love of action seemed to be expressed in every line of her trim little figure isabel felt the charm of her friends free grace and dashed forward with unchecked speed a long avenue lined with palms towering eucalyptus trees and draping peppers reached for miles across the valley dressed for aprils carnival the air was intoxicating millions of flowersroses climbing climbing seemed to blaze a sacrifice to spring isabels heart lightened with the glory of the day for the time being she forgot that tomorrow was the seventeenth that philip was about to enter the golden gate about to spend a few last hours in san francisco before sailing on his long voyage fortunately escaped her mind quick to understand miss lewis led the way she dashed onward for an hour then nearer mountains appeared to turn for a fresh landscape all at once remote giant snowclad peaks became the center of the horizon lifting from acres of darkgreen orange groves flecked with golden fruit and snowy blossoms gay dropped from the saddle while her horse began to graze by the roadside mrs barry kept her mount with loosened bridle they had gone a long distance into the valley the spell of spring was upon them both  it is all too lovely for earth cried gay  too lovely for sorrow and disappointment isabel answered a shadow passed over her face she was at last thinking of philip  miss lewis impulsively drew in her horse springing to her seat like a boy come on she begged i have something else to show you she stripped off her glove holding up her hand is it not a beauty a black opal surrounded with canary diamonds flashed in sunlight i chose the ring myself she confessed i have always been wild over black opals have always intended to have one when i settled down for life she laughed and dashed onward  tell me all about him isabel called out i am so glad that you are happy i cannot waitdo tell me  the horses were now walking side by side miss lewis leaned shaking over the pommel of her saddle who said there was a man in the story she demanded how quickly you arrive at conclusions did i not say that i chose the ring myself but i will tell you she turned lightly to her friend my engagement is another case of marjory daw there isnt any suitor only a ranch of six hundred acres on which i intend to live the greater part of the year i am crazy about it the papers are being prepared and as soon as i have full possession i shall build a bungalow a barn and a garage my black opal simply means that i am engaged to my new estate that i am going to be the happiest bachelor girl in southern california she laughed gaily starting her horse on a run come on come on she called  they dashed miles across the country before they turned for home isabel had no opportunity for pensive thoughts the sun had touched the zenith when the thoroughbreds stood in their stalls luncheon waited for two hungry women  suddenly a longdistance call summoned isabel to the telephone she left the table vaguely conscious of fresh trouble the receiver trembled in her hand she could hardly control herself but soon she was listening in rapture from faraway san francisco a familiar voice vibrated over the wireher husband spoke to her catch the owltonightjoin me tomorrowat the dock he implored she heard him distinctly attempted to answer when the connection broke again and again the operator tried to restore the line communication with philip was hopelessly lost the disappointment seemed more than isabel could endure and she buried her face and wept the voice of the man she loved still rang out in her imagination she heard him commanding begging her to come i will i will she answered she seemed almost to be repeating their marriage service dear dear husband i am coming no power on earth shall keep me from you she laughed softly as she again caught the receiver  give me one six double three she entreated she hardly breathed while she waited a womans voice said dr judkins office and isabel announced herself the doctor is occupied with a patienthe cannot be interrupted will you please give me your message the attendant answered  he must comeat once i cannot wait isabel begged tell him that mrs barry wishes to speak with him he will understand i cannot lose a moment i am going north to join my husband her words rang with decision she no longer trembled and her tears had been dashed away her cheeks burned in the little closet where she tarried an electric bulb blazed no brighter than her eyes why did the doctor not come why after all had she asked for him was she not going to philip at once there was indeed no time to lose if she packed for a voyage and caught the evening train in los angeles for san francisco her heart thumped like a triphammer as she sat clutching the receiver now fairly glued to her ear and at last she recognized the voice of dr judkin and repeated her previous statement  im going north tonighton the owlto philip he wants me he has just telephoned a longdistance message i am to join him tomorrowat the dock her voice fairly danced why do you not answer she implored you surely understand  my poor poor child she heard at last would you ruin all that we have done you must not go emphatically you must not sail with your husband the receiver dropped her head went forward against her arms crossed on the table but she could not weep the luxury of tears was beyond her strength to shed them when she lifted her head she was in the dark the electric bulb had burned out and next day at the same hour in the same spot she first heard of the earthquake of the total destruction of san francisco     chapter xxxiv   time dragged for isabel like every one else with friends in the north she tried in vain to hear directly from san francisco communication had been completely cut off for the illfated city wrecked now burning above the useless bay isabel sat for hours listening and waiting still no word from philip the sound of his faraway voice his last request asking her to come to him echoed in her brain she felt that she might lose her reason all the fine courage of weeks back was gone dr judkin miss lewis and old madame each tried in turn to allay her fear she could not hope the only person whose sympathy seemed to be of value was coles for the man from the foothills offered to go north and hunt for philip ill get into the city some way he promised if mr barrys on land ill find him isabel would have accepted the warmhearted offer but for dr judkin ten chances to one your husband was on shipboard before the earthquake took place he stoutly maintained i know that dr ward had at first intended spending the night at the st francis then he changed his plan deciding to get his patient settled as soon as possible in the steamers cabin he feared the excitement of the hotel and felt sure that the tahiti boat would be lying at anchor isabel did not reply and he went on suspense is hard to endure but i rely on you to wait a few days longer when we are then sure to hear something while flames are raging in the streets with dynamite blowing up blocks of buildings we cannot hope for reliable information but one thing is certaindr ward is going to take care of philip barry if the two men are not out at sea they are simply unable to let us know of their safety on account of both martial law and prevailing conditions  i should have gone to him when he called me isabel answered then i would have been therewhen it happened oh why did you keep me from going for the first time dr judkin felt unable to control his patients wife she was like another woman refusing to accept either advice or sympathy even the boy was now forgotten but remembering the long previous strain to which she had been subjected he forgave her he realized the strength of her love while he considered every available means for reaching the burning city at once finally he could no longer resist isabels mute pleading outside of professional obligation he seemed to see that she had suffered enough  i will go myselffind out where he is he offered impulsively he stood looking down at philip barrys wife a special train for newspaper men leaves for the north tonight i can go as a surgeon ill try my best to make you happyas i promised to do he humbly added there was a lump in his throat and he went out isabel stunned with gratitude could not speak could not thank him but her face shone with the old courage of weeks back lived through for philips sake  the next day and the day after she went about the house as usual thinking of others trying not to brood reginald enjoyed his evening petting and in every way his mother seemed to be the same then gradually the late catastrophe became less fatal as time went by for at last reliable news was beginning to come in from the illfated city still burning yet under absolute martial law thousands were now reported to be safe though homeless in the parks and upon higher undamaged ground beyond the region of flames relief trains had gone out on all the railroads a few of them were now returning packed with frightened hungry refugees and every one in the south seemed to be helping the call for clothing for unfortunates had been answered generally isabel found strange comfort in sorting over her wardrobe in giving useful parts of it away everything suitable for the dire occasion was gladly offered action restored her in helping others she helped herself her generosity grew contagious throughout the household madame and the maids brought halfworn garments to swell the size of her own complete pile even thrifty wing became duly exercised over the sad condition of countrymen driven from san franciscos chinatown he talked incessantly of the prevalent heathen version of the earthquake which involved the rage of an old black cow beneath the surface one morning he rushed out of the kitchen in fresh excitement a cousin from the north had just arrived transported south in a cattle car filled with other celestials wings face reflected the situation as he burst forth with the story of his friends lucky escape isabel sitting alone encouraged him to speak  my cousin velly sad now he lose he businesshe so poor what you think plaps i take him lectic cargo that veniceall same dleam wing referred to a seaside resort nearby  mrs barry nodded you may have the day for your outing she told him kindly one of the maids

seventeen time that old black cow kick up under that gleat san flancisco that old cow never so mad udder time  isabel appreciated the heathen myth but her soul sank as she thought of philip where was

sick inside he heart cannot forget  by all means take him to venice isabel advised and later she watched the pair go forth from the garden wings vivid description of the catastrophe lived in her memory all day but she tried to control herself tried to believe that good news would soon come from dr judkin then in the afternoon a messenger boy brought a despatch she tore open the envelope hardly daring to look within but she nerved herself and read your husbands manuscript accepted for magazine also for book form philips friendthe editorhad signed the golden message     chapter xxxv   isabel held the telegram to her lips she seemed to be kissing philip dear dear husband i knew i knew she softly murmured the rest of the day she wandered about the garden almost in an ecstacy of expectation something seemed to tell her that philip was safe that she would hear from him but evening shadows fell without a personal word from the north she was obliged to content herself by reading the evening papers which were beginning to contradict certain overwhelming statements of days back the hotel that had totally collapsed was now known to have been poorly built and was not the st francis as formerly stated iron frames of many buildings had withstood the earthquake to go down at last before dynamite still the list of dead and wounded would be a long one nothing could be definitely settled until after flames had ceased to lick through deserted streets suffering was intense on every side children had first seen the world under its open sky women without beds to lie upon had given birth in the open yet it seemed to be a time when the best part of human nature revealed a noble side already hope was beginning to stir in camps where ruined families clung lovingly together isabels eyes grew moist as she read a thrilling story of heroism and courage  miss lewis had gone back to the hotel and when madame complaining of a headache kept her room isabel found herself alone but one thought now absorbed her mind every moment she hoped for a telegram from dr judkin then suddenly wing again stood before her he had returned from his days outing and his countenance shone elate evidently he had fulfilled a purpose and brought new strength to the fainting heart of his unfortunate friend as in the morning isabel encouraged him to talk  i come tell youclause you so solly he began plitty soon i sure you hear you husblandall safe people say not so many kill after all boss all light i sure  he tried to render sympathy and his attempt was not repulsed and you took your cousin to venice mrs barry kindly questioned  wing shrugged his shoulders and shook his head he had lately cut off his cue and now stood politely with a gray fedora hat in one hand jus this way he explained i decidenot take my cousin that veniceall same dleam too much expense i say more better not fool money these hard time i count up must spend twodollarhalfgo that

keenest interest at another time she might have found it difficult to control her countenance tonight she could not laugh almost for the first time she realized the meaning of the brotherhood of man she found her purse and sent a liberal donation to celestials lately en route in the cattle car relieve your friends as much as possible she commanded you may take tomorrow off and spend the money as you see best those of us who can must help  the simple kindness of her words fell clearly wing went out from her presence as one entrusted with a grave commission she sat on with her thoughts  suddenly she was depressed beyond all control joined to her longing for philip was the dread that he would never be able to forget that he had once been a catholic and a priest of the church and she had made him forsake his calling again and again she repeated the publishers telegram aloud she tried to tell herself that when philip came back he must see his way at once to go on with life he would find his work appreciated his book accepted then he would surely continue to writebecome noted yet perhaps authorship might not satisfy him the man who formerly moved large audiences with his impassioned sermons might not after all make a success in literature she recalled the first time that she had heard philip address a congregation his clear eloquent handling of a great ethical subject had delighted her sitting in a pew with devout catholics she had been glad to forget the high mass which she did not understand and follow the speaker in the pulpit she had felt that her former lover still her friend had found his natural profession for even before ordination philiptoo young for a priestwas permitted to preach  tonight isabels thoughts wandered back to an earlier sunday in venicein st markswhen they had gone together to vespers philip had then jestingly declared that but for her he would go into the church i would like to preach at least one sermon as compelling as the one we have just heard he told her as they floated away in their gondola now his old words passed through her mind a strange humility possessed her again she lived over those happy youthful days in venice still of all the churches abroad of all the services she had witnessed san marco with the afternoon in question stood out apart from other romish background at the time isabel caught a new view of the catholic church in europe for at midsummer vespers there had hardly been a suggestion of the pomp and ceremony which on stated occasions is supposed to make st mark turn over in his coffin when clouds of incense pour through open doors into the piazza  on that august evening all had been so simpleeven without a vested choir informality prevailed throughout the humble audience every one moved his chair at will to the side of some friend women used their fans and whispered discreetly to one another there were few sunday hats dark uncovered heads and black crape shawls richly fringed worn corner wise as only venetian maids can wear them discounted tawdry finery young men and little children sat on the pulpit steps every one sang from the heart wonderful italian voices rose in natural harmony then at last the patriarchal shepherd of the gathered flock came slowly forward the beautiful old man wore no embroidered vestments on that summers afternoon sheer spotless white showing but a line of scarlet beneath the lace around his hands alone defined ecclesiastical rank yet he was strangely grand in the evening light of the golden church a loving hush pervaded san marco as he leaned over the pulpit looking down upon his children isabel had never forgotten either the sermon or the marvelous voice of the speaker  tonight it came to her that to be able to guide ones fellowmen to higher ideals through spoken words was after all a godgiven gift and she had ruined philips opportunity she asked herself a hard question if he came back with his heart still turning to a natural calling could she help him at last she felt his inborn tendency the early religious background which influenced his temperament things entirely outside of her own experience had always been vital to the man she loved if he came back to her uncertain and wavering in view of returning health and implied difficult conditions she must give him up at last the situation seemed plain but she was bitter withal philips god was hard she could not understand the miserable decision forced upon her as she sat alone  twice she tried to go above to bed yet something held her hours wore on she felt cold and started a fire the heat from the hearth sent her into heavy desperate slumber she heard no sound philip entered softly and alone for dr judkin had hurried away                                       and as he waitedtransfixed he thought of that other night when he had stood outside the curtains looking in at the woman he dared not touch then slowly isabel opened her eyes saw that her husband had come felt that a miracle had restored his power to love renunciation of a dark hour was forgotten in a low glad cry philip held her as never before the strength of his arms made her dumb with joy she could not speak her husband led her to the divan and she listened to his voice his words she heard him entreat her to forgive to live anew  she felt that natures rending soul had tried their appealed case to enjoin his human need humility charged his fresh purpose as he tenderly pleaded for time to prove the revelation of terrible days back  later when she told him about the acceptance of his book he listened incredulously  suddenly he understood you kept it from deserved oblivion he said at last a fond smile played on his lips what have you not done for me he kissed away her denial of all personal influence take me back on trust he implored i ask only for the stimulant of your faith then perhapsperhaps i may please you do something worth while  isabel knew that his secularization had been sanctioned by the higher court the years to come held glad significance for them both
