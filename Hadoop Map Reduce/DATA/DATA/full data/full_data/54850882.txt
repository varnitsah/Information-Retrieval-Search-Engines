henry d thoreau       1863        contents     biographical sketch    natural history of massachusetts    a walk to wachusett    the landlord    a winter walk    the succession of forest trees    walking    autumnal tints    wild apples    night and moonlight     biographical sketch  by rw emerson  henry david thoreau was the last male descendant of a french ancestor who came to this country from the isle of guernsey his character exhibited occasional traits drawn from this blood in singular combination with a very strong saxon genius  he was born in concord massachusetts on the 12th of july 1817 he was graduated at harvard college in 1837 but without any literary distinction an iconoclast in literature he seldom thanked colleges for their service to him holding them in small esteem whilst yet his debt to them was important after leaving the university he joined his brother in teaching a private school which he soon renounced his father was a manufacturer of leadpencils and henry applied himself for a time to this craft believing he could make a better pencil than was then in use after completing his experiments he exhibited his work to chemists and artists in boston and having obtained their certificates to its excellence and to its equality with the best london manufacture he returned home contented his friends congratulated him that he had now opened his way to fortune but he replied that he should never make another pencil why should i i would not do again what i have done once he resumed his endless walks and miscellaneous studies making every day some new acquaintance with nature though as yet never speaking of zoölogy or botany since though very studious of natural facts he was incurious of technical and textual science  at this time a strong healthy youth fresh from college whilst all his companions were choosing their profession or eager to begin some lucrative employment it was inevitable that his thoughts should be exercised on the same question and it required rare decision to refuse all the accustomed paths and keep his solitary freedom at the cost of disappointing the natural expectations of his family and friends all the more difficult that he had a perfect probity was exact in securing his own independence and in holding every man to the like duty but thoreau never faltered he was a born protestant he declined to give up his large ambition of knowledge and action for any narrow craft or profession aiming at a much more comprehensive calling the art of living well if he slighted and defied the opinions of others it was only that he was more intent to reconcile his practice with his own belief never idle or selfindulgent he preferred when he wanted money earning it by some piece of manual labor agreeable to him as building a boat or a fence planting grafting surveying or other short work to any long engagements with his hardy habits and few wants his skill in woodcraft and his powerful arithmetic he was very competent to live in any part of the world it would cost him less time to supply his wants than another he was therefore secure of his leisure  a natural skill for mensuration growing out of his mathematical knowledge and his habit of ascertaining the measures and distances of objects which interested him the size of trees the depth and extent of ponds and rivers the height of mountains and the airline distance of his favorite summitsthis and his intimate knowledge of the territory about concord made him drift into the profession of landsurveyor it had the advantage for him that it led him continually into new and secluded grounds and helped his studies of nature his accuracy and skill in this work were readily appreciated and he found all the employment he wanted  he could easily solve the problems of the surveyor but he was daily beset with graver questions which he manfully confronted he interrogated every custom and wished to settle all his practice on an ideal foundation he was a protestant à loutrance and few lives contain so many renunciations he was bred to no profession he never married he lived alone he never went to church he never voted he refused to pay a tax to the state he ate no flesh he drank no wine he never knew the use of tobacco and though a naturalist he used neither trap nor gun he chose wisely no doubt for himself to be the bachelor of thought and nature he had no talent for wealth and knew how to be poor without the least hint of squalor or inelegance perhaps he fell into his way of living without forecasting it much but approved it with later wisdom  i am often reminded he wrote in his journal that if i had bestowed on me the wealth of croesus my aims must be still the same and my means essentially the same he had no temptations to fight againstno appetites no passions no taste for elegant trifles a fine house dress the manners and talk of highly cultivated people were all thrown away on him he much preferred a good indian and considered these refinements as impediments to conversation wishing to meet his companion on the simplest terms he declined invitations to dinnerparties because there each was in every ones way and he could not meet the individuals to any purpose they make their pride he said in making their dinner cost much i make my pride in making my dinner cost little when asked at table what dish he preferred he answered the nearest he did not like the taste of wine and never had a vice in his life he saidi have a faint recollection of pleasure derived from smoking dried lilystems before i was a man i had commonly a supply of these i have never smoked anything more noxious  he chose to be rich by making his wants few and supplying them himself in his travels he used the railroad only to get over so much country as was unimportant to the present purpose walking hundreds of miles avoiding taverns buying a lodging in farmers and fishermens houses as cheaper and more agreeable to him and because there he could better find the men and the information he wanted  there was somewhat military in his nature not to be subdued always manly and able but rarely tender as if he did not feel himself except in opposition he wanted a fallacy to expose a blunder to pillory i may say required a little sense of victory a roll of the drum to call his powers into full exercise it cost him nothing to say no indeed he found it much easier than to say yes it seemed as if his first instinct on hearing a proposition was to controvert it so impatient was he of the limitations of our daily thought this habit of course is a little chilling to the social affections and though the companion would in the end acquit him of any malice or untruth yet it mars conversation hence no equal companion stood in affectionate relations with one so pure and guileless i love henry said one of his friends but i cannot like him and as for taking his arm i should as soon think of taking the arm of an elmtree  yet hermit and stoic as he was he was really fond of sympathy and threw himself heartily and childlike into the company of young people whom he loved and whom he delighted to entertain as he only could with the varied and endless anecdotes of his experiences by field and river and he was always ready to lead a huckleberry party or a search for chestnuts or grapes talking one day of a public discourse henry remarked that whatever succeeded with the audience was bad i said who would not like to write something which all can read like robinson crusoe and who does not see with regret that his page is not solid with a right materialistic treatment which delights everybody henry objected of course and vaunted the better lectures which reached only a few persons but at supper a young girl understanding that he was to lecture at the lyceum sharply asked him whether his lecture would be a nice interesting story such as she wished to hear or whether it was one of those old philosophical things that she did not care about henry turned to her and bethought himself and i saw was trying to believe that he had matter that might fit her and her brother who were to sit up and go to the lecture if it was a good one for them  he was a speaker and actor of the truthborn suchand was ever running into dramatic situations from this cause in any circumstance it interested all bystanders to know what part henry would take and what he would say and he did not disappoint expectation but used an original judgment on each emergency in 1845 he built himself a small framed house on the shores of walden pond and lived there two years alone a life of labor and study this action was quite native and fit for him no one who knew him would tax him with affectation he was more unlike his neighbors in his thought than in his action as soon as he had exhausted the advantages of that solitude he abandoned it in 1847 not approving some uses to which the public expenditure was applied he refused to pay his town tax and was put in jail a friend paid the tax for him and he was released the like annoyance was threatened the next year but as his friends paid the tax notwithstanding his protest i believe he ceased to resist no opposition or ridicule had any weight with him he coldly and fully stated his opinion without affecting to believe that it was the opinion of the company it was of no consequence if every one present held the opposite opinion on one occasion he went to the university library to procure some books the librarian refused to lend them mr thoreau repaired to the president who stated to him the rules and usages which permitted the loan of books to resident graduates to clergymen who were alumni and to some others resident within a circle of ten miles radius from the college mr thoreau explained to the president that the railroad had destroyed the old scale of distancesthat the library was useless yes and president and college useless on the terms of his rulesthat the one benefit he owed to the college was its library that at this moment not only his want of books was imperative but he wanted a large number of books and assured him that he thoreau and not the librarian was the proper custodian of these in short the president found the petitioner so formidable and the rules getting to look so ridiculous that he ended by giving him a privilege which in his hands proved unlimited thereafter  no truer american existed than thoreau his preference of his country and condition was genuine and his aversation from english and european manners and tastes almost reached contempt he listened impatiently to news or bon mots gleaned from london circles and though he tried to be civil these anecdotes fatigued him the men were all imitating each other and on a small mould why can they not live as far apart as possible and each be a man by himself what he sought was the most energetic nature and he wished to go to oregon not to london in every part of great britain he wrote in his diary are discovered traces of the romans their funereal urns their camps their roads their dwellings but new england at least is not based on any roman ruins we have not to lay the foundations of our houses on the ashes of a former civilization  but idealist as he was standing for abolition of slavery abolition of tariffs almost for abolition of government it is needless to say he found himself not only unrepresented in actual politics but almost equally opposed to every class of reformers yet he paid the tribute of his uniform respect to the antislavery party one man whose personal acquaintance he had formed he honored with exceptional regard before the first friendly word had been spoken for captain john brown after the arrest he sent notices to most houses in concord that he would speak in a public hall on the condition and character of john brown on sunday evening and invited all people to come the republican committee the abolitionist committee sent him word that it was premature and not advisable he repliedi did not send to you for advice but to announce that i am to speak the hall was filled at an early hour by people of all parties and his earnest eulogy of the hero was heard by all respectfully by many with a sympathy that surprised themselves  it was said of plotinus that he was ashamed of his body and tis very likely he had good reason for itthat his body was a bad servant and he had not skill in dealing with the material world as happens often to men of abstract intellect but mr thoreau was equipped with a most adapted and serviceable body he was of short stature firmly built of light complexion with strong serious blue eyes and a grave aspecthis face covered in the late years with a becoming beard his senses were acute his frame wellknit and hardy his hands strong and skilful in the use of tools and there was a wonderful fitness of body and mind he could pace sixteen rods more accurately than another man could measure them with rod and chain he could find his path in the woods at night he said better by his feet than his eyes he could estimate the measure of a tree very well by his eyes he could estimate the weight of a calf or a pig like a dealer from a box containing a bushel or more of loose pencils he could take up with his hands fast enough just a dozen pencils at every grasp he was a good swimmer runner skater boatman and would probably outwalk most countrymen in a days journey and the relation of body to mind was still finer than we have indicated he said he wanted every stride his legs made the length of his walk uniformly made the length of his writing if shut up in the house he did not write at all  he had a strong common sense like that which rose flammock the weavers daughter in scotts romance commends in her father as resembling a yardstick which whilst it measures dowlas and diaper can equally well measure tapestry and cloth of gold he had always a new resource when i was planting foresttrees and had procured half a peck of acorns he said that only a small portion of them would be sound and proceeded to examine them and select the sound ones but finding this took time he said i think if you put them all into water the good ones will sink which experiment we tried with success he could plan a garden or a house or a barn would have been competent to lead a pacific exploring expedition could give judicious counsel in the gravest private or public affairs  he lived for the day not cumbered and mortified by his memory if he brought you yesterday a new proposition he would bring you today another not less revolutionary a very industrious man and setting like all highly organized men a high value on his time he seemed the only man of leisure in town always ready for any excursion that promised well or for conversation prolonged into late hours his trenchant sense was never stopped by his rules of daily prudence but was always up to the new occasion he liked and used the simplest food yet when some one urged a vegetable diet thoreau thought all diets a very small matter saying that the man who shoots the buffalo lives better than the man who boards at the graham house he saidyou can sleep near the railroad and never be disturbed nature knows very well what sounds are worth attending to and has made up her mind not to hear the railroadwhistle but things respect the devout mind and a mental ecstasy was never interrupted he noted what repeatedly befell him that after receiving from a distance a rare plant he would presently find the same in his own haunts and those pieces of luck which happen only to good players happened to him one day walking with a stranger who inquired where indian arrowheads could he found he replied everywhere and stooping forward picked one on the instant from the ground at mount washington in tuckermans ravine thoreau had a bad fall and sprained his foot as he was in the act of getting up from his fall he saw for the first time the leaves of the arnica mollis  his robust common sense armed with stout hands keen perceptions and strong will cannot yet account for the superiority which shone in his simple and hidden life i must add the cardinal fact that there was an excellent wisdom in him proper to a rare class of men which showed him the material world as a means and symbol this discovery which sometimes yields to poets a certain casual and interrupted light serving for the ornament of their writing was in him an unsleeping insight and whatever faults or obstructions of temperament might cloud it he was not disobedient to the heavenly vision in his youth he said one day the other world is all my art my pencils will draw no other my jackknife will cut nothing else i do not use it as a means this was the muse and genius that ruled his opinions conversation studies work and course of life this made him a searching judge of men at first glance he measured his companion and though insensible to some fine traits of culture could very well report his weight and calibre and this made the impression of genius which his conversation often gave  he understood the matter in hand at a glance and saw the limitations and poverty of those he talked with so that nothing seemed concealed from such terrible eyes i have repeatedly known young men of sensibility converted in a moment to the belief that this was the man they were in search of the man of men who could tell them all they should do his own dealing with them was never affectionate but superior didacticscorning their petty waysvery slowly conceding or not conceding at all the promise of his society at their houses or even at his own would he not walk with them he did not know there was nothing so important to him as his walk he had no walks to throw away on company visits were offered him from respectful parties but he declined them admiring friends offered to carry him at their own cost to the yellowstone riverto the west indiesto south america but though nothing could be more grave or considered than his refusals they remind one in quite new relations of that fop brummels reply to the gentleman who offered him his carriage in a shower but where will you ride thenand what accusing silences and what searching and irresistible speeches battering down all defences his companions can remember  mr thoreau dedicated his genius with such entire love to the fields hills and waters of his native town that he made them known and interesting to all reading americans and to people over the sea the river on whose banks he was born and died he knew from its springs to its confluence with the merrimack he had made summer and winter observations on it for many years and at every hour of the day and the night the result of the recent survey of the water commissioners appointed by the state of massachusetts he had reached by his private experiments several years earlier every fact which occurs in the bed on the banks or in the air over it the fishes and their spawning and nests their manners their food the shadflies which fill the air on a certain evening once a year and which are snapped at by the fishes so ravenously that many of these die of repletion the conical heaps of small stones on the rivershallows one of which heaps will sometimes overfill a cartthese heaps the huge nests of small fishes the birds which frequent the stream heron duck sheldrake loon osprey the snake muskrat otter woodchuck and fox on the banks the turtle frog hyla and cricket which make the banks vocalwere all known to him and as it were townsmen and fellowcreatures so that he felt an absurdity or violence in any narrative of one of these by itself apart and still more of its dimensions on an inchrule or in the exhibition of its skeleton or the specimen of a squirrel or a bird in brandy he liked to speak of the manners of the river as itself a lawful creature yet with exactness and always to an observed fact as he knew the river so the ponds in this region  one of the weapons he used more important than microscope or alcoholreceiver to other investigators was a whim which grew on him by indulgence yet appeared in gravest statement namely of extolling his own town and neighborhood as the most favored centre for natural observation he remarked that the flora of massachusetts embraced almost all the important plants of americamost of the oaks most of the willows the best pines the ash the maple the beech the nuts he returned kanes arctic voyage to a friend of whom he had borrowed it with the remark that most of the phenomena noted might be observed in concord he seemed a little envious of the pole for the coincident sunrise and sunset or five minutes day after six months a splendid fact which annursnuc had never afforded him he found red snow in one of his walks and told me that he expected to find yet the victoria regia in concord he was the attorney of the indigenous plants and owned to a preference of the weeds to the imported plants as of the indian to the civilized manand noticed with pleasure that the willow beanpoles of his neighbor had grown more than his beans see these weeds he said which have been hoed at by a million farmers all spring and summer and yet have prevailed and just now come out triumphant over all lanes pastures fields and gardens such is their vigor we have insulted them with low names tooas pigweed wormwood chickweed shadblossom he says they have brave names tooambrosia stellaria amelanchia amaranth etc  i think his fancy for referring everything to the meridian of concord did not grow out of any ignorance or depreciation of other longitudes or latitudes but was rather a playful expression of his conviction of the indifferency of all places and that the best place for each is where he stands he expressed it once in this wisei think nothing is to be hoped from you if this bit of mould under your feet is not sweeter to you to eat than any other in this world or in any world  the other weapon with which he conquered all obstacles in science was patience he knew how to sit immovable a part of the rock he rested on until the bird the reptile the fish which had retired from him should come back and resume its habits nay moved by curiosity should come to him and watch him  it was a pleasure and a privilege to walk with him he knew the country like a fox or a bird and passed through it as freely by paths of his own he knew every track in the snow or on the ground and what creature had taken this path before him one must submit abjectly to such a guide and the reward was great under his arm he carried an old musicbook to press plants in his pocket his diary and pencil a spyglass for birds microscope jackknife and twine he wore straw hat stout shoes strong gray trousers to brave shruboaks and smilax and to climb a tree for a hawks or a squirrels nest he waded into the pool for the waterplants and his strong legs were no insignificant part of his armor on the day i speak of he looked for the menyanthes detected it across the wide pool and on examination of the florets decided that it had been in flower five days he drew out of his breastpocket his diary and read the names of all the plants that should bloom on this day whereof he kept account as a banker when his notes fall due the cypripedium not due till tomorrow he thought that if waked up from a trance in this swamp he could tell by the plants what time of the year it was within two days the redstart was flying about and presently the fine grosbeaks whose brilliant scarlet makes the rash gazer wipe his eye and whose fine clear note thoreau compared to that of a tanager which has got rid of its hoarseness presently he heard a note which he called that of the nightwarbler a bird he had never identified had been in search of twelve years which always when he saw it was in the act of diving down into a tree or bush and which it was vain to seek the only bird that sings indifferently by night and by day i told him he must beware of finding and booking it lest life should have nothing more to show him he said what you seek in vain for half your life one day you come full upon all the family at dinner you seek it like a dream and as soon as you find it you become its prey  his interest in the flower or the bird lay very deep in his mind was connected with natureand the meaning of nature was never attempted to be defined by him he would not offer a memoir of his observations to the natural history society why should i to detach the description from its connections in my mind would make it no longer true or valuable to me and they do not wish what belongs to it his power of observation seemed to indicate additional senses he saw as with microscope heard as with eartrumpet and his memory was a photographic register of all he saw and heard and yet none knew better than he that it is not the fact that imports but the impression or effect of the fact on your mind every fact lay in glory in his mind a type of the order and beauty of the whole his determination on natural history was organic he confessed that he sometimes felt like a hound or a panther and if born among indians would have been a fell hunter but restrained by his massachusetts culture he played out the game in this mild form of botany and ichthyology his intimacy with animals suggested what thomas fuller records of butler the apiologist that either he had told the bees things or the bees had told him snakes coiled round his leg the fishes swam into his hand and he took them out of the water he pulled the woodchuck out of its hole by the tail and took the foxes under his protection from the hunters our naturalist had perfect magnanimity he had no secrets he would carry you to the herons haunt or even to his most prized botanical swamppossibly knowing that you could never find it again yet willing to take his risks  no college ever offered him a diploma or a professors chair no academy made him its corresponding secretary its discoverer or even its member whether these learned bodies feared the satire of his presence yet so much knowledge of natures secret and genius few others possessed none in a more large and religious synthesis for not a particle of respect had he to the opinions of any man or body of men but homage solely to the truth itself and as he discovered everywhere among doctors some leaning of courtesy it discredited them he grew to be revered and admired by his townsmen who had at first known him only as an oddity the farmers who employed him as a surveyor soon discovered his rare accuracy and skill his knowledge of their lands of trees of birds of indian remains and the like which enabled him to tell every farmer more than he knew before of his own farm so that he began to feel as if mr thoreau had better rights in his land than he they felt too the superiority of character which addressed all men with a native authority  indian relics abound in concordarrowheads stone chisels pestles and fragments of pottery and on the riverbank large heaps of clamshells and ashes mark spots which the savages frequented these and every circumstance touching the indian were important in his eyes his visits to maine were chiefly for love of the indian he had the satisfaction of seeing the manufacture of the barkcanoe as well as of trying his hand in its management on the rapids he was inquisitive about the making of the stone arrowhead and in his last days charged a youth setting out for the rocky mountains to find an indian who could tell him that it was well worth a visit to california to learn it occasionally a small party of penobscot indians would visit concord and pitch their tents for a few weeks in summer on the riverbank he failed not to make acquaintance with the best of them though he well knew that asking questions of indians is like catechizing beavers and rabbits in his last visit to maine he had great satisfaction from joseph polis an intelligent indian of oldtown who was his guide for some weeks  he was equally interested in every natural fact the depth of his perception found likeness of law throughout nature and i know not any genius who so swiftly inferred universal law from the single fact he was no pedant of a department his eye was open to beauty and his ear to music he found these not in rare conditions but wheresoever he went he thought the best of music was in single strains and he found poetic suggestion in the humming of the telegraphwire  his poetry might be bad or good he no doubt wanted a lyric facility and technical skill but he had the source of poetry in his spiritual perception he was a good reader and critic and his judgment on poetry was to the ground of it he could not be deceived as to the presence or absence of the poetic element in any composition and his thirst for this made him negligent and perhaps scornful of superficial graces he would pass by many delicate rhythms but he would have detected every live stanza or line in a volume and knew very well where to find an equal poetic charm in prose he was so enamored of the spiritual beauty that he held all actual written poems in very light esteem in the comparison he admired aeschylus and pindar but when some one was commending them he said that aeschylus and the greeks in describing apollo and orpheus had given no song or no good one they ought not to have moved trees but to have chanted to the gods such a hymn as would have sung all their old ideas out of their heads and new ones in his own verses are often rude and defective the gold does not yet run pure is drossy and crude the thyme and marjoram are not yet honey but if he want lyric fineness and technical merits if he have not the poetic temperament he never lacks the causal thought showing that his genius was better than his talent he knew the worth of the imagination for the uplifting and consolation of human life and liked to throw every thought into a symbol the fact you tell is of no value but only the impression for this reason his presence was poetic always piqued the curiosity to know more deeply the secrets of his mind he had many reserves an unwillingness to exhibit to profane eyes what was still sacred in his own and knew well how to throw a poetic veil over his experience all readers of walden will remember his mythical record of his disappointments  i long ago lost a hound a bay horse and a turtledove and am still on their trail many are the travellers i have spoken concerning them describing their tracks and what calls they answered to i have met one or two who had heard the hound and the tramp of the horse and even seen the dove disappear behind a cloud and they seemed as anxious to recover them as if they had lost them themselves walden p20  his riddles were worth the reading and i confide that if at any time i do not understand the expression it is yet just such was the wealth of his truth that it was not worth his while to use words in vain his poem entitled sympathy reveals the tenderness under that triple steel of stoicism and the intellectual subtilty it could animate his classic poem on smoke suggests simonides but is better than any poem of simonides his biography is in his verses his habitual thought makes all his poetry a hymn to the cause of causes the spirit which vivifies and controls his own    i hearing get who had but ears   and sight who had but eyes before   i moments live who lived but years   and truth discern who knew but learnings lore  and still more in these religious lines    now chiefly is my natal hour   and only now my prime of life   i will not doubt the love untold   which not my worth or want hath bought   which wooed me young and wooes me old   and to this evening hath me brought  whilst he used in his writings a certain petulance of remark in reference to churches or churchmen he was a person of a rare tender and absolute religion a person incapable of any profanation by act or by thought of course the same isolation which belonged to his original thinking and living detached him from the social religious forms this is neither to be censured nor regretted aristotle long ago explained it when he said one who surpasses his fellowcitizens in virtue is no longer a part of the city their law is not for him since he is a law to himself  thoreau was sincerity itself and might fortify the convictions of prophets in the ethical laws by his holy living it was an affirmative experience which refused to be set aside a truthspeaker he capable of the most deep and strict conversation a physician to the wounds of any soul a friend knowing not only the secret of friendship but almost worshipped by those few persons who resorted to him as their confessor and prophet and knew the deep value of his mind and great heart he thought that without religion or devotion of some kind nothing great was ever accomplished and he thought that the bigoted sectarian had better bear this in mind  his virtues of course sometimes ran into extremes it was easy to trace to the inexorable demand on all for exact truth that austerity which made this willing hermit more solitary even than he wished himself of a perfect probity he required not less of others he had a disgust at crime and no worldly success could cover it he detected paltering as readily in dignified and prosperous persons as in beggars and with equal scorn such dangerous frankness was in his dealing that his admirers called him that terrible thoreau as if he spoke when silent and was still present when he had departed i think the severity of his ideal interfered to deprive him of a healthy sufficiency of human society  the habit of a realist to find things the reverse of their appearance inclined him to put every statement in a paradox a certain habit of antagonism defaced his earlier writingsa trick of rhetoric not quite outgrown in his later of substituting for the obvious word and thought its diametrical opposite he praised wild mountains and winter forests for their domestic air in snow and ice he would find sultriness and commended the wilderness for resembling rome and paris it was so dry that you might call it wet  the tendency to magnify the moment to read all the laws of nature in the one object or one combination under your eye is of course comic to those who do not share the philosophers perception of identity to him there was no such thing as size the pond was a small ocean the atlantic a large walden pond he referred every minute fact to cosmical laws though he meant to be just he seemed haunted by a certain chronic assumption that the science of the day pretended completeness and he had just found out that the savans had neglected to discriminate a particular botanical variety had failed to describe the seeds or count the sepals that is to say we replied the blockheads were not born in concord but who said they were it was their unspeakable misfortune to be born in london or paris or rome but poor fellows they did what they could considering that they never saw batemans pond or nineacre corner or beckystows swamp besides what were you sent into the world for but to add this observation  had his genius been only contemplative he had been fitted to his life but with his energy and practical ability he seemed born for great enterprise and for command and i so much regret the loss of his rare powers of action that i cannot help counting it a fault in him that he had no ambition wanting this instead of engineering for all america he was the captain of a huckleberry party pounding beans is good to the end of pounding empires one of these days but if at the end of years it is still only beans  but these foibles real or apparent were fast vanishing in the incessant growth of a spirit so robust and wise and which effaced its defeats with new triumphs his study of nature was a perpetual ornament to him and inspired his friends with curiosity to see the world through his eyes and to hear his adventures they possessed every kind of interest  he had many elegances of his own whilst he scoffed at conventional elegance thus he could not bear to hear the sound of his own steps the grit of gravel and therefore never willingly walked in the road but in the grass on mountains and in woods his senses were acute and he remarked that by night every dwellinghouse gives out bad air like a slaughterhouse he liked the pure fragrance of melilot he honored certain plants with special regard and over all the pondlilythen the gentian and the mikania scandens and lifeeverlasting and a basstree which he visited every year when it bloomed in the middle of july he thought the scent a more oracular inquisition than the sightmore oracular and trustworthy the scent of course reveals what is concealed from the other senses by it he detected earthiness he delighted in echoes and said they were almost the only kind of kindred voices that he heard he loved nature so well was so happy in her solitude that he became very jealous of cities and the sad work which their refinements and artifices made with man and his dwelling the axe was always destroying his forest thank god he said they cannot cut down the clouds all kinds of figures are drawn on the blue ground with this fibrous white paint  i subjoin a few sentences taken from his unpublished manuscripts not only as records of his thought and feeling but for their power of description and literary excellence  some circumstantial evidence is very strong as when you find a trout in the milk  the chub is a soft fish and tastes like boiled brown paper salted  the youth gets together his materials to build a bridge to the moon or perchance a palace or temple on the earth and at length the middleaged man concludes to built a woodshed with them  the locust zing  devilsneedles zigzagging along the nutmeadow brook  sugar is not so sweet to the palate as sound to the healthy ear  i put on some hemlockboughs and the rich salt crackling of their leaves was like mustard to the ear the crackling of uncountable regiments dead trees love the fire  the bluebird carries the sky on his back  the tanager flies through the green foliage as if it would ignite the leaves  if i wish for a horsehair for my compasssight i must go to the stable but the hairbird with her sharp eyes goes to the road  immortal water alive even to the superficies  fire is the most tolerable third party  nature made ferns for pure leaves to show what she could do in that line  no tree has so fair a bole and so handsome an instep as the beech  how did these beautiful rainbowtints get into the shell of the freshwater clam buried in the mud at the bottom of our dark river  hard are the times when the infants shoes are secondfoot  we are strictly confined to our men to whom we

our summer plant called lifeeverlasting a gnaphalium like that which grows on the most inaccessible cliffs of the tyrolese mountains where the chamois dare hardly venture and which the hunter tempted by its beauty and by his love for it is immensely valued by the swiss maidens climbs the cliffs to gather and is sometimes found dead at the foot with the flower in his hand it is called by botanists the gnaphalium leontopodium but by the swiss edelweisse which signifies noble purity thoreau seemed to me living in the hope to gather this plant which belonged to him of right the scale on which his studies proceeded was so large as to require longevity and we were the less prepared for his sudden disappearance the country knows not yet or in the least part how great a son it has lost it seems an injury that he should leave in the midst his broken task which none else can finisha kind of indignity to so noble a soul that it should depart out of nature before yet he has been really shown to his peers for what he is but he at least is content his soul was made for the noblest society he had in a short life exhausted the capabilities of this world wherever there is knowledge wherever there is virtue wherever there is beauty he will find a home        excursions   natural history of massachusetts footnote reportson the fishes reptiles and birds the herbaceous plants and quadrupeds the insects injurious to vegetation and the invertebrate animals of massachusetts published agreeably to an order of the legislature by the commissioners on the zoölogical and botanical survey of the state 1842  books of natural history make the most cheerful winter reading i read in audubon with a thrill of delight when the snow covers the ground of the magnolia and the florida keys and their warm seabreezes of the fencerail and the cottontree and the migrations of the ricebird of the breaking up of winter in labrador and the melting of the snow on the forks of the missouri and owe an accession of health to these reminiscences of luxuriant nature  within the circuit of this plodding life there enter moments of an azure hue untarnished fair as is the violet or anemone when the spring strews them by some meandering rivulet which make the best philosophy untrue that aims but to console man for his grievances i have remembered when the winter came high in my chamber in the frosty nights when in the still light of the cheerful moon on every twig and rail and jutting spout the icy spears were adding to their length against the arrows of the coming sun how in the shimmering noon of summer past some unrecorded beam slanted across the upland pastures where the johnswort grew or heard amid the verdure of my mind the bees long smothered hum on the blue flag loitering amidst the mead or busy rill which now through all its course stands still and dumb its own memorialpurling at its play along the slopes and through the meadows next until its youthful sound was hushed at last in the staid current of the lowland stream or seen the furrows shine but late upturned and where the fieldfare followed in the rear when all the fields around lay bound and hoar beneath a thick integument of snow so by gods cheap economy made rich to go upon my winters task again  i am singularly refreshed in winter when i hear of serviceberries pokeweed juniper is not heaven made up of these cheap summer glories there is a singular health in those words labrador and east main which no desponding creed recognizes how much more than federal are these states if there were no other vicissitudes than the seasons our interest would never tire much more is adoing than congress wots of what journal do the persimmon and the buckeye keep and the sharpshinned hawk what is transpiring from summer to winter in the carolinas and the great pine forest and the valley of the mohawk the merely political aspect of the land is never very cheering men are degraded when considered as the members of a political organization on this side all lands present only the symptoms of decay i see but bunker hill and singsing the district of columbia and sullivans island with a few avenues connecting them but paltry are they all beside one blast of the east or the south wind which blows over them  in society you will not find health but in nature unless our feet at least stood in the midst of nature all our faces would be pale and livid society is always diseased and the best is the most so there is no scent in it so wholesome as that of the pines nor any fragrance so penetrating and restorative as the lifeeverlasting in high pastures i would keep some book of natural history always by me as a sort of elixir the reading of which should restore the tone of the system to the sick indeed nature is sick but to the well a fountain of health to him who contemplates a trait of natural beauty no harm nor disappointment can come the doctrines of despair of spiritual or political tyranny or servitude were never taught by such as shared the serenity of nature surely good courage will not flag here on the atlantic border as long as we are flanked by the fur countries there is enough in that sound to cheer one under any circumstances the spruce the hemlock and the pine will not countenance despair methinks some creeds in vestries and churches do forget the hunter wrapped in furs by the great slave lake and that the esquimaux sledges are drawn by dogs and in the twilight of the northern night the hunter does not give over to follow the seal and walrus on the ice they are of sick and diseased imaginations who would toll the worlds knell so soon cannot these sedentary sects do better than prepare the shrouds and write the epitaphs of those other busy living men the practical faith of all men belies the preachers consolation what is any mans discourse to me if i am not sensible of something in it as steady and cheery as the creak of crickets in it the woods must be relieved against the sky men tire me when i am not constantly greeted and refreshed as by the flux of sparkling streams surely joy is the condition of life think of the young fry that leap in ponds the myriads of insects ushered into being on a summer evening the incessant note of the hyla with which the woods ring in the spring the nonchalance of the butterfly carrying accident and change painted in a thousand hues upon its wings or the brook minnow stoutly stemming the current the lustre of whose scales worn bright by the attrition is reflected upon the bank  we fancy that this din of religion literature and philosophy which is heard in pulpits lyceums and parlors vibrates through the universe and is as catholic a sound as the creaking of the earths axle but if a man sleep soundly he will forget it all between sunset and dawn it is the threeinch swing of a pendulum in a cupboard which the great pulse of nature vibrates by and through each instant when we lift our eyelids and open our ears it disappears with smoke and rattle like the cars on a railroad when i detect a beauty in any of the recesses of nature i am reminded by the serene and retired spirit in which it requires to be contemplated of the inexpressible privacy of a lifehow silent and unambitious it is the beauty there is in mosses must be considered from the holiest quietest nook what an admirable training is science for the more active warfare of life indeed the unchallenged bravery which these studies imply is far more impressive than the trumpeted valor of the warrior i am pleased to learn that thales was up and stirring by night not unfrequently as his astronomical discoveries prove linnaeus setting out for lapland surveys his comb and spare shirt leathern breeches and gauze cap to keep off gnats with as much complacency as bonaparte a park of artillery for the russian campaign the quiet bravery of the man is admirable his eye is to take in fish flower and bird quadruped and biped science is always brave for to know is to know good doubt and danger quail before her eye what the coward overlooks in his hurry she calmly scrutinizes breaking ground like a pioneer for the array of arts that follow in her train but cowardice is unscientific for there cannot be a science of ignorance there may be a science of bravery for that advances but a retreat is rarely well conducted if it is then is it an orderly advance in the face of circumstances  but to draw a little nearer to our promised topics entomology extends the limits of being in a new direction so that i walk in nature with a sense of greater space and freedom it suggests besides that the universe is not roughhewn but perfect in its details nature will bear the closest inspection she invites us to lay our eye level with the smallest leaf and take an insect view of its plain she has no interstices every part is full of life i explore too with pleasure the sources of the myriad sounds which crowd the summer noon and which seem the very grain and stuff of which eternity is made who does not remember the shrill rollcall of the harvest fly there were ears for these sounds in greece long ago as anacreons ode will show  we pronounce thee happy cicada for on the tops of the trees drinking a little dew like any king thou singest for thine are they all whatever thou seest in the fields and whatever the woods bear thou art the friend of the husbandmen in no respect injuring any one and thou art honored among men sweet prophet of summer the muses love thee and phoebus himself loves thee and has given thee a shrill song age does not wrack thee thou skilful earthborn songloving unsuffering bloodless one almost thou art like the gods  in the autumn days the creaking of crickets is heard at noon over all the land and as in summer they are heard chiefly at nightfall so then by their incessant chirp they usher in the evening of the year nor can all the vanities that vex the world alter one whit the measure that night has chosen every pulsebeat is in exact time with the crickets chant and the tickings of the deathwatch in the wall alternate with these if you can  about two hundred and eighty birds either reside permanently in the state or spend the summer only or make us a passing visit those which spend the winter with us have obtained our warmest sympathy the nuthatch and chicadee flitting in company through the dells of the wood the one harshly scolding at the intruder the other with a faint lisping note enticing him on the jay screaming in the orchard the crow cawing in unison with the storm the partridge like a russet link extended over from autumn to spring preserving unbroken the chain of summers the hawk with warriorlike firmness abiding the blasts of winter the robin footnote a white robin and a white quail have occasionally been seen it is mentioned in audubon as remarkable that the nest of a robin should be found on the ground but this bird seems to be less particular than most in the choice of a building spot i have seen its nest placed under the thatched roof of a deserted barn and in one instance where the adjacent country was nearly destitute of trees together with two of the phoebe upon the end of a board in the loft of a sawmill but a few feet from the saw which vibrated several inches with the motion of the machinery and lark lurking by warm springs in the woods the familiar snowbird culling a few seeds in the garden or a few crumbs in the yard and occasionally the shrike with heedless and unfrozen melody bringing back summer again  his steady sails he never furls at any time o year and perching now on winters curls he whistles in his ear  as the spring advances and the ice is melting in the river our earliest and straggling visitors make their appearance again does the old teian poet sing as well for new england as for greece in the  return of spring  behold how spring appearing the graces send forth roses behold how the wave of the sea is made smooth by the calm behold how the duck dives behold how the crane travels and titan shines constantly bright the shadows of the clouds are moving the works of man shine the earth puts forth fruits the fruit of the olive puts forth the cup of bacchus is crowned along the leaves along the branches the fruit bending them down flourishes  the ducks alight at this season in the still water in company with the gulls which do not fail to improve an east wind to visit our meadows and swim about by twos and threes pluming themselves and diving to peck at the root of the lily and the cranberries which the frost has not loosened the first flock of geese is seen beating to north in long harrows and waving lines the gingle of the songsparrow salutes us from the shrubs and fences the plaintive note of the lark comes clear and sweet from the meadow and the bluebird like an azure ray glances past us in our walk the fishhawk too is occasionally seen at this season sailing majestically over the water and he who has once observed it will not soon forget the majesty of its flight it sails the air like a ship of the line worthy to struggle with the elements falling back from time to time like a ship on its beam ends and holding its talons up as if ready for the arrows in the attitude of the national bird it is a great presence as of the master of river and forest its eye would not quail before the owner of the soil but make him feel like an intruder on its domains and then its retreat sailing so steadily away is a kind of advance i have by me one of a pair of ospreys which have for some years fished in this vicinity shot by a neighboring pond measuring more than two feet in length and six in the stretch of its wings nuttall mentions that the ancients particularly aristotle pretended that the ospreys taught their young to gaze at the sun and those who were unable to do so were destroyed linnaeus even believed on ancient authority that one of the feet of this bird had all the toes divided while the other was partly webbed so that it could swim with one foot and grasp a fish with the other but that educated eye is now dim and those talons are nerveless its shrill scream seems yet to linger in its throat and the roar of the sea in its wings there is the tyranny of jove in its claws and his wrath in the erectile feathers of the head and neck it reminds me of the argonautic expedition and would inspire the dullest to take flight over parnassus  the booming of the bittern described by goldsmith and nuttall is frequently heard in our fens in the morning and evening sounding like a pump or the chopping of wood in a frosty morning in some distant farmyard the manner in which this sound is produced i have not seen anywhere described on one occasion the bird has been seen by one of my neighbors to thrust its bill into the water and suck up as much as it could hold then raising its head it pumped it out again with four or five heaves of the neck throwing it two or three feet and making the sound each time  at length the summers eternity is ushered in by the cackle of the flicker among the oaks on the hillside and a new dynasty begins with calm security  in may and june the woodland quire is in full tune and given the immense spaces of hollow air and this curious human ear one does not see how the void could be better filled    each summer sound   is a summer round  as the season advances and those birds which make us but a passing visit depart the woods become silent again and but few feathers ruffle the drowsy air but the solitary rambler may still find a response and expression for every mood in the depths of the wood  sometimesi hear the veerys clarion or brazen trump of the impatient jay and in secluded woods the chicadee doles out her scanty notes which sing the praise of heroes and set forth the loveliness of virtue evermore  footnote  this bird which is so well described by nuttall but is apparently unknown by the author of the report is one of the most common in the woods in this vicinity and in cambridge i have heard the college yard ring with its trill the boys call it yorrick from the sound of its querulous and chiding note as it flits near the traveller through the underwood the cowbirds egg is occasionally found in its nest as mentioned by audubon  the phoebe still sings in harmony with the sultry weather by the brink of the pond nor are the desultory hours of noon in the midst of the village without their minstrel  upon the lofty elmtree sprays the vireo rings the changes sweet during the trivial summer days striving to lift our thoughts above the street  with the autumn begins in some measure a new spring the plover is heard whistling high in the air over the dry pastures the finches flit from tree to tree the bobolinks and flickers fly in flocks and the goldfinch rides on the earliest blast like a winged hyla peeping amid the rustle of the leaves the crows too begin now to congregate you may stand and count them as they fly low and straggling over the landscape singly or by twos and threes at intervals of half a mile until a hundred have passed  i have seen it suggested somewhere that the crow was brought to this country by the white man but i shall as soon believe that the white man planted these pines and hemlocks he is no spaniel to follow our steps but rather flits about the clearings like the dusky spirit of the indian reminding me oftener of philip and powhatan than of winthrop and smith he is a relic of the dark ages by just so slight by just so lasting a tenure does superstition hold the world ever there is the rook in england and the crow in new england  thou dusky spirit of the wood bird of an ancient brood flitting thy lonely way a meteor in the summers day from wood to wood from hill to hill low over forest field and rill what wouldst thou say why shouldst thou haunt the day what makes thy melancholy float what bravery inspires thy throat and bears thee up above the clouds over desponding human crowds which far below lay thy haunts low  the late walker or sailor in the october evenings may hear the murmurings of the snipe circling over the meadows the most spiritlike sound in nature and still later in the autumn when the frosts have tinged the leaves a solitary loon pays a visit to our retired ponds where he may lurk undisturbed till the season of moulting is passed making the woods ring with his wild laughter this bird the great northern diver well deserves its name for when pursued with a boat it will dive and swim like a fish under water for sixty rods or more as fast as a boat can be paddled and its pursuer if he would discover his game again must put his ear to the surface to hear where it comes up when it comes to the surface it throws the water off with one shake of its wings and calmly swims about until again disturbed  these are the sights and sounds which reach our senses oftenest during the year but sometimes one hears a quite new note which has for background other carolinas and mexicos than the books describe and learns that his ornithology has done him no service  it appears from the report that there are about forty quadrupeds belonging to the state and among these one is glad to hear of a few bears wolves lynxes and wildcats  when our river overflows its banks in the spring the wind from the meadows is laden with a strong scent of musk and by its freshness advertises me of an unexplored wildness those backwoods are not far off then i am affected by the sight of the cabins of the muskrat made of mud and grass and raised three or four feet along the river as when i read of the barrows of asia the muskrat is the beaver of the settled states their number has even increased within a few years in this vicinity among the rivers which empty into the merrimack the concord is known to the boatmen as a dead stream the indians are said to have called it musketaquid or prairie river its current being much more sluggish and its water more muddy than the rest it abounds more in fish and game of every kind according to the history of the town the furtrade was here once very important as early as 1641 a company was formed in the colony of which major willard of concord was superintendent and had the exclusive right to trade with the indians in furs and other articles and for this right they were obliged to pay into the public treasury one twentieth of all the furs they obtained there are trappers in our midst still as well as on the streams of the far west who night and morning go the round of their traps without fear of the indian one of these takes from one hundred and fifty to two hundred muskrats in a year and even thirtysix have been shot by one man in a day their fur which is not nearly as valuable as formerly is in good condition in the winter and spring only and upon the breaking up of the ice when they are driven out of their holes by the water the greatest number is shot from boats either swimming or resting on their stools or slight supports of grass and reeds by the side of the stream though they exhibit considerable cunning at other times they are easily taken in a trap which has only to be placed in their holes or wherever they frequent without any bait being used though it is sometimes rubbed with their musk in the winter the hunter cuts holes in the ice and shoots them when they come to the surface their burrows are usually in the high banks of the river with the entrance under water and rising within to above the level of high water sometimes their nests composed of dried meadow grass and flags may be discovered where the bank is low and spongy by the yielding of the ground under the feet they have from three to seven or eight young in the spring  frequently in the morning or evening a long ripple is seen in the still water where a muskrat is crossing the stream with only its nose above the surface and sometimes a green bough in its mouth to build its house with when it finds itself observed it will dive and swim five or six rods under water and at length conceal itself in its hole or the weeds it will remain under water for ten minutes at a time and on one occasion has been seen when undisturbed to form an airbubble under the ice which contracted and expanded as it breathed at leisure when it suspects danger on shore it will stand erect like a squirrel and survey its neighborhood for several minutes without moving  in the fall if a meadow intervene between their burrows and the stream they erect cabins of mud and grass three or four feet high near its edge these are not their breedingplaces though young are sometimes found in them in late freshets but rather their huntinglodges to which they resort in the winter with their food and for shelter their food consists chiefly of flags and freshwater muscles the shells of the latter being left in large quantities around their lodges in the spring  the penobscot indian wears the entire skin of a muskrat with the legs and tail dangling and the head caught under his girdle for a pouch into which he puts his fishing tackle and essences to scent his traps with  the bear wolf lynx wildcat deer beaver and marten have disappeared the otter is rarely if ever seen here at present and the mink is less common than formerly  perhaps of all our untamed quadrupeds the fox has obtained the widest and most familiar reputation from the time of pilpay and aesop to the present day his recent tracks still give variety to a winters walk i tread in the steps of the fox that has gone before me by some hours or which perhaps i have started with such a tiptoe of expectation as if i were on the trail of the spirit itself which resides in the wood and expected soon to catch it in its lair i am curious to know what has determined its graceful curvatures and how surely they were coincident with the fluctuations of some mind i know which way a mind wended what horizon it faced by the setting of these tracks and whether it moved slowly or rapidly by their greater or less intervals and distinctness for the swiftest step leaves yet a lasting trace sometimes you will see the trails of many together and where they have gambolled and gone through a hundred evolutions which testify to a singular listlessness and leisure in nature  when i see a fox run across the pond on the snow with the carelessness of freedom or at intervals trace his course in the sunshine along the ridge of a hill i give up to him sun and earth as to their true proprietor he does not go in the sun but it seems to follow him and there is a visible sympathy between him and it sometimes when the snow lies light and but five or six inches deep you may give chase and come up with one on foot in such a case he will show a remarkable presence of mind choosing only the safest direction though he may lose ground by it notwithstanding his fright he will take no step which is not beautiful his pace is a sort of leopard canter as if he were in nowise impeded by the snow but were husbanding his strength all the while when the ground is uneven the course is a series of graceful curves conforming to the shape of the surface he runs as though there were not a bone in his back occasionally dropping his muzzle to the ground for a rod or two and then tossing his head aloft when satisfied of his course when he comes to a declivity he will put his forefeet together and slide swiftly down it shoving the snow before him he treads so softly that you would hardly hear it from any nearness and yet with such expression that it would not be quite inaudible at any distance                                       of fishes seventyfive genera and one hundred and seven species are described in the report the fisherman will be startled to learn that there are but about a dozen kinds in the ponds and streams of any inland town and almost nothing is known of their habits only their names and residence make one love fishes i would know even the number of their finrays and how many scales compose the lateral line i am the wiser in respect to all knowledges and the better qualified for all fortunes for knowing that there is a minnow in the brook methinks i have need even of his sympathy and to be his fellow in a degree  i have experienced such simple delight in the trivial matters of fishing and sporting formerly as might have inspired the muse of homer or shakspeare and now when i turn the pages and ponder the plates of the anglers souvenir i am fain to exclaim                 can these things be   and overcome us like a summers cloud  next to nature it seems as if mans actions were the most natural they so gently accord with her the small seines of flax stretched across the shallow and transparent parts of our river are no more intrusion than the cobweb in the sun i stay my boat in midcurrent and look down in the sunny water to see the civil meshes of his nets and wonder how the blustering people of the town could have done this elvish work the twine looks like a new river weed and is to the river as a beautiful memento of mans presence in nature discovered as silently and delicately as a footprint in the sand  when the ice is covered with snow i do not suspect the wealth under my feet that there is as good as a mine under me wherever i go how many pickerel are poised on easy fin fathoms below the loaded wain the revolution of the seasons must be a curious phenomenon to them at length the sun and wind brush aside their curtain and they see the heavens again  early in the spring after the ice has melted is the time for spearing fish suddenly the wind shifts from northeast and east to west and south and every icicle which has tinkled on the meadow grass so long trickles down its stem and seeks its level unerringly with a million comrades the steam curls up from every roof and fence    i see the civil sun drying earths tears   her tears of joy which only faster flow  in the brooks is heard the slight grating sound of small cakes of ice floating with various speed full of content and promise and where the water gurgles under a natural bridge you may hear these hasty rafts hold conversation in an undertone every rill is a channel for the juices of the meadow in the ponds the ice cracks with a merry and inspiriting din and down the larger streams is whirled grating hoarsely and crashing its way along which was so lately a highway for the woodmans team and the fox sometimes with the tracks of the skaters still fresh upon it and the holes cut for pickerel town committees anxiously inspect the bridges and causeways as if by mere eyeforce to intercede with the ice and save the treasury  the river swelleth more and more like some sweet influence stealing oer the passive town and for a while each tussuck makes a tiny isle where on some friendly ararat resteth the weary waterrat  no ripple shows musketaquid her very current een is hid as deepest souls do calmest rest when thoughts are swelling in the breast and she that in the summers drought doth make a rippling and a rout sleeps from nabshawtuck to the cliff unruffled by a single skiff but by a thousand distant hills the louder roar a thousand rills and many a spring which now is dumb and many a stream with smothered hum doth swifter well and faster glide though buried deep beneath the tide  our village shows a rural venice its broad lagoons where yonder fen is as lovely as the bay of naples yon placid cove amid the maples and in my neighbors field of corn i recognize the golden horn  here nature taught from year to year when only red men came to hear methinks twas in this school of art venice and naples learned their part but still their mistress to my mind her young disciples leaves behind  the fisherman now repairs and launches his boat the best time for spearing is at this season before the weeds have begun to grow and while the fishes lie in the shallow water for in summer they prefer the cool depths and in the autumn they are still more or less concealed by the grass the first requisite is fuel for your crate and for this purpose the roots of the pitchpine are commonly used found under decayed stumps where the trees have been felled eight or ten years  with a crate or jack made of iron hoops to contain your fire and attached to the bow of your boat about three feet from the water a fishspear with seven tines and fourteen feet long a large basket or barrow to carry your fuel and bring back your fish and a thick outer garment you are equipped for a cruise it should be a warm and still evening and then with a fire crackling merrily at the prow you may launch forth like a cucullo into the night the dullest soul cannot go upon such an expedition without some of the spirit of adventure as if he had stolen the boat of charon and gone down the styx on a midnight expedition into the realms of pluto and much speculation does this wandering star afford to the musing nightwalker leading him on and on jackolanternlike over the meadows or if he is wiser he amuses himself with imagining what of human life far in the silent night is flitting mothlike round its candle the silent navigator shoves his craft gently over the water with a smothered pride and sense of benefaction as if he were the phosphor or lightbringer to these dusky realms or some sister moon blessing the spaces with her light the waters for a rod or two on either hand and several feet in depth are lit up with more than noonday distinctness and he enjoys the opportunity which so many have desired for the roofs of a city are indeed raised and he surveys the midnight economy of the fishes there they lie in every variety of posture some on their backs with their white bellies uppermost some suspended in midwater some sculling gently along with a dreamy motion of the fins and others quite active and wide awakea scene not unlike what the human city would present occasionally he will encounter a turtle selecting the choicest morsels or a muskrat resting on a tussuck he may exercise his dexterity if he sees fit on the more distant and active fish or fork the nearer into his boat as potatoes out of a pot or even take the sound sleepers with his hands but these last accomplishments he will soon learn to dispense with distinguishing the real object of his pursuit and find compensation in the beauty and neverending novelty of his position the pines growing down to the waters edge will show newly as in the glare of a conflagration and as he floats under the willows with his light the songsparrow will often wake on her perch and sing that strain at midnight which she had meditated for the morning and when he has done he may have to steer his way home through the dark by the north star and he will feel himself some degrees nearer to it for having lost his way on the earth  the fishes commonly taken in this way are pickerel suckers perch eels pouts breams and shinersfrom thirty to sixty weight in a night some are hard to be recognized in the unnatural light especially the perch which his dark bands being exaggerated acquires a ferocious aspect the number of these transverse bands which the report states to be seven is however very variable for in some of our ponds they have nine and ten even                                       it appears that we have eight kinds of tortoises twelve snakesbut one of which is venomousnine frogs and toads nine salamanders and one lizard for our neighbors  i am particularly attracted by the motions of the serpent tribe they make our hands and feet the wings of the bird and the fins of the fish seems very superfluous as if nature had only indulged her fancy in making them the black snake will dart into a bush when pursued and circle round and round with an easy and graceful motion amid the thin and bare twigs five or six feet from the ground as a bird flits from bough to bough or hang in festoons between the forks elasticity and flexibleness in the simpler forms of animal life are equivalent to a complex system of limbs in the higher and we have only to be as wise and wily as the serpent to perform as difficult feats without the vulgar assistance of hands and feet  in may the snapping turtle emysaurus serpentina is frequently taken on the meadows and in the river the fisherman taking sight over the calm surface discovers its snout projecting above the water at the distance of many rods and easily secures his prey through its unwillingness to disturb the water by swimming hastily away for gradually drawing its head under it remains resting on some limb or clump of grass its eggs which are buried at a distance from the water in some soft place as a pigeonbed are frequently devoured by the skunk it will catch fish by daylight as a toad catches flies and is said to emit a transparent fluid from its mouth to attract them  nature has taken more care than the fondest parent for the education and refinement of her children consider the silent influence which flowers exert no less upon the ditcher in the meadow than the lady in the bower when i walk in the woods i am reminded that a wise purveyor has been there before me my most delicate experience is typified there i am struck with the pleasing friendships and unanimities of nature as when the lichen on the trees takes the form of their leaves in the most stupendous scenes you will see delicate and fragile features as slight wreaths of vapor dewlines feathery sprays which suggest a high refinement a noble blood and breeding as it were it is not hard to account for elves and fairies they represent this light grace this ethereal gentility bring a spray from the wood or a crystal from the brook and place it on your mantel and your household ornaments will seem plebeian beside its nobler fashion and bearing it will wave superior there as if used to a more refined and polished circle it has a salute and a response to all your enthusiasm and heroism  in the winter i stop short in the path to admire how the trees grow up without forethought regardless of the time and circumstances they do not wait as man does but now is the golden age of the sapling earth air sun and rain are occasion enough they were no better in primeval centuries the winter of their discontent never comes witness the buds of the native poplar standing gayly out to the frost on the sides of its bare switches they express a naked confidence with cheerful heart one could be a sojourner in the wilderness if he were sure to find there the catkins of the willow or the alder when i read of them in the accounts of northern adventurers by baffins bay or mackenzies river i see how even there too i could dwell they are our little vegetable redeemers methinks our virtue will hold out till they come again they are worthy to have had a greater than minerva or ceres for their inventor who was the benignant goddess that bestowed them on mankind  nature is mythical and mystical always and works with the license and extravagance of genius she has her luxurious and florid style as well as art having a pilgrims cup to make she gives to the whole stem bowl handle and nose some fantastic shape as if it were to be the car of some fabulous marine deity a nereus or triton  in the winter the botanist needs not confine himself to his books and herbarium and give over his outdoor pursuits but may study a new department of vegetable physiology what may be called crystalline botany then the winter of 1837 was unusually favorable for this in december of that year the genius of vegetation seemed to hover by night over its summer haunts with unusual persistency such a hoarfrost as is very uncommon here or anywhere and whose full effects can never be witnessed after sunrise occurred several times as i went forth early on a still and frosty morning the trees looked like airy creatures of darkness caught napping on this side huddled together with their gray hairs streaming in a secluded valley which the sun had not penetrated on that hurrying off in indian file along some watercourse while the shrubs and grasses like elves and fairies of the night sought to hide their diminished heads in the snow the river viewed from the high bank appeared of a yellowish green color though all the landscape was white every tree shrub and spire of grass that could raise its head above the snow was covered with a dense icefoliage answering as it were leaf for leaf to its summer dress even the fences had put forth leaves in the night the centre diverging and more minute fibres were perfectly distinct and the edges regularly indented these leaves were on the side of the twig or stubble opposite to the sun meeting it for the most part at right angles and there were others standing out at all possible angles upon these and upon one another with no twig or stubble supporting them when the first rays of the sun slanted over the scene the grasses seemed hung with innumerable jewels which jingled merrily as they were brushed by the foot of the traveller and reflected all the hues of the rainbow as he moved from side to side it struck me that these ghost leaves and the green ones whose forms they assume were the creatures of but one law that in obedience to the same law the vegetable juices swell gradually into the perfect leaf on the one hand and the crystalline particles troop to their standard in the same order on the other as if the material were indifferent but the law one and invariable and every plant in the spring but pushed up into and filled a permanent and eternal mould which summer and winter forever is waiting to be filled  this foliate structure is common to the coral and the plumage of birds and to how large a part of animate and inanimate nature the same independence of law on matter is observable in many other instances as in the natural rhymes when some animal form color or odor has its counterpart in some vegetable as indeed all rhymes imply an eternal melody independent of any particular sense  as confirmation of the fact that vegetation is but a kind of crystallization every one may observe how upon the edge of the melting frost on the window the needleshaped particles are bundled together so as to resemble fields waving with grain or shocks rising here and there from the stubble on one side the vegetation of the torrid zone hightowering palms and widespread banyans such as are seen in pictures of oriental scenery on the other arctic pines stiff frozen with downcast branches  vegetation has been made the type of all growth but as in crystals the law is more obvious their material being more simple and for the most part more transient and fleeting would it not be as philosophical as convenient to consider all growth all filling up within the limits of nature but a crystallization more or less rapid  on this occasion in the side of the high bank of the river wherever the water or other cause had formed a cavity its throat and outer edge like the entrance to a citadel bristled with a glistening icearmor in one place you might see minute ostrichfeathers which seemed the waving plumes of the warriors filing into the fortress in another the glancing fanshaped banners of the lilliputian host and in another the needleshaped particles collected into bundles resembling the plumes of the pine might pass for a phalanx of spears from the under side of the ice in the brooks where there was a thicker ice below depended a mass of crystallization four or five inches deep in the form of prisms with their lower ends open which when the ice was laid on its smooth side resembled the roofs and steeples of a gothic city or the vessels of a crowded haven under a press of canvas the very mud in the road where the ice had melted was crystallized with deep rectilinear fissures and the crystalline masses in the sides of the ruts resembled exactly asbestos in the disposition of their needles around the roots of the stubble and flowerstalks the frost was gathered into the form of irregular conical shells or fairy rings in some places the icecrystals were lying upon granite rocks directly over crystals of quartz the frostwork of a longer night crystals of a longer period but to some eye unprejudiced by the short term of human life melting as fast as the former  in the report on the invertebrate animals this singular fact is recorded which teaches us to put a new value on time and space the distribution of the marine shells is well worthy of notice as a geological fact cape cod the right arm of the commonwealth reaches out into the ocean some fifty or sixty miles it is nowhere many miles wide but this narrow point of land has hitherto proved a barrier to the migrations of many species of mollusca several genera and numerous species which are separated by the intervention of only a few miles of land are effectually prevented from mingling by the cape and do not pass from one side to the other of the one hundred and ninetyseven marine species eightythree do not pass to the south shore and fifty are not found on the north shore of the cape  that common muscle the unio complanalus or more properly fluviatilis left in the spring by the muskrat upon rocks and stumps appears to have been an important article of food with the indians in one place where they are said to have feasted they are found in large quantities at an elevation of thirty feet above the river filling the soil to the depth of a foot and mingled with ashes and indian remains  the works we have placed at the head of our chapter with as much license as the preacher selects his text are such as imply more labor than enthusiasm the state wanted complete catalogues of its natural riches with such additional facts merely as would be directly useful  the reports on fishes reptiles insects and invertebrate animals however indicate labor and research and have a value independent of the object of the legislature  those on herbaceous plants and birds cannot be of much value as long as bigelow and nuttall are accessible they serve but to indicate with more or less exactness what species are found in the state we detect several errors ourselves and a more practised eye would no doubt expand the list  the quadrupeds deserved a more final and instructive report than they have obtained  these volumes deal much in measurements and minute descriptions not interesting to the general reader with only here and there a colored sentence to allure him like those plants growing in dark forests which bear only leaves without blossoms but the ground was comparatively unbroken and we will not complain of the pioneer if he raises no flowers with his first crop let us not underrate the value of a fact it will one day flower in a truth it is astonishing how few facts of importance are added in a century to the natural history of any animal the natural history of man himself is still being gradually written men are knowing enough after their fashion every countryman and dairymaid knows that the coats of the fourth stomach of the calf will curdle milk and what particular mushroom is a safe and nutritious diet you cannot go into any field or wood but it will seem as if every stone had been turned and the bark on every tree ripped up but after all it is much easier to discover than to see when the cover is off it has been well said that the attitude of inspection is prone wisdom does not inspect but behold we must look a long time before we can see slow are the beginnings of philosophy he has something demoniacal in him who can discern a law or couple two facts we can imagine a time whenwater runs down hillmay have been taught in the schools the true man of science will know nature better by his finer organization he will smell taste see hear feel better than other men his will be a deeper and finer experience we do not learn by inference and deduction and the application of mathematics to philosophy but by direct intercourse and sympathy it is with science as with ethicswe cannot know truth by contrivance and method the baconian is as false as any other and with all the helps of machinery and the arts the most scientific will still be the healthiest and friendliest man and possess a more perfect indian wisdom    a walk to wachusett  1843    the needles of the pine   all to the west incline  concord july 19 1842  summer and winter our eyes had rested on the dim outline of the mountains in our horizon to which distance and indistinctness lent a grandeur not their own so that they served equally to interpret all the allusions of poets and travellers whether with homer on a spring morning we sat down on the manypeaked olympus or with virgil and his compeers roamed the etrurian and thessalian hills or with humboldt measured the more modern andes and teneriffe thus we spoke our mind to them standing on the concord cliffs  with frontier strength ye stand your ground with grand content ye circle round tumultuous silence for all sound ye distant nursery of rills monadnock and the peterboro hills like some vast fleet sailing through rain and sleet through winters cold and summers heat still holding on upon your high emprise until ye find a shore amid the skies not skulking close to land with cargo contraband for they who sent a venture out by ye have set the sun to see their honesty ships of the line each one ye to the westward run always before the gale under a press of sail with weight of metal all untold i seem to feel ye in my firm seat here immeasurable depth of hold and breadth of beam and length of running gear  methinks ye take luxurious pleasure in your novel western leisure so cool your brows and freshly blue as time had nought for ye to do for ye lie at your length an unappropriated strength unhewn primeval timber for knees so stiff for masts so limber the stock of which new earths are made one day to be our western trade fit for the stanchions of a world which through the seas of space is hurled  while we enjoy a lingering ray ye still oertop the western day reposing yonder on gods croft like solid stacks of hay edged with silver and with gold the clouds hang oer in damask fold and with such depth of amber light the west is dight where still a few rays slant that even heaven seems extravagant on the earths edge mountains and trees stand as they were on air graven or as the vessels in a haven await the morning breeze i fancy even through your defiles windeth the way to heaven and yonder still in spite of historys page linger the golden and the silver age upon the laboring gale the news of future centuries is brought and of new dynasties of thought from your remotest vale  but special i remember thee wachusett who like me standest alone without society thy far blue eye a remnant of the sky seen through the clearing or the gorge or from the windows on the forge doth leaven all it passes by nothing is true but stands tween me and you thou western pioneer who knowst not shame nor fear by venturous spirit driven under the eaves of heaven and canst expand thee there and breathe enough of air upholding heaven holding down earth thy pastime from thy birth not steadied by the one nor leaning on the other may i approve myself thy worthy brother  at length like rasselas and other inhabitants of happy valleys we resolved to scale the blue wall which bound the western horizon though not without misgivings that thereafter no visible fairy land would exist for us but we will not leap at once to our journeys end though near but imitate homer who conducts his reader over the plain and along the resounding sea though it be but to the tent of achilles in the spaces of thought are the reaches of land and water where men go and come the landscape lies far and fair within and the deepest thinker is the farthest travelled  at a cool and early hour on a pleasant morning in july my companion and i passed rapidly through acton and stow stopping to rest and refresh us on the bank of a small stream a tributary of the assabet in the latter town as we traversed the cool woods of acton with stout staves in our hands we were cheered by the song of the redeye the thrushes the phoebe and the cuckoo and as we passed through the open country we inhaled the fresh scent of every field and all nature lay passive to be viewed and travelled every rail every farmhouse seen dimly in the twilight every tinkling sound told of peace and purity and we moved happily along the dank roads enjoying not such privacy as the day leaves when it withdraws but such as it has not profaned it was solitude with light which is better than darkness but anon the sound of the mowers rifle was heard in the fields and this too mingled with the lowing kine  this part of our route lay through the country of hops which plant perhaps supplies the want of the vine in american scenery and may remind the traveller of italy and the south of france whether he traverses the country when the hopfields as then present solid and regular masses of verdure hanging in graceful festoons from pole to pole the cool coverts where lurk the gales which refresh the wayfarer or in september when the women and children and the neighbors from far and near are gathered to pick the hops into long troughs or later still when the poles stand piled in vast pyramids in the yards or lie in heaps by the roadside  the culture of the hop with the processes of picking drying in the kiln and packing for the market as well as the uses to which it is applied so analogous to the culture and uses of the grape may afford a theme for future poets  the mower in the adjacent meadow could not tell us the name of the brook on whose banks we had rested or whether it had any but his younger companion perhaps his brother knew that it was great brook though they stood very near together in the field the things they knew were very far apart nor did they suspect each others reserved knowledge till the stranger came by in bolton while we rested on the rails of a cottage fence the strains of music which issued from within probably in compliment to us sojourners reminded us that thus far men were fed by the accustomed pleasures so soon did we wayfarers begin to learn that mans life is rounded with the same few facts the same simple relations everywhere and it is vain to travel to find it new the flowers grow more various ways than he but coming soon to higher land which afforded a prospect of the mountains we thought we had not travelled in vain if it were only to hear a truer and wilder pronunciation of their names from the lips of the inhabitants not waytatic waychusett but wortatic worchusett it made us ashamed of our tame and civil pronunciation and we looked upon them as born and bred farther west than we their tongues had a more generous accent than ours as if breath was cheaper where they wagged a countryman who speaks but seldom talks copiously as it were as his wife sets cream and cheese before you without stint before noon we had reached the highlands overlooking the valley of lancaster affording the first fair and open prospect into the west and there on the top of a hill in the shade of some oaks near to where a spring bubbled out from a leaden pipe we rested during the heat of the day reading virgil and enjoying the scenery it was such a place as one feels to be on the outside of the earth for from it we could in some measure see the form and structure of the globe there lay wachusett the object of our journey lowering upon us with unchanged proportions though with a less ethereal aspect than had greeted our morning gaze while further north in successive order slumbered its sister mountains along the horizon  we could get no further into the aeneid than    atque altae moenia romae   and the wall of high rome  before we were constrained to reflect by what myriad tests a work of genius has to be tried that virgil away in rome two thousand years off should have to unfold his meaning the inspiration of italian vales to the pilgrim on new england hills this life so raw and modern that so civil and ancient and yet we read virgil mainly to be reminded of the identity of human nature in all ages and by the poets own account we are both the children of a late age and live equally under the reign of jupiter  he shook honey from the leaves and removed fire and stayed the wine everywhere flowing in rivers that experience by meditating might invent various arts by degrees and seek the blade of corn in furrows and strike out hidden fire from the veins of the flint  the old world stands serenely behind the new as one mountain yonder towers behind another more dim and distant rome imposes her story still upon this late generation the very children in the school we had that morning passed had gone through her wars and recited her alarms ere they had heard of the wars of neighboring lancaster the roving eye still rests inevitably on her hills and she still holds up the skirts of the sky on that side and makes the past remote  the lay of the land hereabouts is well worthy the attention of the traveller the hill on which we were resting made part of an extensive range running from southwest to northeast across the country and separating the waters of the nashua from those of the concord whose banks we had left in the morning and by bearing in mind this fact we could easily determine whither each brook was bound that crossed our path parallel to this and fifteen miles further west beyond the deep and broad valley in which lie groton shirley lancaster and boylston runs the wachusett range in the same general direction the descent into the valley on the nashua side is by far the most sudden and a couple of miles brought us to the southern branch of the nashua a shallow but rapid stream flowing between high and gravelly banks but we soon learned that there were no gelidae valles into which we had descended and missing the coolness of the morning air feared it had become the suns turn to try his power upon us    the sultry sun had gained the middle sky    and not a tree and not an herb was nigh  and with melancholy pleasure we echoed the melodious plaint of our fellowtraveller hassan in the desert    sad was the hour and luckless was the day    when first from schiraz walls i bent my way  the air lay lifeless between the hills as in a seething caldron with no leaf stirring and instead of the fresh odor of grass and clover with which we had before been regaled the dry scent of every herb seemed merely medicinal yielding therefore to the heat we strolled into the woods and along the course of a rivulet on whose banks we loitered observing at our leisure the products of these new fields he who traverses the woodland paths at this season will have occasion to remember the small drooping belllike flowers and slender red stem of the dogsbane and the coarser stem and berry of the poke which are both common in remoter and wilder scenes and if the sun casts such a reflecting heat from the sweet fern as makes him faint when he is climbing the bare hills as they complained who first penetrated into these parts the cool fragrance of the swamp pink restores him again when traversing the valleys between  as we went on our way late in the afternoon we refreshed ourselves by bathing our feet in every rill that crossed the road and anon as we were able to walk in the shadows of the hills recovered our morning elasticity passing through sterling we reached the banks of the stillwater in the western part of the town at evening where is a small village collected we fancied that there was already a certain western look about this place a smell of pines and roar of water recently confined by dams belying its name which were exceedingly grateful when the first inroad has been made a few acres levelled and a few houses erected the forest looks wilder than ever left to herself nature is always more or less civilized and delights in a certain refinement but where the axe has  encroached upon the edge of the forest the dead and unsightly limbs of the pine which she had concealed with green banks of verdure are exposed to sight this village had as yet no postoffice nor any settled name in the small villages which we entered the villagers gazed after us with a complacent almost compassionate look as if we were just making our debut in the world at a late hour nevertheless did they seem to say come and study us and learn men and manners so is each ones world but a clearing in the forest so much open and inclosed ground the landlord had not yet returned from the field with his men and the cows had yet to be milked but we remembered the inscription on the wall of the swedish inn you will find at trolhate excellent bread meat and wine provided you bring them with you and were contented but i must confess it did somewhat disturb our pleasure in this withdrawn spot to have our own village newspaper handed us by our host as if the greatest charm the country offered to the traveller was the facility of communication with the town let it recline on its own everlasting hills and not be looking out from their summits for some petty boston or new york in the horizon  at intervals we heard the murmuring of water and the slumberous breathing of crickets throughout the night and left the inn the next morning in the gray twilight after it had been hallowed by the night air and when only the innocent cows were stirring with a kind of regret it was only four miles to the base of the mountain and the scenery was already more picturesque our road lay along the course of the stillwater which was brawling at the bottom of a deep ravine filled with pines and rocks tumbling fresh from the mountains so soon alas to commence its career of usefulness at first a cloud hung between us and the summit but it was soon blown away as we gathered the raspberries which grew abundantly by the roadside we fancied that that action was consistent with a lofty prudence as if the traveller who ascends into a mountainous region should fortify himself by eating of such light ambrosial fruits as grow there and drinking of the springs which gush out from the mountain sides as he gradually inhales the subtler and purer atmosphere of those elevated places thus propitiating the mountain gods by a sacrifice of their own fruits the gross products of the plains and valleys are for such as dwell therein but it seemed to us that the juices of this berry had relation to the thin air of the mountaintops  in due time we began to ascend the mountain passing first through a grand sugar maple wood which bore the marks of the augur then a denser forest which gradually became dwarfed till there were no trees whatever we at length pitched our tent on the summit it is but nineteen hundred feet above the village of princeton and three thousand above the level of the sea but by this slight elevation it is infinitely removed from the plain and when we reached it we felt a sense of remoteness as if we had travelled into distant regions to arabia petrea or the farthest east a robin upon a staff was the highest object in sight swallows were flying about us and the chewink and cuckoo were heard near at hand the summit consists of a few acres destitute of trees covered with bare rocks interspersed with blueberry bushes raspberries gooseberries strawberries moss and a fine wiry grass the common yellow lily and dwarfcornel grow abundantly in the crevices of the rocks this clear space which is gently rounded is bounded a few feet lower by a thick shrubbery of oaks with maples aspens beeches cherries and occasionally a mountainash intermingled among which we found the bright blueberries of the solomons seal and the fruit of the pyrola from the foundation of a wooden observatory which was formerly erected on the highest point forming a rude hollow structure of stone a dozen feet in diameter and five or six in height we could see monadnock in simple grandeur in the northwest rising nearly a thousand feet higher still the far blue mountain though with an altered profile the first day the weather was so hazy that it was in vain we endeavored to unravel the obscurity it was like looking into the sky again and the patches of forest here and there seemed to flit like clouds over a lower heaven as to voyagers of an aërial polynesia the earth seemed like a larger island in the ether on every side even as low as we the sky shutting down like an unfathomable deep around it a blue pacific island where who knows what islanders inhabit and as we sail near its shores we see the waving of trees and hear the lowing of kine  we read virgil and wordsworth in our tent with new pleasure there while waiting for a clearer atmosphere nor did the weather prevent our appreciating the simple truth and beauty of peter bell  and he had lain beside his asses  on lofty cheviot hills  and he had trudged through yorkshire dales  among the rocks and winding scars  where deep and low the hamlets lie  beneath their little patch of sky  and little lot of stars  who knows but this hill may one day be a helvellyn or even a parnassus and the muses haunt here and other homers frequent the neighboring plains  not unconcerned wachusett rears his head   above the field so late from nature won with patient brow reserved as one who read   new annals in the history of man  the blueberries which the mountain afforded added to the milk we had brought made our frugal supper while for entertainment the evensong of the woodthrush rung along the ridge our eyes rested on no painted ceiling nor carpeted hall but on skies of natures painting and hills and forests of her embroidery before sunset we rambled along the ridge to the north while a hawk soared still above us it was a place where gods might wander so solemn and solitary and removed from all contagion with the plain as the evening came on the haze was condensed in vapor and the landscape became more distinctly visible and numerous sheets of water were brought to light  et jam summa procul villarum culmina fumant majoresque cadunt altis de montibus umbrae  and now the tops of the villas smoke afar off and the shadows fall longer from the high mountains  as we stood on the stone tower while the sun was setting we saw the shades of night creep gradually over the valleys of the east and the inhabitants went into their houses and shut their doors while the moon silently rose up and took possession of that part and then the same scene was repeated on the west side as far as the connecticut and the green mountains and the suns rays fell on us two alone of all new england men  it was the night but one before the full of the moon so bright that we could see to read distinctly by moonlight and in the evening strolled over the summit without danger there was by chance a fire blazing on monadnock that night which lighted up the whole western horizon and by making us aware of a community of mountains made our position seem less solitary but at length the wind drove us to the shelter of our tent and we closed its door for the night and fell asleep  it was thrilling to hear the wind roar over the rocks at intervals when we waked for it had grown quite cold and windy the night was in its elements simple even to majesty in that bleak placea bright moonlight and a piercing wind it was at no time darker than twilight within the tent and we could easily see the moon through its transparent roof as we lay for there was the moon still above us with jupiter and saturn on either hand looking down on wachusett and it was a satisfaction to know that they were our fellowtravellers still as high and out of our reach as our own destiny truly the stars were given for a consolation to man we should not know but our life were fated to be always grovelling but it is permitted to behold them and surely they are deserving of a fair destiny we see laws which never fail of whose failure we never conceived and their lamps burn all the night too as well as all day so rich and lavish is that nature which can afford this superfluity of light  the morning twilight began as soon as the moon had set and we arose and kindled our fire whose blaze might have been seen for thirty miles around as the daylight increased it was remarkable how rapidly the wind went down there was no dew on the summit but coldness supplied its place when the dawn had reached its prime we enjoyed the view of a distinct horizon line and could fancy ourselves at sea and the distant hills the waves in the horizon as seen from the deck of a vessel the cherrybirds flitted around us the nuthatch and flicker were heard among the bushes the titmouse perched within a few feet and the song of the woodthrush again rung along the ridge at length we saw the sun rise up out of the sea and shine on massachusetts and from this moment the atmosphere grew more and more transparent till the time of our departure and we began to realize the extent of the view and how the earth in some degree answered to the heavens in breadth the white villages to the constellations in the sky there was little of the sublimity and grandeur which belong to mountain scenery but an immense landscape to ponder on a summers day we could see how ample and roomy is nature as far as the eye could reach there was little life in the landscape the few birds that flitted past did not crowd the travellers on the remote highways which intersect the country on every side had no fellowtravellers for miles before or behind on every side the eye ranged over successive circles of towns rising one above another like the terraces of a vineyard till they were lost in the horizon wachusett is in fact the observatory of the state there lay massachusetts spread out before us in its length and breadth like a map there was the level horizon which told of the sea on the east and south the wellknown hills of new hampshire on the north and the misty summits of the hoosac and green mountains first made visible to us the evening before blue and unsubstantial like some bank of clouds which the morning wind would dissipate on the northwest and west these last distant ranges on which the eye rests unwearied commence with an abrupt boulder in the north beyond the connecticut and travel southward with three or four peaks dimly seen but monadnock rearing its masculine front in the northwest is the grandest feature as we beheld it we knew that it was the height of land between the two rivers on this side the valley of the merrimack or that of the connecticut fluctuating with their blue seas of airthese rival vales already teeming with yankee men along their respective streams born to what destiny who shall tell watatic and the neighboring hills in this state and in new hampshire are a continuation of the same elevated range on which we were standing but that new hampshire bluffthat promontory of a statelowering day and night on this our state of massachusetts will longest haunt our dreams  we could at length realize the place mountains occupy on the land and how they come into the general scheme of the universe when first we climb their summits and observe their lesser irregularities we do not give credit to the comprehensive intelligence which shaped them but when afterward we behold their outlines in the horizon we confess that the hand which moulded their opposite slopes making one to balance the other worked round a deep centre and was privy to the plan of the universe so is the least part of nature in its bearings referred to all space these lesser mountain ranges as well as the alleghanies run from northeast to southwest and parallel with these mountain streams are the more fluent rivers answering to the general direction of the coast the bank of the great ocean stream itself even the clouds with their thin bars fall into the same direction by preference and such even is the course of the prevailing winds and the migration of men and birds a mountainchain determines many things for the statesman and philosopher the improvements of civilization rather creep along its sides than cross its summit how often is it a barrier to prejudice and fanaticism in passing over these heights of land through their thin atmosphere the follies of the plain are refined and purified and as many species of plants do not scale their summits so many species of folly no doubt do not cross the alleghanies it is only the hardy mountain plant that creeps quite over the ridge and descends into the valley beyond  we get a dim notion of the flight of birds especially of such as fly high in the air by having ascended a mountain we can now see what landmarks mountains are to their migrations how the catskills and highlands have hardly sunk to them when wachusett and monadnock open a passage to the northeast how they are guided too in their course by the rivers and valleys and who knows but by the stars as well as the mountain ranges and not by the petty landmarks which we use the bird whose eye takes in the green mountains on the one side and the ocean on the other need not be at a loss to find its way  at noon we descended the mountain and having returned to the abodes of men turned our faces to the east again measuring our progress from time to time by the more ethereal hues which the mountain assumed passing swiftly through stillwater and sterling as with a downward impetus we found ourselves almost at home again in the green meadows of lancaster so like our own concord for both are watered by two streams which unite near their centres and have many other features in common there is an unexpected refinement about this scenery level prairies of great extent interspersed with elms and hopfields and groves of trees give it almost a classic appearance this it will be remembered was the scene of mrs kowlandsons capture and of other events in the indian wars but from this july afternoon and under that mild exterior those times seemed as remote as the irruption of the goths they were the dark age of new england on beholding a picture of a new england village as it then appeared with a fair open prospect and a light on trees and river as if it were broad noon we find we had not thought the sun shone in those days or that men lived in broad daylight then we do not imagine the sun shining on hill and valley during philips war nor on the warpath of paugus or standish or church or lovell with serene summer weather but a dim twilight or night did those events transpire in they must have fought in the shade of their own dusky deeds  at length as we plodded along the dusty roads our thoughts became as dusty as they all thought indeed stopped thinking broke down or proceeded only passively in a sort of rhythmical cadence of the confused material of thought and we found ourselves mechanically repeating some familiar measure which timed with our tread some verse of the robin hood ballads for instance which one can recommend to travel by  swearers are swift sayd lyttle john as the wind blows over the hill for if it be never so loud this night tomorrow it may be still  and so it went up hill and down till a stone interrupted the line when a new verse was chosen  his shoote it was but loosely shot   yet flewe not the arrowe in vaine for it met one of the sheriffes men   and williamatrent was slaine  there is however this consolation to the most wayworn traveller upon the dustiest road that the path his feet describe is so perfectly symbolical of human lifenow climbing the hills now descending into the vales from the summits he beholds the heavens and the horizon from the vales he looks up to the heights again he is treading his old lessons still and though he may be very weary and travelworn it is yet sincere experience  leaving the nashua we changed our route a little and arrived at stillriver village in the western part of harvard just as the sun was setting from this place which lies to the northward upon the western slope of the same range of hills on which we had spent the noon before in the adjacent town the prospect is beautiful and the grandeur of the mountain outlines unsurpassed there was such a repose and quiet here at this hour as if the very hillsides were enjoying the scene and we passed slowly along looking back over the country we had traversed and listening to the evening song of the robin we could not help contrasting the equanimity of nature with the bustle and impatience of man his words and actions presume always a crisis near at hand but she is forever silent and unpretending  and now that we have returned to the desultory life of the plain let us endeavor to import a little of that mountain grandeur into it we will remember within what walls we lie and understand that this level life too has its summit and why from the mountaintop the deepest valleys have a tinge of blue that there is elevation in every hour as no part of the earth is so low that the heavens may not be seen from and we have only to stand on the summit of our hour to command an uninterrupted horizon  we rested that night at harvard and the next morning while one bent his steps to the nearer village of groton the other took his separate and solitary way to the peaceful meadows of concord but let him not forget to record the brave hospitality of a farmer and his wife who generously entertained him at their board though the poor wayfarer could only congratulate the one on the continuance of hayweather and silently accept the kindness of the other refreshed by this instance of generosity no less than by the substantial viands set before him he pushed forward with new vigor and reached the banks of the concord before the sun had climbed many degrees into the heavens    the landlord  1843   under the one word house are included the schoolhouse the almshouse the jail the tavern the dwellinghouse and the meanest shed or cave in which men live contains the elements of all these but nowhere on the earth stands the entire and perfect house the parthenon st peters the gothic minster the palace the hovel are but imperfect executions of an imperfect idea who would dwell in them perhaps to the eye of the gods the cottage is more holy than the parthenon for they look down with no especial favor upon the shrines formally dedicated to them and that should be the most sacred roof which shelters most of humanity surely then the gods who are most interested in the human race preside over the tavern where especially men congregate methinks i see the thousand shrines erected to hospitality shining afar in all countries as well mahometan and jewish as christian khans and caravansaries and inns whither all pilgrims without distinction resort  likewise we look in vain east or west over the earth to find the perfect man but each represents only some particular excellence the landlord is a man of more open and general sympathies who possesses a spirit of hospitality which is its own reward and feeds and shelters men from pure love of the creatures to be sure this profession is as often filled by imperfect characters and such as have sought it from unworthy motives as any other but so much the more should we prize the true and honest landlord when we meet with him  who has not imagined to himself a country inn where the traveller shall really feel in and at home and at his publichouse who was before at his private house whose host is indeed a host and a lord of the land a selfappointed brother of his race called to his place beside by all the winds of heaven and his good genius as truly as the preacher is called to preach a man of such universal sympathies and so broad and genial a human nature that he would fain sacrifice the tender but narrow ties of private friendship to a broad sunshiny fairweatherandfoul friendship for his race who loves men not as a philosopher with philanthropy nor as an overseer of the poor with charity but by a necessity of his nature as he loves dogs and horses and standing at his open door from morning till night would fain see more and more of them come along the highway and is never satiated to him the sun and moon are but travellers the one by day and the other by night and they too patronize his house to his imagination all things travel save his signpost and himself and though you may be his neighbor for years he will show you only the civilities of the road but on the other hand while nations and individuals are alike selfish and exclusive he loves all men equally and if he treats his nearest neighbor as a stranger since he has invited all nations to share his hospitality the farthest travelled is in some measure kindred to him who takes him into the bosom of his family  he keeps a house of entertainment at the sign of the black horse or the spread eagle and is known far and wide and his fame travels with increasing radius every year all the neighborhood is in his interest and if the traveller ask how far to a tavern he receives some such answer as this well sir theres a house about three miles from here where they havent taken down their sign yet but its only ten miles to slocums and thats a capital house both for man and beast at three miles he passes a cheerless barrack standing desolate behind its signpost neither public nor private and has glimpses of a discontented couple who have mistaken their calling at ten miles see where the tavern standsreally an entertaining prospectso public and inviting that only the rain and snow do not enter it is no gay pavilion made of bright stuffs and furnished with nuts and gingerbread but as plain and sincere as a caravansary located in no tarrytown where you receive only the civilities of commerce but far in the fields it exercises a primitive hospitality amid the fresh scent of new hay and raspberries if it be summer time and the tinkling of cowbells from invisible pastures for it is a land flowing with milk and honey and the newest milk courses in a broad deep stream across the premises  in these retired places the tavern is first of all a houseelsewhere last of all or neverand warms and shelters its inhabitants it is as simple and sincere in its essentials as the caves in which the first men dwelt but it is also as open and public the traveller steps across the threshold and lo he too is master for he only can be called proprietor of the house here who behaves with most propriety in it the landlord stands clear back in nature to my imagination with his axe and spade felling trees and raising potatoes with the vigor of a pioneer with promethean energy making nature yield her increase to supply the wants of so many and he is not so exhausted nor of so short a stride but that he comes forward even to the highway to this wide hospitality and publicity surely he has solved some of the problems of life he comes in at his backdoor holding a log fresh cut for the hearth upon his shoulder with one hand while he greets the newly arrived traveller with the other  here at length we have free range as not in palaces nor cottages nor temples and intrude nowhere all the secrets of housekeeping are exhibited to the eyes of men above and below before and behind this is the necessary way to live men have confessed in these days and shall he skulk and hide and why should we have any serious disgust at kitchens perhaps they are the holiest recess of the house there is the hearth after alland the settle and the fagots and the kettle and the crickets we have pleasant reminiscences of these they are the heart the left ventricle the very vital part of the house here the real and sincere life which we meet in the streets was actually fed and sheltered here burns the taper that cheers the lonely traveller by night and from this hearth ascend the smokes that populate the valley to his eyes by day on the whole a man may not be so little ashamed of any other part of his house for here is his sincerity and earnest at least it may not be here that the besoms are plied mostit is not here that they need to be for dust will not settle on the kitchen floor more than in nature  hence it will not do for the landlord to possess too fine a nature he must have health above the common accidents of life subject to no modern fashionable diseases but no taste rather a vast relish or appetite his sentiments on all subjects will be delivered as freely as the wind blows there is nothing private or individual in them though still original but they are public and of the hue of the heavens over his housea certain outofdoor obviousness and transparency not to be disputed what he does his manners are not to be complained of though abstractly offensive for it is what man does and in him the race is exhibited when he eats he is liver and bowels and the whole digestive apparatus to the company and so all admit the thing is done he must have no idiosyncrasies no particular bents or tendencies to this or that but a general uniform and healthy development such as his portly person indicates offering himself equally on all sides to men he is not one of your peaked and inhospitable men of genius with particular tastes but as we said before has one uniform relish and taste which never aspires higher than a tavernsign or the cut of a weathercock the man of genius like a dog with a bone or the slave who has swallowed a diamond or a patient with the gravel sits afar and retired off the road hangs out no sign of refreshment for man and beast but says by all possible hints and signs i wish to be alonegoodbyfarewell but the landlord can afford to live without privacy he entertains no private thought he cherishes no solitary hour no sabbath day but thinksenough to assert the dignity of reasonand talks and reads the newspaper what he does not tell to one traveller he tells to another he never wants to be alone but sleeps wakes eats drinks sociably still remembering his race he walks abroad through the thoughts of men and the iliad and shakspeare are tame to him who hears the rude but homely incidents of the road from every traveller the mail might drive through his brain in the midst of his most lonely soliloquy without disturbing his equanimity provided it brought plenty of news and passengers there can be no profanity where there is no fane behind and the whole world may see quite round him perchance his lines have fallen to him in dustier places and he has heroically sat down where two roads meet or at the four corners or the five points and his life is sublimely trivial for the good of men the dust of travel blows ever in his eyes and they preserve their clear complacent look the hourlies and halfhourlies the dailies and weeklies whirl on wellworn tracks round and round his house as if it were the goal in the stadium and still he sits within in unruffled serenity with no show of retreat his neighbor dwells timidly behind a screen of poplars and willows and a fence with sheaves of spears at regular intervals or defended against the tender palms of visitors by sharp spikesbut the travellers wheels rattle over the doorstep of the tavern and he cracks his whip in the entry he is truly glad to see you and sincere as the bullseye over his door the traveller seeks to find wherever he goes some one who will stand in this broad and catholic relation to him who will be an inhabitant of the land to him a stranger and represent its human nature as the rock stands for its inanimate nature and this is he as his crib furnishes provender for the travellers horse and his larder provisions for his appetite so his conversation furnishes the necessary aliment to his spirits he knows very well what a man wants for he is a man himself and as it were the farthest travelled though he has never stirred from his door he understands his needs and destiny he would be well fed and lodged there can be no doubt and have the transient sympathy of a cheerful companion and of a heart which always prophesies fair weather and after all the greatest men even want much more the sympathy which every honest fellow can give than that which the great only can impart if he is not the most upright let us allow him this praise that he is the most downright of men he has a hand to shake and to be shaken and takes a sturdy and unquestionable interest in you as if he had assumed the care of you but if you will break your neck he will even give you the best advice as to the method  the great poets have not been ungrateful to their landlords mine host of the tabard inn in the prologue to the canterbury tales was an honor to his profession  a semely man our hoste was with alle for to han been an marshal in an halle a large man he was with eyen stepe a fairer burgeis is ther nou in chepe bold of his speche and wise and well ytaught and of manhood him lacked righte naught eke thereto was he right a mery man and after souper plaien he began and spake of mirthe amonges other thinges whan that we hadden made our reckoninges  he is the true houseband and centre of the companyof greater fellowship and practical social talent than any he it is that proposes that each shall tell a tale to while away the time to canterbury and leads them himself and concludes with his own tale  now by my faders soule that is ded but ye be mery smiteth of my hed hold up your hondes withouten more speche  if we do not look up to the landlord we look round for him on all emergencies for he is a man of infinite experience who unites hands with wit he is a more public character than a statesmana publican and not consequently a sinner and surely he if any should be exempted from taxation and military duty  talking with our host is next best and instructive to talking with ones self it is a more conscious soliloquy as it were to speak generally and try what we would say provided we had an audience he has indulgent and open ears and does not require petty and particular statements heigho exclaims the traveller thems my sentiments thinks mine host and stands ready for what may come next expressing the purest sympathy by his demeanor hot as blazes says the otherhard weather sirnot much stirring nowadays says he he is wiser than to contradict his guest in any case he lets him go on he lets him travel  the latest sitter leaves him standing far in the night prepared to live right on while suns rise and set and his good night has as brisk a sound as his good morning and the earliest riser finds him tasting his liquors in the bar ere flies begin to buzz with a countenance fresh as the morning star over the sanded floorand not as one who had watched all night for travellers and yet if beds be the subject of conversation it will appear that no man has been a sounder sleeper in his time  finally as for his moral character we do not hesitate to say that he has no grain of vice or meanness in him but represents just that degree of virtue which all men relish without being obliged to respect he is a good man as his bitters are goodan unquestionable goodness not what is called a good mangood to be considered as a work of art in galleries and museumsbut a good fellow that is good to be associated with who ever thought of the religion of an innkeeperwhether he was joined to the church partook of the sacrament said his prayers feared god or the like no doubt he has had his experiences has felt a change and is a firm believer in the perseverance of the saints in this last we suspect does the peculiarity of his religion consist but he keeps an inn and not a conscience how many fragrant charities and sincere social virtues are implied in this daily offering of himself to the public he cherishes good will to all and gives the wayfarer as good and honest advice to direct him on his road as the priest  to conclude the tavern will compare favorably with the church the church is the place where prayers and sermons are delivered but the tavern is where they are to take effect and if the former are good the latter cannot be bad    a winter walk  1843   the wind has gently murmured through the blinds or puffed with feathery softness against the windows and occasionally sighed like a summer zephyr lifting the leaves along the livelong night the meadowmouse has slept in his snug gallery in the sod the owl has sat in a hollow tree in the depth of the swamp the rabbit the squirrel and the fox have all been housed the watchdog has lain quiet on the hearth and the cattle have stood silent in their stalls the earth itself has slept as it were its first not its last sleep save when some streetsign or woodhouse door has faintly creaked upon its hinge cheering forlorn nature at her midnight workthe only sound awake twixt venus and marsadvertising us of a remote inward warmth a divine cheer and fellowship where gods are met together but where it is very bleak for men to stand but while the earth has slumbered all the air has been alive with feathery flakes descending as if some northern ceres reigned showering her silvery grain over all the fields  we sleep and at length awake to the still reality of a winter morning the snow lies warm as cotton or down upon the windowsill the broadened sash and frosted panes admit a dim and private light which enhances the snug cheer within the stillness of the morning is impressive the floor creaks under our feet as we move toward the window to look abroad through some clear space over the fields we see the roofs stand under their snow burden from the eaves and fences hang stalactites of snow and in the yard stand stalagmites covering some concealed core the trees and shrubs rear white arms to the sky on every side and where were walls and fences we see fantastic forms stretching in frolic gambols across the dusky landscape as if nature had strewn her fresh designs over the fields by night as models for mans art  silently we unlatch the door letting the drift fall in and step abroad to face the cutting air already the stars have lost some of their sparkle and a dull leaden mist skirts the horizon a lurid brazen light in the east proclaims the approach of day while the western landscape is dim and spectral still and clothed in a sombre tartarian light like the shadowy realms they are infernal sounds only that you hearthe crowing of cocks the barking of dogs the chopping of wood the lowing of kine all seem to come from plutos barnyard and beyond the styxnot for any melancholy they suggest but their twilight bustle is too solemn and mysterious for earth the recent tracks of the fox or otter in the yard remind us that each hour of the night is crowded with events and the primeval nature is still working and making tracks in the snow opening the gate we tread briskly along the lone country road crunching the dry and crisped snow under our feet or aroused by the sharp clear creak of the woodsled just starting for the distant market from the early farmers door where it has lain the summer long dreaming amid the chips and stubble while far through the drifts and powdered windows we see the farmers early candle like a paled star emitting a lonely beam as if some severe virtue were at its matins there and one by one the smokes begin to ascend from the chimneys amidst the trees and snows  the sluggish smoke curls up from some deep dell the stiffened air exploring in the dawn and making slow acquaintance with the day delaying now upon its heavenward course in wreathed loiterings dallying with itself with as uncertain purpose and slow deed as its halfwakened master by the hearth whose mind still slumbering and sluggish thoughts have not yet swept into the onward current of the new dayand now it streams afar the while the chopper goes with step direct and mind intent to swing the early axe  first in the dusky dawn he sends abroad his early scout his emissary smoke the earliest latest pilgrim from the roof to feel the frosty air inform the day and while he crouches still beside the hearth nor musters courage to unbar the door it has gone down the glen with the light wind and oer the plain unfurled its venturous wreath draped the treetops loitered upon the hill and warmed the pinions of the early bird and now perchance high in the crispy air has caught sight of the day oer the earths edge and greets its masters eye at his low door as some refulgent cloud in the upper sky  we hear the sound of woodchopping at the farmers doors far over the frozen earth the baying of the housedog and the distant clarion of the cock though the thin and frosty air conveys only the finer particles of sound to our ears with short and sweet vibrations as the waves subside soonest on the purest and lightest liquids in which gross substances sink to the bottom they come clear and belllike and from a greater distance in the horizon as if there were fewer impediments than in summer to make them faint and ragged the ground is sonorous like seasoned wood and even the ordinary rural sounds are melodious and the jingling of the ice on the trees is sweet and liquid there is the least possible moisture in the atmosphere all being dried up or congealed and it is of such extreme tenuity and elasticity that it becomes a source of delight the withdrawn and tense sky seems groined like the aisles of a cathedral and the polished air sparkles as if there were crystals of ice floating in it as they who have resided in greenland tell us that when it freezes the sea smokes like burning turfland and a fog or mist arises called frostsmoke which cutting smoke frequently raises blisters on the face and hands and is very pernicious to the health but this pure stinging cold is an elixir to the lungs and not so much a frozen mist as a crystallized midsummer haze refined and purified by cold  the sun at length rises through the distant woods as if with the faint clashing swinging sound of cymbals melting the air with his beams and with such rapid steps the morning travels that already his rays are gilding the distant western mountains meanwhile we step hastily along through the powdery snow warmed by an inward heat enjoying an indian summer still in the increased glow of thought and feeling probably if our lives were more conformed to nature we should not need to defend ourselves against her heats and colds but find her our constant nurse and friend as do plants and quadrupeds if our bodies were fed with pure and simple elements and not with a stimulating and heating diet they would afford no more pasture for cold than a leafless twig but thrive like the trees which find even winter genial to their expansion  the wonderful purity of nature at this season is a most pleasing fact every decayed stump and mossgrown stone and rail and the dead leaves of autumn are concealed by a clean napkin of snow in the bare fields and tinkling woods see what virtue survives in the coldest and bleakest places the warmest charities still maintain a foothold a cold and searching wind drives away all contagion and nothing can withstand it but what has a virtue in it and accordingly whatever we meet with in cold and bleak places as the tops of mountains we respect for a sort of sturdy innocence a puritan toughness all things beside seem to be called in for shelter and what stays out must be part of the original frame of the universe and of such valor as god himself it is invigorating to breathe the cleansed air its greater fineness and purity are visible to the eye and we would fain stay out long and late that thegales may sigh through us too as through the leafless trees and fit us for the winteras if we hoped so to borrow some pure and steadfast virtue which will stead us in all seasons  there is a slumbering subterranean fire in nature which never goes out and which no cold can chill it finally melts the great snow and in january or july is only buried under a thicker or thinner covering in the coldest day it flows somewhere and the snow melts around every tree this field of winter rye which sprouted late in the fall and now speedily dissolves the snow is where the fire is very thinly covered we feel warmed by it in the winter warmth stands for all virtue and we resort in thought to a trickling rill with its bare stones shining in the sun and to warm springs in the woods with as much eagerness as rabbits and robins the steam which rises from swamps and pools is as dear and domestic as that of our own kettle what fire could ever equal the sunshine of a winters day when the meadow mice come out by the wallsides and the chicadee lisps in the defiles of the wood the warmth comes directly from the sun and is not radiated from the earth as in summer and when we feel his beams on our backs as we are treading some snowy dell we are grateful as for a special kindness and bless the sun which has followed us into that byplace  this subterranean fire has its altar in each mans breast for in the coldest day and on the bleakest hill the traveller cherishes a warmer fire within the folds of his cloak than is kindled on any hearth a healthy man indeed is the complement of the seasons and in winter summer is in his heart there is the south thither have all birds and insects migrated and around the warm springs in his breast are gathered the robin and the lark  at length having reached the edge of the woods and shut out the gadding town we enter within their covert as we go under the roof of a cottage and cross its threshold all ceiled and banked up with snow they are glad and warm still and as genial and cheery in winter as in summer as we stand in the midst of the pines in the nickering and checkered light which straggles but little way into their maze we wonder if the towns have ever heard their simple story it seems to us that no traveller has ever explored them and notwithstanding the wonders which science is elsewhere revealing every day who would not like to hear their annals our humble villages in the plain are their contribution we borrow from the forest the boards which shelter and the sticks which warm us how important is their evergreen to the winter that portion of the summer which does not fade the permanent year the unwithered grass thus simply and with little expense of altitude is the surface of the earth diversified what would human life be without forests those natural cities from the tops of mountains they appear like smooth shaven lawns yet whither shall we walk but in this taller grass  in this glade covered with bushes of a years growth see how the silvery dust lies on every seared leaf and twig deposited in such infinite and luxurious forms as by their very variety atone for the absence of color observe the tiny tracks of mice around every stem and the triangular tracks of the rabbit a pure elastic heaven hangs over all as if the impurities of the summer sky refined and shrunk by the chaste winters cold had been winnowed from the heavens upon the earth  nature confounds her summer distinctions at this season the heavens seem to be nearer the earth the elements are less reserved and distinct water turns to ice rain to snow the day is but a scandinavian night the winter is an arctic summer  how much more living is the life that is in nature the furred life which still survives the stinging nights and from amidst fields and woods covered with frost and snow sees the sun rise        the foodless wilds   pour forth their brown inhabitants  the gray squirrel and rabbit are brisk and playful in the remote glens even on the morning of the cold friday here is our lapland and labrador and for our esquimaux and knistenaux dogribbed indians novazemblaites and spitzbergeners are there not the icecutter and woodchopper the fox muskrat and mink  still in the midst of the arctic day we may trace the summer to its retreats and sympathize with some contemporary life stretched over the brooks in the midst of the frostbound meadows we may observe the submarine cottages of the caddiceworms the larvae of the plicipennes their small cylindrical cases built around themselves composed of flags sticks grass and withered leaves shells and pebbles in form and color like the wrecks which strew the bottomnow drifting along over the pebbly bottom now whirling in tiny eddies and dashing down steep falls or sweeping rapidly along with the current or else swaying to and fro at the end of some grassblade or root anon they will leave their sunken habitations and crawling up the stems of plants or to the surface like gnats as perfect insects henceforth flutter over the surface of the water or sacrifice their short lives in the flame of our candles at evening down yonder little glen the shrubs are drooping under their burden and the red alderberries contrast with the white ground here are the marks of a myriad feet which have already been abroad the sun rises as proudly over such a glen as over the valley of the seine or the tiber and it seems the residence of a pure and selfsubsistent valor such as they never witnessed which never knew defeat nor fear here reign the simplicity and purity of a primitive age and a health and hope far remote from towns and cities standing quite alone far in the forest while the wind is shaking down snow from the trees and leaving the only human tracks behind us we find our reflections of a richer variety than the life of cities the chicadee and nuthatch are more inspiring society than statesmen and philosophers and we shall return to these last as to more vulgar companions in this lonely glen with its brook draining the slopes its creased ice and crystals of all hues where the spruces and hemlocks stand up on either side and the rush and sere wild oats in the rivulet itself our lives are more serene and worthy to contemplate  as the day advances the heat of the sun is reflected by the hillsides and we hear a faint but sweet music where flows the rill released from its fetters and the icicles are melting on the trees and the nuthatch and partridge are heard and seen the south wind melts the snow at noon and the bare ground appears with its withered grass and leaves and we are invigorated by the perfume which exhales from it as by the scent of strong meats  let us go into this deserted woodmans hut and see how he has passed the long winter nights and the short and stormy days for here man has lived under this south hillside and it seems a civilized and public spot we have such associations as when the traveller stands by the ruins of palmyra or hecatompolis singing birds and flowers perchance have begun to appear here for flowers as well as weeds follow in the footsteps of man these hemlocks whispered over his head these hickory logs were his fuel and these pitchpine roots kindled his fire yonder fuming rill in the hollow whose thin and airy vapor still ascends as busily as ever though he is far off now was his well these hemlock boughs and the straw upon this raised platform were his bed and this broken dish held his drink but he has not been here this season for the phoebes built their nest upon this shelf last summer i find some embers left as if he had but just gone out where he baked his pot of beans and while at evening he smoked his pipe whose stemless bowl lies in the ashes chatted with his only companion if perchance he had any about the depth of the snow on the morrow already falling fast and thick without or disputed whether the last sound was the screech of an owl or the creak of a bough or imagination only and through this broad chimney throat in the late winter evening ere he stretched himself upon the straw he looked up to learn the progress of the storm and seeing the bright stars of cassiopeias chair shining brightly down upon him fell contentedly asleep see how many traces from which we may learn the choppers history from this stump we may guess the sharpness of his axe and from the slope of the stroke on which side he stood and whether he cut down the tree without going round it or changing hands and from the flexure of the splinters we may know which way it fell this one chip contains inscribed on it the whole history of the woodchopper and of the world on this scrap of paper which held his sugar or salt perchance or was the wadding of his gun sitting on a log in the forest with what interest we read the tattle of cities of those larger huts empty and to let like this in high streets and broadways the eaves are dripping on the south side of this simple roof while the titmouse lisps in the pine and the genial warmth of the sun around the door is somewhat kind and human  after two seasons this rude dwelling does not deform the scene already the birds resort to it to build their nests and you may track to its door the feet of many quadrupeds thus for a long time nature overlooks the encroachment and profanity ofman the wood still cheerfully and unsuspiciously echoes the strokes of the axe that fells it and while they are few and seldom they enhance its wildness and all the elements strive to naturalize the sound  now our path begins to ascend gradually to the top of this high hill from whose precipitous south side we can look over the broad country of forest and field and river to the distant snowy mountains see yonder thin column of smoke curling up through the woods from some invisible farmhouse the standard raised over some rural homestead there must be a warmer and more genial spot there below as where we detect the vapor from a spring forming a cloud above the trees what fine relations are established between the traveller who discovers this airy column from some eminence in the forest and him who sits below up goes the smoke as silently and naturally as the vapor exhales from the leaves and as busy disposing itself in wreathes as the housewife on the hearth below it is a hieroglyphic of mans life and suggests more intimate and important things than the boiling of a pot where its fine column rises above the forest like an ensign some human life has planted itselfand such is the beginning of rome the establishment of the arts and the foundation of empires whether on the prairies of america or the steppes of asia  and now we descend again to the brink of this woodland lake which lies in a hollow of the hills as if it were their expressed juice and that of the leaves which are annually steeped in it without outlet or inlet to the eye it has still its history in the lapse of its waves in the rounded pebbles on its shore and in the pines which grow down to its brink it has not been idle though sedentary but like abu musa teaches that sitting still at home is the heavenly way the going out is the way of the world yet in its evaporation it travels as far as any in summer it is the earths liquid eye a mirror in the breast of nature the sins of the wood are washed out in it see how the woods form an amphitheatre about it and it is an arena for all the genialness of nature all trees direct the traveller to its brink all paths seek it out birds fly to it quadrupeds flee to it and the very ground inclines toward it it is natures saloon where she has sat down to her toilet consider her silent economy and tidiness how the sun comes with his evaporation to sweep the dust from its surface each morning and a fresh surface is constantly welling up and annually after whatever impurities have accumulated herein its liquid transparency appears again in the spring in summer a hushed music seems to sweep across its surface but now a plain sheet of snow conceals it from our eyes except where the wind has swept the ice bare and the sere leaves are gliding from side to side tacking and veering on their tiny voyages here is one just keeled up against a pebble on shove a dry beechleaf rocking still as if it would start again a skilful engineer methinks might project its course since it fell from the parent stem here are all the elements for such a calculation its present position the direction of the wind the level of the pond and how much more is given in its scarred edges and veins is its log rolled up  we fancy ourselves in the interior of a larger house the surface of the pond is our deal table or sanded floor and the woods rise abruptly from its edge like the walls of a cottage the lines set to catch pickerel through the ice look like a larger culinary preparation and the men stand about on the white ground like pieces of forest furniture the actions of these men at the distance of half a mile over the ice and snow impress us as when we read the exploits of alexander in history they seem not unworthy of the scenery and as momentous as the conquest of kingdoms  again we have wandered through the arches of the wood until from its skirts we hear the distant booming of ice from yonder bay of the river as if it were moved by some other and subtler tide than oceans know to me it has a strange sound of home thrilling as the voice of ones distant and noble kindred a mild summer sun shines over forest and lake and though there is but one green leaf for many rods yet nature enjoys a serene health every sound is fraught with the same mysterious assurance of health as well now the creaking of the boughs in january as the soft sough of the wind in july  when winter fringes every bough   with his fantastic wreath and puts the seal of silence now   upon the leaves beneath  when every stream in its penthouse   goes gurgling on its way and in his gallery the mouse   nibbleth the meadow hay  methinks the summer still is nigh   and lurketh underneath as that same meadowmouse doth lie   snug in that last years heath  and if perchance the chicadee   lisp a faint note anon the snow is summers canopy   which she herself put on  fair blossoms deck the cheerful trees   and dazzling fruits depend the north wind sighs a summer breeze   the nipping frosts to fend  bringing glad tidings unto me   the while i stand all ear of a serene eternity   which need not winter fear  out on the silent pond straightway   the restless ice doth crack and pond sprites merry gambols play   amid the deafening rack  eager i hasten to the vale   as if i heard brave news how nature held high festival   which it were hard to lose  i gambol with my neighbor ice   and sympathizing quake as each new crack darts in a trice   across the gladsome lake  one with the cricket in the ground   and fagot on the hearth resounds the rare domestic sound   along the forest path  before night we will take a journey on skates along the course of this meandering river as full of novelty to one who sits by the cottage fire all the winters day as if it were over the polar ice with captain parry or franklin following the winding of the stream now flowing amid hills now spreading out into fair meadows and forming a myriad coves and bays where the pine and hemlock overarch the river flows in the rear of the towns and we see all things from a new and wilder side the fields and gardens come down to it with a frankness and freedom from pretension which they do not wear on the highway it is the outside and edge of the earth our eyes are not offended by violent contrasts the last rail of the farmers fence is some swaying willow bough which still preserves its freshness and here at length all fences stop and we no longer cross any road we may go far up within the country now by the most retired and level road never climbing a hill but by broad levels ascending to the upland meadows it is a beautiful illustration of the law of obedience the flow of a river the path for a sick man a highway down which an acorn cup may float secure with its freight its slight occasional falls whose precipices would not diversify the landscape are celebrated by mist and spray and attract the traveller from far and near from the remote interior its current conducts him by broad and easy steps or by one gentle inclined plane to the sea thus by an early and constant yielding to the inequalities of the ground it secures itself the easiest passage  no domain of nature is quite closed to man at all times and now we draw near to the empire of the fishes our feet glide swiftly over unfathomed depths where in summer our line tempted the pout and perch and where the stately pickerel lurked in the long corridors formed by the bulrushes the deep impenetrable marsh where the heron waded and bittern squatted is made pervious to our swift shoes as if a thousand railroads had been made into it with one impulse we are carried to the cabin of the muskrat that earliest settler and see him dart away under the transparent ice like a furred fish to his hole in the bank and we glide rapidly over meadows where lately the mower whet his scythe through beds of frozen cranberries mixed with meadow grass we skate near to where the blackbird the pewee and the kingbird hung their nests over the water and the hornets builded from the maple in the swamp how many gay warblers following the sun have radiated from this nest of silverbirch and thistledown on the swamps outer edge was hung the supermarine village where no foot penetrated in this hollow tree the woodduck reared her brood and slid away each day to forage in yonder fen  in winter nature is a cabinet of curiosities full of dried specimens in their natural order and position the meadows and forests are a hortus siccus the leaves and grasses stand perfectly pressed by the air without screw or gum and the birds nests are not hung on an artificial twig but where they builded them we go about dryshod to inspect the summers work in the rank swamp and see what a growth have got the alders the willows and the maples testifying to how many warm suns and fertilizing dews and showers see what strides their boughs took in the luxuriant summerand anon these dormant buds will carry them onward and upward another span into the heavens  occasionally we wade through fields of snow under whose depths the river is lost for many rods to appear again to the right or left where we least expected still holding on its way underneath with a faint stertorous rumbling sound as if like the bear and marmot it too had hibernated and we had followed its faint summertrail to where it earthed itself in snow and ice at first we should have thought that rivers would be empty and dry in midwinter or else frozen solid till the spring thawed them but their volume is not diminished even for only a superficial cold bridges their surface the thousand springs which feed the lakes and streams are flowing still the issues of a few surface springs only are closed and they go to swell the deep reservoirs natures wells are below the frost the summer brooks are not filled with snowwater nor does the mower quench his thirst with that alone the streams are swollen when the snow melts in the spring because natures work has been delayed the water being turned into ice and snow whose particles are less smooth and round and do not find their level so soon  far over the ice between the hemlock woods and snowclad hills stands the pickerel fisher his lines set in some retired cove like a finlander with his arms thrust into the pouches of his dreadnought with dull snowy fishy thoughts himself a finless fish separated a few inches from his race dumb erect and made to be enveloped in clouds and snows like the pines on shore in these wild scenes men stand about in the scenery or move deliberately and heavily having sacrificed the sprightliness and vivacity of towns to the dumb sobriety of nature he does not make the scenery less wild more than the jays and muskrats but stands there as a part of it as the natives are represented in the voyages of early navigators at nootka sound and on the northwest coast with their furs about them before they were tempted to loquacity by a scrap of iron he belongs to the natural family of man and is planted deeper in nature and has more root than the inhabitants of towns go to him ask what luck and you will learn that he too is a worshipper of the unseen hear with what sincere deference and waving gesture in his tone he speaks of the lake pickerel which he has never seen his primitive and ideal race of pickerel he is connected with the shore still as by a fishline and yet remembers the season when he took fish through the ice on the pond while the peas were up in his garden at home  but now while we have loitered the clouds have gathered again and a few straggling snowflakes are beginning to descend faster and faster they fall shutting out the distant objects from sight the snow falls on every wood and field and no crevice is forgotten by the river and the pond on the hill and in the valley quadrupeds are confined to their coverts and the birds sit upon their perches this peaceful hour there is not so much sound as in fair weather but silently and gradually every slope and the gray walls and fences and the polished ice and the sere leaves which were not buried before are concealed and the tracks of men and beasts are lost with so little effort does nature reassert her rule and blot out the traces of men hear how homer has described the same the snowflakes fall thick and fast on a winters day the winds are lulled and the snow falls incessant covering the tops of the mountains and the hills and the plains where the lotustree grows and the cultivated fields and they are falling by the inlets and shores of the foaming sea but are silently dissolved by the waves the snow levels all things and infolds them deeper in the bosom of nature as in the slow summer vegetation creeps up to the entablature of the temple and the turrets of the castle and helps her to prevail over art  the surly nightwind rustles through the wood and warns us to retrace our steps while the sun goes down behind the thickening storm and birds seek their roosts and cattle their stalls        drooping the labrer ox   stands covered oer with snow and now demands   the fruit of all his toil  though winter is represented in the almanac as an old man facing the wind and sleet and drawing his cloak about him we rather think of him as a merry woodchopper and warmblooded youth as blithe as summer the unexplored grandeur of the storm keeps up the spirits of the traveller it does not trifle with us but has a sweet earnestness in winter we lead a more inward life our hearts are warm and cheery like cottages under drifts whose windows and doors are half concealed but from whose chimneys the smoke cheerfully ascends the imprisoning drifts increase the sense of comfort which the house affords and in the coldest days we are content to sit over the hearth and see the sky through the chimney top enjoying the quiet and serene life that may be had in a warm corner by the chimney side or feeling our pulse by listening to the low of cattle in the street or the sound of the flail in distant barns all the long afternoon no doubt a skilful physician could determine our health by observing how these simple and natural sounds affected us we enjoy now not an oriental but a boreal leisure around warm stoves and fireplaces and watch the shadow of motes in the sunbeams  sometimes our fate grows too homely and familiarly serious ever to be cruel consider how for three months the human destiny is wrapped in furs the good hebrew revelation takes no cognizance of all this cheerful snow is there no religion for the temperate and frigid zones we know of no scripture which records the pure benignity of the gods on a new england winter night their praises have never been sung only their wrath deprecated the best scripture after all records but a meagre faith its saints live reserved and austere let a brave devout man spend the year in the woods of maine or labrador and see if the hebrew scriptures speak adequately to his condition and experience from the setting in of winter to the breaking up of the ice  now commences the long winter evening around the farmers hearth when the thoughts of the indwellers travel far abroad and men are by nature and necessity charitable and liberal to all creatures now is the happy resistance to cold when the farmer reaps his reward and thinks of his preparedness for winter and through the glittering panes sees with equanimity the mansion of the northern bear for now the storm is over        the full ethereal round infinite worlds disclosing to the view shines out intensely keen and all one cope of starry glitter glows from pole to pole    the succession of forest trees an address read to the middlesex agricultural society in concord september 1860  every man is entitled to come to cattleshow even a transcendentalist and for my part i am more interested in the men than in the cattle i wish to see once more those old familiar faces whose names i do not know which for me represent the middlesex country and come as near being indigenous to the soil as a white man can the men who are not above their business whose coats are not too black whose shoes do not shine very much who never wear gloves to conceal their hands it is true there are some queer specimens of humanity attracted to our festival but all are welcome i am pretty sure to meet once more that weakminded and whimsical fellow generally weakbodied too who prefers a crooked stick for a cane perfectly useless you would say only bizarre fit for a cabinet like a petrified snake a rams horn would be as convenient and is yet more curiously twisted he brings that much indulged bit of the country with him from some towns end or other and introduces it to concord groves as if he had promised it so much sometime so some it seems to me elect their rulers for their crookedness but i think that a straight stick makes the best cane and an upright man the best ruler or why choose a man to do plain work who is distinguished for his oddity however i do not know but you will think that they have committed this mistake who invited me to speak to you today  in my capacity of surveyor i have often talked with some of you my employers at your dinnertables after having gone round and round and behind your farming and ascertained exactly what its limits were moreover taking a surveyors and a naturalists liberty i have been in the habit of going across your lots much oftener than is usual as many of you perhaps to your sorrow are aware yet many of you to my relief have seemed not to be aware of it and when i came across you in some outoftheway nook of your farms have inquired with an air of surprise if i were not lost since you had never seen me in that part of the town or county before when if the truth were known and it had not been for betraying my secret i might with more propriety have inquired if you were not lost since i had never seen you there before i have several times shown the proprietor the shortest way out of his woodlot  therefore it would seem that i have some title to speak to you today and considering what that title is and the occasion that has called us together i need offer no apology if i invite your attention for the few moments that are allotted me to a purely scientific subject  at those dinnertables referred to i have often been asked as many of you have been if i could tell how it happened that when a pine wood was cut down an oak one commonly sprang up and vice versa to which i have answered and now answer that i can tellthat it is no mystery to me as i am not aware that this has been clearly shown by any one i shall lay the more stress on this point let me lead you back into your woodlots again  when hereabouts a single forest tree or a forest springs up naturally where none of its kind grew before i do not hesitate to say though in some quarters still it may sound paradoxical that it came from a seed of the various ways by which trees are known to be propagatedby transplanting cuttings and the likethis is the only supposable one under these circumstances no such tree has ever been known to spring from anything else if any one asserts that it sprang from something else or from nothing the burden of proof lies with him  it remains then only to show how the seed is transported from where it grows to where it is planted this is done chiefly by the agency of the wind water and animals the lighter seeds as those of pines and maples are transported chiefly by wind and water the heavier as acorns and nuts by animals  in all the pines a very thin membrane in appearance much like an insects wing grows over and around the seed and independent of it while the latter is being developed within its base indeed this is often perfectly developed though the seed is abortive nature being you would say more sure to provide the means of transporting the seed than to provide the seed to be transported in other words a beautiful thin sack is woven around the seed with a handle to it such as the wind can take hold of and it is then committed to the wind expressly that it may transport the seed and extend the range of the species and this it does as effectually as when seeds are sent by mail in a different kind of sack from the patentoffice there is a patentoffice at the seat of government of the universe whose managers are as much interested in the dispersion of seeds as anybody at washington can be and their operations are infinitely more extensive and regular  there is then no necessity for supposing that the pines have sprung up from nothing and i am aware that i am not at all peculiar in asserting that they come from seeds though the mode of their propagation by nature has been but little attended to they are very extensively raised from the seed in europe and are beginning to be here  when you cut down an oak wood a pine wood will not at once spring up there unless there are or have been quite recently seedbearing pines near enough for the seeds to be blown from them but adjacent to a forest of pines if you prevent other crops from growing there you will surely have an extension of your pine forest provided the soil is suitable  as for the heavy seeds and nuts which are not furnished with wings the notion is still a very common one that when the trees which bear these spring up where none of their kind were noticed before they have come from seeds or other principles spontaneously generated there in an unusual manner or which have lain dormant in the soil for centuries or perhaps been called into activity by the heat of a burning i do not believe these assertions and i will state some of the ways in which according to my observation such forests are planted and raised  every one of these seeds too will be found to be winged or legged in another fashion surely it is not wonderful that cherrytrees of all kinds are widely dispersed since their fruit is well known to be the favorite food of various birds many kinds are called birdcherries and they appropriate many more kinds which are not so called eating cherries is a birdlike employment and unless we disperse the seeds occasionally as they do i shall think that the birds have the best right to them see how artfully the seed of a cherry is placed in order that a bird may be compelled to transport itin the very midst of a tempting pericarp so that the creature that would devour this must commonly take the stone also into its mouth or bill if you ever ate a cherry and did not make two bites of it you must have perceived itright in the centre of the luscious morsel a large earthy residuum left on the tongue we thus take into our mouths cherry stones as big as peas a dozen at once for nature can persuade us to do almost anything when she would compass her ends some wild men and children instinctively swallow these as the birds do when in a hurry it being the shortest way to get rid of them thus though these seeds are not provided with vegetable wings nature has impelled the thrush tribe to take them into their bills and fly away with them and they are winged in another sense and more effectually than the seeds of pines for these are carried even against the wind the consequence is that cherrytrees grow not only here but there the same is true of a great many other seeds  but to come to the observation which suggested these remarks as i have said i suspect that i can throw some light on the fact that when hereabouts a dense pine wood is cut down oaks and other hard woods may at once take its place i have got only to show that the acorns and nuts provided they are grown in the neighborhood are regularly planted in such woods for i assert that if an oaktree has not grown within ten miles and man has not carried acorns thither then an oak wood will not spring up at once when a pine wood is cut down  apparently there were only pines there before they are cut off and after a year or two you see oaks and other hard woods springing up there with scarcely a pine amid them and the wonder commonly is how the seed could have lain in the ground so long without decaying but the truth is that it has not lain in the ground so long but is regularly planted each year by various quadrupeds and birds  in this neighborhood where oaks and pines are about equally dispersed if you look through the thickest pine wood even the seemingly unmixed pitchpine ones you will commonly detect many little oaks birches and other hard woods sprung from seeds carried into the thicket by squirrels and other animals and also blown thither but which are overshadowed and choked by the pines the denser the evergreen wood the more likely it is to be well planted with these seeds because the planters incline to resort with their forage to the closest covert they also carry it into birch and other woods this planting is carried on annually and the oldest seedlings annually die but when the pines are cleared off the oaks having got just the start they want and now secured favorable conditions immediately spring up to trees  the shade of a dense pine wood is more unfavorable to the springing up of pines of the same species than of oaks within it though the former may come up abundantly when the pines are cut if there chance to be sound seed in the ground  but when you cut off a lot of hard wood very often the little pines mixed with it have a similar start for the squirrels have carried off the nuts to the pines and not to the more open wood and they commonly make pretty clean work of it and moreover if the wood was old the sprouts will be feeble or entirely fail to say nothing about the soil being in a measure exhausted for this kind of crop  if a pine wood is surrounded by a white oak one chiefly white oaks may be expected to succeed when the pines are cut if it is surrounded instead by an edging of shruboaks then you will probably have a dense shruboak thicket  i have no time to go into details but will say in a word that while the wind is conveying the seeds of pines into hard woods and open lands the squirrels and other animals are conveying the seeds of oaks and walnuts into the pine woods and thus a rotation of crops is kept up  i affirmed this confidently many years ago and an occasional examination of dense pine woods confirmed me in my opinion it has long been known to observers that squirrels bury nuts in the ground but i am not aware that any one has thus accounted for the regular succession of forests  on the 24th of september in 1857 as i was paddling down the assabet in this town i saw a red squirrel run along the bank under some herbage with something large in its mouth it stopped near the foot of a hemlock within a couple of rods of me and hastily pawing a hole with its forefeet dropped its booty into it covered it up and retreated part way up the trunk of the tree as i approached the shore to examine the deposit the squirrel descending part way betrayed no little anxiety about its treasure and made two or three motions to recover it before it finally retreated digging there i found two green pignuts joined together with the thick husks on buried about an inch and a half under the reddish soil of decayed hemlock leavesjust the right depth to plant it in short this squirrel was then engaged in accomplishing two objects to wit laying up a store of winter food for itself and planting a hickory wood for all creation if the squirrel was killed or neglected its deposit a hickory would spring up the nearest hickory tree was twenty rods distant these nuts were there still just fourteen days later but were gone when i looked again november 21 or six weeks later still  i have since examined more carefully several dense woods which are said to be and are apparently exclusively pine and always with the same result for instance i walked the same day to a small but very dense and handsome whitepine grove about fifteen rods square in the east part of this town the trees are large for concord being from ten to twenty inches in diameter and as exclusively pine as any wood that i know indeed i selected this wood because i thought it the least likely to contain anything else it stands on an open plain or pasture except that it adjoins another small pine wood which has a few little oaks in it on the southeast side on every other side it was at least thirty rods from the nearest woods standing on the edge of this grove and looking through it for it is quite level and free from underwood for the most part bare redcarpeted ground you would have said that there was not a hard wood tree in it young or old but on looking carefully along over its floor i discovered though it was not till my eye had got used to the search that alternating with thin ferns and small blueberry bushes there was not merely here and there but as often as every five feet and with a degree of regularity a little oak from three to twelve inches high and in one place i found a green acorn dropped by the base of a pine  i confess i was surprised to find my theory so perfectly proved in this case one of the principal agents in this planting the red squirrels were all the while curiously inspecting me while i was inspecting their plantation some of the little oaks had been browsed by cows which resorted to this wood for shade  after seven or eight years the hard woods evidently find such a locality unfavorable to their growth the pines being allowed to stand as an evidence of this i observed a diseased redmaple twentyfive feet long which had been recently prostrated though it was still covered with green leaves the only maple in any position in the wood  but although these oaks almost invariably die if the pines are not cut down it is probable that they do better for a few years under their shelter than they would anywhere else  the very extensive and thorough experiments of the english have at length led them to adopt a method of raising oaks almost precisely like this which somewhat earlier had been adopted by nature and her squirrels here they have simply rediscovered the value of pines as nurses for oaks the english experimenters seem early and generally to have found out the importance of using trees of some kind as nurseplants for the young oaks i quote from loudon what he describes as the ultimatum on the subject of planting and sheltering oaksan abstract of the practice adopted by the government officers in the national forests of england prepared by alexander milne  at first some oaks had been planted by themselves and others mixed with scotch pines but in all cases says mr milne where oaks were planted actually among the pines and surrounded by them though the soil might be inferior the oaks were found to be much the best for several years past the plan pursued has been to plant the inclosures with scotch pines only a tree very similar to our pitchpine and when the pines have got to the height of five or six feet then to put in good strong oak plants of about four or five years growth among the pinesnot cutting away any pines at first unless they happen to be so strong and thick as to overshadow the oaks in about two years it becomes necessary to shred the branches of the pines to give light and air to the oaks and in about two or three more years to begin gradually to remove the pines altogether taking out a certain number each year so that at the end of twenty or twentyfive years not a single scotch pine shall be left although for the first ten or twelve years the plantation may have appeared to contain nothing else but pine the advantage of this mode of planting has been found to be that the pines dry and ameliorate the soil destroying the coarse grass and brambles which frequently choke and injure oaks and that no mending over is necessary as scarcely an oak so planted is found to fail  thus much the english planters have discovered by patient experiment and for aught i know they have taken out a patent for it but they appear not to have discovered that it was discovered before and that they are merely adopting the method of nature which she long ago made patent to all she is all the while planting the oaks amid the pines without our knowledge and at last instead of government officers we send a party of woodchoppers to cut down the pines and so rescue an oak forest at which we wonder as if it had dropped from the skies  as i walk amid hickories even in august i hear the sound of green pignuts falling from time to time cut off by the chickaree over my head in the fall i notice on the ground either within or in the neighborhood of oak woods on all sides of the town stout oak twigs three or four inches long bearing halfadozen empty acorncups which twigs have been gnawed off by squirrels on both sides of the nuts in order to make them more portable the jays scream and the red squirrels scold while you are clubbing and shaking the chestnut trees for they are there on the same errand and two of a trade never agree i frequently see a red or gray squirrel cast down a green chestnut bur as i am going through the woods and i used to think sometimes that they were cast at me in fact they are so busy about it in the midst of the chestnut season that you cannot stand long in the woods without hearing one fall a sportsman told me that he had the day beforethat was in the middle of octoberseen a green chestnut bur dropt on our great river meadow fifty rods from the nearest wood and much further from the nearest chestnuttree and he could not tell how it came there occasionally when chestnutting in midwinter i find thirty or forty nuts in a pile left in its gallery just under the leaves by the common woodmouse mus leucopus  but especially in the winter the extent to which this transportation and planting of nuts is carried on is made apparent by the snow in almost every wood you will see where the red or gray squirrels have pawed down through the snow in a hundred places sometimes two feet deep and almost always directly to a nut or a pinecone as directly as if they had started from it and bored upwardwhich you and i could not have done it would be difficult for us to find one before the snow falls commonly no doubt they had deposited them there in the fall you wonder if they remember the localities or discover them by the scent the red squirrel commonly has its winter abode in the earth under a thicket of evergreens frequently under a small clump of evergreens in the midst of a deciduous wood if there are any nuttrees which still retain their nuts standing at a distance without the wood their paths often lead directly to and from them we therefore need not suppose an oak standing here and there in the wood in order to seed it but if a few stand within twenty or thirty rods of it it is sufficient  i think that i may venture to say that every whitepine cone that falls to the earth naturally in this town before opening and losing its seeds and almost every pitchpine one that falls at all is cut off by a squirrel and they begin to pluck them long before they are ripe so that when the crop of whitepine cones is a small one as it commonly is they cut off thus almost every one of these before it fairly ripens i think moreover that their design if i may so speak in cutting them off green is partly to prevent their opening and losing their seeds for these are the ones for which they dig through the snow and the only whitepine cones which contain anything then i have counted in one heap within a diameter of four feet the cores of 239 pitchpine cones which had been cut off and stripped by the red squirrel the previous winter  the nuts thus left on the surface or buried just beneath it are placed in the most favorable circumstances for germinating i have sometimes wondered how those which merely fell on the surface of the earth got planted but by the end of december i find the chestnut of the same year partially mixed with the mould as it were under the decaying and mouldy leaves where there is all the moisture and manure they want for the nuts fall first in a plentiful year a large proportion of the nuts are thus covered loosely an inch deep and are of course somewhat concealed from squirrels one winter when the crop had been abundant i got with the aid of a rake many quarts of these nuts as late as the tenth of january and though some bought at the store the same day were more than half of them mouldy i did not find a single mouldy one among these which i picked from under the wet and mouldy leaves where they had been snowed on once or twice nature knows how to pack them best they were still plump and tender apparently they do not heat there though wet in the spring they were all sprouting  loudon says that when the nut of the common walnut of europe is to be preserved through the winter for the purpose of planting in the following spring it should be laid in a rotheap as soon as gathered with the husk on and the heap should be turned over frequently in the course of the winter  here again he is stealing natures thunder how can a poor mortal do otherwise for it is she that finds fingers to steal with and the treasure to be stolen in the planting of the seeds of most trees the best gardeners do no more than follow nature though they may not know it generally both large and small ones are most sure to germinate and succeed best when only beaten into the earth with the back of a spade and then covered with leaves or straw these results to which planters have arrived remind us of the experience of kane and his companions at the north who when learning to live in that climate were surprised to find themselves steadily adopting the customs of the natives simply becoming esquimaux so when we experiment in planting forests we find ourselves at last doing as nature does would it not be well to consult with nature in the outset for she is the most extensive and experienced planter of us all not excepting the dukes of athol  in short they who have not attended particularly to this subject are but little aware to what an extent quadrupeds and birds are employed especially in the fall in collecting and so disseminating and planting the seeds of trees it is the almost constant employment of the squirrels at that season and you rarely meet with one that has not a nut in its mouth or is not just going to get one one squirrelhunter of this town told me that he knew of a walnuttree which bore particularly good nuts but that on going to gather them one fall he found that he had been anticipated by a family of a dozen red squirrels he took out of the tree which was hollow one bushel and three pecks by measurement without the husks and they supplied him and his family for the winter it would be easy to multiply instances of this kind how commonly in the fall you see the cheekpouches of the striped squirrel distended by a quantity of nuts this species gets its scientific name tamias or the steward from its habit of storing up nuts and other seeds look under a nuttree a month after the nuts have fallen and see what proportion of sound nuts to the abortive ones and shells you will find ordinarily they have been already eaten or dispersed far and wide the ground looks like a platform before a grocery where the gossips of the village sit to crack nuts and less savory jokes you have come you would say after the feast was over and are presented with the shells only  occasionally when threading the woods in the fall you will hear a sound as if some one had broken a twig and looking up see a jay pecking at an acorn or you will see a flock of them at once about it in the top of an oak and hear them break them off they then fly to a suitable limb and placing the acorn under one foot hammer away at it busily making a sound like a woodpeckers tapping looking round from time to time to see if any foe is approaching and soon reach the meat and nibble at it holding up their heads to swallow while they hold the remainder very firmly with their claws nevertheless it often drops to the ground before the bird has done with it i can confirm what wm bartram wrote to wilson the ornithologist that the jay is one of the most useful agents in the economy of nature for disseminating forest trees and other nuciferous and hardseeded vegetables on which they feed their chief employment during the autumnal season is foraging to supply their winter stores in performing this necessary duty they drop abundance of seed in their flight over fields hedges and by fences where they alight to deposit them in the postholes c it is remarkable what numbers of young trees rise up in fields and pastures after a wet winter and spring these birds alone are capable in a few years time to replant all the cleared lands  i have noticed that squirrels also frequently drop their nuts in open land which will still further account for the oaks and walnuts which spring up in pastures for depend on it every new tree comes from a seed when i examine the little oaks one or two years old in such places i invariably find the empty acorn from which they sprung  so far from the seed having lain dormant in the soil since oaks grew there before as many believe it is well known that it is difficult to preserve the vitality of acorns long enough to transport them to europe and it is recommended in loudons arboretum as the safest course to sprout them in pots on the voyage the same authority states that very few acorns of any species will germinate after having been kept a year that beechmast only retains its vital properties one year and the blackwalnut seldom more than six months after it has ripened i have frequently found that in november almost every acorn left on the ground had sprouted or decayed what with frost drouth moisture and worms the greater part are soon destroyed yet it is stated by one botanical writer that acorns that have lain for centuries on being ploughed up have soon vegetated  mr george b emerson in his valuable report on the trees and shrubs of this state says of the pines the tenacity of life of the seeds is remarkable they will remain for many years unchanged in the ground protected by the coolness and deep shade of the forest above them but when the forest is removed and the warmth of the sun admitted they immediately vegetate since he does not tell us on what observation his remark is founded i must doubt its truth besides the experience of nurserymen makes it the more questionable  the stories of wheat raised from seed buried with an ancient egyptian and of raspberries raised from seed found in the stomach of a man in england who is supposed to have died sixteen or seventeen hundred years ago are generally discredited simply because the evidence is not conclusive  several men of science dr carpenter among them have used the statement that beachplums sprang up in sand which was dug up forty miles inland in maine to prove that the seed had lain there a very long time and some have inferred that the coast has receded so far but it seems to me necessary to their argument to show first that beachplums grow only on a beach they are not uncommon here which is about half that distance from the shore and i remember a dense patch a few miles north of us twentyfive miles inland from which the fruit was annually carried to market how much further inland they grow i know not dr chas t jackson speaks of finding beachplums perhaps they were this kind more than one hundred miles inland in maine  it chances that similar objections lie against all the more notorious instances of the kind on record  yet i am prepared to believe that some seeds especially small ones may retain their vitality for centuries under favorable circumstances in the spring of 1859 the old hunt house so called in this town whose chimney bore the date 1703 was taken down this stood on land which belonged to john winthrop the first governor of massachusetts and a part of the house was evidently much older than the above date and belonged to the winthrop family for many years i have ransacked this neighborhood for plants and i consider myself familiar with its productions thinking of the seeds which are said to be sometimes dug up at an unusual depth in the earth and thus to reproduce long extinct plants it occurred to me last fall that some new or rare plants might have sprung up in the cellar of this house which had been covered from the light so long searching there on the 22d of september i found among other rank weeds a species of nettle urtica urens which i had not found before dill which i had not seen growing spontaneously the jerusalem oak chenopodium botrys which i had seen wild in but one place black nightshade solanum nigrum which is quite rare hereabouts and common tobacco which though it was often cultivated here in the last century has for fifty years been an unknown plant in this town and a few months before this not even i had heard that one man in the north part of the town was cultivating a few plants for his own use i have no doubt that some or all of these plants sprang from seeds which had long been buried under or about that house and that that tobacco is an additional evidence that the plant was formerly cultivated here the cellar has been filled up this year and four of those plants including the tobacco are now again extinct in that locality  it is true i have shown that the animals consume a great part of the seeds of trees and so at least effectually prevent their becoming trees but in all these cases as i have said the consumer is compelled to be at the same time the disperser and planter and this is the tax which he pays to nature i think it is linnaeus who says that while the swine is rooting for acorns he is planting acorns  though i do not believe that a plant will spring up where no seed has been i have great faith in a seeda to me equally mysterious origin for it convince me that you have a seed there and i am prepared to expect wonders i shall even believe that the millennium is at hand and that the reign of justice is about to commence when the patent office or government begins to distribute and the people to plant the seeds of these things  in the spring of 1857 i planted six seeds sent to me from the patent office and labelled i think poitrine jaune grosse large yellow squash two came up and one bore a squash which weighed 12312 pounds the other bore four weighing together 18614 pounds who would have believed that there was 310 pounds of poitrine jaune grosse in that corner of my garden these seeds were the bait i used to catch it my ferrets which i sent into its burrow my brace of terriers which unearthed it a little mysterious hoeing and manuring was all the abra cadabra prestochange that i used and lo true to the label they found for me 310 pounds of poitrine jaune grosse there where it never was known to be nor was before these talismen had perchance sprung from america at first and returned to it with unabated force the big squash took a premium at your fair that fall and i understood that the man who bought it intended to sell the seeds for ten cents a piece were they not cheap at that but i have more hounds of the same breed i learn that one which i despatched to a distant town true to its instinct points to the large yellow squash there too where no hound ever found it before as its ancestors did here and in france  other seeds i have which will find other things in that corner of my garden in like fashion almost any fruit you wish every year for ages until the crop more than fills the whole garden you have but little more to do than throw up your cap for entertainment these american days perfect alchemists i keep who can transmute substances without end and thus the corner of my garden is an inexhaustible treasurechest here you can dig not gold but the value which gold merely represents and there is no signor blitz about it yet farmers sons will stare by the hour to see a juggler draw ribbons from his throat though he tells them it is all deception surely men love darkness rather than light    walking  1862   i wish to speak a word for nature for absolute freedom and wildness as contrasted with a freedom and culture merely civilto regard man as an inhabitant or a part and parcel of nature rather than a member of society i wish to make an extreme statement if so i may make an emphatic one for there are enough champions of civilization the minister and the schoolcommittee and every one of you will take care of that                                       i have met with but one or two persons in the course of my life who understood the art of walking that is of taking walkswho had a genius so to speak for sauntering which word is beautifully derived from idle people who roved about the country in the middle ages and asked charity under pretence of going à la sainte terre to the holy land till the children exclaimed there goes a sainteterrer a saunterera holylander they who never go to the holy land in their walks as they pretend are indeed mere idlers and vagabonds but they who do go there are saunterers in the good sense such as i mean some however would derive the word from sans terre without land or a home which therefore in the good sense will mean having no particular home but equally at home everywhere for this is the secret of successful sauntering he who sits still in a house all the time may be the greatest vagrant of all but the saunterer in the good sense is no more vagrant than the meandering river which is all the while sedulously seeking the shortest course to the sea but i prefer the first which indeed is the most probable derivation for every walk is a sort of crusade preached by some peter the hermit in us to go forth and reconquer this holy land from the hands of the infidels  it is true we are but fainthearted crusaders even the walkers nowadays who undertake no persevering neverending enterprises our expeditions are but tours and come round again at evening to the old hearthside from which we set out half the walk is but retracing our steps we should go forth on the shortest walk perchance in the spirit of undying adventure never to returnprepared to send back our embalmed hearts only as relics to our desolate kingdoms if you are ready to leave father and mother and brother and sister and wife and child and friends and never see them againif you have paid your debts and made your will and settled all your affairs and are a free man then you are ready for a walk  to come down to my own experience my companion and i for i sometimes have a companion take pleasure in fancying ourselves knights of a new or rather an old ordernot equestrians or chevaliers not ritters or riders but walkers a still more ancient and honorable class i trust the chivalric and heroic spirit which once belonged to the rider seems now to reside in or perchance to have subsided into the walkernot the knight but walker errant he is a sort of fourth estate outside of church and state and people  we have felt that we almost alone hereabouts practised this noble art though to tell the truth at least if their own assertions are to be received moat of my townsmen would fain walk sometimes as i do but they cannot no wealth can buy the requisite leisure freedom and independence which are the capital in this profession it comes only by the grace of god it requires a direct dispensation from heaven to become a walker you must be born into the family of the walkers ambulator nascitur non fit some of my townsmen it is true can remember and have described to me some walks which they took ten years ago in which they were so blessed as to lose themselves for half an hour in the woods but i know very well that they have confined themselves to the highway ever since whatever pretensions they may make to belong to this select class no doubt they were elevated for a moment as by the reminiscence of a previous state of existence when even they were foresters and outlaws  when he came to grene wode   in a mery mornynge there he herde the notes small   of byrdes mery syngynge  it is ferre gone sayd robyn   that i was last here me lyste a lytell for to shote   at the donne dere  i think that i cannot preserve my health and spirits unless i spend four hours a day at leastand it is commonly more than thatsauntering through the woods and over the hills and fields absolutely free from all worldly engagements you may safely say a penny for your thoughts or a thousand pounds when sometimes i am reminded that the mechanics and shopkeepers stay in their shops not only all the forenoon but all the afternoon too sitting with crossed legs so many of themas if the legs were made to sit upon and not to stand or walk uponi think that they deserve some credit for not having all committed suicide long ago  i who cannot stay in my chamber for a single day without acquiring some rust and when sometimes i have stolen forth for a walk at the eleventh hour of four oclock in the afternoon too late to redeem the day when the shades of night were already beginning to be mingled with the daylight have felt as if i had committed some sin to be atoned fori confess that i am astonished at the power of endurance to say nothing of the moral insensibility of my neighbors who confine themselves to shops and offices the whole day for weeks and months ay and years almost together i know not what manner of stuff they are ofsitting there now at three oclock in the afternoon as if it were three oclock in the morning bonaparte may talk of the threeoclockinthemorning courage but it is nothing to the courage which can sit down cheerfully at this hour in the afternoon over against ones self whom you have known all the morning to starve out a garrison to whom you are bound by such strong ties of sympathy i wonder that about this time or say between four and five oclock in the afternoon too late for the morning papers and too early for the evening ones there is not a general explosion heard up and down the street scattering a legion of antiquated and housebred notions and whims to the four winds for an airingand so the evil cure itself  how womankind who are confined to the house still more than men stand it i do not know but i have ground to suspect that most of them do not stand it at all when early in a summer afternoon we have been shaking the dust of the village from the skirts of our garments making haste past those houses with purely doric or gothic fronts which have such an air of repose about them my companion whispers that probably about these times their occupants are all gone to bed then it is that i appreciate the beauty and the glory of architecture which itself never turns in but forever stands out and erect keeping watch over the slumberers  no doubt temperament and above all age have a good deal to do with it as a man grows older his ability to sit still and follow indoor occupations increases he grows vespertinal in his habits as the evening of life approaches till at last he comes forth only just before sundown and gets all the walk that he requires in half an hour  but the walking of which i speak has nothing in it akin to taking exercise as it is called as the sick take medicine at stated hoursas the swinging of dumbbells or chairs but is itself the enterprise and adventure of the day if you would get exercise go in search of the springs of life think of a mans swinging dumbbells for his health when those springs are bubbling up in faroff pastures unsought by him  moreover you must walk like a camel which is said to be the only beast which ruminates when walking when a traveller asked wordsworths servant to show him her masters study she answered here is his library but his study is out of doors  living much out of doors in the sun and wind will no doubt produce a certain roughness of characterwill cause a thicker cuticle to grow over some of the finer qualities of our nature as on the face and hands or as severe manual labor robs the hands of some of their delicacy of touch so staying in the house on the other hand may produce a softness and smoothness not to say thinness of skin accompanied by an increased sensibility to certain impressions perhaps we should be more susceptible to some influences important to our intellectual and moral growth if the sun had shone and the wind blown on us a little less and no doubt it is a nice matter to proportion rightly the thick and thin skin but methinks that is a scurf that will fall off fast enoughthat the natural remedy is to be found in the proportion which the night bears to the day the winter to the summer thought to experience there will be so much the more air and sunshine in our thoughts the callous palms of the laborer are conversant with finer tissues of selfrespect and heroism whose touch thrills the heart than the languid fingers of idleness that is mere sentimentality that lies abed by day and thinks itself white far from the tan and callus of experience  when we walk we naturally go to the fields and woods what would become of us if we walked only in a garden or a mall even some sects of philosophers have felt the necessity of importing the woods to themselves since they did not go to the woods they planted groves and walks of platanes where they took subdiales ambulationes in porticos open to the air of course it is of no use to direct our steps to the woods if they do not carry us thither i am alarmed when it happens that i have walked a mile into the woods bodily without getting there in spirit in my afternoon walk i would fain forget all my morning occupations and my obligations to society but it sometimes happens that i cannot easily shake off the village the thought of some work will run in my head and i am not where my body isi am out of my senses in my walks i would fain return to my senses what business have i in the woods if i am thinking of something out of the woods i suspect myself and cannot help a shudder when i find myself so implicated even in what are called good worksfor this may sometimes happen  my vicinity affords many good walks and though for so many years i have walked almost every day and sometimes for several days together i have not yet exhausted them an absolutely new prospect is a great happiness and i can still get this any afternoon two or three hours walking will carry me to as strange a country as i expect ever to see a single farmhouse which i had not seen before is sometimes as good as the dominions of the king of dahomey there is in fact a sort of harmony discoverable between the capabilities of the landscape within a circle of ten miles radius or the limits of an afternoon walk and the threescore years and ten of human life it will never become quite familiar to you  nowadays almost all mans improvements so called as the building of houses and the cutting down of the forest and of all large trees simply deform the landscape and make it more and more tame and cheap a people who would begin by burning the fences and let the forest stand i saw the fences half consumed their ends lost in the middle of the prairie and some worldly miser with a surveyor looking after his bounds while heaven had taken place around him and he did not see the angels going to and fro but was looking for an old posthole in the midst of paradise i looked again and saw him standing in the middle of a boggy stygian fen surrounded by devils and he had found his bounds without a doubt three little stones where a stake had been driven and looking nearer i saw that the prince of darkness was his surveyor  i can easily walk ten fifteen twenty any number of miles commencing at my own door without going by any house without crossing a road except where the fox and the mink do first along by the river and then the brook and then the meadow and the woodside there are square miles in my vicinity which have no inhabitant from many a hill i can see civilization and the abodes of man afar the farmers and their works are scarcely more obvious than woodchucks and their burrows man and his affairs church and state and school trade and commerce and manufactures and agriculture even politics the most alarming of them alli am pleased to see how little space they occupy in the landscape politics is but a narrow field and that still narrower highway yonder leads to it i sometimes direct the traveller thither if you would go to the political world follow the great roadfollow that marketman keep his dust in your eyes and it will lead you straight to it for it too has its place merely and does not occupy all space i pass from it as from a beanfield into the forest and it is forgotten in one halfhour i can walk off to some portion of the earths surface where a man does not stand from one years end to another and there consequently politics are not for they are but as the cigarsmoke of a man  the village is the place to which the roads tend a sort of expansion of the highway as a lake of a river it is the body of which roads are the arms and legsa trivial or quadrivial place the thoroughfare and ordinary of travellers the word is from the latin villa which together with via a way or more anciently ved and vella varro derives from veho to carry because the villa is the place to and from which things are carried they who got their living by teaming were said vellaturam facere hence too apparently the latin word vilis and our vile also villain this suggests what kind of degeneracy villagers are liable to they are wayworn by the travel that goes by and over them without travelling themselves  some do not walk at all others walk in the highways a few walk across lots roads are made for horses and men of business i do not travel in them much comparatively because i am not in a hurry to get to any tavern or grocery or liverystable or depot to which they lead i am a good horse to travel but not from choice a roadster the landscapepainter uses the figures of men to mark a road he would not make that use of my figure i walk out into a nature such as the old prophets and poets menu moses homer chaucer walked in you may name it america but it is not america neither atnericus vespucius nor columbus nor the rest were the discoverers of it there is a truer account of it in mythology than in any history of america so called that i have seen  however there are a few old roads that may be trodden with profit as if they led somewhere now that they are nearly discontinued there is the old marlborough road which does not go to marlborough now methinks unless that is marlborough where it carries me i am the bolder to speak of it here because i presume that there are one or two such roads in every town      the old marlborough road      where they once dug for money     but never found any     where sometimes martial miles     singly files     and elijah wood     i fear for no good     no other man     save elisha dugan     o man of wild habits     partridges and rabbits     who hast no cares     only to set snares     who livst all alone     close to the bone     and where life is sweetest     constantly eatest when the spring stirs my blood   with the instinct to travel   i can get enough gravel on the old marlborough road     nobody repairs it     for nobody wears it     it is a living way     as the christians say not many there be   who enter therein only the guests of the   irishman quin what is it what is it   but a direction out there and the bare possibility   of going somewhere     great guideboards of stone     but travellers none     cenotaphs of the towns     named on their crowns     it is worth going to see     where you might be     what king     did the thing     i am still wondering     set up how or when     by what selectmen     gourgas or lee     clark or darby     theyre a great endeavor     to be something forever     blank tablets of stone     where a traveller might groan     and in one sentence     grave all that is known     which another might read     in his extreme need     i know one or two     lines that would do     literature that might stand     all over the land     which a man could remember     till next december     and read again in the spring     after the thawing if with fancy unfurled   you leave your abode you may go round the world   by the old marlborough road  at present in this vicinity the best part of the land is not private property the landscape is not owned and the walker enjoys comparative freedom but possibly the day will come when it will be partitioned off into socalled pleasuregrounds in which a few will take a narrow and exclusive pleasure onlywhen fences shall be multiplied and mantraps and other engines invented to confine men to the public road and walking over the surface of gods earth shall be construed to mean trespassing on some gentlemans grounds to enjoy a thing exclusively is commonly to exclude yourself from the true enjoyment of it let us improve our opportunities then before the evil days come                                       what is it that makes it so hard sometimes to determine whither we will walk i believe that there is a subtile magnetism in nature which if we unconsciously yield to it will direct us aright it is not indifferent to us which way we walk there is a right way but we are very liable from heedlessness and stupidity to take the wrong one we would fain take that walk never yet taken by us through this actual world which is perfectly symbolical of the path which we love to travel in the interior and ideal world and sometimes no doubt we find it difficult to choose our direction because it does not yet exist distinctly in our idea  when i go out of the house for a walk uncertain as yet whither i will bend my steps and submit myself to my instinct to decide for me i find strange and whimsical as it may seem that i finally and inevitably settle southwest toward some particular wood or meadow or deserted pasture or hill in that direction my needle is slow to settlevaries a few degrees and does not always point due southwest it is true and it has good authority for this variation but it always settles between west and southsouthwest the future lies that way to me and the earth seems more unexhausted and richer on that side the outline which would bound my walks would be not a circle but a parabola or rather like one of those cometary orbits which have been thought to be nonreturning curves in this case opening westward in which my house occupies the place of the sun i turn round and round irresolute sometimes for a quarter of an hour until i decide for a thousandth time that i will walk into the southwest or west eastward i go only by force but westward i go free thither no business leads me it is hard for me to believe that i shall find fair landscapes or sufficient wildness and freedom behind the eastern horizon i am not excited by the prospect of a walk thither but i believe that the forest which i see in the western horizon stretches uninterruptedly toward the setting sun and there are no towns nor cities in it of enough consequence to disturb me let me live where i will on this side is the city on that the wilderness and ever i am leaving the city more and more and withdrawing into the wilderness i should not lay so much stress on this fact if i did not believe that something like this is the prevailing tendency of my countrymen i must walk toward oregon and not toward europe and that way the nation is moving and i may say that mankind progress from east to west within a few years we have witnessed the phenomenon of a southeastward migration in the settlement of australia but this affects us as a retrograde movement and judging from the moral and physical character of the first generation of australians has not yet proved a successful experiment the eastern tartars think that there is nothing west beyond thibet the world ends there say they beyond there is nothing but a shoreless sea it is unmitigated east where they live  we go eastward to realize history and study the works of art and literature retracing the steps of the race we go westward as into the future with a spirit of enterprise and adventure the atlantic is a lethean stream in our passage over which we have had an opportunity to forget the old world and its institutions if we do not succeed this time there is perhaps one more chance for the race left before it arrives on the banks of the styx and that is in the lethe of the pacific which is three times as wide  i know not how significant it is or how far it is an evidence of singularity that an individual should thus consent in his pettiest walk with the general movement of the race but i know that something akin to the migratory instinct in birds and quadrupedswhich in some instances is known to have affected the squirrel tribe impelling them to a general and mysterious movement in which they were seen say some crossing the broadest rivers each on its particular chip with its tail raised for a sail and bridging narrower streams with their deadthat something like the furor which affects the domestic cattle in the spring and which is referred to a worm in their tailsaffects both nations and individuals either perennially or from time to time not a flock of wild geese cackles over our town but it to some extent unsettles the value of real estate here and if i were a broker i should probably take that disturbance into account    than longen folk to gon on pilgrimages    and palmeres for to seken strange strondes  every sunset which i witness inspires me with the desire to go to a west as distant and as fair as that into which the sun goes down he appears to migrate westward daily and tempt us to follow him he is the great western pioneer whom the nations follow we dream all night of those mountainridges in the horizon though they may be of vapor only which were last gilded by his rays the island of atlantis and the islands and gardens of the hesperides a sort of terrestrial paradise appear to have been the great west of the ancients enveloped in mystery and poetry who has not seen in imagination when looking into the sunset sky the gardens of the hesperides and the foundation of all those fables  columbus felt the westward tendency more strongly than any before he obeyed it and found a new world for castile and leon the herd of men in those days scented fresh pastures from afar    and now the sun had stretched out all the hills    and now was dropped into the western bay    at last he rose and twitched his mantle blue    tomorrow to fresh woods and pastures new  where on the globe can there be found an area of equal extent with that occupied by the bulk of our states so fertile and so rich and varied in its productions and at the same time so habitable by the european as this is michaux who knew but part of them says that the species of large trees are much more numerous in north america than in europe in the united states there are more than one hundred and forty species that exceed thirty feet in height in france there are but thirty that attain this size later botanists more than confirm his observations humboldt came to america to realize his youthful dreams of a tropical vegetation and he beheld it in its greatest perfection in the primitive forests of the amazon the most gigantic wilderness on the earth which he has so eloquently described the geographer guyot himself a european goes fartherfarther than i am ready to follow him yet not when he says as the plant is made for the animal as the vegetable world is made for the animal world america is made for the man of the old world the man of the old world sets out upon his way leaving the highlands of asia he descends from station to station towards europe each of his steps is marked by a new civilization superior to the preceding by a greater power of development arrived at the atlantic he pauses on the shore of this unknown ocean the bounds of which he knows not and turns upon his footprints for an instant when he has exhausted the rich soil of europe and reinvigorated himself then recommences his adventurous career westward as in the earliest ages so far guyot  from this western impulse coming in contact with the barrier of the atlantic sprang the commerce and enterprise of modern times the younger michaux in his travels west of the alleghanies in 1802 says that the common inquiry in the newly settled west was from what part of the world have you come as if these vast and fertile regions would naturally be the place of meeting and common country of all the inhabitants of the globe  to use an obsolete latin word i might say ex oriente lux ex occidente frux from the east light from the west fruit  sir francis head an english traveller and a governorgeneral of canada tells us that in both the northern and southern hemispheres of the new world nature has not only outlined her works on a larger scale but has painted the whole picture with brighter and more costly colors than she used in delineating and in beautifying the old world the heavens of america appear infinitely higher the sky is bluer the air is fresher the cold is intenser the moon looks larger the stars are brighter the thunder is louder the lightning is vivider the wind is stronger the rain is heavier the mountains are higher the rivers longer the forests bigger the plains broader this statement will do at least to set against buffons account of this part of the world and its productions  linnaeus said long ago nescio quae facies laeta glabra plantis americanis i know not what there is of joyous and smooth in the aspect of american plants and i think that in this country there are no or at most very few africanae bestiae african beasts as the romans called them and that in this respect also it is peculiarly fitted for the habitation of man we are told that within three miles of the centre of the eastindian city of singapore some of the inhabitants are annually carried off by tigers but the traveller can lie down in the woods at night almost anywhere in north america without fear of wild beasts  these are encouraging testimonies if the moon looks larger here than in europe probably the sun looks larger also if the heavens of america appear infinitely higher and the stars brighter i trust that these facts are symbolical of the height to which the philosophy and poetry and religion of her inhabitants may one day soar at length perchance the immaterial heaven will appear as much higher to the american mind and the intimations that star it as much brighter for i believe that climate does thus react on manas there is something in the mountainair that feeds the spirit and inspires will not man grow to greater perfection intellectually as well as physically under these influences or is it unimportant how many foggy days there are in his life i trust that we shall be more imaginative that our thoughts will be clearer fresher and more ethereal as our skyour understanding more comprehensive and broader like our plainsour intellect generally on a grander scale like our thunder and lightning our rivers and mountains and forestsand our hearts shall even correspond in breadth and depth and grandeur to our inland seas perchance there will appear to the traveller something he knows not what of laeta and glabra of joyous and serene in our very faces else to what end does the world go on and why was america discovered  to americans i hardly need to say    westward the star of empire takes its way  as a true patriot i should be ashamed to think that adam in paradise was more favorably situated on the whole than the backwoodsman in this country  our sympathies in massachusetts are not confined to new england though we may be estranged from the south we sympathize with the west there is the home of the younger sons as among the scandinavians they took to the sea for their inheritance it is too late to be studying hebrew it is more important to understand even the slang of today  some months ago i went to see a panorama of the rhine it was like a dream of the middle ages i floated down its historic stream in something more than imagination under bridges built by the romans and repaired by later heroes past cities and castles whose very names were music to my ears and each of which was the subject of a legend there were ehrenbreitstein and rolandseck and coblentz which i knew only in history they were ruins that interested me chiefly there seemed to come up from its waters and its vineclad hills and valleys a hushed music as of crusaders departing for the holy land i floated along under the spell of enchantment as if i had been transported to an heroic age and breathed an atmosphere of chivalry  soon after i went to see a panorama of the mississippi and as i worked my way up the river in the light of today and saw the steamboats wooding up counted the rising cities gazed on the fresh ruins of nauvoo beheld the indians moving west across the stream and as before i had looked up the moselle now looked up the ohio and the missouri and heard the legends of dubuque and of wenonas cliffstill thinking more of the future than of the past or presenti saw that this was a rhine stream of a different kind that the foundations of castles were yet to be laid and the famous bridges were yet to be thrown over the river and i felt that this was the heroic age itself though we know it not for the hero is commonly the simplest and obscurest of men                                       the west of which i speak is but another name for the wild and what i have been preparing to say is that in wildness is the preservation of the world every tree sends its fibres forth in search of the wild the cities import it at any price men plough and sail for it from the forest and wilderness come the tonics and barks which brace mankind our ancestors were savages the story of romulus and remus being suckled by a wolf is not a meaningless fable the founders of every state which has risen to eminence have drawn their nourishment and vigor from a similar wild source it was because the children of the empire were not suckled by the wolf that they were conquered and displaced by the children of the northern forests who were  i believe in the forest and in the meadow and in the night in which the corn grows we require an infusion of hemlockspruce or arborvitae in our tea there is a difference between eating and drinking for strength and from mere gluttony the hottentots eagerly devour the marrow of the koodoo and other antelopes raw as a matter of course some of our northern indians eat raw the marrow of the arctic reindeer as well as various other parts including the summits of the antlers as long as they are soft and herein perchance they have stolen a march on the cooks of paris they get what usually goes to feed the fire this is probably better than stallfed beef and slaughterhouse pork to make a man of give me a wildness whose glance no civilization can endureas if we lived on the marrow of koodoos devoured raw  there are some intervals which border the strain of the woodthrush to which i would migratewild lands where no settler has squatted to which methinks i am already acclimated  the african hunter cummings tells us that the skin of the eland as well as that of most other antelopes just killed emits the most delicious perfume of trees and grass i would have every man so much like a wild antelope so much a part and parcel of nature that his very person should thus sweetly advertise our senses of his presence and remind us of those parts of nature which he most haunts i feel no disposition to be satirical when the trappers coat emits the odor of musquash even it is a sweeter scent to me than that which commonly exhales from the merchants or the scholars garments when i go into their wardrobes and handle their vestments i am reminded of no grassy plains and flowery meads which they have frequented but of dusty merchants exchanges and libraries rather  a tanned skin is something more than respectable and perhaps olive is a fitter color than white for a mana denizen of the woods the pale white man i do not wonder that the african pitied him darwin the naturalist says a white man bathing by the side of a tahitian was like a plant bleached by the gardeners art compared with a fine dark green one growing vigorously in the open fields  ben jonson exclaims    how near to good is what is fair  so i would say    how near to good is what is wild  life consists with wildness the most alive is the wildest not yet subdued to man its presence refreshes him one who pressed forward incessantly and never rested from his labors who grew fast and made infinite demands on life would always find himself in a new country or wilderness and surrounded by the raw material of life he would be climbing over the prostrate stems of primitive foresttrees  hope and the future for me are not in lawns and cultivated fields not in towns and cities but in the impervious and quaking swamps when formerly i have analyzed my partiality for some farm which i had contemplated purchasing i have frequently found that i was attracted solely by a few square rods of impermeable and unfathomable boga natural sink in one corner of it that was the jewel which dazzled me i derive more of my subsistence from the swamps which surround my native town than from the cultivated gardens in the village there are no richer parterres to my eyes than the dense beds of dwarf andromeda cassandra calyculata which cover these tender places on the earths surface botany cannot go farther than tell me the names of the shrubs which grow therethe highblueberry panicled andromeda lambkill azalea and rhodoraall standing in the quaking sphagnum i often think that i should like to have my house front on this mass of dull red bushes omitting other flower plots and borders transplanted spruce and trim box even gravelled walksto have this fertile spot under my windows not a few imported barrowfulls of soil only to cover the sand which was thrown out in digging the cellar why not put my house my parlor behind this plot instead of behind that meagre assemblage of curiosities that poor apology for a nature and art which i call my frontyard it is an effort to clear up and make a decent appearance when the carpenter and mason have departed though done as much for the passerby as the dweller within the most tasteful frontyard fence was never an agreeable object of study to me the most elaborate ornaments acorntops or what not soon wearied and disgusted me bring your sills up to the very edge of the swamp then though it may not be the best place for a dry cellar so that there be no access on that side to citizens frontyards are not made to walk in but at most through and you could go in the back way  yes though you may think me perverse if it were proposed to me to dwell in the neighborhood of the most beautiful garden that ever human art contrived or else of a dismal swamp i should certainly decide for the swamp how vain then have been all your labors citizens for me  my spirits infallibly rise in proportion to the outward dreariness give me the ocean the desert or the wilderness in the desert pure air and solitude compensate for want of moisture and fertility the traveller burton says of ityour morale improves you become frank and cordial hospitable and singleminded in the desert spirituous liquors excite only disgust there is a keen enjoyment in a mere animal existence they who have been travelling long on the steppes of tartary sayon reëntering cultivated lands the agitation perplexity and turmoil of civilization oppressed and suffocated us the air seemed to fail us and we felt every moment as if about to die of asphyxia when i would recreate myself i seek the darkest wood the thickest and most interminable and to the citizen most dismal swamp i enter a swamp as a sacred placea sanctum sanctorum there is the strength the marrow of nature the wildwood covers the virgin mouldand the same soil is good for men and for trees a mans health requires as many acres of meadow to his prospect as his farm does loads of muck there are the strong meats on which he feeds a town is saved not more by the righteous men in it than by the woods and swamps that surround it a township where one primitive forest waves above while another primitive forest rots belowsuch a town is fitted to raise not only corn and potatoes but poets and philosophers for the coming ages in such a soil grew homer and confucius and the rest and out of such a wilderness comes the reformer eating locusts and wild honey  to preserve wild animals implies generally the creation of a forest for them to dwell in or resort to so it is with man a hundred years ago they sold bark in our streets peeled from our own woods in the very aspect of those primitive and rugged trees there was methinks a tanning principle which hardened and consolidated the fibres of mens thoughts ah already i shudder for these comparatively degenerate days of my native village when you cannot collect a load of bark of good thicknessand we no longer produce tar and turpentine  the civilized nationsgreece rome englandhave been sustained by the primitive forests which anciently rotted where they stand they survive as long as the soil is not exhausted alas for human culture little is to be expected of a nation when the vegetable mould is exhausted and it is compelled to make manure of the bones of its fathers there the poet sustains himself merely by his own superfluous fat and the philosopher comes down on his marrowbones  it is said to be the task of the american to work the virgin soil and that agriculture here already assumes proportions unknown everywhere else i think that the farmer displaces the indian even because he redeems the meadow and so makes himself stronger and in some respects more natural i was surveying for a man the other day a single straight line one hundred and thirtytwo rods long through a swamp at whose entrance might have been written the words which dante read over the entrance to the infernal regionsleave all hope ye that enterthat is of ever getting out again where at one time i saw my employer actually up to his neck and swimming for his life in his property though it was still winter he had another similar swamp which i could not survey at all because it was completely under water and nevertheless with regard to a third swamp which i did survey from a distance he remarked to me true to his instincts that he would not part with it for any consideration on account of the mud which it contained and that man intends to put a girdling ditch round the whole in the course of forty months and so redeem it by the magic of his spade i refer to him only as the type of a class  the weapons with which we have gained our most important victories which should be handed down as heirlooms from father to son are not the sword and the lance but the bushwhack the turfcutter the spade and the boghoe rusted with the blood of many a meadow and begrimed with the dust of many a hardfought field the very winds blew the indians cornfield into the meadow and pointed out the way which he had not the skill to follow he had no better implement with which to intrench himself in the land than a clamshell but the farmer is armed with plough and spade  in literature it is only the wild that attracts us dullness is but another name for tameness it is the uncivilized free and wild thinking in hamlet and the iliad in all the scriptures and mythologies not learned in the schools that delights us as the wild duck is more swift and beautiful than the tame so is the wildthe mallardthought which mid falling dews wings its way above the fens a truly good book is something as natural and as unexpectedly and unaccountably fair and perfect as a wild flower discovered on the prairies of the west or in the jungles of the east genius is a light which makes the darkness visible like the lightnings flash which perchance shatters the temple of knowledge itselfand not a taper lighted at the hearthstone of the race which pales before the light of common day  english literature from the days of the minstrels to the lake poets chaucer and spenser and milton and even shakspeare includedbreathes no quite fresh and in this sense wild strain it is an essentially tame and civilized literature reflecting greece and rome her wilderness is a green woodher wild man a robin hood there is plenty of genial love of nature but not so much of nature herself her chronicles inform us when her wild animals but not when the wild man in her became extinct  the science of humboldt is one thing poetry is another thing the poet today notwithstanding all the discoveries of science and the accumulated learning of mankind enjoys no advantage over homer  where is the literature which gives expression to nature he would be a poet who could impress the winds and streams into his service to speak for him who nailed words to their primitive senses as farmers drive down stakes in the spring which the frost has heaved who derived his words as often as he used themtransplanted them to his page with earth adhering to their roots whose words were so true and fresh and natural that they would appear to expand like the buds at the approach of spring though they lay halfsmothered between two musty leaves in a libraryay to bloom and bear fruit there after their kind annually for the faithful reader in sympathy with surrounding nature  i do not know of any poetry to quote which adequately expresses this yearning for the wild approached from this side the best poetry is tame i do not know where to find in any literature ancient or modern any account which contents me of that nature with which even i am acquainted you will perceive that i demand something which no augustan nor elizabethan age which no culture in short can give mythology comes nearer to it than anything how much more fertile a nature at least has grecian mythology its root in than english literature mythology is the crop which the old world bore before its soil was exhausted before the fancy and imagination were affected with blight and which it still bears wherever its pristine vigor is unabated all other literatures endure only as the elms which overshadow our houses but this is like the great dragontree of the western isles as old as mankind and whether that does or not will endure as long for the decay of other literatures makes the soil in which it thrives  the west is preparing to add its fables to those of the east the valleys of the ganges the nile and the rhine having yielded their crop it remains to be seen what the valleys of the amazon the plate the orinoco the st lawrence and the mississippi will produce perchance when in the course of ages american liberty has become a fiction of the pastas it is to some extent a fiction of the presentthe poets of the world will be inspired by american mythology  the wildest dreams of wild men even are not the less true though they may not recommend themselves to the sense which is most common among englishmen and americans today it is not every truth that recommends itself to the common sense nature has a place for the wild clematis as well as for the cabbage some expressions of truth are reminiscent others merely sensible as the phrase isothers prophetic some forms of disease even may prophesy forms of health the geologist has discovered that the figures of serpents griffins flying dragons and other fanciful embellishments of heraldry have their prototypes in the forms of fossil species which were extinct before man was created and hence indicate a faint and shadowy knowledge of a previous state of organic existence the hindoos dreamed that the earth rested on an elephant and the elephant on a tortoise and the tortoise on a serpent and though it may be an unimportant coincidence it will not be out of place here to state that a fossil tortoise has lately been discovered in asia large enough to support an elephant i confess that i am partial to these wild fancies which transcend the order of time and development they are the sublimest recreation of the intellect the partridge loves peas but not those that go with her into the pot  in short all good things are wild and free there is something in a strain of music whether produced by an instrument or by the human voicetake the sound of a bugle in a summer night for instancewhich by its wildness to speak without satire reminds me of the cries emitted by wild beasts in their native forests it is so much of their wildness as i can understand give me for my friends and neighbors wild men not tame ones the wildness of the savage is but a faint symbol of the awful ferity with which good men and lovers meet  i love even to see the domestic animals reassert their native rightsany evidence that they have not wholly lost their original wild habits and vigor as when my neighbors cow breaks out of her pasture early in the spring and boldly swims the river a cold gray tide twentyfive or thirty rods wide swollen by the melted snow it is the buffalo crossing the mississippi this exploit confers some dignity on the herd in my eyesalready dignified the seeds of instinct are preserved under the thick hides of cattle and horses like seeds in the bowels of the earth an indefinite period  any sportiveness in cattle is unexpected i saw one day a herd of a dozen bullocks and cows running about and frisking in unwieldly sport like huge rats even like kittens they shook their heads raised their tails and rushed up and down a hill and i perceived by their horns as well as by their activity their relation to the deer tribe but alas a sudden loud whoa would have damped their ardor at once reduced them from venison to beef and stiffened their sides and sinews like the locomotive who but the evil one has cried whoa to mankind indeed the life of cattle like that of many men is but a sort of locomotiveness they move a side at a time and man by his machinery is meeting the horse and the ox halfway whatever part the whip has touched is thenceforth palsied who would ever think of a side of any of the supple cat tribe as we speak of a side of beef  i rejoice that horses and steers have to be broken before they can be made the slaves of men and that men themselves have some wild oats still left to sow before they become submissive members of society undoubtedly all men are not equally fit subjects for civilization and because the majority like dogs and sheep are tame by inherited disposition this is no reason why the others should have their natures broken that they may be reduced to the same level men are in the main alike but they were made several in order that they might be various if a low use is to be served one man will do nearly or quite as well as another if a high one individual excellence is to be regarded any man can stop a hole to keep the wind away but no other man could serve so rare a use as the author of this illustration did confucius saysthe skins of the tiger and the leopard when they are tanned are as the skins of the dog and the sheep tanned but it is not the part of a true culture to tame tigers any more than it is to make sheep ferocious and tanning their skins for shoes is not the best use to which they can be put  when looking over a list of mens names in a foreign language as of military officers or of authors who have written on a particular subject i am reminded once more that there is nothing in a name the name menschikoff for instance has nothing in it to my ears more human than a whisker and it may belong to a rat as the names of the poles and russians are to us so are ours to them it is as if they had been named by the childs rigmaroleiery wiery ichery van tittletoltan i see in my mind a herd of wild creatures swarming over the earth and to each the herdsman has affixed some barbarous sound in his own dialect the names of men are of course as cheap and meaningless as bose and tray the names of dogs  methinks it would be some advantage to philosophy if men were named merely in the gross as they are known it would be necessary only to know the genus and perhaps the race or variety to know the individual we are not prepared to believe that every private soldier in a roman army had a name of his ownbecause we have not supposed that he had a character of his own at present our only true names are nicknames i knew a boy who from his peculiar energy was called buster by his playmates and this rightly supplanted his christian name some travellers tell us that an indian had no name given him at first but earned it and his name was his fame and among some tribes he acquired a new name with every new exploit it is pitiful when a man bears a name for convenience merely who has earned neither name nor fame  i will not allow mere names to make distinctions for me but still see men in herds for all them a familiar name cannot make a man less strange to me it may be given to a savage who retains in secret his own wild title earned in the woods we have a wild savage in us and a savage name is perchance somewhere recorded as ours i see that my neighbor who bears the familiar epithet william or edwin takes it off with his jacket it does not adhere to him when asleep or in anger or aroused by any passion or inspiration i seem to hear pronounced by some of his kin at such a time his original wild name in some jawbreaking or else melodious tongue  here is this vast savage howling mother of ours nature lying all around with such beauty and such affection for her children as the leopard and yet we are so early weaned from her breast to society to that culture which is exclusively an interaction of man on mana sort of breeding in and in which produces at most a merely english nobility a civilization destined to have a speedy limit  in society in the best institutions of men it is easy to detect a certain precocity when we should still be growing children we are already little men give me a culture which imports much muck from the meadows and deepens the soilnot that which trusts to heating manures and improved implements and modes of culture only  many a poor soreeyed student that i have heard of would grow faster both intellectually and physically if instead of sitting up so very late he honestly slumbered a fools allowance  there may be an excess even of informing light niépce a frenchman discovered actinism that power in the suns rays which produces a chemical effectthat granite rocks and stone structures and statues of metal are all alike destructively acted upon during the hours of sunshine and but for provisions of nature no less wonderful would soon perish under the delicate touch of the most subtile of the agencies of the universe but he observed that those bodies which underwent this change during the daylight possessed the power of restoring themselves to their original conditions during the hours of night when this excitement was nolonger influencing them hence it has been inferred that the hours of darkness are as necessary to the inorganic creation as we know night and sleep are to the organic kingdom not even does the moon shine every night but gives place to darkness  i would not have every man nor every part of a man cultivated any more than i would have every acre of earth cultivated part will be tillage but the greater part will be meadow and forest not only serving an immediate use but preparing a mould against a distant future by the annual decay of the vegetation which it supports  there are other letters for the child to learn than those which cadmus invented the spaniards have a good term to express this wild and dusky knowledgegramática parda tawny grammara kind of motherwit derived from that same leopard to which i have referred  we have heard of a society for the diffusion of useful knowledge it is said that knowledge is power and the like methinks there is equal need of a society for the diffusion of useful ignorance what we will call beautiful knowledge a knowledge useful in a higher sense for what is most of our boasted socalled knowledge but a conceit that we know something which robs us of the advantage of our actual ignorance what we call knowledge is often our positive ignorance ignorance our negative knowledge by long years of patient industry and reading of the newspapersfor what are the libraries of science but files of newspapersa man accumulates a myriad facts lays them up in his memory and then when in some spring of his life he saunters abroad into the great fields of thought he as it were goes to grass like a horse and leaves all his harness behind in the stable i would say to the society for the diffusion of useful knowledge sometimesgo to grass you have eaten hay long enough the spring has come with its green crop the very cows are driven to their country pastures before the end of may though i have heard of one unnatural farmer who kept his cow in the barn and fed her on hay all the year round so frequently the society for the diffusion of useful knowledge treats its cattle  a mans ignorance sometimes is not only useful but beautifulwhile his knowledge so called is oftentimes worse than useless besides being ugly which is the best man to deal withhe who knows nothing about a subject and what is extremely rare knows that he knows nothing or he who really knows something about it but thinks that he knows all  my desire for knowledge is intermittent but my desire to bathe my head in atmospheres unknown to my feet is perennial and constant the highest that we can attain to is not knowledge but sympathy with intelligence i do not know that this higher knowledge amounts to anything more definite than a novel and grand surprise on a sudden revelation of the insufficiency of all that we called knowledge beforea discovery that there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in our philosophy it is the lighting up of the mist by the sun man cannot know in any higher sense than this any more than he can look serenely and with impunity in the face of sun greek os thi noon ou keiuou uoaeseisyou will not perceive that as perceiving a particular thing say the chaldean oracles  there is something servile in the habit of seeking after a law which we may obey we may study the laws of matter at and for our convenience but a successful life knows no law it is an unfortunate discovery certainly that of a law which binds us where we did not know before that we were bound live free child of the mistand with respect to knowledge we are all children of the mist the man who takes the liberty to live is superior to all the laws by virtue of his relation to the lawmaker that is active duty says the vishnu parana which is not for our bondage that is knowledge which is for our liberation all other duty is good only unto weariness all other knowledge is only the cleverness of an artist                                       it is remarkable how few events or crises there are in our histories how little exercised we have been in our minds how few experiences we have had i would fain be assured that i am growing apace and rankly though my very growth disturb this dull equanimitythough it be with struggle through long dark muggy nights or seasons of gloom it would be well if all our lives were a divine tragedy even instead of this trivial comedy or farce dante bunyan and others appear to have been exercised in their minds more than we they were subjected to a kind of culture such as our district schools and colleges do not contemplate even mahomet though many may scream at his name had a good deal more to live for ay and to die for than they have commonly  when at rare intervals some thought visits one as perchance he is walking on a railroad then indeed the cars go by without his hearing them but soon by some inexorable law our life goes by and the cars return    gentle breeze that wanderest unseen    and bendest the thistles round loira of storms    traveller of the windy glens    why hast thou left my ear so soon  while almost all men feel an attraction drawing them to society few are attracted strongly to nature in their relation to nature men appear to me for the most part notwithstanding their arts lower than the animals it is not often a beautiful relation as in the case of the animals how little appreciation of the beauty of the landscape there is among us we have to be told that the greeks called the world greek kosmos beauty or order but we do not see clearly why they did so and we esteem it at best only a curious philological fact  for my part i feel that with regard to nature i live a sort of border life on the confines of a world into which i make occasional and transional and transient forays only and my patriotism and allegiance to the state into whose territories i seem to retreat are those of a mosstrooper unto a life which i call natural i would gladly follow even a willothewisp through bogs and sloughs unimaginable but no moon nor firefly has shown me the causeway to it nature is a personality so vast and universal that we have never seen one of her features the walker in the familiar fields which stretch around my native town sometimes finds himself in another land than is described in their owners deeds as it were in some faraway field on the confines of the actual concord where her jurisdiction ceases and the idea which the word concord suggests ceases to be suggested these farms which i have myself surveyed these bounds which i have set up appear dimly still as through a mist but they have no chemistry to fix them they fade from the surface of the glass and the picture which the painter painted stands out dimly from beneath the world with which we are commonly acquainted leaves no trace and it will have no anniversary  i took a walk on spauldings farm the other afternoon i saw the setting sun lighting up the opposite side of a stately pine wood its golden rays straggled into the aisles of the wood as into some noble hall i was impressed as if some ancient and altogether admirable and shining family had settled there in that part of the land called concord unknown to meto whom the sun was servantwho had not gone into society in the villagewho had not been called on i saw their park their pleasureground beyond through the wood in spauldings cranberrymeadow the pines furnished them with gables as they grew their house was not obvious to vision the trees grew through it i do not know whether i heard the sounds of a suppressed hilarity or not they seemed to recline on the sunbeams they have sons and daughters they are quite well the farmers cartpath which leads directly through their hall does not in the least put them outas the muddy bottom of a pool is sometimes seen through the reflected skies they never heard of spaulding and do not know that he is their neighbornotwithstanding i heard him whistle as he drove his team through the house nothing can equal the serenity of their lives their coat of arms is simply a lichen i saw it painted on the pines and oaks their attics were in the tops of the trees they are of no politics there was no noise of labor i did not perceive that they were weaving or spinning yet i did detect when the wind lulled and hearing was done away the finest imaginable sweet musical humas of a distant hive in may which perchance was the sound of their thinking they had no idle thoughts and no one without could see their work for their industry was not as in knots and excrescences embayed  but i find it difficult to remember them they fade irrevocably out of my mind even now while i speak and endeavor to recall them and recollect myself it is only after a long and serious effort to recollect my best thoughts that i become again aware of their cohabitancy if it were not for such families as this i think i should move out of concord                                       we are accustomed to say in new england that few and fewer pigeons visit us every year our forests furnish no mast for them so it would seem few and fewer thoughts visit each growing man from year to year for the grove in our minds is laid wastesold to feed unnecessary fires of ambition or sent to mill and there is scarcely a twig left for them to perch on they no longer build nor breed with us in some more genial season perchance a faint shadow flits across the landscape of the mind cast by the wings of some thought in its vernal or autumnal migration but looking up we are unable to detect the substance of the thought itself our winged thoughts are turned to poultry they no longer soar and they attain only to a shanghai and cochinchina grandeur those graaate thoughts those graaate men you hear of                                       we hug the earthhow rarely we mount methinks we might elevate ourselves a little more we might climb a tree at least i found my account in climbing a tree once it was a tall white pine on the top of a hill and though i got well pitched i was well paid for it for i discovered new mountains in the horizon which i had never seen beforeso much more of the earth and the heavens i might have walked about the foot of the tree for threescore years and ten and yet i certainly should never have seen them but above all i discovered around meit was near the end of juneon the ends of the topmost branches only a few minute and delicate red conelike blossoms the fertile flower of the white pine looking heavenward i carried straightway to the village the topmost spire and showed it to stranger jurymen who walked the streetsfor it was courtweekand to farmers and lumberdealers and woodchoppers and hunters and not one had ever seen the like before but they wondered as at a star dropped down tell of ancient architects finishing their works on the tops of columns as perfectly as on the lower and more visible parts nature has from the first expanded the minute blossoms of the forest only toward the heavens above mens heads and unobserved by them we see only the flowers that are under our feet in the meadows the pines have developed their delicate blossoms on the highest twigs of the wood every summer for ages as well over the heads of natures red children as of her white ones yet scarcely a farmer or hunter in the land has ever seen them                                       above all we cannot afford not to live in the present he is blessed over all mortals who loses no moment of the passing life in remembering the past unless our philosophy hears the cock crow in every barnyard within our horizon it is belated that sound commonly reminds us that we are growing rusty and antique in our employments and habits of thought his philosophy comes down to a more recent time than ours there is something suggested by it that is a newer testamentthe gospel according to this moment he has not fallen astern he has got up early and kept up early and to be where he is to be in season in the foremost rank of time it is an expression of the health and soundness of nature a brag for all the worldhealthiness as of a spring burst forth a new fountain of the muses to celebrate this last instant of time where he lives no fugitive slave laws are passed who has not betrayed his master many times since last he heard that note  the merit of this birds strain is in its freedom from all plaintiveness the singer can easily move us to tears or to laughter but where is he who can excite in us a pure morning joy when in doleful dumps breaking the awful stillness of our wooden sidewalk on a sunday or perchance a watcher in the house of mourning i hear a cockerel crow far or near i think to myself there is one of us well at any rateand with a sudden gush return to my senses  we had a remarkable sunset one day last november i was walking in a meadow the source of a small brook when the sun at last just before setting after a cold gray day reached a clear stratum in the horizon and the softest brightest morning sunlight fell on the dry grass and on the stems of the trees in the opposite horizon and on the leaves of the shruboaks on the hillside while our shadows stretched long over the meadow eastward as if we were the only motes in its beams it was such a light as we could not have imagined a moment before and the air also was so warm and serene that nothing was wanting to make a paradise of that meadow when we reflected that this was not a solitary phenomenon never to happen again but that it would happen forever and ever an infinite number of evenings and cheer and reassure the latest child that walked there it was more glorious still  the sun sets on some retired meadow where no house is visible with all the glory and splendor that it lavishes on cities and perchance as it has never set beforewhere there is but a solitary marshhawk to have his wings gilded by it or only a musquash looks out from his cabin and there is some little blackveined brook in the midst of the marsh just beginning to meander winding slowly round a decaying stump we walked in so pure and bright a light gilding the withered grass and leaves so softly and serenely bright i thought i had never bathed in such a golden flood without a ripple or a murmur to it the west side of every wood and rising ground gleamed like the boundary of elysium and the sun on our backs seemed like a gentle herdsman driving us home at evening  so we saunter toward the holy land till one day the sun shall shine more brightly than ever he has done shall perchance shine into our minds and hearts and light up our whole lives with a great awakening light as warm and serene and golden as on a bankside in autumn    autumnal tints  1862   europeans coming to america are surprised by the brilliancy of our autumnal foliage there is no account of such a phenomenon in english poetry because the trees acquire but few bright colors there the most that thomson says on this subject in his autumn is contained in the lines    but see the fading manycolored woods    shade deepening over shade the country round    imbrown a crowded umbrage dusk and dun    of every hue from wan declining green to sooty dark  and in the line in which he speaks of           autumn beaming oer the yellow woods  the autumnal change of our woods has not made a deep impression on our own literature yet october has hardly tinged our poetry  a great many who have spent their lives in cities and have never chanced to come into the country at this season have never seen this the flower or rather the ripe fruit of the year i remember riding with one such citizen who though a fortnight too late for the most brilliant tints was taken by surprise and would not believe that there had been any brighter he had never heard of this phenomenon before not only many in our towns have never witnessed it but it is scarcely remembered by the majority from year to year  most appear to confound changed leaves with withered ones as if they were to confound ripe apples with rotten ones i think that the change to some higher color in a leaf is an evidence that it has arrived at a late and perfect maturity answering to the maturity of fruits it is generally the lowest and oldest leaves which change first but as the perfect winged and usually brightcolored insect is shortlived so the leaves ripen but to fall  generally every fruit on ripening and just before it falls when it commences a more independent and individual existence requiring less nourishment from any source and that not so much from the earth through its stem as from the sun and air acquires a bright tint so do leaves the physiologist says it is due to an increased absorption of oxygen that is the scientific account of the matteronly a reassertion of the fact but i am more interested in the rosy cheek than i am to know what particular diet the maiden fed on the very forest and herbage the pellicle of the earth must acquire a bright color an evidence of its ripenessas if the globe itself were a fruit on its stem with ever a cheek toward the sun  flowers are but colored leaves fruits but ripe ones the edible part of most fruits is as the physiologist says the parenchyma or fleshy tissue of the leaf of which they are formed  our appetites have commonly confined our views of ripeness and its phenomena color mellowness and perfectness to the fruits which we eat and we are wont to forget that an immense harvest which we do not eat hardly use at all is annually ripened by nature at our annual cattle shows and horticultural exhibitions we make as we think a great show of fair fruits destined however to a rather ignoble end fruits not valued for their beauty chiefly but round about and within our towns there is annually another show of fruits on an infinitely grander scale fruits which address our taste for beauty alone  october is the month for painted leaves their rich glow now flashes round the world as fruits and leaves and the day itself acquire a bright tint just before they fall so the year near its setting october is its sunset sky november the later twilight  i formerly thought that it would be worth the while to get a specimen leaf from each changing tree shrub and herbaceous plant when it had acquired its brightest characteristic color in its transition from the green to the brown state outline it and copy its color exactly with paint in a book which should be entitled october or autumnal tintsbeginning with the earliest reddeningwoodbine and the lake of radical leaves and coming down through the maples hickories and sumachs and many beautifully freckled leaves less generally known to the latest oaks and aspens what a memento such a book would be you would need only to turn over its leaves to take a ramble through the autumn woods whenever you pleased or if i could preserve the leaves themselves unfaded it would be better still i have made but little progress toward such a book but i have endeavored instead to describe all these bright tints in the order in which they present themselves the following are some extracts from my notes  the purple grasses  by the twentieth of august everywhere in woods and swamps we are reminded of the fall both by the richly spotted sarsaparillaleaves and brakes and the withering and blackened skunkcabbage and hellebore and by the riverside the already blackening pontederia  the purple grass eragrostis pectinacea is now in the height of its beauty i remember still when i first noticed this grass particularly standing on a hillside near our river i saw thirty or forty rods off a stripe of purple half a dozen rods long under the edge of a wood where the ground sloped toward a meadow it was as highcolored and interesting though not quite so bright as the patches of rhexia being a darker purple like a berrys stain laid on close and thick on going to and examining it i found it to be a kind of grass in bloom hardly a foot high with but few green blades and a fine spreading panicle of purple flowers a shallow purplish mist trembling around me close at hand it appeared but a dull purple and made little impression on the eye it was even difficult to detect and if you plucked a single plant you were surprised to find how thin it was and how little color it had but viewed at a distance in a favorable light it was of a fine lively purple flowerlike enriching the earth such puny causes combine to produce these decided effects i was the more surprised and charmed because grass is commonly of a sober and humble color  with its beautiful purple blush it reminds me and supplies the place of the rhexia which is now leaving off and it is one of the most interesting phenomena of august the finest patches of it grow on waste strips or selvages of land at the base of dry hills just above the edge of the meadows where the greedy mower does not deign to swing his scythe for this is a thin and poor grass beneath his notice or it may be because it is so beautiful he does not know that it exists for the same eye does not see this and timothy he carefully gets the meadow hay and the more nutritious grasses which grow next to that but he leaves this fine purple mist for the walkers harvestfodder for his fancy stock higher up the hill perchance grow also blackberries johnswort and neglected withered and wiry junegrass how fortunate that it grows in such places and not in the midst of the rank grasses which are annually cut nature thus keeps use and beauty distinct i know many such localities where it does not fail to present itself annually and paint the earth with its blush it grows on the gentle slopes either in a continuous patch or in scattered and rounded tufts a foot in diameter and it lasts till it is killed by the first smart frosts  in most plants the corolla or calyx is the part which attains the highest color and is the most attractive in many it is the seedvessel or fruit in others as the red maple the leaves and in others still it is the very culm itself which is the principal flower or blooming part  the last is especially the case with the poke or garget phytolacca decandra some which stand under our cliffs quite dazzle me with their purple stems now and early in september they are as interesting to me as most flowers and one of the most important fruits of our autumn every part is flower or fruit such is its superfluity of colorstem branch peduncle pedicel petiole and even the at length yellowish purpleveined leaves its cylindrical racemes of berries of various hues from green to dark purple six or seven inches long are gracefully drooping on all sides offering repasts to the birds and even the sepals from which the birds have picked the berries are a brilliant lakered with crimson flamelike reflections equal to anything of the kindall on fire with ripeness hence the lacca from lac lake there are at the same time flowerbuds flowers green berries dark purple or ripe ones and these flowerlike sepals all on the same plant  we love to see any redness in the vegetation of the temperate zone it is the color of colors this plant speaks to our blood it asks a bright sun on it to make it show to best advantage and it must be seen at this season of the year on warm hillsides its stems are ripe by the twentythird of august at that date i walked through a beautiful grove of them six or seven feet high on the side of one of our cliffs where they ripen early quite to the ground they were a deep brilliant purple with a bloom contrasting with the still clear green leaves it appears a rare triumph of nature to have produced and perfected such a plant as if this were enough for a summer what a perfect maturity it arrives at it is the emblem of a successful life concluded by a death not premature which is an ornament to nature what if we were to mature as perfectly root and branch glowing in the midst of our decay like the poke i confess that it excites me to behold them i cut one for a cane for i would fain handle and lean on it i love to press the berries between my fingers and see their juice staining my hand to walk amid these upright branching casks of purple wine which retain and diffuse a sunset glow tasting each one with your eye instead of counting the pipes on a london dock what a privilege for natures vintage is not confined to the vine our poets have sung of wine the product of a foreign plant which commonly they never saw as if our own plants had no juice in them more than the singers indeed this has been called by some the american grape and though a native of america its juices are used in some foreign countries to improve the color of the wine so that the poetaster may be celebrating the virtues of the poke without knowing it here are berries enough to paint afresh the western sky and play the bacchanal with if you will and what flutes its ensanguined stems would make to be used in such a dance it is truly a royal plant i could spend the evening of the year musing amid the pokestems and perchance amid these groves might arise at last a new school of philosophy or poetry it lasts all through september  at the same time with this or near the end of august a to me very interesting genus of grasses andropogons or beardgrasses is in its prime andropogon furcatus forked beardgrass or call it purplefingered grass andropogon scoparius purple wood grass and andropogon now called sorghum nutans indiangrass the first is a very tall and slenderculmed grass three to seven feet high with four or five purple fingerlike spikes raying upward from the top the second is also quite slender growing in tufts two feet high by one wide with culms often somewhat curving which as the spikes go out of bloom have a whitish fuzzy look these two are prevailing grasses at this season on dry and sandy fields and hillsides the culms of both not to mention their pretty flowers reflect a purple tinge and help to declare the ripeness of the year perhaps i have the more sympathy with them because they are despised by the farmer and occupy sterile and neglected soil they are highcolored like ripe grapes and express a maturity which the spring did not suggest only the august sun could have thus burnished these culms and leaves the farmer has long since done his upland haying and he will not condescend to bring his scythe to where these slender wild grasses have at length flowered thinly you often see spaces of bare sand amid them but i walk encouraged between the tufts of purple woodgrass over the sandy fields and along the edge of the shruboaks glad to recognize these simple contemporaries with thoughts cutting a broad swathe i get them with horseraking thoughts i gather them into windrows the fineeared poet may hear the whetting of my scythe these two were almost the first grasses that i learned to distinguish for i had not known by how many friends i was surroundedi had seen them simply as grasses standing the purple of their culms also excites me like that of the pokeweed stems  think what refuge there is for one before august is over from college commencements and society that isolates i can skulk amid the tufts of purple woodgrass on the borders of the great fields wherever i walk these afternoons the purplefingered grass also stands like a guideboard and points my thoughts to more poetic paths than they have lately travelled  a man shall perhaps rush by and trample down plants as high as his head and cannot be said to know that they exist though he may have cut many tons of them littered his stables with them and fed them to his cattle for years yet if he ever favorably attends to them he may be overcome by their beauty each humblest plant or weed as we call it stands there to express some thought or mood of ours and yet how long it stands in vain i had walked over those great fields so many augusts and never yet distinctly recognized these purple companions that i had there i had brushed against them and trodden on them forsooth and now at last they as it were rose up and blessed me beauty and true wealth are always thus cheap and despised heaven might be defined as the place which men avoid who can doubt that these grasses which the farmer says are of no account to him find some compensation in your appreciation of them i may say that i never saw them beforethough when i came to look them face to face there did come down to me a purple gleam from previous years and now wherever i go i see hardly anything else it is the reign and presidency of the andropogons  almost the very sands confess the ripening influence of the august sun and methinks together with the slender grasses waving over them reflect a purple tinge the impurpled sands such is the consequence of all this sunshine absorbed into the pores of plants and of the earth all sap or blood is now winecolored at last we have not only the purple sea but the purple land  the chestnut beardgrass indiangrass or woodgrass growing here and there in waste places but more rare than the former from two to four or five feet high is still handsomer and of more vivid colors than its congeners and might well have caught the indians eye it has a long narrow onesided and slightly nodding panicle of bright purple and yellow flowers like a banner raised above its reedy leaves these bright standards are now advanced on the distant hillsides not in large armies but in scattered troops or single file like the red men they stand thus fair and bright representative of the race which they are named after but for the most part unobserved as they the expression of this grass haunted me for a week after i first passed and noticed it like the glance of an eye it stands like an indian chief taking a last look at his favorite huntinggrounds  the red maple  by the twentyfifth of september the red maples generally are beginning to be ripe some large ones have been conspicuously changing for a week and some single trees are now very brilliant i notice a small one half a mile off across a meadow against the green woodside there a far brighter red than the blossoms of any tree in summer and more conspicuous i have observed this tree for several autumns invariably changing earlier than its fellows just as one tree ripens its fruit earlier than another it might serve to mark the season perhaps i should be sorry if it were cut down i know of two or three such trees in different parts of our town which might perhaps be propagated from as early ripeners or september trees and their seed be advertised in the market as well as that of radishes if we cared as much about them  at present these burning bushes stand chiefly along the edge of the meadows or i distinguish them afar on the hillsides here and there sometimes you will see many small ones in a swamp turned quite crimson when all other trees around are still perfectly green and the former appear so much the brighter for it they take you by surprise as you are going by on one side across the fields thus early in the season as if it were some gay encampment of the red men or other foresters of whose arrival you had not heard  some single trees wholly bright scarlet seen against others of their kind still freshly green or against evergreens are more memorable than whole groves will be byandby how beautiful when a whole tree is like one great scarlet fruit full of ripe juices every leaf from lowest limb to topmost spire all aglow especially if you look toward the sun what more remarkable object can there be in the landscape visible for miles too fair to be believed if such a phenomenon occurred but once it would be handed down by tradition to posterity and get into the mythology at last  the whole tree thus ripening in advance of its fellows attains a singular preeminence and sometimes maintains it for a week or two i am thrilled at the sight of it bearing aloft its scarlet standard for the regiment of greenclad foresters around and i go half a mile out of my way to examine it a single tree becomes thus the crowning beauty of some meadowy vale and the expression of the whole surrounding forest is at once more spirited for it  a small red maple has grown perchance far away at the head of some retired valley a mile from any road unobserved it has faithfully discharged the duties of a maple there all winter and summer neglected none of its economies but added to its stature in the virtue which belongs to a maple by a steady growth for so many months never having gone gadding abroad and is nearer heaven than it was in the spring it has faithfully husbanded its sap and afforded a shelter to the wandering bird has long since ripened its seeds and committed them to the winds and has the satisfaction of knowing perhaps that a thousand little wellbehaved maples are already settled in life somewhere it deserves well of mapledom its leaves have been asking it from time to time in a whisper when shall we redden and now in this month of september this month of travelling when men are hastening to the seaside or the mountains or the lakes this modest maple still without budging an inch travels in its reputationruns up its scarlet flag on that hillside which shows that it has finished its summers work before all other trees and withdraws from the contest at the eleventh hour of the year the tree which no scrutiny could have detected here when it was most industrious is thus by the tint of its maturity by its very blushes revealed at last to the careless and distant traveller and leads his thoughts away from the dusty road into those brave solitudes which it inhabits it flashes out conspicuous with all the virtue and beauty of a mapleacer rubrum we may now read its title or rubric clear its virtues not its sins are as scarlet  notwithstanding the red maple is the most intense scarlet of any of our trees the sugarmaple has been the most celebrated and michaux in his sylva does not speak of the autumnal color of the former about the second of october these trees both large and small are most brilliant though many are still green in sproutlands they seem to vie with one another and ever some particular one in the midst of the crowd will be of a peculiarly pure scarlet and by its more intense color attract our eye even at a distance and carry off the palm a large redmaple swamp when at the height of its change is the most obviously brilliant of all tangible things where i dwell so abundant is this tree with us it varies much both in form and color a great many are merely yellow more scarlet others scarlet deepening into crimson more red than common look at yonder swamp of maples mixed with pines at the base of a pineclad hill a quarter of a mile off so that you get the full effect of the bright colors without detecting the imperfections of the leaves and see their yellow scarlet and crimson fires of all tints mingled and contrasted with the green some maples are yet green only yellow or crimsontipped on the edges of their flakes like the edges of a hazelnut burr some are wholly brilliant scarlet raying out regularly and finely every way bilaterally like the veins of a leaf others of more irregular form when i turn my head slightly emptying out some of its earthiness and concealing the trunk of the tree seem to rest heavily flake on flake like yellow and scarlet clouds wreath upon wreath or like snowdrifts driving through the air stratified by the wind it adds greatly to the beauty of such a swamp at this season that even though there may be no other trees interspersed it is not seen as a simple mass of color but different trees being of different colors and hues the outline of each crescent treetop is distinct and where one laps on to another yet a painter would hardly venture to make them thus distinct a quarter of a mile off  as i go across a meadow directly toward a low rising ground this bright afternoon i see some fifty rods off toward the sun the top of a maple swamp just appearing over the sheeny russet edge of the hill a stripe apparently twenty rods long by ten feet deep of the most intensely brilliant scarlet orange and yellow equal to any flowers or fruits or any tints ever painted as i advance lowering the edge of the hill which makes the firm foreground or lower frame of the picture the depth of the brilliant grove revealed steadily increases suggesting that the whole of the inclosed valley is filled with such color one wonders that the tithingmen and fathers of the town are not out to see what the trees mean by their high colors and exuberance of spirits fearing that some mischief is brewing i do not see what the puritans did at this season when the maples blaze out in scarlet they certainly could not have worshipped in groves then perhaps that is what they built meetinghouses and fenced them round with horsesheds for  the elm  now too the first of october or later the elms are at the height of their autumnal beauty great brownishyellow masses warm from their september oven hanging over the highway their leaves are perfectly ripe i wonder if there is any answering ripeness in the lives of the men who live beneath them as i look down our street which is lined with them they remind me both by their form and color of yellowing sheaves of grain as if the harvest had indeed come to the village itself and we might expect to find some maturity and flavor in the thoughts of the villagers at last under those bright rustling yellow piles just ready to fall on the heads of the walkers how can any crudity or greenness of thought or act prevail when i stand where half a dozen large elms droop over a house it is as if i stood within a ripe pumpkinrind and i feel as mellow as if i were the pulp though i may be somewhat stringy and seedy withal what is the late greenness of the english elm like a cucumber out of season which does not know when to have done compared with the early and golden maturity of the american tree the street is the scene of a great harvesthome it would be worth the while to set out these trees if only for their autumnal value think of these great yellow canopies or parasols held over our heads and houses by the mile together making the village all one and compactan ulmarium which is at the same time a nursery of men and then how gently and unobserved they drop their burden and let in the sun when it is wanted their leaves not heard when they fall on our roofs and in our streets and thus the village parasol is shut up and put away i see the marketman driving into the village and disappearing under its canopy of elmtops with his crop as into a great granary or barnyard i am tempted to go thither as to a husking of thoughts now dry and ripe and ready to be separated from their integuments but alas i foresee that it will be chiefly husks and little thought blasted pigcorn fit only for cobmealfor as you sow so shall you reap  fallen leaves  by the sixth of october the leaves generally begin to fall in successive showers after frost or rain but the principal leafharvest the acme of the fall is commonly about the sixteenth some morning at that date there is perhaps a harder frost than we have seen and ice formed under the pump and now when the morning wind rises the leaves come down in denser showers than ever they suddenly form thick beds or carpets on the ground in this gentle air or even without wind just the size and form of the tree above some trees as small hickories appear to have dropped their leaves instantaneously as a soldier grounds arms at a signal and those of the hickory being bright yellow still though withered reflect a blaze of light from the ground where they lie down they have come on all sides at the first earnest touch of autumns wand making a sound like rain  or else it is after moist and rainy weather that we notice how great a fall of leaves there has been in the night though it may not yet be the touch that loosens the rockmaple leaf the streets are thickly strewn with the trophies and fallen elmleaves make a dark brown pavement under our feet after some remarkably warm indiansummer day or days i perceive that it is the unusual heat which more than anything causes the leaves to fall there having been perhaps no frost nor rain for some time the intense heat suddenly ripens and wilts them just as it softens and ripens peaches and other fruits and causes them to drop  the leaves of late red maples still bright strew the earth often crimsonspotted on a yellow ground like some wild applesthough they preserve these bright colors on the ground but a day or two especially if it rains on causeways i go by trees here and there all bare and smokelike having lost their brilliant clothing but there it lies nearly as bright as ever on the ground on one side and making nearly as regular a figure as lately on the tree i would rather say that i first observe the trees thus flat on the ground like a permanent colored shadow and they suggest to look for the boughs that bore them a queen might be proud to walk where these gallant trees have spread their bright cloaks in the mud i see wagons roll over them as a shadow or a reflection and the drivers heed them just as little as they did their shadows before  birdsnests in the huckleberry and other shrubs and in trees are already being filled with the withered leaves so many have fallen in the woods that a squirrel cannot run after a falling nut without being heard boys are raking them in the streets if only for the pleasure of dealing with such clean crisp substances some sweep the paths scrupulously neat and then stand to see the next breath strew them with new trophies the swampfloor is thickly covered and the lycopodium lucidulum looks suddenly greener amid them in dense woods they halfcover pools that are three or four rods long the other day i could hardly find a wellknown spring and even suspected that it had dried up for it was completely concealed by freshly fallen leaves and when i swept them aside and revealed it it was like striking the earth with aarons rod for a new spring wet grounds about the edges of swamps look dry with them at one swamp where i was surveying thinking to step on a leafy shore from a rail i got into the water more than a foot deep when i go to the river the day after the principal fall of leaves the sixteenth i find my boat all covered bottom and seats with the leaves of the golden willow under which it is moored and i set sail with a cargo of them rustling under my feet if i empty it it will be full again tomorrow i do not regard them as litter to be swept out but accept them as suitable straw or matting for the bottom of my carriage when i turn up into the mouth of the assabet which is wooded large fleets of leaves are floating on its surface as it were getting out to sea with room to tack but next the shore a little farther up they are thicker than foam quite concealing the water for a rod in width under and amid the alders buttonbushes and maples still perfectly light and dry with fibre unrelaxed and at a rocky bend where they are met and stopped by the morning wind they sometimes form a broad and dense crescent quite across the river when i turn my prow that way and the wave which it makes strikes them list what a pleasant rustling from these dry substances grating on one another often it is their undulation only which reveals the water beneath them also every motion of the woodturtle on the shore is betrayed by their rustling there or even in midchannel when the wind rises i hear them blown with a rustling sound higher up they are slowly moving round and round in some great eddy which the river makes as that at the leaning hemlocks where the water is deep and the current is wearing into the bank  perchance in the afternoon of such a day when the water is perfectly calm and full of reflections i paddle gently down the main stream and turning up the assabet reach a quiet cove where i unexpectedly find myself surrounded by myriads of leaves like fellowvoyagers which seem to have the same purpose or want of purpose with myself see this great fleet of scattered leafboats which we paddle amid in this smooth riverbay each one curled up on every side by the suns skill each nerve a stiff sprucekneelike boats of hide and of all patterns charons boat probably among the rest and some with lofty prows and poops like the stately vessels of the ancients scarcely moving in the sluggish currentlike the great fleets the dense chinese cities of boats with which you mingle on entering some great mart some new york or canton which we are all steadily approaching together how gently each has been deposited on the water no violence has been used towards them yet though perchance palpitating hearts were present at the launching and painted ducks too the splendid woodduck among the rest often come to sail and float amid the painted leavesbarks of a nobler model still  what wholesome herbdrinks are to be had in the swamps now what strong medicinal but rich scents from the decaying leaves the rain falling on the freshly dried herbs and leaves and filling the pools and ditches into which they have dropped thus clean and rigid will soon convert them into teagreen black brown and yellow teas of all degrees of strength enough to set all nature a gossiping whether we drink them or not as yet before their strength is drawn these leaves dried on great natures coppers are of such various pure and delicate tints as might make the fame of oriental teas  how they are mixed up of all species oak and maple and chestnut and birch but nature is not cluttered with them she is a perfect husbandman she stores them all consider what a vast crop is thus annually shed on the earth this more than any mere grain or seed is the great harvest of the year the trees are now repaying the earth with interest what they have taken from it they are discounting they are about to add a leafs thickness to the depth of the soil this is the beautiful way in which nature gets her muck while i chaffer with this man and that who talks to me about sulphur and the cost of carting we are all the richer for their decay i am more interested in this crop than in the english grass alone or in the corn it prepares the virgin mould for future cornfields and forests on which the earth fattens it keeps our homestead in good heart  for beautiful variety no crop can be compared with this here is not merely the plain yellow of the grains but nearly all the colors that we know the brightest blue not excepted the early blushing maple the poisonsumach blazing its sins as scarlet the mulberry ash the rich chromeyellow of the poplars the brilliant red huckleberry with which the hills backs are painted like those of sheep the frost touches them and with the slightest breath of returning day or jarring of earths axle see in what showers they come floating down the ground is all partycolored with them but they still live in the soil whose fertility and bulk they increase and in the forests that spring from it they stoop to rise to mount higher in coming years by subtle chemistry climbing by the sap in the trees and the saplings first fruits thus shed transmuted at last may adorn its crown when in afteryears it has become the monarch of the forest  it is pleasant to walk over the beds of these fresh crisp and rustling leaves how beautifully they go to their graves how gently lay themselves down and turn to mouldpainted of a thousand hues and fit to make the beds of us living so they troop to their last restingplace light and frisky they put on no weeds but merrily they go scampering over the earth selecting the spot choosing a lot ordering no iron fence whispering all through the woods about itsome choosing the spot where the bodies of men are mouldering beneath and meeting them halfway how many flutterings before they rest quietly in their graves they that soared so loftily how contentedly they return to dust again and are laid low resigned to lie and decay at the foot of the tree and afford nourishment to new generations of their kind as well as to flutter on high they teach us how to die one wonders if the time will ever come when men with their boasted faith in immortality will lie down as gracefully and as ripewith such an indiansummer serenity will shed their bodies as they do their hair and nails  when the leaves fall the whole earth is a cemetery pleasant to walk in i love to wander and muse over them in their graves here are no lying nor vain epitaphs what though you own no lot at mount auburn your lot is surely cast somewhere in this vast cemetery which has been consecrated from of old you need attend no auction to secure a place there is room enough here the loosestrife shall bloom and the huckleberrybird sing over your bones the woodman and hunter shall be your sextons and the children shall tread upon the borders as much as they will let us walk in the cemetery of the leavesthis is your true greenwood cemetery  the sugarmaple  but think not that the splendor of the year is over for as one leaf does not make a summer neither does one falling leaf make an autumn the smallest sugarmaples in our streets make a great show as early as the fifth of october more than any other trees there as i look up the main street they appear like painted screens standing before the houses yet many are green but now or generally by the seventeenth of october when almost all red maples and some white maples are bare the large sugarmaples also are in their glory glowing with yellow and red and show unexpectedly bright and delicate tints they are remarkable for the contrast they often afford of deep blushing red on one half and green on the other they become at length dense masses of rich yellow with a deep scarlet blush or more than blush on the exposed surfaces they are the brightest trees now in the street  the large ones on our common are particularly beautiful a delicate but warmer than golden yellow is now the prevailing color with scarlet cheeks yet standing on the east side of the common just before sundown when the western light is transmitted through them i see that their yellow even compared with the pale lemon yellow of an elm close by amounts to a scarlet without noticing the bright scarlet portions generally they are great regular oval masses of yellow and scarlet all the sunny warmth of the season the indiansummer seems to be absorbed in their leaves the lowest and inmost leaves next the bole are as usual of the most delicate yellow and green like the complexion of young men brought up in the house there is an auction on the common today but its red flag is hard to be discerned amid this blaze of color  little did the fathers of the town anticipate this brilliant success when they caused to be imported from farther in the country some straight poles with their tops cut off which they called sugarmaples and as i remember after they were set out a neighboring merchants clerk by way of jest planted beans about them those which were then jestingly called beanpoles are today far the most beautiful objects noticeable in our streets they are worth all and more than they have costthough one of the selectmen while setting them out took the cold which occasioned his deathif only because they have filled the open eyes of children with their rich color unstintedly so many octobers we will not ask them to yield us sugar in the spring while they afford us so fair a prospect in the autumn wealth indoors may be the inheritance of few but it is equally distributed on the common all children alike can revel in this golden harvest  surely trees should be set in our streets with a view to their october splendor though i doubt whether this is ever considered by the tree society do you not think it will make some odds to these children that they were brought up under the maples hundreds of eyes are steadily drinking in this color and by these teachers even the truants are caught and educated the moment they step abroad indeed neither the truant nor the studious is at present taught color in the schools these are instead of the bright colors in apothecaries shops and city windows it is a pity that we have no more red maples and some hickories in our streets as well our paintbox is very imperfectly filled instead of or beside supplying such paintboxes as we do we might supply these natural colors to the young where else will they study color under greater advantages what school of design can vie with this think how much the eyes of painters of all kinds and of manufacturers of cloth and paper and paperstainers and countless others are to be educated by these autumnal colors the stationers envelopes may be of very various tints yet not so various as those of the leaves of a single tree if you want a different shade or tint of a particular color you have only to look farther within or without the tree or the wood these leaves are not many dipped in one dye as at the dyehouse but they are dyed in light of infinitely various degrees of strength and left to set and dry there  shall the names of so many of our colors continue to be derived from those of obscure foreign localities as naples yellow prussian blue raw sienna burnt umber gambogesurely the tyrian purple must have faded by this timeor from comparatively trivial articles of commerce chocolate lemon coffee cinnamon claretshall we compare our hickory to a lemon or a lemon to a hickoryor from ores and oxides which few ever see shall we so often when describing to our neighbors the color of something we have seen refer them not to some natural object in our neighborhood but perchance to a bit of earth fetched from the other side of the planet which possibly they may find at the apothecarys but which probably neither they nor we ever saw have we not an earth under our feetay and a sky over our heads or is the last all ultramarine what do we know of sapphire amethyst emerald ruby amber and the likemost of us who take these names in vain leave these precious words to cabinetkeepers virtuosos and maidsofhonor to the nabobs begums and chobdars of hindostan or wherever else i do not see why since america and her autumn woods have been discovered our leaves should not compete with the precious stones in giving names to colors and indeed i believe that in course of time the names of some of our trees and shrubs as well as flowers will get into our popular chromatic nomenclature  but of much more importance than a knowledge of the names and distinctions of color is the joy and exhilaration which these colored leaves excite already these brilliant trees throughout the street without any more variety are at least equal to an annual festival and holiday or a week of such these are cheap and innocent galadays celebrated by one and all without the aid of committees or marshals such a show as may safely be licensed not attracting gamblers or rumsellers not requiring any special police to keep the peace and poor indeed must be that newengland villages october which has not the maple in its streets this october festival costs no powder nor ringing of bells but every tree is a living libertypole on which a thousand bright flags are waving  no wonder that we must have our annual cattleshow and fall training and perhaps cornwallis our september courts and the like nature herself holds her annual fair in october not only in the streets but in every hollow and on every hillside when lately we looked into that redmaple swamp all ablaze where the trees were clothed in their vestures of most dazzling tints did it not suggest a thousand gypsies beneatha race capable of wild delightor even the fabled fawns satyrs and woodnymphs come back to earth or was it only a congregation of wearied woodchoppers or of proprietors come to inspect their lots that we thought of or earlier still when we paddled on the river through that finegrained september air did there not appear to be something new going on under the sparkling surface of the stream a shaking of props at least so that we made haste in order to be up in time did not the rows of yellowing willows and buttonbushes on each side seem like rows of booths under which perhaps some fluviatile eggpop equally yellow was effervescing did not all these suggest that mans spirits should rise as high as naturesshould hang out their flag and the routine of his life be interrupted by an analogous expression of joy and hilarity  no annual training or muster of soldiery no celebration with its scarfs and banners could import into the town a hundredth part of the annual splendor of our october we have only to set the trees or let them stand and nature will find the colored draperyflags of all her nations some of whose private signals hardly the botanist can readwhile we walk under the triumphal arches of the elms leave it to nature to appoint the days whether the same as in neighboring states or not and let the clergy read her proclamations if they can understand them behold what a brilliant drapery is her woodbine flag what publicspirited merchant think you has contributed this part of the show there is no handsomer shingling and paint than this vine at present covering a whole side of some houses i do not believe that the ivy never sere is comparable to it no wonder it has been extensively introduced into london let us have a good many maples and hickories and scarlet oaks then i say blaze away shall that dirty roll of bunting in the gunhouse be all the colors a village can display a village is not complete unless it have these trees to mark the season in it they are important like the townclock a village that has them not will not be found to work well it has a screw loose an essential part is wanting let us have willows for spring elms for summer maples and walnuts and tupeloes for autumn evergreens for winter and oaks for all seasons what is a gallery in a house to a gallery in the streets which every marketman rides through whether he will or not of course there is not a picturegallery in the country which would be worth so much to us as is the western view at sunset under the elms of our main street they are the frame to a picture which is daily painted behind them an avenue of elms as large as our largest and three miles long would seem to lead to some admirable place though only c were at the end of it  a village needs these innocent stimulants of bright and cheering prospects to keep off melancholy and superstition show me two villages one embowered in trees and blazing with all the glories of october the other a merely trivial and treeless waste or with only a single tree or two for suicides and i shall be sure that in the latter will be found the most starved and bigoted religionists and the most desperate drinkers every washtub and milkcan and gravestone will be exposed the inhabitants will disappear abruptly behind their barns and houses like desert arabs amid their rocks and i shall look to see spears in their hands they will be ready to accept the most barren and forlorn doctrineas that the world is speedily coming to an end or has already got to it or that they themselves are turned wrong side outward they will perchance crack their dry joints at one another and call it a spiritual communication  but to confine ourselves to the maples what if we were to take half as much pains in protecting them as we do in setting them outnot stupidly tie our horses to our dahliastems  what meant the fathers by establishing this perfectly living institution before the churchthis institution which needs no repairing nor repainting which is continually enlarged and repaired by its growth surely they    wrought in a sad sincerity    themselves from god they could not free    they planted better than they knew    the conscious trees to beauty grew  verily these maples are cheap preachers permanently settled which preach their halfcentury and century ay and centuryandahalf sermons with constantly increasing unction and influence ministering to many generations of men and the least we can do is to supply them with suitable colleagues as they grow infirm  the scarlet oak  belonging to a genus which is remarkable for the beautiful form of its leaves i suspect that some scarletoak leaves surpass those of all other oaks in the rich and wild beauty of their outlines i judge from an acquaintance with twelve species and from drawings which i have seen of many others  stand under this tree and see how finely its leaves are cut against the skyas it were only a few sharp points extending from a midrib they look like double treble or quadruple crosses they are far more ethereal than the less deeply scolloped oakleaves they have so little leafy terra firma that they appear melting away in the light and scarcely obstruct our view the leaves of very young plants are like those of fullgrown oaks of other species more entire simple and lumpish in their outlines but these raised high on old trees have solved the leafy problem lifted higher and higher and sublimated more and more putting off some earthiness and cultivating more intimacy with the light each year they have at length the least possible amount of earthy matter and the greatest spread and grasp of skyey influences there they dance arm in arm with the lighttripping it on fantastic points fit partners in those aerial halls so intimately mingled are they with it that what with their slenderness and their glossy surfaces you can hardly tell at last what in the dance is leaf and what is light and when no zephyr stirs they are at most but a rich tracery to the forestwindows  i am again struck with their beauty when a month later they thickly strew the ground in the woods piled one upon another under my feet they are then brown above but purple beneath with their narrow lobes and their bold deep scollops reaching almost to the middle they suggest that the material must be cheap or else there has been a lavish expense in their creation as if so much had been cut out or else they seem to us the remnants of the stuff out of which leaves have been cut with a die indeed when they lie thus one upon another they remind me of a pile of scraptin  or bring one home and study it closely at your leisure by the fireside it is a type not from any oxford font not in the basque nor the arrowheaded character not found on the rosetta stone but destined to be copied in sculpture one day if they ever get to whittling stone here what a wild and pleasing outline a combination of graceful curves and angles the eye rests with equal delight on what is not leaf and on what is leafon the broad free open sinuses and on the long sharp bristlepointed lobes a simple oval outline would include it all if you connected the points of the leaf but how much richer is it than that with its halfdozen deep scollops in which the eye and thought of the beholder are embayed if i were a drawingmaster i would set my pupils to copying these leaves that they might learn to draw firmly and gracefully  regarded as water it is like a pond with half a dozen broad rounded promontories extending nearly to its middle half from each side while its watery bays extend far inland like sharp friths at each of whose heads several fine streams empty inalmost a leafy archipelago  but it oftener suggests land and as dionysius and pliny compared the form of the morea to that of the leaf of the oriental planetree so this leaf reminds me of some fair wild island in the ocean whose extensive coast alternate rounded bays with smooth strands and sharppointed rocky capes mark it as fitted for the habitation of man and destined to become a centre of civilization at last to the sailors eye it is a muchindented shore is it not in fact a shore to the aerial ocean on which the windy surf beats at sight of this leaf we are all marinersif not vikings buccaneers and filibusters both our love of repose and our spirit of adventure are addressed in our most casual glance perchance we think that if we succeed in doubling those sharp capes we shall find deep smooth and secure havens in the ample bays how different from the whiteoak leaf with its rounded headlands on which no lighthouse need be placed that is an england with its long civil history that may be read this is some still unsettled newfound island or celebes shall we go and be rajahs there  by the twentysixth of october the large scarlet oaks are in their prime when other oaks are usually withered they have been kindling their fires for a week past and now generally burst into a blaze this alone of our indigenous deciduous trees excepting the dogwood of which i do not know half a dozen and they are but large bushes is now in its glory the two aspens and the sugarmaple come nearest to it in date but they have lost the greater part of their leaves of evergreens only the pitchpine is still commonly bright  but it requires a particular alertness if not devotion to these phenomena to appreciate the widespread but late and unexpected glory of the scarlet oaks i do not speak here of the small trees and shrubs which are commonly observed and which are now withered but of the large trees most go in and shut their doors thinking that bleak and colorless november has already come when some of the most brilliant and memorable colors are not yet lit  this very perfect and vigorous one about forty feet high standing in an open pasture which was quite glossy green on the twelfth is now the twentysixth completely changed to bright dark scarletevery leaf between you and the sun as if it had been dipped into a scarlet dye the whole tree is much like a heart in form as well as color was not this worth waiting for little did you think ten days ago that that cold green tree would assume such color as this its leaves are still firmly attached while those of other trees are falling around it it seems to sayi am the last to blush but i blush deeper than any of ye i bring up the rear in my red coat we scarlet ones alone of oaks have not given up the fight  the sap is now and even far into november frequently flowing fast in these trees as in maples in the spring and apparently their bright tints now that most other oaks are withered are connected with this phenomenon they are full of life it has a pleasantly astringent acornlike taste this strong oakwine as i find on tapping them with my knife  looking across this woodland valley a quarter of a mile wide how rich those scarlet oaks embosomed in pines their bright red branches intimately intermingled with them they have their full effect there the pineboughs are the green calyx to their red petals or as we go along a road in the woods the sun striking endwise through it and lighting up the red tents of the oaks which on each side are mingled with the liquid green of the pines makes a very gorgeous scene indeed without the evergreens for contrast the autumnal tints would lose much of their effect  the scarlet oak asks a clear sky and the brightness of late october days these bring out its colors if the sun goes into a cloud they become comparatively indistinct as i sit on a cliff in the southwest part of our town the sun is now getting low and the woods in lincoln south and east of me are lit up by its more level rays and in the scarlet oaks scattered so equally over the forest there is brought out a more brilliant redness than i had believed was in them every tree of this species which is visible in those directions even to the horizon now stands out distinctly red some great ones lift their red backs high above the woods in the next town like huge roses with a myriad of fine petals and some more slender ones in a small grove of white pines on pine hill in the east on the very verge of the horizon alternating with the pines on the edge of the grove and shouldering them with their red coats look like soldiers in red amid hunters in green this time it is lincoln green too till the sun got low i did not believe that there were so many red coats in the forest army theirs is an intense burning red which would lose some of its strength methinks with every step you might take toward them for the shade that lurks amid their foliage does not report itself at this distance and they are unanimously red the focus of their reflected color is in the atmosphere far on this side every such tree becomes a nucleus of red as it were where with the declining sun that color grows and glows it is partly borrowed fire gathering strength from the sun on its way to your eye it has only some comparatively dull red leaves for a rallyingpoint or kindlingstuff to start it and it becomes an intense scarlet or red mist or fire which finds fuel for itself in the very atmosphere so vivacious is redness the very rails reflect a rosy light at this hour and season you see a redder tree than exists  if you wish to count the scarlet oaks do it now in a clear day stand thus on a hilltop in the woods when the sun is an hour high and every one within range of your vision excepting in the west will be revealed you might live to the age of methuselah and never find a tithe of them otherwise yet sometimes even in a dark day i have thought them as bright as i ever saw them looking westward their colors are lost in a blaze of light but in other directions the whole forest is a flowergarden in which these late roses burn alternating with green while the socalled gardeners walking here and there perchance beneath with spade and waterpot see only a few little asters amid withered leaves  these are my chinaasters my late gardenflowers it costs me nothing for a gardener the falling leaves all over the forest are protecting the roots of my plants only look at what is to be seen and you will have garden enough without deepening the soil in your yard we have only to elevate our view a little to see the whole forest as a garden the blossoming of the scarlet oakthe forestflower surpassing all in splendor at least since the maple i do not know but they interest me more than the maples they are so widely and equally dispersed throughout the forest they are so hardy a nobler tree on the wholeour chief november flower abiding the approach of winter with us imparting warmth to early november prospects it is remarkable that the latest bright color that is general should be this deep dark scarlet and red the intensest of colors the ripest fruit of the year like the cheek of a hard glossy red apple from the cold isle of orleans which will not be mellow for eating till next spring when i rise to a hilltop a thousand of these great oak roses distributed on every side as far as the horizon i admire them four or five miles off this my unfailing prospect for a fortnight past this late forestflower surpasses all that spring or summer could do their colors were but rare and dainty specks comparatively created for the nearsighted who walk amid the humblest herbs and underwoods and made no impression on a distant eye now it is an extended forest or a mountainside through or along which we journey from day to day that bursts into bloom comparatively our gardening is on a petty scalethe gardener still nursing a few asters amid dead weeds ignorant of the gigantic asters and roses which as it were overshadow him and ask for none of his care it is like a little red paint ground on a saucer and held up against the sunset sky why not take more elevated and broader views walk in the great garden not skulk in a little debauched nook of it consider the beauty of the forest and not merely of a few impounded herbs  let your walks now be a little more adventurous ascend the hills if about the last of october you ascend any hill in the outskirts of our town and probably of yours and look over the forest you may seewell what i have endeavored to describe all this you surely will see and much more if you are prepared to see itif you look for it otherwise regular and universal as this phenomenon is whether you stand on the hilltop or in the hollow you will think for threescore years and ten that all the wood is at this season sere and brown objects are concealed from our view not so much because they are out of the course of our visual ray as because we do not bring our minds and eyes to bear on them for there is no power to see in the eye itself any more than in any other jelly we do not realize how far and widely or how near and narrowly we are to look the greater part of the phenomena of nature are for this reason concealed from us all our lives the gardener sees only the gardeners garden here too as in political economy the supply answers to the demand nature does not cast pearls before swine there is just as much beauty visible to us in the landscape as we are prepared to appreciatenot a grain more the actual objects which one man will see from a particular hilltop are just as different from those which another will see as the beholders are different the scarlet oak must in a sense be in your eye when you go forth we cannot see anything until we are possessed with the idea of it take it into our headsand then we can hardly see anything else in my botanical rambles i find that first the idea or image of a plant occupies my thoughts though it may seem very foreign to this localityno nearer than hudsons bayand for some weeks or months i go thinking of it and expecting it unconsciously and at length i surely see it this is the history of my finding a score or more of rare plants which i could name a man sees only what concerns him a botanist absorbed in the study of grasses does not distinguish the grandest pasture oaks he as it were tramples down oaks unwittingly in his walk or at most sees only their shadows i have found that it required a different intention of the eye in the same locality to see different plants even when they were closely allied as juncaceoe and gramineoe when i was looking for the former i did not see the latter in the midst of them how much more then it requires different intentions of the eye and of the mind to attend to different departments of knowledge how differently the poet and the naturalist look at objects  take a newengland selectman and set him on the highest of our hills and tell him to looksharpening his sight to the utmost and putting on the glasses that suit him best ay using a spyglass if he likesand make a full report what probably will he spywhat will he select to look at of course he will see a brocken spectre of himself he will see several meetinghouses at least and perhaps that somebody ought to be assessed higher than he is since he has so handsome a woodlot now take julius caesar or immanuel swedenborg or a fegeeislander and set him up there or suppose all together and let them compare notes afterward will it appear that they have enjoyed the same prospect what they will see will be as different as rome was from heaven or hell or the last from the fegee islands for aught we know as strange a man as any of these is always at our elbow  why it takes a sharpshooter to bring down even such trivial game as snipes and woodcocks he must take very particular aim and know what he is aiming at he would stand a very small chance if he fired at random into the sky being told that snipes were flying there and so is it with him that shoots at beauty though he wait till the sky falls he will not bag any if he does not already know its seasons and haunts and the color of its wingif he has not dreamed of it so that he can anticipate it then indeed he flushes it at every step shoots double and on the wing with both barrels even in cornfields the sportsman trains himself dresses and watches unweariedly and loads and primes for his particular game he prays for it and offers sacrifices and so he gets it after due and long preparation schooling his eye and hand dreaming awake and asleep with gun and paddle and boat he goes out after meadowhens which most of his townsmen never saw nor dreamed of and paddles for miles against a headwind and wades in water up to his knees being out all day without his dinner and therefore he gets them he had them halfway into his bag when he started and has only to shove them down the true sportsman can shoot you almost any of his game from his windows what else has he windows or eyes for it comes and perches at last on the barrel of his gun but the rest of the world never see it with the feathers on the geese fly exactly under his zenith and honk when they get there and he will keep himself supplied by firing up his chimney twenty musquash have the refusal of each one of his traps before it is empty if he lives and his gamespirit increases heaven and earth shall fail him sooner than game and when he dies he will go to more extensive and perchance happier huntinggrounds the fisherman too dreams of fish sees a bobbing cork in his dreams till he can almost

up country where she came from the astronomer knows where to go stargathering and sees one clearly in his mind before any have seen it with a glass the hen scratches and finds her food right under where she stands but such is not the way with the hawk  these bright leaves which i have mentioned are not the exception but the rule for i believe that all leaves even grasses and mosses acquire brighter colors just before their fall when you come to observe faithfully the changes of each humblest plant you find that each has sooner or later its peculiar autumnal tint and if you undertake to make a complete list of the bright tints it will be nearly as long as a catalogue of the plants in your vicinity    wild apples  1862   the history of the appletree  it is remarkable how closely the history of the appletree is connected with that of man the geologist tells us that the order of the rosaceae which includes the apple also the true grasses and the labiatae or mints were introduced only a short time previous to the appearance of man on the globe  it appears that apples made a part of the food of that unknown primitive people whose traces have lately been found at the bottom of the swiss lakes supposed to be older than the foundation of rome so old that they had no metallic implements an entire black and shrivelled crabapple has been recovered from their stores  tacitus says of the ancient germans that they satisfied their hunger with wild apples agrestia poma among other things  niebuhr observes that the words for a house a field a plough ploughing wine oil milk sheep apples and others relating to agriculture and the gentler way of life agree in latin and greek while the latin words for all objects pertaining to war or the chase are utterly alien from the greek thus the appletree may be considered a symbol of peace no less than the olive  the apple was early so important and generally distributed that its name traced to its root in many languages signifies fruit in general greek maelon in greek means an apple also the fruit of other trees also a sheep and any cattle and finally riches in general  the appletree has been celebrated by the hebrews greeks romans and scandinavians some have thought that the first human pair were tempted by its fruit goddesses are fabled to have contended for it dragons were set to watch it and heroes were employed to pluck it  the tree is mentioned in at least three places in the old testament and its fruit in two or three more solomon singsas the appletree among the trees of the wood so is my beloved among the sons and againstay me with flagons comfort me with apples the noblest part of mans noblest feature is named from this fruit the apple of the eye  the appletree is also mentioned by homer and herodotus ulysses saw in the glorious garden of alcinous pears and pomegranates and appletrees bearing beautiful fruit kai maeleui aglaokarpoi and according to homer apples were among the fruits which tantalus could not pluck the wind ever blowing their boughs away from him theophrastus knew and described the appletree as a botanist  according to the prose edda iduna keeps in a box the apples which the gods when they feel old age approaching have only to taste of to become young again it is in this manner that they will be kept in renovated youth until ragnarök or the destruction of the gods  i learn from loudon that the ancient welsh bards were rewarded for excelling in song by the token of the applespray and in the highlands of scotland the appletree is the badge of theclan lamont  the appletree pyrus malus belongs chiefly to the northern temperate zone loudon says that it grows spontaneously in every part of europe except the frigid zone and throughout western asia china and japan we have also two or three varieties of the apple indigenous in north america the cultivated appletree was first introduced into this country by the earliest settlers and is thought to do as well or better here than anywhere else probably some of the varieties which are now cultivated were first introduced into britain by the romans  pliny adopting the distinction of theophrastus saysof trees there are some which are altogether wild sylvestres some more civilized urbaniores theophrastus includes the apple among the last and indeed it is in this sense the most civilized of all trees it is as harmless as a dove as beautiful as a rose and as valuable as flocks and herds it has been longer cultivated than any other and so is more humanized and who knows but like the dog it will at length be no longer traceable to its wild original it migrates with man like the dog and horse and cow first perchance from greece to italy thence to england thence to america and our western emigrant is still marching steadily toward the setting sun with the seeds of the apple in his pocket or perhaps a few young trees strapped to his load at least a million appletrees are thus set farther westward this year than any cultivated ones grew last year consider how the blossomweek like the sabbath is thus annually spreading over the prairies for when man migrates he carries with him not only his birds quadrupeds insects vegetables and his very sward but his orchard also  the leaves and tender twigs are an agreeable food to many domestic animals as the cow horse sheep and goat and the fruit is sought after by the first as well as by the hog thus there appears to have existed a natural alliance between these animals and this tree from the first the fruit of the crab in the forests of france is said to be a great resource for the wildboar  not only the indian but many indigenous insects birds and quadrupeds welcomed the appletree to these shores the tentcaterpillar saddled her eggs on the very first twig that was formed and it has since shared her affections with the wild cherry and the cankerworm also in a measure abandoned the elm to feed on it as it grew apace the bluebird robin cherrybird kingbird and many more came with haste and built their nests and warbled in its boughs and so became orchardbirds and multiplied more than ever it was an era in the history of their race the downy woodpecker found such a savory morsel under its bark that he perforated it in a ring quite round the tree before he left ita thing which he had never done before to my knowledge it did not take the partridge long to find out how sweet its buds were and every winter eve she flew and still flies from the wood to pluck them much to the farmers sorrow the rabbit too was not slow to learn the taste of its twigs and bark and when the fruit was ripe the squirrel halfrolled halfcarried it to his hole and even the musquash crept up the bank from the brook at evening and greedily devoured it until he had worn a path in the grass there and when it was frozen and thawed the crow and the jay were glad to taste it occasionally the owl crept into the first appletree that became hollow and fairly hooted with delight finding it just the place for him so settling down into it he has remained there ever since  my theme being the wild apple i will merely glance at some of the seasons in the annual growth of the cultivated apple and pass on to my special province  the flowers of the apple are perhaps the most beautiful of any trees so copious and so delicious to both sight and scent the walker is frequently tempted to turn and linger near some more than usually handsome one whose blossoms are two thirds expanded how superior it is in these respects to the pear whose blossoms are neither colored nor fragrant  by the middle of july green apples are so large as to remind us of coddling and of the autumn the sward is commonly strewed with little ones which fall stillborn as it werenature thus thinning them for us the roman writer palladius saidif apples are inclined to fall before their time a stone placed in a split root will retain them some such notion still surviving may account for some of the stones which we see placed to be overgrown in the forks of trees they have a saying in suffolk england    at michaelmas time or a little before    half an apple goes to the core  early apples begin to be ripe about the first of august but i think that none of them are so good to eat as some to smell one is worth more to scent your handkerchief with than any perfume which they sell in the shops the fragrance of some fruits is not to be forgotten along with that of flowers some gnarly apple which i pick up in the road reminds me by its fragrance of all the wealth of pomonacarrying me forward to those days when they will be collected in golden and ruddy heaps in the orchards and about the cidermills  a week or two later as you are going by orchards or gardens especially in the evenings you pass through a little region possessed by the fragrance of ripe apples and thus enjoy them without price and without robbing anybody  there is thus about all natural products a certain volatile and ethereal quality which represents their highest value and which cannot be vulgarized or bought and sold no mortal has ever enjoyed the perfect flavor of any fruit and only the godlike among men begin to taste its ambrosial qualities for nectar and ambrosia are only those fine flavors of every earthly fruit which our coarse palates fail to perceivejust as we occupy the heaven of the gods without knowing it when i see a particularly mean man carrying a load of fair and fragrant early apples to market i seem to see a contest going on between him and his horse on the one side and the apples on the other and to my mind the apples always gain it pliny says that apples are the heaviest of all things and that the oxen begin to sweat at the mere sight of a load of them our driver begins to lose his load the moment he tries to transport them to where they do not belong that is to any but the most beautiful though he gets out from time to time and feels of them and thinks they are all there i see the stream of their evanescent and celestial qualities going to heaven from his cart while the pulp and skin and core only are going to market they are not apples but pomace are not these still idunas apples the taste of which keeps the gods forever young and think you that they will let loki or thjassi carry them off to jötunheim while they grow wrinkled and gray no for ragnarök or the destruction of the gods is not yet  there is another thinning of the fruit commonly near the end of august or in september when the ground is strewn with windfalls and this happens especially when high winds occur after rain in some orchards you may see fully three quarters of the whole crop on the ground lying in a circular form beneath the trees yet hard and greenor if it is a hillside rolled far down the hill however it is an ill wind that blows nobody any good all the country over people are busy picking up the windfalls and this will make them cheap for early applepies  in october the leaves falling the apples are more distinct on the trees i saw one year in a neighboring town some trees fuller of fruit than i remember to have ever seen before small yellow apples hanging over the road the branches were gracefully drooping with their weight like a barberrybush so that the whole tree acquired a new character even the topmost branches instead of standing erect spread and drooped in all directions and there were so many poles supporting the lower ones that they looked like pictures of baniantrees as an old english manuscript says the mo appelen the tree bereth the more sche boweth to the folk  surely the apple is the noblest of fruits let the most beautiful or the swiftest have it that should be the going price of apples  between the fifth and twentieth of october i see the barrels lie under the trees and perhaps i talk with one who is selecting some choice barrels to fulfil an order he turns a specked one over many times before he leaves it out if i were to tell what is passing in my mind i should say that every one was specked which he had handled for he rubs off all the bloom and those fugacious ethereal qualities leave it cool eveings prompt the farmers to make haste and at length i see only the ladders here and there left leaning against the trees  it would be well if we accepted these gifts with more joy and gratitude and did not think it enough simply to put a fresh load of compost about the tree some old english customs are suggestive at least i find them described chiefly in brands popular antiquities it appears that on christmas eve the farmers and their men in devonshire take a large bowl of cider with a toast in it and carrying it in state to the orchard they salute the appletrees with much ceremony in order to make them bear well the next season this salutation consists in throwing some of the cider about the roots of the tree placing bits of the toast on the branches and then encircling one of the best bearing trees in the orchard they drink the following toast three several times    heres to thee old appletree  whence thou mayst bud and whence thou mayst blow  and whence thou mayst bear apples enow    hatsfull capsfull    bushel bushel sacksfull    and my pockets full too hurra  also what was called applehowling used to be practised in various counties of england on newyears eve a troop of boys visited the different orchards and encircling the appletrees repeated the following words    stand fast root bear well top    pray god send us a good howling crop    every twig apples big    every bow apples enow  they then shout in chorus one of the boys accompanying them on a cows horn during this ceremony they rap the trees with their sticks this is called wassailing the trees and is thought by some to be a relic of the heathen sacrifice to pomona  herrick sings    wassaile the trees that they may beare    you many a plum and many a peare    for more or less fruits they will bring    as you so give them wassailing  our poets have as yet a better right to sing of cider than of wine but it behooves them to sing better than english phillips did else they will do no credit to their muse  the wild apple  so much for the more civilized appletrees urbaniores as pliny calls them i love better to go through the old orchards of ungrafted appletrees at whatever season of the yearso irregularly planted sometimes two trees standing close together and the rows so devious that you would think that they not only had grown while the owner was sleeping but had been set out by him in a somnambulic state the rows of grafted fruit will never tempt me to wander amid them like these but i now alas speak rather from memory than from any recent experience such ravages have been made  some soils like a rocky tract called the easterbrooks country in my neighborhood are so suited to the apple that it will grow faster in them without any care or if only the ground is broken up once a year than it will in many places with any amount of care the owners of this tract allow that the soil is excellent for fruit but they say that it is so rocky that they have not patience to plough it and that together with the distance is the reason why it is not cultivated there are or were recently extensive orchards there standing without order nay they spring up wild and bear well there in the midst of pines birches maples and oaks i am often surprised to see rising amid these trees the rounded tops of appletrees glowing with red or yellow fruit in harmony with the autumnal tints of the forest  going up the side of a cliff about the first of november i saw a vigorous young appletree which planted by birds or cows had shot up amid the rocks and open woods there and had now much fruit on it uninjured by the frosts when all cultivated apples were gathered it was a rank wild growth with many green leaves on it still and made an impression of thorniness the fruit was hard and green but looked as if it would be palatable in the winter some was dangling on the twigs but more halfburied in the wet leaves under the tree or rolled far down the hill amid the rocks the owner knows nothing of it the day was not observed when it first blossomed nor when it first bore fruit unless by the chickadee there was no dancing on the green beneath it in its honor and now there is no hand to pluck its fruitwhich is only gnawed by squirrels as i perceive it has done double dutynot only borne this crop but each twig has grown a foot into the air and this is such fruit bigger than many berries we must admit and carried home will be sound and palatable next spring what care i for idunas apples so long as i can get these  when i go by this shrub thus late and hardy and see its dangling fruit i respect the tree and i am grateful for natures bounty even though i cannot eat it here on this rugged and woody hillside has grown an appletree not planted by man no relic of a former orchard but a natural growth like the pines and oaks most fruits which we prize and use depend entirely on our care corn and grain potatoes peaches melons etc depend altogether on our planting but the apple emulates mans independence and enterprise it is not simply carried as i have said but like him to some extent it has migrated to this new world and is even here and there making its way amid the aboriginal trees just as the ox and dog and horse sometimes run wild and maintain themselves  even the sourest and crabbedest apple growing in the most unfavorable position suggests such thoughts as these it is so noble a fruit  the crab  nevertheless our wild apple is wild only like myself perchance who belong not to the aboriginal race here but have strayed into the woods from the cultivated stock wilder still as i have said there grows elsewhere in this country a native and aboriginal crabapple malus coronaria whose nature has not yet been modified by cultivation it is found from western newyork to minnesota and southward michaux says that its ordinary height is fifteen or eighteen feet but it is sometimes found twentyfive or thirty feet high and that the large ones exactly resemble the common appletree the flowers are white mingled with rosecolor and are collected in corymbs they are remarkable for their delicious odor the fruit according to him is about an inch and a half in diameter and is intensely acid yet they make fine sweetmeats and also cider of them he concludes that if on being cultivated it does not yield new and palatable varieties it will at least be celebrated for the beauty of its flowers and for the sweetness of its perfume  i never saw the crabapple till may 1861 i had heard of it through michaux but more modern botanists so far as i know have not treated it as of any peculiar importance thus it was a halffabulous tree to me i contemplated a pilgrimage to the glades a portion of pennsylvania where it was said to grow to perfection i thought of sending to a nursery for it but doubted if they had it or would distinguish it from european varieties at last i had occasion to go to minnesota and on entering michigan i began to notice from the cars a tree with handsome rosecolored flowers at first i thought it some variety of thorn but it was not long before the truth flashed on me that this was my longsought crabapple it was the prevailing flowering shrub or tree to be seen from the cars at that season of the yearabout the middle of may but the cars never stopped before one and so i was launched on the bosom of the mississippi without having touched one experiencing the fate of tantalus on arriving at st anthonys falls i was sorry to be told that i was too far north for the crabapple nevertheless i succeeded in finding it about eight miles west of the falls touched it and smelled it and secured a lingering corymb of flowers for my herbarium this must have been near its northern limit  how the wild apple grows  but though these are indigenous like the indians i doubt whether they are any hardier than those backwoodsmen among the appletrees which though descended from cultivated stocks plant themselves in distant fields and forests where the soil is favorable to them i know of no trees which have more difficulties to contend with and which more sturdily resist their foes these are the ones whose story we have to tell it oftentimes reads thus  near the beginning of may we notice little thickets of appletrees just springing up in the pastures where cattle have beenas the rocky ones of our easterbrooks country or the top of nobscot hill in sudbury one or two of these perhaps survive the drought and other accidentstheir very birthplace defending them against the encroaching grass and some other dangers at first  in two years time t had thus   reached the level of the rocks admired the stretching world   nor feared the wandering flocks  but at this tender age   its sufferings began there came a browsing ox  and cut it down a span  this time perhaps the ox does not notice it amid the grass but the next year when it has grown more stout he recognizes it for a fellowemigrant from the old country the flavor of whose leaves and twigs he well knows and though at first he pauses to welcome it and express his surprise and gets for answer the same cause that brought you here brought me he nevertheless browses it again reflecting it may be that he has some title to it  thus cut down annually it does not despair but putting forth two short twigs for every one cut off it spreads out low along the ground in the hollows or between the rocks growing more stout and scrubby until it forms not a tree as yet but a little pyramidal stiff twiggy mass almost as solid and impenetrable as a rock some of the densest and most impenetrable clumps of bushes that i have ever seen as well on account of the closeness and stubbornness of their branches as of their thorns have been these wildapple scrubs they are more like the scrubby fir and black spruce on which you stand and sometimes walk on the tops of mountains where cold is the demon they contend with than anything else no wonder they are prompted to grow thorns at last to defend themselves against such foes in their thorniness however there is no malice only some malic acid  the rocky pastures of the tract i have referred tofor they maintain their ground best in a rocky fieldare thickly sprinkled with these little tufts reminding you often of some rigid gray mosses or lichens and you see thousands of little trees just springing up between them with the seed still attached to them  being regularly clipped all around each year by the cows as a hedge with shears they are often of a perfect conical or pyramidal form from one to four feet high and more or less sharp as if trimmed by the gardeners art in the pastures on nobscot hill and its spurs they make fine dark shadows when the sun is low they are also an excellent covert from hawks for many small birds that roost and build in them whole flocks perch in them at night and i have seen three robins nests in one which was six feet in diameter  no doubt many of these are already old trees if you reckon from the day they were planted but infants still when you consider their development and the long life before them i counted the annual rings of some which were just one foot high and as wide as high and found that they were about twelve years old but quite sound and thrifty they were so low that they were unnoticed by the walker while many of their contemporaries from the nurseries were already bearing considerable crops but what you gain in time is perhaps in this case too lost in powerthat is in the vigor of the tree this is their pyramidal state  the cows continue to browse them thus for twenty years or more keeping them down and compelling them to spread until at last they are so broad that they become their own fence when some interior shoot which their foes cannot reach darts upward with joy for it has not forgotten its high calling and bears its own peculiar fruit in triumph  such are the tactics by which it finally defeats its bovine foes now if you have watched the progress of a particular shrub you will see that it is no longer a simple pyramid or cone but that out of its apex there rises a sprig or two growing more lustily perchance than an orchardtree since the plant now devotes the whole of its repressed energy to these upright parts in a short time these become a small tree an inverted pyramid resting on the apex of the other so that the whole has now the form of a vast hourglass the spreading bottom having served its purpose finally disappears and the generous tree permits the now harmless cows to come in and stand in its shade and rub against and redden its trunk which has grown in spite of them and even to taste a part of its fruit and so disperse the seed  thus the cows create their own shade and food and the tree its hourglass being inverted lives a second life as it were  it is an important question with some nowadays whether you should trim young appletrees as high as your nose or as high as your eyes the ox trims them up as high as he can reach and that is about the right height i think  in spite of wandering kine and other adverse circumstances that despised shrub valued only by small birds as a covert and shelter from hawks has its blossomweek at last and in coarse of time its harvest sincere though small  by the end of some october when its leaves have fallen i frequently see such a central sprig whose progress i have watched when i thought it had forgotten its destiny as i had bearing its first crop of small green or yellow or rosy fruit which the cows cannot get at over the bushy and thorny hedge which surrounds it and i make haste to taste the new and undescribed variety we have all heard of the numerous varieties of fruit invented by van mons and knight this is the system of van cow and she has invented far more and more memorable varieties than both of them  through what hardships it may attain to bear a sweet fruit though somewhat small it may prove equal if not superior in flavor to that which has grown in a gardenwill perchance be all the sweeter and more palatable for the very difficulties it has had to contend with who knows but this chance wild fruit planted by a cow or a bird on some remote and rocky hillside where it is as yet unobserved by man may be the choicest of all its kind and foreign potentates shall hear of it and royal societies seek to propagate it though the virtues of the perhaps truly crabbed owner of the soil may never be heard ofat least beyond the limits of his village it was thus the porter and the baldwin grew  every wildapple shrub excites our expectation thus somewhat as every wild child it is perhaps a prince in disguise what a lesson to man so are human beings referred to the highest standard the celestial fruit which they suggest and aspire to bear browsed on by fate and only the most persistent and strongest genius defends itself and prevails sends a tender scion upward at last and drops its perfect fruit on the ungrateful earth poets and philosophers and statesmen thus spring up in the country pastures and outlast the hosts of unoriginal men  such is always the pursuit of knowledge the celestial fruits the golden apples of the hesperides are ever guarded by a hundredheaded dragon which never sleeps so that it is an herculean labor to pluck them  this is one and the most remarkable way in which the wild apple is propagated but commonly it springs up at wide intervals in woods and swamps and by the sides of roads as the soil may suit it and grows with comparative rapidity those which grow in dense woods are very tall and slender i frequently pluck from these trees a perfectly mild and tamed fruit as palladius says et injussu consternitur ubere mali and the ground is strewn with the fruit of an unbidden appletree  it is an old notion that if these wild trees do not bear a valuable fruit of their own they are the best stocks by which to transmit to posterity the most highly prized qualities of others however i am not in search of stocks but the wild fruit itself whose fierce gust has suffered no inteneration it is not my                 highest plot        to plant the bergamot  the fruit and its flavor  the time for wild apples is the last of october and the first of november they then get to be palatable for they ripen late and they are still perhaps as beautiful as ever i make a great account of these fruits which the farmers do not think it worth the while to gatherwild flavors of the muse vivacious and inspiriting the farmer thinks that he has better in his barrels but he is mistaken unless he has a walkers appetite and imagination neither of which can he have  such as grow quite wild and are left out till the first of november i presume that the owner does not mean to gather they belong to children as wild as themselvesto certain active boys that i knowto the wildeyed woman of the fields to whom nothing comes amiss who gleans after all the worldand moreover to us walkers we have met with them and they are ours these rights long enough insisted upon have come to be an institution in some old countries where they have learned how to live i hear that the custom of grippling which may be called applegleaning is or was formerly practised in herefordshire it consists in leaving a few apples which are called the gripples on every tree after the general gathering for the boys who go with climbingpoles and bags to collect them  as for those i speak of i pluck them as a wild fruit native to this quarter of the earthfruit of old trees that have been dying ever since i was a boy and are not yet dead frequented only by the woodpecker and the squirrel deserted now by the owner who has not faith enough to look under their boughs from the appearance of the treetop at a little distance you would expect nothing but lichens to drop from it but your faith is rewarded by finding the ground strewn with spirited fruitsome of it perhaps collected at squirrelholes with the marks of their teeth by which they carried themsome containing a cricket or two silently feeding within and some especially in damp days a shelless snail the very sticks and stones lodged in the treetop might have convinced you of the savoriness of the fruit which has been so eagerly sought after in past years  i have seen no account of these among the fruits and fruittrees of america though they are more memorable to my taste than the grafted kinds more racy and wild american flavors do they possess when october and november when december and january and perhaps february and march even have assuaged them somewhat an old farmer in my neighborhood who always selects the right word says that they have a kind of bowarrow tang  apples for grafting appear to have been selected commonly not so much for their spirited flavor as for their mildness their size and bearing qualitiesnot so much for their beauty as for their fairness and soundness indeed i have no faith in the selected lists of pomological gentlemen their favorites and nonesuches and seeknofarthers when i have fruited them commonly turn out very tame and forgetable they are eaten with comparatively little zest and have no real tang nor smack to them  what if some of these wildings are acrid and puckery genuine verjuice do they not still belong to the pomaceae which are uniformly innocent and kind to our race i still begrudge them to the cidermill perhaps they are not fairly ripe yet  no wonder that these small and highcolored apples are thought to make the best cider loudon quotes from the herefordshire report that apples of a small size are always if equal in quality to be preferred to those of a larger size in order that the rind and kernel may bear the greatest proportion to the pulp which affords the weakest and most watery juice and he says that to prove this dr symonds of hereford about the year 1800 made one hogshead of cider entirely from the rinds and cores of apples and another from the pulp only when the first was found of extraordinary strength and flavor while the latter was sweet and insipid  evelyn says that the redstrake was the favorite ciderapple in his day and he quotes one dr newburg as saying in jersey t is a general observation as i hear that the more of red any apple has in its rind the more proper it is for this use palefaced apples they exclude as much as may be from their cidervat this opinion still prevails  all apples are good in november those which the farmer leaves out as unsalable and unpalatable to those who frequent the markets are choicest fruit to the walker but it is remarkable that the wild apple which i praise as so spirited and racy when eaten in the fields or woods being brought into the house has frequently a harsh and crabbed taste the saunterers apple not even the saunterer can eat in the house the palate rejects it there as it does haws and acorns and demands a tamed one for there you miss the november air which is the sauce it is to be eaten with accordingly when tityrus seeing the lengthening shadows invites meliboeus to go home and pass the night with him he promises him mild apples and soft chestnutsmitia poma castaneae molles i frequently pluck wild apples of so rich and spicy a flavor that i wonder all orchardists do not get a scion from that tree and i fail not to bring home my pockets full but perchance when i take one out of my desk and taste it in my chamber i find it unexpectedly crudesour enough to set a squirrels teeth on edge and make a jay scream  these apples have hung in the wind and frost and rain till they have absorbed the qualities of the weather or season and thus are highly seasoned and they pierce and sting and permeate us with their spirit they must be eaten in season accordinglythat is outofdoors  to appreciate the wild and sharp flavors of these october fruits it is necessary that you be breathing the sharp october or november air the outdoor air and exercise which the walker gets give a different tone to his palate and he craves a fruit which the sedentary would call harsh and crabbed they must be eaten in the fields when your system is all aglow with exercise when the frosty weather nips your fingers the wind rattles the bare boughs or rustles the few remaining leaves and the jay is heard screaming around what is sour in the house a bracing walk makes sweet some of these apples might be labelled to be eaten in the wind  of course no flavors are thrown away they are intended for the taste that is up to them some apples have two distinct flavors and perhaps onehalf of them must be eaten in the house the other outdoors one peter whitney wrote from northborough in 1782 for the proceedings of the boston academy describing an appletree in that town producing fruit of opposite qualities part of the same apple being frequently sour and the other sweet also some all sour and others all sweet and this diversity on all parts of the tree  there is a wild apple on nawshawtuck hill in my town which has to me a peculiarly pleasant bitter tang not perceived till it is threequarters tasted it remains on the tongue as you eat it it smells exactly like a squashbug it is a sort of triumph to eat and relish it  i hear that the fruit of a kind of plumtree in provence is called prunes sibarelles because it is impossible to whistle after having eaten them from their sourness but perhaps they were only eaten in the house and in summer and if tried outofdoors in a stinging atmosphere who knows but you could whistle an octave higher and clearer  in the fields only are the sours and bitters of nature appreciated just as the woodchopper eats his meal in a sunny glade in the middle of a winter day with content basks in a sunny ray there and dreams of summer in a degree of cold which experienced in a chamber would make a student miserable they who are at work abroad are not cold but rather it is they who sit shivering in houses as with temperatures so with flavors as with cold and heat so with sour and sweet this natural raciness the sours and bitters which the diseased palate refuses are the true condiments  let your condiments be in the condition of your senses to appreciate the flavor of these wild apples requires vigorous and healthy senses papillae firm and erect on the tongue and palate not easily flattened and tamed  from my experience with wild apples i can understand that there may be reason for a savages preferring many kinds of food which the civilized man rejects the former has the palate of an outdoor man it takes a savage or wild taste to appreciate a wild fruit  what a healthy outofdoor appetite it takes to relish the apple of life the apple of the world then    nor is it every apple i desire    nor that which pleases every palate best    t is not the lasting deuxan i require    nor yet the redcheeked greening i request    nor that which first beshrewed the name of wife    nor that whose beauty caused the golden strife    no no i bring me an apple from the tree of life  so there is one thought for the field another for the house i would have my thoughts like wild apples to be food for walkers and will not warrant them to be palatable if tasted in the house  their beauty  almost all wild apples are handsome they cannot be too gnarly and crabbed and rusty to look at the gnarliest will have some redeeming traits even to the eye you will discover some evening redness dashed or sprinkled on some protuberance or in some cavity it is rare that the summer lets an apple go without streaking or spotting it on some part of its sphere it will have some red stains commemorating the mornings and evenings it has witnessed some dark and rusty blotches in memory of the clouds and foggy mildewy days that have passed over it and a spacious field of green reflecting the general face of naturegreen even as the fields or a yellow ground which implies a milder flavoryellow as the harvest or russet as the hills  apples these i mean unspeakably fairapples not of discord but of concord yet not so rare but that the homeliest may have a share painted by the frosts some a uniform clear bright yellow or red or crimson as if their spheres had regularly revolved and enjoyed the influence of the sun on all sides alikesome with the faintest pink blush imaginable some brindled with deep red streaks like a cow or with hundreds of fine bloodred rays running regularly from the stemdimple to the blossomend like meridional lines on a strawcolored groundsome touched with a greenish rust like a fine lichen here and there with crimson blotches or eyes more or less confluent and fiery when wetand others gnarly and freckled or peppered all over on the stem side with fine crimson spots on a white ground as if accidentally sprinkled from the brush of him who paints the autumn leaves others again are sometimes red inside perfused with a beautiful blush fairy food too beautiful to eatapple of the hesperides apple of the evening sky but like shells and pebbles on the seashore they must be seen as they sparkle amid the withering leaves in some dell in the woods in the autumnal air or as they lie in the wet grass and not when they have wilted and faded in the house  the naming of them  it would be a pleasant pastime to find suitable names for the hundred varieties which go to a single heap at the cidermill would it not tax a mans inventionno one to be named after a man and all in the lingua vernacula who shall stand godfather at the christening of the wild apples it would exhaust the latin and greek languages if they were used and make the lingua vernacula flag we should have to call in the sunrise and the sunset the rainbow and the autumn woods and the wild flowers and the woodpecker and the purple finch and the squirrel and the jay and the butterfly the november traveller and the truant boy to our aid  in 1836 there were in the garden of the london horticultural society more than fourteen hundred distinct sorts but here are species which they have not in their catalogue not to mention the varieties which our crab might yield to cultivation  let us enumerate a few of these i find myself compelled after all to give the latin names of some for the benefit of those who live where english is not spokenfor they are likely to have a worldwide reputation  there is first of all the woodapple malus sylvatica the bluejay apple the apple which grows in dells in the woods sylvestrivallis also in hollows in pastures campestrivallis the apple that grows in an old cellarhole malus cellaris the meadowapple the partridgeapple the truants apple cessatoris which no boy will ever go by without knocking off some however late it may be the saunterers appleyou must lose yourself before you can find the way to that the beauty of the air decus aeris decembereating the frozenthawed gelatosoluta good only in that state the concord apple possibly the same with the musketaquidensis the assabet apple the brindled apple wine of new england the chickaree apple the green apple malus viridisthis has many synonymes in an imperfect state it is the cholera morbifera aut dysenterifera puerulis dilectissimathe apple which atalanta stopped to pick up the hedgeapple malus sepium the slugapple limacea the railroadapple which perhaps came from a core thrown out of the cars the apple whose fruit we tasted in our youth our particular apple not to be found in any cataloguepedestrium solatium also the apple where hangs the forgotten scythe idunas apples and the apples which loki found in the wood and a great many more i have on my list too numerous to mentionall of them good as bodaeus exclaims referring to the cultivated kinds and adapting virgil to his case so i adapting bodaeus    not if i had a hundred tongues a hundred mouths    an iron voice could i describe all the forms    and reckon up all the names of these wild apples  the last gleaning  by the middle of november the wild apples have lost some of their brilliancy and have chiefly fallen a great part are decayed on the ground and the sound ones are more palatable than before the note of the chickadee sounds now more distinct as you wander amid the old trees and the autumnal dandelion is halfclosed and tearful but still if you are a skilful gleaner you may get many a pocketfull even of grafted fruit long after apples are supposed to be gone outofdoors i know a bluepearmain tree growing within the edge of a swamp almost as good as wild you would not suppose that there was any fruit left there on the first survey but you must look according to system those which lie exposed are quite brown and rotten now or perchance a few still show one blooming cheek here and there amid the wet leaves nevertheless with experienced eyes i explore amid the bare alders and the huckleberrybushes and the withered sedge and in the crevices of the rocks which are full of leaves and pry under the fallen and decaying ferns which with apple and alder leaves thickly strew the ground for i know that they lie concealed fallen into hollows long since and covered up by the leaves of the tree itselfa proper kind of packing from these lurkingplaces anywhere within the circumference of the tree i draw forth the fruit all wet and glossy maybe nibbled by rabbits and hollowed out by crickets and perhaps with a leaf or two cemented to it as curzon an old manuscript from a monasterys mouldy cellar but still with a rich bloom on it and at least as ripe and well kept if not better than those in barrels more crisp and lively than they if these resources fail to yield anything i have learned to look between the bases of the suckers which spring thickly from some horizontal limb for now and then one lodges there or in the very midst of an alderclump where they are covered by leaves safe from cows which may have smelled them out if i am sharpset for i do not refuse the bluepearmain i fill my pockets on each side and as i retrace my steps in the frosty eve being perhaps four or five miles from home i eat one first from this side and then from that to keep my balance  i learn from topsells gesner whose authority appears to be albertus that the following is the way in which the hedgehog collects and carries home his apples he sayshis meat is apples worms or grapes when he findeth apples or grapes on the earth he rolleth himself upon them until he have filled all his prickles and then carrieth them home to his den never bearing above one in his mouth and if it fortune that one of them fall off by the way he likewise shaketh off all the residue and walloweth upon them afresh until they be all settled upon his back again so forth he goeth making a noise like a cartwheel and if he have any young ones in his nest they pull off his load wherewithal he is loaded eating thereof what they please and laying up the residue for the time to come  the frozenthawed apple  toward the end of november though some of the sound ones are yet more mellow and perhaps more edible they have generally like the leaves lost their beauty and are beginning to freeze it is fingercold and prudent farmers get in their barrelled apples and bring you the apples and cider which they have engaged for it is time to put them into the cellar perhaps a few on the ground show their red cheeks above the early snow and occasionally some even preserve their color and soundness under the snow throughout the winter but generally at the beginning of the winter they freeze hard and soon though undecayed acquire the color of a baked apple  before the end of december generally they experience their first thawing those which a month ago were sour crabbed and quite unpalatable to the civilized taste such at least as were frozen while sound let a warmer sun come to thaw them for they are extremely sensitive to its rays are found to be filled with a rich sweet cider better than any bottled cider that i know of and with which i am better acquainted than with wine all apples are good in this state and your jaws are the ciderpress others which have more substance are a sweet and luscious foodin my opinion of more worth than the pineapples which are imported from the west indies those which lately even i tasted only to repent of itfor i am semicivilizedwhich the farmer willingly left on the tree i am now glad to find have the property of hanging on like the leaves of the young oaks it is a way to keep cider sweet without boiling let the frost come to freeze them first solid as stones and then the rain or a warm winter day to thaw them and they will seem to have borrowed a flavor from heaven through the medium of the air in which they hang or perchance you find when you get home that those which rattled in your pocket have thawed and the ice is turned to cider but after the third or fourth freezing and thawing they will not be found so good  what are the imported halfripe fruits of the torrid south to this fruit matured by the cold of the frigid north these are those crabbed apples with which i cheated my companion and kept a smooth face that i might tempt him to eat now we both greedily fill our pockets with thembending to drink the cup and save our lappets from the overflowing juiceand grow more social with their wine was there one that hung so high and sheltered by the tangled branches that our sticks could not dislodge it  it is a fruit never carried to market that i am aware ofquite distinct from the apple of the markets as from dried apple and ciderand it is not every winter that produces it in perfection                                       the era of the wild apple will soon be past it is a fruit which will probably become extinct in new england you may still wander through old orchards of native fruit of great extent which for the most part went to the cidermill now all gone to decay i have heard of an orchard in a distant town on the side of a hill where the apples rolled down and lay four feet deep against a wall on the lower side and this the owner cut down for fear they should be made into cider since the temperance reform and the general introduction of grafted fruit no native appletrees such as i see everywhere in deserted pastures and where the woods have grown up around them are set out i fear that he who walks over these fields a century hence will not know the pleasure of knocking off wild apples ah poor man there are many pleasures which he will not know notwithstanding the prevalence of the baldwin and the porter i doubt if so extensive orchards are set out today in my town as there were a century ago when those vast straggling ciderorchards were planted when men both ate and drank apples when the pomaceheap was the only nursery and trees cost nothing but the trouble of setting them out men could afford then to stick a tree by every wallside and let it take its chance i see nobody planting trees today in such outoftheway places along the lonely roads and lanes and at the bottom of dells in the wood now that they have grafted trees and pay a price for them they collect them into a plat by their houses and fence them inand the end of it all will be that we shall be compelled to look for our apples in a barrel  this is the word of the lord that came to joel the son of pethuel  hear this ye old men and give ear all ye inhabitants of the land hath this been in your days or even in the days of your fathers  that which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten and that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpillar eaten  awake ye drunkards and weep and howl all ye drinkers of wine because of the new wine for it is cut off from your mouth  for a nation is come up upon my land strong and without number whose teeth are the teeth of a lion and he hath the cheekteeth of a great lion  he hath laid my vine waste and barked my figtree he hath made it clean bare and cast it away the branches thereof are made white  be ye ashamed o ye husbandmen howl o ye vinedressers  the vine is dried up and the figtree languisheth the pomegranatetree the palmtree also and the appletree even all the trees of the field are withered because joy is withered away from the sons of men    night and moonlight  chancing to take a memorable walk by moonlight some years ago i resolved to take more such walks and make acquaintance with another side of nature i have done so  according to pliny there is a stone in arabia called selenites wherein is a white which increases and decreases with the moon my journal for the last year or two has been selenitic in this sense  is not the midnight like central africa to most of us are we not tempted to explore itto penetrate to the shores of its lake tchad and discover the source of its nile perchance the mountains of the moon who knows what fertility and beauty moral and natural are there to be found in the mountains of the moon in the central africa of the night there is where all niles have their hidden heads the expeditions up the nile as yet extend but to the cataracts or perchance to the mouth of the white nile but it is the black nile that concerns us  i shall be a benefactor if i conquer some realms from the night if i report to the gazettes anything transpiring about us at that season worthy of their attentionif i can show men that there is some beauty awake while they are asleepif i add to the domains of poetry  night is certainly more novel and less profane than day i soon discovered that i was acquainted only with its complexion and as for the moon i had seen her only as it were through a crevice in a shutter occasionally why not walk a little way in her light  suppose you attend to the suggestions which the moon makes for one month commonly in vain will it not be very different from anything in literature or religion but why not study this sanscrit what if one moon has come and gone with its world of poetry its weird teachings its oracular suggestionsso divine a creature freighted with hints for me and i have not used her one moon gone by unnoticed  i think it was dr chalmers who said criticising coleridge that for his part he wanted ideas which he could see all round and not such as he must look at away up in the heavens such a man one would say would never look at the moon because she never turns her other side to us the light which comes from ideas which have their orbit as distant from the earth and which is no less cheering and enlightening to the benighted traveller than that of the moon and stars is naturally reproached or nicknamed as moonshine by such they are moonshine are they well then do your nighttravelling when there is no moon to light you but i will be thankful for the light that reaches me from the star of least magnitude stars are lesser or greater only as they appear to us so i will be thankful that i see so much as one side of a celestial ideaone side of the rainbowand the sunset sky  men talk glibly enough about moonshine as if they knew its qualities very well and despised them as owls might talk of sunshine none of your sunshinebut this word commonly means merely something which they do not understandwhich they are abed and asleep to however much it may be worth their while to be up and awake to it  it must be allowed that the light of the moon sufficient though it is for the pensive walker and not disproportionate to the inner light we have is very inferior in quality and intensity to that of the sun but the moon is not to be judged alone by the quantity of light she sends to us but also by her influence on the earth and its inhabitants the moon gravitates toward the earth and the earth reciprocally toward the moon the poet who walks by moonlight is conscious of a tide in his thought which is to be referred to lunar influence i will endeavor to separate the tide in my thoughts from the current distractions of the day i would warn my hearers that they must not try my thoughts by a daylight standard but endeavor to realize that i speak out of the night all depends on your point of view in drakes collection of voyages wafer says of some albinoes among the indians of darien they are quite white but their whiteness is like that of a horse quite different from the fair or pale european as they have not the least tincture of a blush or sanguine complexion    their eyebrows are milkwhite as is likewise the hair of their heads which is very fine    they seldom go abroad in the daytime the sun being disagreeable to them and causing their eyes which are weak and poring to water especially if it shines towards them yet they see very well by moonlight from which we call them mooneyed  neither in our thoughts in these moonlight walks methinks is there the least tincture of a blush or sanguine complexion but we are intellectually and morally albinoeschildren of endymionsuch is the effect of conversing much with the moon  i complain of arctic voyagers that they do not enough remind us of the constant peculiar dreariness of the scenery and the perpetual twilight of the arctic night so he whose theme is moonlight though he may find it difficult must as it were illustrate it with the light of the moon alone  many men walk by day few walk by night it is a very different season take a july night for instance about ten oclockwhen man is asleep and day fairly forgottenthe beauty of moonlight is seen over lonely pastures where cattle are silently feeding on all sides novelties present themselves instead of the sun there are the moon and stars instead of the woodthrush there is the whippoorwillinstead of butterflies in the meadows fireflies winged sparks of fire who would have believed it what kind of cool deliberate life dwells in those dewy abodes associated with a spark of fire so man has fire in his eyes or blood or brain instead of singing birds the halfthrottled note of a cuckoo flying over the croaking of frogs and the intenser dream of crickets but above all the wonderful trump of the bullfrog ringing from maine to georgia the potatovines stand upright the corn grows apace the bushes loom the grainfields are boundless on our open river terraces once cultivated by the indian they appear to occupy the ground like an army their heads nodding in the breeze  small trees and shrubs are seen in the midst overwhelmed as by an inundation the shadows of rocks and trees and shrubs and hills are more conspicuous than the objects themselves the slightest irregularities in the ground are revealed by the shadows and what the feet find comparatively smooth appears rough and diversified in consequence for the same reason the whole landscape is more variegated and picturesque than by day the smallest recesses in the rocks are dim and cavernous the ferns in the wood appear of tropical size the sweet fern and indigo in overgrown woodpaths wet you with dew up to your middle the leaves of the shruboak are shining as if a liquid were flowing over them the pools seen through the trees are as full of light as the sky the light of the day takes refuge in their bosoms as the purana says of the ocean all white objects are more remarkable than by day a distant cliff looks like a phosphorescent space on a hillside the woods are heavy and dark nature slumbers you see the moonlight reflected from particular stumps in the recesses of the forest as if she selected what to shine on these small fractions of her light remind one of the plant called moonseedas if the moon were sowing it in such places  in the night the eyes are partly closed or retire into the head other senses take the lead the walker is guided as well by the sense of smell every plant and field and forest emits its odor now swamppink in the meadow and tansy in the road and there is the peculiar dry scent of corn which has begun to show its tassels the senses both of hearing and smelling are more alert we hear the tinkling of rills which we never detected before from time to time high up on the sides of hills you pass through a stratum of warm air a blast which has come up from the sultry plains of noon it tells of the day of sunny noontide hours and banks of the laborer wiping his brow and the bee humming amid flowers it is an air in which work has been donewhich men have breathed it circulates about from woodside to hillside like a dog that has lost its master now that the sun is gone the rocks retain all night the warmth of the sun which they have absorbed and so does the sand if you dig a few inches into it you find a warm bed you lie on your back on a rock in a pasture on the top of some bare hill at midnight and speculate on the height of the starry canopy the stars are the jewels of the night and perchance surpass anything which day has to show a companion with whom i was sailing one very windy but bright moonlight night when the stars were few and faint thought that a man could get along with themthough he was considerably reduced in his circumstancesthat they were a kind of bread and cheese that never failed  no wonder that there have been astrologers that some have conceived that they were personally related to particular stars dubartas as translated by sylvester says hell      not believe that the great architect   with all these fires the heavenly arches decked   only for show and with these glistering shields   t awake poor shepherds watching in the fields   hell not believe that the least flower which pranks   our garden borders or our common banks   and the least stone that in her warming lap   our mother earth doth covetously wrap   hath some peculiar virtue of its own   and that the glorious stars of heavn have none  and sir walter raleigh well says the stars are instruments of far greater use than to give an obscure light and for men to gaze on after sunset and he quotes plotinus as affirming that they are significant but not efficient and also augustine as saying deus regit inferiora corpora per superiora god rules the bodies below by those above but best of all is this which another writer has expressed sapiens adjuvabit opus astrorum quemadmodum agricola terrae naturam a wise man assisteth the work of the stars as the husbandman helpeth the nature of the soil  it does not concern men who are asleep in their beds but it is very important to the traveller whether the moon shines brightly or is obscured it is not easy to realize the serene joy of all the earth when she commences to shine unobstructedly unless you have often been abroad alone in moonlight nights she seems to be waging continual war with the clouds in your behalf yet we fancy the clouds to be her foes also she comes on magnifying her dangers by her light revealing displaying them in all their hugeness and blackness then suddenly casts them behind into the light concealed and goes her way triumphant through a small space of clear sky  in short the moon traversing or appearing to traverse the small clouds which lie in her way now obscured by them now easily dissipating and shining through them makes the drama of the moonlight night to all watchers and nighttravellers sailors speak of it as the moon eating up the clouds the traveller all alone the moon all alone except for his sympathy overcoming with incessant victory whole squadrons of clouds above the forests and lakes and hills when she is obscured he so sympathizes with her that he could whip a dog for her relief as indians do when she enters on a clear field of great extent in the heavens and shines unobstructedly he is glad and when she has fought her way through all the squadron of her foes and rides majestic in a clear sky unscathed and there are no more any obstructions in her path he cheerfully and confidently pursues his way and rejoices in his heart and the cricket also seems to express joy in its song  how insupportable would be the days if the night with its dews and darkness did not come to restore the drooping world as the shades begin to gather around us our primeval instincts are aroused and we steal forth from our lairs like the inhabitants of the jungle in search of those silent and brooding thoughts which are the natural prey of the intellect  richter says that the earth is every day overspread with the veil of night for the same reason as the cages of birds are darkened viz that we may the more readily

fluctuates above the crater of vesuvius in the daytime appears a pillar of cloud but by night a pillar of fire  there are nights in this climate of such serene and majestic beauty so medicinal and fertilizing to the spirit that methinks a sensitive nature would not devote them to oblivion and perhaps there is no man but would be better and wiser for spending them out of doors though he should sleep all the next day to pay for it should sleep an endymion sleep as the ancients expressed itnights which warrant the grecian epithet ambrosial when as in the land of beulah the atmosphere is

of the stars    when thou quickly followest their steps    pursuing them like a hunter in the sky    thou climbing the lofty hills    they descending on barren mountains  who does not in his thought
