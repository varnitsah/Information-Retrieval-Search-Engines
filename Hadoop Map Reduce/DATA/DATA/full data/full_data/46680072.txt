46680072	the complete  poetical works  of  percy bysshe shelley  volume 1   oxford edition  including materials never before printed in any edition of the poems  edited with textual notes  by  thomas hutchinson m a editor of the oxford wordsworth  1914   preface  this edition of his poetical works contains all shelleys ascertained poems and fragments of verse that have hitherto appeared in print in preparing the volume i have worked as far as possible on the principle of recognizing the editio princeps as the primary textual authority i have not been content to reprint mrs shelleys recension of 1839 or that of any subsequent editor of the poems the present text is the result of a fresh collation of the early editions and in every material instance of departure from the wording of those originals the rejected reading has been subjoined in a footnote again whereveras in the case of julian and maddalothere has appeared to be good reason for superseding the authority of the editio princeps the fact is announced and the substituted exemplar indicated in the prefatory note in the case of a few pieces extant in two or more versions of debatable authority the alternative text or texts will be found at the end of the relevant work but it may be said once for all that this does not pretend to be a variorum edition in the proper sense of the termthe textual apparatus does not claim to be exhaustive thus i have not thought it necessary to cumber the footnotes with every minute grammatical correction introduced by mrs shelley apparently on her own authority into the texts of 1839 nor has it come within the scheme of this edition to record every conjectural emendation adopted or proposed by rossetti and others in recent times but it is hoped that up to and including the editions of 1839 at least no important variation of the text has been overlooked whenever a reading has been adopted on manuscript authority a reference to the particular source has been added below  i have been chary of gratuitous interference with the punctuation of the manuscripts and early editions in this direction however some revision was indispensable even in his most carefully finished fair copy shelley underpunctuates thus in the exquisite autograph hunt ms of julian and maddalo mr buxton forman the most conservative of editors finds it necessary to supplement shelleys punctuation in no fewer than ninetyfour places and sometimes punctuates capriciously in the very act of transcribing his mind was apt to stray from the work in hand to higher things he would lose himself in contemplating those airy abstractions and lofty visions of which alone he greatly cared to sing to the neglect and detriment of the merely external and formal element of his song shelley recked little of the jots and tittles of literary craftsmanship he committed many a small sin against the rules of grammar and certainly paid but a halting attention to the nice distinctions of punctuation thus in the early editions a comma occasionally plays the part of a semicolon colons and semicolons seem to be employed interchangeably a semicolon almost invariably appears where nowadays we should employ the dash and lastly the dash itself becomes a point of all work replacing indifferently commas colons semicolons or periods inadequate and sometimes haphazard as it is however shelleys punctuation so far as it goes is of great value as an index to his metrical or at times it may be to his rhetorical intentionfor in shelleys hands punctuation serves rather to mark the rhythmical pause and onflow of the verse or to secure some declamatory effect than to indicate the structure or elucidate the sense for this reason the original pointing has been retained save where it tends to obscure or pervert the poets meaning amongst the editors notes at the end of the volume 3 the reader will find lists of the punctual variations in the longer poems by means of which the supplementary points now added may be identified and the original points which in this edition have been deleted or else replaced by others ascertained in the order of their occurrence in the use of capitals shelleys practice has been followed while an attempt has been made to reduce the number of his inconsistencies in this regard  to have reproduced the spelling of the manuscripts would only have served to divert attention from shelleys poetry to my own ingenuity in disgusting the reader according to the rules of editorial punctilio i adapt a phrase or two from the preface to the revolt of islam shelley was neither very accurate nor always consistent in his spelling he was to say the truth indifferent about all such matters indeed to one absorbed in the spectacle of a world travailing for lack of the gospel of political justice the study of orthographical niceties must have seemed an occupation for bedlamites againas a distinguished critic and editor of shelley professor dowden aptly observes in this connexiona great poet is not of an age but for all time irregular or antiquated forms such as recieve sacrifize tyger gulph desart falshood and the like can only serve to distract the readers attention and mar his enjoyment of the verse accordingly shelleys eccentricities in this kind have been discarded and his spelling reversed in accordance with modern usage all weak preteriteforms whether indicatives or participles have been printed with ed rather than t participial adjectives and substantives such as past alone excepted in the case of leap which has two preteriteforms both employed by shelley see for an example of the longer form the hymn to mercury 18 5 where leaped rhymes with heaped line 1 the shorter form rhyming to wept adapt etc occurs more frequentlyone with the long vowel of the presentform the other with a vowelchange of course wherever this vowelshortening takes place whether indicated by a corresponding change in the spelling or not t not ed is properly usedcleave cleft deal dealt etc the forms discarded under the general rule laid down above are such as wrackt prankt snatcht kist opprest etc like that of crept from creepi have not hesitated to print the longer form leaped and the shorter after mr henry sweets example lept in order clearly to indicate the pronunciation intended by shelley in the editions the two vowelsounds are confounded under the one spelling leapt in a few cases shelleys spelling though unusual or obsolete has been retained thus in aethereal paean and one or two more words the ae will be found and airy still appears as aery shelley seems to have uniformly written lightening here the word is so printed whenever it is employed as a trisyllable elsewhere the ordinary spelling has been adopted not a little has been written about uprest revolt of islam 3 21 5 which has been described as a nonceword deliberately coined by shelley on no better warrant than the exigency of the rhyme there can be little doubt that uprest is simply an overlooked misprint for upristnot by any means a nonceword but a genuine english verbal substantive of regular formation familiar to many from its employment by chaucer true the corresponding rhymewords in the passage above referred to are nest possessed breast but a laxity such as nestuprist is quite in shelleys manner thus in this very poem we find midstshedst 6 16 mistrestblest 5 58 loveliestmistkisseddressed 5 53 shelley may have first seen the word in the ancient mariner but he employs it more correctly than coleridge who seems to have mistaken it for a preteriteform uprose whereas in truth it serves either as the third person singular of the present upriseth or as here for the verbal substantive uprising  the editor of shelley today enters upon a goodly heritage the accumulated gains of a series of distinguished predecessors mrs shelleys two editions of 1839 form the nucleus of the present volume and her notes are here reprinted in full but the arrangement of the poems differs to some extent from that followed by herchiefly in respect of queen mab which is here placed at the head of the juvenilia instead of at the forefront of the poems of shelleys maturity in 1862 a slender volume of poems and fragments entitled relics of shelley was published by dr richard garnett cba precious sheaf gleaned from the manuscripts preserved at boscombe manor the relics constitute a salvage second only in value to the posthumous poems of 1824 to the growing mass of shelleys verse yet more material was added in 1870 by mr william michael rossetti who edited for moxon the complete poetical works published in that year to him we owe in particular a revised and greatly enlarged version of the fragmentary drama of charles i but though not seldom successful in restoring the text mr rossetti pushed revision beyond the bounds of prudence freely correcting grammatical errors rectifying small inconsistencies in the sense and too lightly adopting conjectural emendations on the grounds of rhyme or metre in the course of an article published in the westminster review for july 1870 miss mathilde blind with the aid of material furnished by dr garnett was enabled in the words of mr buxton forman to supply omissions make authoritative emendations and controvert erroneous changes in mr rossettis work and in the more cautiously edited text of his later edition published by moxon in 1878 may be traced the influence of her strictures  six years later appeared a variorum edition in which for the first time shelleys text was edited with scientific exactness of method and with a due respect for the authority of the original editions it would be difficult indeed to overestimate the gains which have accrued to the lovers of shelley from the strenuous labours of mr harry buxton forman cb he too has enlarged the body of shelleys poetry mr formans most notable addition is the second part of the daemon of the world which he printed privately in 1876 and included in his library edition of the poetical works published in the same year see the list of editions etc at the end of volume 3 but important as his editions undoubtedly are it may safely be affirmed that his services in this direction constitute the least part of what we owe him he has vindicated the authenticity of the text in many places while in many others he has succeeded with the aid of manuscripts in restoring it his untiring industry in research his wide bibliographical knowledge and experience above all his accuracy as invariable as it is minute have combined to make him in the words of professor dowden our chief living authority on all that relates to shelleys writings his name stands securely linked for all time to shelleys by a long series of notable words including three successive editions 1876 1882 1892 of the poems an edition of the prose remains as well as many minor publicationsa bibliography the shelley library 1886and several facsimile reprints of the early issues edited for the shelley society  to professor dowden whose authoritative biography of the poet published in 1886 was followed in 1890 by an edition of the poems macmillans is due the addition of several pieces belonging to the juvenile period incorporated by him in the pages of the life of shelley professor dowden has also been enabled with the aid of the manuscripts placed in his hands to correct the text of the juvenilia in many places in 1893 professor george e woodberry edited a centenary edition of the complete poetical works in which to quote his own words an attempt is made to summarize the labours of more than half a century on shelleys text and on his biography so far as the biography is bound up with the text in this centenary edition the textual variations found in the harvard college manuscripts as well as those in the manuscripts belonging to mr frederickson of brooklyn are fully recorded professor woodberrys text is conservative on the whole but his revision of the punctuation is drastic and occasionally sacrifices melody to perspicuity  in 1903 mr cd locock published in a quarto volume of seventyfive pages the fruits of a careful scrutiny of the shelley manuscripts now lodged in the bodleian library mr locock succeeded in recovering several inedited fragments of verse and prose amongst the poems chiefly concerned in the results of his examination may be named marenghi prince athanase the witch of atlas to constantia the ode to naples and last not least prometheus unbound full use has been made in this edition of mr lococks collations and the fragments recovered and printed by him are included in the text variants derived from the bodleian manuscripts are marked b in the footnotes  on the state of the text generally and the various quarters in which it lies open to conjectural emendation i cannot do better than quote the following succinct and luminous account from a causerie on the shelley manuscripts in the bodleian library contributed by dr richard garnett cb to the columns of the speaker of december 19 1903  from the textual point of view shelleys works may be divided into three classesthose published in his lifetime under his own direction those also published in his lifetime but in his absence from the press and those published after his death the first class includes queen mab the revolt of islam and alastor with its appendages published in england before his final departure for the continent and the cenci and adonais printed under his own eye at leghorn and pisa respectively except for some provoking but corrigible misprints in the revolt of islam and one crucial passage in alastor these poems afford little material for conjectural emendation for the alexandrines now and then left in the middle of stanzas in the revolt of islam must remain untouched as proceeding not from the printers carelessness but the authors the second class poems printed during shelleys lifetime but not under his immediate inspection comprise prometheus unbound and rosalind and helen together with the pieces which accompanied them epipsychidion hellas and swellfoot the tyrant the correction of the most important of these the prometheus was the least satisfactory shelley though speaking plainly to the publisher rather hints than expresses his dissatisfaction when writing to gisborne the corrector but there is a pretty clear hint when on a subsequent occasion he says to him i have received hellas which is prettily printed and with fewer mistakes than any poem i ever published this also was probably not without influence on his determination to have the cenci and adonais printed in italyof the third class of shelleys writingsthose which were first published after his deathsufficient facsimiles have been published to prove that trelawnys graphic description of the chaotic state of most of them was really in no respect exaggeratedthe difficulty is much augmented by the fact that these pieces are rarely consecutive but literally disiecti membra poetae scattered through various notebooks in a way to require piecing together as well as deciphering the editors of the posthumous poems moreover though diligent according to their light were neither endowed with remarkable acumen nor possessed of the wide knowledge requisite for the full intelligence of so erudite a poet as shelley hence the perpetration of numerous mistakes some few of the manuscripts indeed such as those of the witch of atlas julian and maddalo and the lines at naples were beautifully written out for the press in shelleys best hand but their very value and beauty necessitated the ordeal of transcription with disastrous results in several instances an entire line dropped out of the lines at naples and although julian and maddalo was extant in more than one very clear copy the printed text had several such sensedestroying errors as least for lead  the corrupt state of the text has stimulated the ingenuity of numerous correctors who have suggested many acute and convincing emendations and some very specious ones which sustained scrutiny has proved untenable it should be needless to remark that success has in general been proportionate to the facilities of access to the manuscripts which have only of late become generally available if shelley is less fortunate than most modern poets in the purity of his text he is more fortunate than many in the preservation of his manuscripts these have not as regards a fair proportion been destroyed or dispersed at auctions but were protected from either fate by their very character as confused memoranda as such they remained in the possession of shelleys widow and passed from her to her son and daughterinlaw after sir percy shelleys death lady shelley took the occasion of the erection of the monument to shelley at university college oxford to present certain of the manuscripts to the bodleian library and verse and sculpture form an imperishable memorial of his connection with the university where his residence was so brief and troubled dr garnett proceedsthe most important of the bodleian manuscripts is that of prometheus unbound which says mr locock has the appearance of being an intermediate draft and also the first copy made this should confer considerable authority on its variations from the accepted text as this appears to have been printed from a copy not made by shelley himself my prometheus he writes to ollier on september 6 1819 is now being transcribed an expression which he would hardly have used if he had himself been the copyist he wished the proofs to be sent to him in italy for correction but to this ollier objected and on may 14 1820 shelley signifies his acquiescence adding however in this case i shall repose trust in your care respecting the correction of the press mr gisborne will revise it he heard it recited and will therefore more readily seize any error this confidence in the accuracy of gisbornes verbal memory is touching from a letter to gisborne on may 26 following it appears that the offer to correct came from him and that shelley sent him two little papers of corrections and additions which were probably made use of or the fact would have been made known in the case of additions this may satisfactorily account for apparent omissions in the bodleian manuscript gisborne after all did not prove fully up to the mark it is to be regretted writes shelley to ollier on november 20 that the errors of the press are so numerous adding i shall send you the list of errata in a day or two this was probably the list of errata written by shelley himself from which mrs shelley corrected the edition of 1839  in placing queen mab at the head of the juvenilia i have followed the arrangement adopted by mr buxton forman in his library edition of 1876 i have excluded the wandering jew having failed to satisfy myself of the sufficiency of the grounds on which in certain quarters it is accepted as the work of shelley the shorter fragments are printed as in professor dowdens edition of 1890 along with the miscellaneous poems of the years to which they severally belong under titles which are sometimes borrowed from mr buxton forman sometimes of my own choosing i have added a few brief editors notes mainly on textual questions at the end of the book of the poverty of my work in this direction i am painfully aware but in the present edition the ordinary reader will it is hoped find an authentic complete and accurately printed text and if this be so the principal end and aim of the oxford shelley will have been attained  i desire cordially to acknowledge the courtesy of mr h buxton forman cb by whose kind sanction the second part of the daemon the world appears in this volume and i would fain express my deep sense of obligation for manifold information and guidance derived from mr buxton formans various editions reprints and other publicationsespecially from the monumental library edition of 1876 acknowledgements are also due to the poets grandson charles ej esdaile esq for permission to include the early poems first printed in professor dowdens life of shelley and to mr cd locock for leave to make full use of the material contained in his interesting and stimulating volume to dr richard garnett cb and to professor dowden cordial thanks are hereby tendered for good counsel cheerfully bestowed to two of the editors of the shelley society reprints mr thomas j wise and mr robert a pottsboth generously communicative collectorsi am deeply indebted for the gift or loan of scarce volumes as well as for many kind offices in other ways lastly to the staff of the oxford university press my heartiest thanks are owing for their unremitting care in all that relates to the printing and correcting of the sheets  thomas hutchinson  december 1904  postscript  in a valuable paper notes on passages in shelley contributed to the modern language review october 1905 mr ac bradley discussed amongst other things some fifty places in the text of shelleys verse and indicated certain errors and omissions in this edition with the aid of these notes the editor has now carefully revised the text and has in many places adopted the suggestions or conclusions of their accomplished author  june 1913      preface by mrs shelley  to first collected edition 1839  obstacles have long existed to my presenting the public with a perfect edition of shelleys poems these being at last happily removed i hasten to fulfil an important dutythat of giving the productions of a sublime genius to the world with all the correctness possible and of at the same time detailing the history of those productions as they sprang living and warm from his heart and brain i abstain from any remark on the occurrences of his private life except inasmuch as the passions which they engendered inspired his poetry this is not the time to relate the truth and i should reject any colouring of the truth no account of these events has ever been given at all approaching reality in their details either as regards himself or others nor shall i further allude to them than to remark that the errors of action committed by a man as noble and generous as shelley may as far as he only is concerned be fearlessly avowed by those who loved him in the firm conviction that were they judged impartially his character would stand in fairer and brighter light than that of any contemporary whatever faults he had ought to find extenuation among his fellows since they prove him to be human without them the exalted nature of his soul would have raised him into something divine  the qualities that struck any one newly introduced to shelley werefirst a gentle and cordial goodness that animated his intercourse with warm affection and helpful sympathy the other the eagerness and ardour with which he was attached to the cause of human happiness and improvement and the fervent eloquence with which he discussed such subjects his conversation was marked by its happy abundance and the beautiful language in which he clothed his poetic ideas and philosophical notions to defecate life of its misery and its evil was the ruling passion of his soul he dedicated to it every power of his mind every pulsation of his heart he looked on political freedom as the direct agent to effect the happiness of mankind and thus any newsprung hope of liberty inspired a joy and an exultation more intense and wild than he could have felt for any personal advantage those who have never experienced the workings of passion on general and unselfish subjects cannot understand this and it must be difficult of comprehension to the younger generation rising around since they cannot remember the scorn and hatred with which the partisans of reform were regarded some few years ago nor the persecutions to which they were exposed he had been from youth the victim of the state of feeling inspired by the reaction of the french revolution and believing firmly in the justice and excellence of his views it cannot be wondered that a nature as sensitive as impetuous and as generous as his should put its whole force into the attempt to alleviate for others the evils of those systems from which he had himself suffered many advantages attended his birth he spurned them all when balanced with what he considered his duties he was generous to imprudence devoted to heroism  these characteristics breathe throughout his poetry the struggle for human weal the resolution firm to martyrdom the impetuous pursuit the glad triumph in good the determination not to despairsuch were the features that marked those of his works which he regarded with most complacency as sustained by a lofty subject and useful aim  in addition to these his poems may be divided into two classesthe purely imaginative and those which sprang from the emotions of his heart among the former may be classed the witch of atlas adonais and his latest composition left imperfect the triumph of life in the first of these particularly he gave the reins to his fancy and luxuriated in every idea as it rose in all there is that sense of mystery which formed an essential portion of his perception of lifea clinging to the subtler inner spirit rather than to the outward forma curious and metaphysical anatomy of human passion and perception  the second class is of course the more popular as appealing at once to emotions common to us all some of these rest on the passion of love others on grief and despondency others on the sentiments inspired by natural objects shelleys conception of love was exalted absorbing allied to all that is purest and noblest in our nature and warmed by earnest passion such it appears when he gave it a voice in verse yet he was usually averse to expressing these feelings except when highly idealized and many of his more beautiful effusions he had cast aside unfinished and they were never seen by me till after i had lost him others as for instance rosalind and helen and lines written among the euganean hills i found among his papers by chance and with some difficulty urged him to complete them there are others such as the ode to the skylark and the cloud which in the opinion of many critics bear a purer poetical stamp than any other of his productions they were written as his mind prompted listening to the carolling of the bird aloft in the azure sky of italy or marking the cloud as it sped across the heavens while he floated in his boat on the thames  no poet was ever warmed by a more genuine and unforced inspiration his extreme sensibility gave the intensity of passion to his intellectual pursuits and rendered his mind keenly alive to every perception of outward objects as well as to his internal sensations such a gift is among the sad vicissitudes of human life the disappointments we meet and the galling sense of our own mistakes and errors fraught with pain to escape from such he delivered up his soul to poetry and felt happy when he sheltered himself from the influence of human sympathies in the wildest regions of fancy his imagination has been termed too brilliant his thoughts too subtle he loved to idealize reality and this is a taste shared by few we are willing to have our passing whims exalted into passions for this gratifies our vanity but few of us understand or sympathize with the endeavour to ally the love of abstract beauty and adoration of abstract good the to agathon kai to kalon of the socratic philosophers with our sympathies with our kind in this shelley resembled plato both taking more delight in the abstract and the ideal than in the special and tangible this did not result from imitation for it was not till shelley resided in italy that he made plato his study he then translated his symposium and his ion and the english language boasts of no more brilliant composition than platos praise of love translated by shelley to return to his own poetry the luxury of imagination which sought nothing beyond itself as a child burdens itself with spring flowers thinking of no use beyond the enjoyment of gathering them often showed itself in his verses they will be only appreciated by minds which have resemblance to his own and the mystic subtlety of many of his thoughts will share the same fate the metaphysical strain that characterizes much of what he has written was indeed the portion of his works to which apart from those whose scope was to awaken mankind to aspirations for what he considered the true and good he was himself particularly attached there is much however that speaks to the many when he would consent to dismiss these huntings after the obscure which entwined with his nature as they were he did with difficulty no poet ever expressed in sweeter more heartreaching or more passionate verse the gentler or more forcible emotions of the soul  a wise friend once wrote to shelley you are still very young and in certain essential respects you do not yet sufficiently perceive that you are so it is seldom that the young know what youth is till they have got beyond its period and time was not given him to attain this knowledge it must be remembered that there is the stamp of such inexperience on all he wrote he had not completed his nineandtwentieth year when he died the calm of middle life did not add the seal of the virtues which adorn maturity to those generated by the vehement spirit of youth through life also he was a martyr to illhealth and constant pain wound up his nerves to a pitch of susceptibility that rendered his views of life different from those of a man in the enjoyment of healthy sensations perfectly gentle and forbearing in manner he suffered a good deal of internal irritability or rather excitement and his fortitude to bear was almost always on the stretch and thus during a short life he had gone through more experience of sensation than many whose existence is protracted if i die tomorrow he said on the eve of his unanticipated death i have lived to be older than my father the weight of thought and feeling burdened him heavily you read his sufferings in his attenuated frame while you perceived the mastery he held over them in his animated countenance and brilliant eyes  he died and the world showed no outward sign but his influence over mankind though slow in growth is fast augmenting and in the ameliorations that have taken place in the political state of his country we may trace in part the operation of his arduous struggles his spirit gathers peace in its new state from the sense that though late his exertions were not made in vain and in the progress of the liberty he so fondly loved  he died and his place among those who knew him intimately has never been filled up he walked beside them like a spirit of good to comfort and benefitto enlighten the darkness of life with irradiations of genius to cheer it with his sympathy and love any one once attached to shelley must feel all other affections however true and fond as wasted on barren soil in comparison it is our best consolation to know that such a pureminded and exalted being was once among us and now exists where we hope one day to join himalthough the intolerant in their blindness poured down anathemas the spirit of good who can judge the heart never rejected him  in the notes appended to the poems i have endeavoured to narrate the origin and history of each the loss of nearly all letters and papers which refer to his early life renders the execution more imperfect than it would otherwise have been i have however the liveliest recollection of all that was done and said during the period of my knowing him every impression is as clear as if stamped yesterday and i have no apprehension of any mistake in my statements as far as they go in other respects i am indeed incompetent but i feel the importance of the task and regard it as my most sacred duty i endeavour to fulfil it in a manner he would himself approve and hope in this publication to lay the first stone of a monument due to shelleys genius his sufferings and his virtues  se al seguir son tarda forse avverra che l bel nome gentile consacrero con questa stanca penna   postscript in second edition of 1839  in revising this new edition and carefully consulting shelleys scattered and confused papers i found a few fragments which had hitherto escaped me and was enabled to complete a few poems hitherto left unfinished what at one time escapes the searching eye dimmed by its own earnestness becomes clear at a future period by the aid of a friend i also present some poems complete and correct which hitherto have been defaced by various mistakes and omissions it was suggested that the poem to the queen of my heart was falsely attributed to shelley i certainly find no trace of it among his papers and as those of his intimate friends whom i have consulted never heard of it i omit it  two poems are added of some length swellfoot the tyrant and peter bell the third i have mentioned the circumstances under which they were written in the notes and need only add that they are conceived in a very different spirit from shelleys usual compositions they are specimens of the burlesque and fanciful but although they adopt a familiar style and homely imagery there shine through the radiance of the poets imagination the earnest views and opinions of the politician and the moralist  at my request the publisher has restored the omitted passages of queen mab i now present this edition as a complete collection of my husbands poetical works and i do not foresee that i can hereafter add to or take away a word or line  putney november 6 1839   preface by mrs shelley  to the volume of posthumous poems published in 1824  in nobil sangue vita umile e queta ed in alto intelletto un puro core frutto senile in sul giovenil fibre e in aspetto pensoso anima lietapetrarca  it had been my wish on presenting the public with the posthumous poems of mr shelley to have accompanied them by a biographical notice as it appeared to me that at this moment a narration of the events of my husbands life would come more gracefully from other hands than mine i applied to mr leigh hunt the distinguished friendship that mr shelley felt for him and the enthusiastic affection with which mr leigh hunt clings to his friends memory seemed to point him out as the person best calculated for such an undertaking his absence from this country which prevented our mutual explanation has unfortunately rendered my scheme abortive i do not doubt but that on some other occasion he will pay this tribute to his lost friend and sincerely regret that the volume which i edit has not been honoured by its insertion  the comparative solitude in which mr shelley lived was the occasion that he was personally known to few and his fearless enthusiasm in the cause which he considered the most sacred upon earth the improvement of the moral and physical state of mankind was the chief reason why he like other illustrious reformers was pursued by hatred and calumny no man was ever more devoted than he to the endeavour of making those around him happy no man ever possessed friends more unfeignedly attached to him the ungrateful world did not feel his loss and the gap it made seemed to close as quickly over his memory as the murderous sea above his living frame hereafter men will lament that his transcendent powers of intellect were extinguished before they had bestowed on them their choicest treasures to his friends his loss is irremediable the wise the brave the gentle is gone for ever he is to them as a bright vision whose radiant track left behind in the memory is worth all the realities that society can afford before the critics contradict me let them appeal to any one who had ever known him to see him was to love him and his presence like ithuriels spear was alone sufficient to disclose the falsehood of the tale which his enemies whispered in the ear of the ignorant world  his life was spent in the contemplation of nature in arduous study or in acts of kindness and affection he was an elegant scholar and a profound metaphysician without possessing much scientific knowledge he was unrivalled in the justness and extent of his observations on natural objects he knew every plant by its name and was familiar with the history and habits of every production of the earth he could interpret without a fault each appearance in the sky and the varied phenomena of heaven and earth filled him with deep emotion he made his study and readingroom of the shadowed copse the stream the lake and the waterfall ill health and continual pain preyed upon his powers and the solitude in which we lived particularly on our first arrival in italy although congenial to his feelings must frequently have weighed upon his spirits those beautiful and affecting lines written in dejection near naples were composed at such an interval but when in health his spirits were buoyant and youthful to an extraordinary degree  such was his love for nature that every page of his poetry is associated in the minds of his friends with the loveliest scenes of the countries which he inhabited in early life he visited the most beautiful parts of this country and ireland afterwards the alps of switzerland became his inspirers prometheus unbound was written among the deserted and flowergrown ruins of rome and when he made his home under the pisan hills their roofless recesses harboured him as he composed the witch of atlas adonais and hellas in the wild but beautiful bay of spezzia the winds and waves which he loved became his playmates his days were chiefly spent on the water the management of his boat its alterations and improvements were his principal occupation at night when the unclouded moon shone on the calm sea he often went alone in his little shallop to the rocky caves that bordered it and sitting beneath their shelter wrote the triumph of life the last of his productions the beauty but strangeness of this lonely place the refined pleasure which he felt in the companionship of a few selected friends our entire sequestration from the rest of the world all contributed to render this period of his life one of continued enjoyment i am convinced that the two months we passed there were the happiest which he had ever known his health even rapidly improved and he was never better than when i last saw him full of spirits and joy embark for leghorn that he might there welcome leigh hunt to italy i was to have accompanied him but illness confined me to my room and thus put the seal on my misfortune his vessel bore out of sight with a favourable wind and i remained awaiting his return by the breakers of that sea which was about to engulf him  he spent a week at pisa employed in kind offices toward his friend and enjoying with keen delight the renewal of their intercourse he then embarked with mr williams the chosen and beloved sharer of his pleasures and of his fate to return to us we waited for them in vain the sea by its restless moaning seemed to desire to inform us of what we would not learnbut a veil may well be drawn over such misery the real anguish of those moments transcended all the fictions that the most glowing imagination ever portrayed our seclusion the savage nature of the inhabitants of the surrounding villages and our immediate vicinity to the troubled sea combined to imbue with strange horror our days of uncertainty the truth was at last knowna truth that made our loved and lovely italy appear a tomb its sky a pall every heart echoed the deep lament and my only consolation was in the praise and earnest love that each voice bestowed and each countenance demonstrated for him we had lostnot i fondly hope for ever his unearthly and elevated nature is a pledge of the continuation of his being although in an altered form rome received his ashes they are deposited beneath its weedgrown wall and the worlds sole monument is enriched by his remains  i must add a few words concerning the contents of this volume julian and maddalo the witch of atlas and most of the translations were written some years ago and with the exception of the cyclops and the scenes from the magico prodigioso may be considered as having received the authors ultimate corrections the triumph of life was his last work and was left in so unfinished a state that i arranged it in its present form with great difficulty all his poems which were scattered in periodical works are collected in this volume and i have added a reprint of alastor or the spirit of solitude the difficulty with which a copy can be obtained is the cause of its republication many of the miscellaneous poems written on the spur of the occasion and never retouched i found among his manuscript books and have carefully copied i have subjoined whenever i have been able the date of their composition  i do not know whether the critics will reprehend the insertion of some of the most imperfect among them but i frankly own that i have been more actuated by the fear lest any monument of his genius should escape me than the wish of presenting nothing but what was complete to the fastidious reader i feel secure that the lovers of shelleys poetry who know how more than any poet of the present day every line and word he wrote is instinct with peculiar beauty will pardon and thank me i consecrate this volume to them  the size of this collection has prevented the insertion of any prose pieces they will hereafter appear in a separate publication  mary

unmeasured notes which from the unseen lyres of dells and groves the genii of the breezes sweep                                      55 floating on waves of music and of light the chariot of the daemon of the world descends in silent power its shape reposed within slight as some cloud that catches but the palest tinge of day                             60 when evening yields to night bright as that fibrous woof when stars indue its transitory robe four shapeless shadows bright and beautiful draw that strange car of glory reins of light                       65 check their unearthly speed

              110 robed in its human hues it did ascend disparting as it went the silver clouds it moved towards the car and took its seat beside the daemon shape  obedient to the sweep of aery song                                  115 the mighty ministers unfurled their prismy wings the magic car moved on the night was fair innumerable stars studded heavens dark blue vault                                    120 the eastern wave grew pale with the first smile of morn the magic car moved on from the swift sweep of wings the atmosphere in flaming sparkles flew                             125 and where the burning wheels eddied above the mountains loftiest peak was traced a line of lightning now far above a rock the utmost verge of the wide earth it flew                                           130 the rival of the andes whose dark brow frowned oer the silver sea far far below the chariots stormy path calm as a slumbering babe tremendous ocean lay                                                135 its broad and silent mirror gave to view the pale and waning stars the chariots fiery track and the grey light of morn tingeing those fleecy clouds                                         140 that cradled in their folds the infant dawn the chariot seemed to fly through the abyss of an immense concave radiant with million constellations tinged with shades of infinite colour                                      145 and semicircled with a belt flashing incessant meteors  as they approached their goal the winged shadows seemed to gather speed the sea no longer was distinguished earth                           150 appeared a vast and shadowy sphere suspended in the black concave of heaven with the suns cloudless orb whose rays of rapid light parted around the chariots swifter course                          155 and fell like oceans feathery spray dashed from the boiling surge before a vessels prow  the magic car moved on earths distant orb appeared                                         160 the smallest light that twinkles in the heavens whilst round the chariots way innumerable systems widely rolled and countless spheres diffused an ever varying glory                                               165 it was a sight of wonder some were horned and like the moons argentine crescent hung in the dark dome of heaven some did shed a clear mild beam like hesperus while the sea yet glows with fading sunlight others dashed                        170 athwart the night with trains of bickering fire like sphered worlds to death and ruin driven some shone like stars and as the chariot passed bedimmed all other light  spirit of nature here                                               175 in this interminable wilderness of worlds at whose involved immensity even soaring fancy staggers here is thy fitting temple yet not the lightest leaf                                            180 that quivers to the passing breeze is less instinct with thee yet not the meanest worm that lurks in graves and fattens on the dead less shares thy eternal breath                                      185 spirit of nature thou imperishable as this glorious scene here is thy fitting temple  if solitude hath ever led thy steps to the shore of the immeasurable sea                                190 and thou hast lingered there until the suns broad orb seemed resting on the fiery line of ocean thou must have marked the braided webs of gold that without motion hang                                             195 over the sinking sphere thou must have marked the billowy mountain clouds edged with intolerable radiancy towering like rocks of jet above the burning deep                                              200 and yet there is a moment when the suns highest point peers like a star oer oceans western edge when those far clouds of feathery purple gleam like fairy lands girt by some heavenly sea                          205 then has thy rapt imagination soared where in the midst of all existing things the temple of the mightiest daemon stands  yet not the golden islands that gleam amid yon flood of purple light                           210 nor the feathery curtains that canopy the suns resplendent couch nor the burnished ocean waves paving that gorgeous dome so fair so wonderful a sight                                        215 as the eternal temple could afford the elements of all that human thought can frame of lovely or sublime did join to rear the fabric of the fane nor aught of earth may image forth its majesty                                220 yet likest evenings vault that faery hall as heaven low resting on the wave it spread its floors of flashing light its vast and azure dome and on the verge of that obscure abyss                               225 where crystal battlements oerhang the gulf of the dark world ten thousand spheres diffuse their lustre through its adamantine gates  the magic car no longer moved the daemon and the spirit                                            230 entered the eternal gates those clouds of aery gold that slept in glittering billows beneath the azure canopy with the ethereal footsteps trembled not                            235 while slight and odorous mists floated to strains of thrilling melody through the vast columns and the pearly shrines  the daemon and the spirit approached the overhanging battlement                               240 below lay stretched the boundless universe there far as the remotest line that limits swift imaginations flight unending orbs mingled in mazy motion immutably fulfilling                                                 245 eternal natures law above below around the circling systems formed a wilderness of harmony each with undeviating aim                                            250 in eloquent silence through the depths of space pursued its wondrous way  awhile the spirit paused in ecstasy yet soon she saw as the vast spheres swept by strange things within their belted orbs appear                      255 like animated frenzies dimly moved shadows and skeletons and fiendly shapes thronging round human graves and oer the dead sculpturing records for each memory in verse such as malignant gods pronounce                          260 blasting the hopes of men when heaven and hell confounded burst in ruin oer the world and they did build

and brazen chariots stained with blood and scrolls of mystic wickedness the sanguine codes of venerable crime the likeness of a throned king came by                              270 when these had passed bearing upon his brow a threefold crown his countenance was calm his eye severe and cold but his right hand was charged with bloody coin and he did gnaw by fits with secret smiles a human heart                           275 concealed beneath his robe and motley shapes a multitudinous throng around him knelt with bosoms bare and bowed heads and false looks of true submission as the sphere rolled by brooking no eye to witness their foul shame                         280 which human hearts must feel while human tongues tremble to speak they did rage horribly breathing in selfcontempt fierce blasphemies against the daemon of the world and high hurling their armed hands where the pure spirit                     285 serene and inaccessibly secure stood on an isolated pinnacle the flood of ages combating below the depth of the unbounded universe above and all around                                                290 necessitys unchanging harmony  part 2  sections 8 and 9 of

chaplets for their innocent brows with the green ivy and the red wallflower that mock the dungeons unavailing gloom the ponderous chains and gratings of strong iron there rust amid the accumulated ruins                                490 now mingling slowly with their native earth there the broad beam of day which feebly once lighted the cheek of lean captivity with a pale and sickly glare now freely shines on the pure smiles of infant playfulness                            495 no more the shuddering voice of hoarse despair peals through the echoing vaults but soothing notes of ivyfingered

1839 editions 1st and 2nd for 2 and 3 mrs shelley is responsible  preface  the poem entitled alastor may be considered as allegorical of one of the most interesting situations of the human mind it represents a youth of uncorrupted feelings and adventurous genius led forth by an imagination inflamed and purified through familiarity with all that is excellent and majestic to the contemplation of the universe he drinks deep of the fountains of knowledge and is still insatiate the magnificence and beauty of the external world sinks profoundly into the frame of his conceptions and affords to their modifications at variety not to be exhausted so long as it is possible for his desires to point towards objects thus infinite and unmeasured he is joyous and tranquil and selfpossessed but the period arrives when these objects cease to suffice his mind is at length suddenly awakened and thirsts for intercourse with an intelligence similar to itself he images to himself the being whom he loves conversant with speculations of the sublimest and most perfect natures the vision in which he embodies his own imaginations unites all of wonderful or wise or beautiful which the poet the philosopher or the lover could depicture the intellectual faculties the imagination the functions of sense have their respective requisitions on the sympathy of corresponding powers in other human beings the poet is represented as uniting these requisitions and attaching them to a single image he seeks in vain for a prototype of his conception blasted by his disappointment he descends to an untimely grave  the picture is not barren of instruction to actual men the poets selfcentred seclusion was avenged by the furies of an irresistible passion pursuing him to speedy ruin but that power which strikes the luminaries of the world with sudden darkness and extinction by awakening them to too exquisite a perception of its influences dooms to a slow and poisonous decay those manner spirits that dare to abjure its dominion their destiny is more abject and inglorious as their delinquency is more contemptible and pernicious they who deluded by no generous error instigated by no sacred thirst of doubtful knowledge duped by no illustrious superstition loving nothing on this earth and cherishing no hopes beyond yet keep aloof from sympathies with their kind rejoicing neither in human joy nor mourning with human grief these and such as they have their apportioned curse they languish because none feel with them their common nature they are morally dead they are neither friends nor lovers nor fathers nor citizens of the world nor benefactors of their country among those who attempt to exist without human sympathy the pure and tenderhearted perish through the intensity and passion of their search after its communities when the vacancy of their spirit suddenly makes itself felt all else selfish blind and torpid are those unforeseeing multitudes who constitute together with their own the lasting misery and loneliness of the world those who love not their fellowbeings live unfruitful lives and prepare for their old age a miserable grave  the good die first and those whose hearts are dry as summer dust burn to the socket  december 14 1815   alastor or the spirit of solitude  earth ocean air beloved brotherhood if our great mother has imbued my soul with aught of natural piety to feel your love and recompense the boon with mine if dewy morn and odorous noon and even                            5 with sunset and its gorgeous ministers and solemn midnights

i have watched                             20 thy shadow and the darkness of thy steps and my heart ever gazes on the depth of thy deep mysteries i have made my bed in charnels and on coffins where black death keeps record of the trophies won from thee                          25 hoping to still these obstinate questionings of thee and thine by forcing some lone ghost thy messenger to render up

tomb                                 50 no human hands with pious reverence reared but the charmed eddies of autumnal winds built oer his mouldering bones a pyramid of mouldering leaves in the waste wilderness a lovely youthno mourning maiden decked                           55 with weeping flowers or votive cypress wreath the lone couch of his everlasting sleep gentle and brave and generousno lorn bard breathed oer his dark fate one melodious sigh he lived he died he sung in solitude                              60 strangers have wept to hear his passionate notes and virgins as unknown he passed have pined and wasted for fond love of his wild eyes the fire of those soft orbs has ceased to burn and silence too enamoured of that voice                            65 locks its mute music in her rugged cell  by solemn vision and bright silver dream his infancy was nurtured every sight and sound from the vast earth and ambient air sent to his heart its choicest impulses                             70 the fountains of divine philosophy fled not his thirsting lips and all of great or good or lovely which the sacred past in truth or fable consecrates he felt and knew when early youth had passed he left                       75 his cold fireside and alienated home to seek strange truths in undiscovered lands many a wide waste and tangled wilderness has lured his fearless steps and he has bought with his sweet voice and eyes from savage men                      80 his rest and food natures most secret steps he like her shadow has pursued whereer the red volcano overcanopies its fields of snow and pinnacles of ice with burning smoke or where bitumen lakes                           85 on black bare pointed islets ever beat with sluggish surge or where the secret caves rugged and dark winding among the springs of fire and poison inaccessible to avarice or pride their starry domes                              90 of diamond and of gold expand above numberless and immeasurable halls frequent with crystal column and clear shrines of pearl and thrones radiant with chrysolite nor had that scene of ampler majesty                                 95 than gems or gold the varying roof of heaven and the green earth lost in his heart its claims to love and wonder he would linger long in lonesome vales making the wild his home until the doves and squirrels would partake                          100 from his innocuous hand his bloodless food lured by the gentle meaning of his looks and the wild antelope that starts wheneer the dry leaf rustles in the brake suspend her timid steps to gaze upon a form more graceful than her own                                          105 his wandering step obedient to high thoughts has visited the awful ruins of the days of old athens and tyre and balbec and the waste where stood jerusalem the fallen towers                             110 of babylon the eternal pyramids memphis and thebes and whatsoeer of strange sculptured on alabaster obelisk or jasper tomb or mutilated sphynx dark aethiopia in her desert hills                                   115 conceals among the ruined temples there stupendous columns and wild images of more than man where marble daemons watch the zodiacs brazen mystery and dead men hang their mute thoughts on the mute walls around                   120 he lingered poring on memorials of the worlds youth through the long burning day gazed on those speechless shapes nor when the moon filled the mysterious halls with floating shades suspended he that task but ever gazed                               125 and gazed till meaning on his vacant mind flashed like strong inspiration and he saw the thrilling secrets of the birth of time  meanwhile an arab maiden brought his food her daily portion from her fathers tent                           130 and spread her matting for his couch and stole from duties and repose to tend his steps enamoured yet not daring for deep awe to speak her loveand watched his nightly sleep sleepless herself to gaze upon his lips                             135 parted in slumber whence the regular breath of innocent dreams arose then when red morn made paler the pale moon to her cold home wildered and wan and panting she returned  the poet wandering on through arabie                              140 and persia and the wild carmanian waste and oer the aerial mountains which pour down indus and oxus from their icy caves in joy and exultation held his way till in the vale of cashmire far within                             145 its loneliest dell where odorous plants entwine beneath the hollow rocks a natural bower beside a sparkling rivulet he stretched his languid limbs a vision on his sleep there came a dream of hopes that never yet                          150 had flushed his cheek he dreamed a veiled maid sate near him talking in low solemn tones her voice was like the voice of his own soul heard in the calm of thought its music long like woven sounds of streams and breezes held                       155 his inmost sense suspended in its web of manycoloured woof and shifting hues knowledge and truth and virtue were her theme and lofty hopes of divine liberty thoughts the most dear to him and poesy                            160 herself a poet soon the solemn mood of her pure mind kindled through all her frame a permeating fire wild numbers then she raised with voice stifled in tremulous sobs subdued by its own pathos her fair hands                            165 were bare alone sweeping from some strange harp strange symphony and in their branching veins the eloquent blood told an ineffable tale the beating of her heart was heard to fill the pauses of her music and her breath                              170 tumultuously accorded with those fits of intermitted song sudden she rose as if her heart impatiently endured its bursting burthen at the sound he turned and saw by the warm light of their own life                          175 her glowing limbs beneath the sinuous veil of woven wind her outspread arms now bare her dark locks floating in the breath of night her beamy bending eyes her parted lips outstretched and pale and quivering eagerly                       180 his strong heart sunk and sickened with excess of love he reared his shuddering limbs and quelled his gasping breath and spread his arms to meet her panting bosomshe drew back a while then yielding to the irresistible joy                              185 with frantic gesture and short breathless cry folded his frame in her dissolving arms now blackness veiled his dizzy eyes and night involved and swallowed up the vision sleep like a dark flood suspended in its course                           190 rolled back its impulse on his vacant brain  roused by the shock he started from his trance the cold white light of morning the blue moon low in the west the clear and garish hills the distinct valley and the vacant woods                            195 spread round him where he stood whither have fled the hues of heaven that canopied his bower of yesternight the sounds that soothed his sleep the mystery and the majesty of earth the joy the exultation his wan eyes                                200 gaze on the empty scene as vacantly as oceans moon looks on the moon in heaven the spirit of sweet human love has sent a vision to the sleep of him who spurned her choicest gifts he eagerly pursues                               205 beyond the realms of dream that fleeting shade he overleaps the bounds alas alas were limbs and breath and being intertwined thus treacherously lost lost for ever lost in the wide pathless desert of dim sleep                            210 that beautiful shape does the dark gate of death conduct to thy mysterious paradise o sleep does the bright arch of rainbow clouds and pendent mountains seen in the calm lake lead only to a black and watery depth                               215 while deaths blue vault with loathliest vapours hung where every shade which the foul grave exhales hides its dead eye from the detested day conducts o sleep to thy delightful realms this doubt with sudden tide flowed on his heart                     220 the insatiate hope which it awakened stung his brain even like despair while daylight held the sky the poet kept mute conference with his still soul at night the passion came like the fierce fiend of a distempered dream                        225 and shook him from his rest and led him forth into the darknessas an eagle grasped in folds of the green serpent feels her breast burn with the poison and precipitates through night and day tempest and calm and cloud                 230 frantic with dizzying anguish her blind flight oer the wide aery wilderness thus driven by the bright shadow of that lovely dream beneath the cold glare of the desolate night through tangled swamps and deep precipitous dells                   235 startling with careless step the moonlight snake he fled red morning dawned upon his flight shedding the mockery of its vital hues upon his cheek of death he wandered on till vast aornos seen from petras steep                             240 hung oer the low horizon like a cloud through balk and where the desolated tombs of parthian kings scatter to every wind their wasting dust wildly he wandered on day after day a weary waste of hours                                245 bearing within his life the brooding care that ever fed on its decaying flame and now his limbs were lean his scattered hair sered by the autumn of strange suffering sung dirges in the wind his listless hand                           250 hung like dead bone within its withered skin life and the lustre that consumed it shone as in a furnace burning secretly from his dark eyes alone the cottagers who ministered with human charity                                    255 his human wants beheld with wondering awe their fleeting visitant the mountaineer encountering on some dizzy precipice that spectral form deemed that the spirit of wind with lightning eyes and eager breath and feet                      260 disturbing not the drifted snow had paused in its career the infant would conceal his troubled visage in his mothers robe in terror at the glare of those wild eyes to remember their strange light in many a dream                      265 of aftertimes but youthful maidens taught by nature would interpret half the woe that wasted him would call him with false names brother and friend would press his pallid hand at parting and watch dim through tears the path                   270 of his departure from their fathers door  at length upon the lone chorasmian shore he paused a wide and melancholy waste of putrid marshes a strong impulse urged his steps to the seashore a swan was there                        275 beside a sluggish stream among the reeds it rose as he approached and with strong wings scaling the upward sky bent its bright course high over the immeasurable main his eyes pursued its flightthou hast a home                     280 beautiful bird thou voyagest to thine home where thy sweet mate will twine her downy neck with thine and welcome thy return with eyes bright in the lustre of their own fond joy and what am i that i should linger here                             285 with voice far sweeter than thy dying notes spirit more vast than thine frame more attuned to beauty wasting these surpassing powers in the deaf air to the blind earth and heaven that echoes not my thoughts a gloomy smile                         290 of desperate hope wrinkled his quivering lips for sleep he knew kept most relentlessly its precious charge and silent death exposed faithless perhaps as sleep a shadowy lure with doubtful smile mocking its own strange charms                  295  startled by his own thoughts he looked around there was no fair fiend near him not a sight or sound of awe but in his own deep mind a little shallop floating near the shore caught the impatient wandering of his gaze                          300 it had been long abandoned for its sides gaped wide with many a rift and its frail joints swayed with the undulations of the tide a restless impulse urged him to embark and meet lone death on the drear oceans waste                      305 for well he knew that mighty shadow loves the slimy caverns of the populous deep  the day was fair and sunny sea and sky drank its inspiring radiance and the wind swept strongly from the shore blackening the waves                 310 following his eager soul the wanderer leaped in the boat he spread his cloak aloft on the bare mast and took his lonely seat and felt the boat speed oer the tranquil sea like a torn cloud before the hurricane                              315  as one that in a silver vision floats obedient to the sweep of odorous winds upon resplendent clouds so rapidly along the dark and ruffled waters fled the straining boata whirlwind swept it on                        320 with fierce gusts and precipitating force through the white ridges of the chafed sea the waves arose higher and higher still their fierce necks writhed beneath the tempests scourge like serpents struggling in a vultures grasp                       325 calm and rejoicing in the fearful war of wave ruining on wave and blast on blast descending and black flood on whirlpool driven with dark obliterating course he sate as if their genii were the ministers                                 330 appointed to conduct him to the light of those beloved eyes the poet sate holding the steady helm evening came on the beams of sunset hung their rainbow hues high mid the shifting domes of sheeted spray                        335 that canopied his path oer the waste deep twilight ascending slowly from the east entwined in duskier wreaths her braided locks oer the fair front and radiant eyes of day night followed clad with stars on every side                       340 more horribly the multitudinous streams of oceans mountainous waste to mutual war rushed in dark tumult thundering as to mock the calm and spangled sky the little boat still fled before the storm still fled like foam                   345 down the steep cataract of a wintry river now pausing on the edge of the riven wave now leaving far behind the bursting mass that fell convulsing ocean safely fled as if that frail and wasted human form                              350 had been an elemental god  at midnight the moon arose and lo the ethereal cliffs of caucasus whose icy summits shone among the stars like sunlight and around whose caverned base the whirlpools and the waves                     355 bursting and eddying irresistibly rage and resound foreverwho shall save the boat fled onthe boiling torrent drove the crags closed round with black and jagged arms the shattered mountain overhung the sea                             360 and faster still beyond all human speed suspended on the sweep of the smooth wave the little boat was driven a cavern there yawned and amid its slant and winding depths ingulfed the rushing sea the boat fled on                           365 with unrelaxing speedvision and love the poet cried aloud i have beheld the path of thy departure sleep and death shall not divide us long  the boat pursued the windings of the cavern daylight shone                           370 at length upon that gloomy rivers flow now where the fiercest war among the waves is calm on the unfathomable stream the boat moved slowly where the mountain riven exposed those black depths to the azure sky                         375 ere yet the floods enormous volume fell even to the base of caucasus with sound that shook the everlasting rocks the mass filled with one whirlpool all that ample chasm stair above stair the eddying waters rose                           380 circling immeasurably fast and laved with alternating dash the gnarled roots of mighty trees that stretched their giant arms in darkness over it i the midst was left reflecting yet distorting every cloud

arose till on the verge of the extremest curve                            390 where through an opening of the rocky bank the waters overflow and a smooth spot of glassy quiet mid those battling tides

breathed from the west has caught the expanded sail and lo with gentle motion between banks of mossy slope and on a placid stream                              400 beneath a woven grove it sails and hark the ghastly torrent mingles its far roar with the breeze murmuring in the musical woods where the embowering trees recede and leave a little space of green expanse the cove                            405 is closed by meeting banks whose yellow flowers for ever gaze on their own drooping eyes reflected in the crystal calm the wave of the boats motion marred their pensive task which naught but vagrant bird or wanton wind                       410 or falling speargrass or their own decay had eer disturbed before the poet longed to deck with their bright hues his withered hair but on his heart its solitude returned and he forbore not the strong impulse hid                           415 in those flushed cheeks bent eyes and shadowy frame had yet performed its ministry it hung upon his

vast mass of mingling shade whose brown magnificence a narrow vale embosoms there huge caves scooped in the dark base of their aery rocks mocking its moans respond and roar for ever

unconscious of the day ere yet his wings have spread their glories to the gaze of noon  hither the poet came his eyes beheld their own wan light through the reflected lines                      470 of his thin hair distinct in the dark depth of that still fountain as the human heart gazing in dreams over the gloomy grave sees its own treacherous likeness there he heard the motion of the leaves the grass that sprung                      475 startled and glanced and trembled even to feel an unaccustomed presence and the sound of the sweet brook that from the secret springs of that dark fountain rose a spirit seemed to stand beside himclothed in no bright robes                      480 of shadowy silver or enshrining light borrowed from aught the visible world affords of grace or majesty or mystery but undulating woods and silent well and leaping rivulet and evening gloom                               485 now deepening the dark shades for speech assuming held commune with him as if he and it were all that wasonlywhen his regard was raised by intense pensivenesstwo eyes two starry eyes hung in the gloom of thought                       490 and seemed with their serene and azure smiles to beckon him  obedient to the light that shone within his soul he went pursuing the windings of the dellthe rivulet wanton and wild through many a green ravine                         495 beneath the forest flowed sometimes it fell among the moss with hollow harmony dark and profound now on the polished stones it danced like childhood laughing as it went then through the plain in tranquil wanderings crept                500 reflecting every herb and drooping bud that overhung its quietnesso stream whose source is inaccessibly profound whither do thy mysterious waters tend thou imagest my life thy darksome stillness                        505 thy dazzling waves thy loud and hollow gulfs thy searchless fountain and invisible course have each their type in me and the wide sky and measureless ocean may declare as soon what oozy cavern or what wandering cloud                             510 contains thy waters as the universe tell where these living thoughts reside when stretched upon thy flowers my bloodless limbs shall waste i the passing wind  beside the grassy shore of the small stream he went he did impress                          515 on the green moss his tremulous step that caught strong shuddering from his burning limbs as one roused by some joyous madness from the couch of fever he did move yet not like him forgetful of the grave where when the flame                        520 of his frail exultation shall be spent he must descend with rapid steps he went beneath the shade of trees beside the flow of the wild babbling rivulet and now the forests solemn canopies were changed                            525 for the uniform and lightsome evening sky grey rocks did peep from the spare moss and stemmed the struggling brook tall spires of windlestrae threw their thin shadows down the rugged slope and nought but gnarled roots of ancient pines                        530 branchless and blasted clenched with grasping roots the unwilling soil a gradual change was here yet ghastly for as fast years flow away the smooth brow gathers and the hair grows thin and white and where irradiate dewy eyes                             535 had shone gleam stony orbsso from his steps bright flowers departed and the beautiful shade of the green groves with all their odorous winds and musical motions calm he still pursued the stream that with a larger volume now                            540 rolled through the labyrinthine dell and there fretted a path through its descending curves with its wintry speed on every side now rose rocks which in unimaginable forms lifted their black and barren pinnacles                              545 in the light of evening and its precipice obscuring the ravine disclosed above mid toppling stones black gulfs and yawning caves whose windings gave ten thousand various tongues to the loud stream lo where the pass expands                       550 its stony jaws the abrupt mountain breaks and seems with its accumulated crags to overhang the world for wide expand beneath the wan stars and descending moon islanded seas blue mountains mighty streams                       555 dim tracts and vast robed in

           560 made contrast with the universe a pine rockrooted stretched athwart the vacancy its swinging boughs to each inconstant blast yielding one only response at each pause in most familiar cadence with the howl                              565 the thunder and the hiss of homeless streams mingling its solemn song whilst the broad river foaming and hurrying oer its rugged path fell into that immeasurable void scattering its waters to the passing winds                          570  yet the grey precipice and solemn pine and torrent were not allone silent nook was there even on the edge of that vast mountain upheld by knotty roots and fallen rocks it overlooked in its serenity                                        575 the dark earth and the bending vault of stars it was a tranquil spot that seemed to smile even in the lap of horror ivy clasped the fissured stones with its entwining arms and did embower with leaves for ever green                          580 and berries

blue cavern mould nurses of rainbow flowers and branching moss commit the colours of that varying cheek                            600 that snowy breast those dark and drooping eyes  the dim and horned moon hung low and poured a sea of lustre on the horizons verge that overflowed its mountains yellow mist filled the unbounded atmosphere and drank                           605 wan moonlight

night 610 and thou colossal skeleton that still guiding its irresistible career in thy devastating omnipotence art king of this frail world from the red field of slaughter from the reeking hospital

unheeded tribute of a broken heart  when on the threshold of the green recess                            625 the wanderers footsteps fell he knew that death was on him yet a little ere it fled did he resign his high and holy soul to images of the majestic past that paused within his passive being now                            630 like winds that bear sweet music when they breathe through some dim latticed chamber he did place his pale lean hand upon the rugged trunk of the old pine upon an ivied stone reclined his languid head his limbs did rest                       635 diffused and motionless on the smooth brink of that obscurest chasmand thus he lay surrendering to their final impulses the hovering powers of life hope and despair the torturers slept no mortal pain or fear                         640 marred his repose the influxes of sense and his own being unalloyed by pain yet feebler and more feeble calmly fed the stream of thought till he lay breathing there at peace and faintly smilinghis last sight                       645 was the great moon which oer the western line of the wide world her mighty horn suspended with whose dun beams inwoven darkness seemed to mingle

grew feebler still and when two lessening points of light alone gleamed through the darkness the alternate gasp                     655 of his faint respiration scarce did stir the stagnate nighttill the minutest ray was quenched the pulse yet lingered in his heart it pausedit fluttered but when heaven remained utterly black the murky shades involved                             660 an image silent cold and motionless as their own voiceless earth and vacant air even as a vapour fed with golden beams that ministered on sunlight ere the west eclipses it was now that wondrous frame

a very different tone from queen mab in the latter shelley poured out all the cherished speculations of his youthall the irrepressible emotions of sympathy censure and hope to which the present suffering and what he considers the proper destiny of his fellowcreatures gave birth alastor on the contrary contains an individual interest only a very few years with their attendant events had checked the ardour of shelleys hopes though he still thought them wellgrounded and that to advance their fulfilment was the noblest task man could achieve  this is neither the time nor place to speak of the misfortunes that chequered his life it will be sufficient to say that in all he did he at the time of doing it believed himself justified to his own conscience while the various ills of poverty and loss of friends brought home to him the sad realities of life physical suffering had also considerable influence in causing him to turn his eyes inward inclining him rather to brood over the thoughts and emotions of his own soul than to glance abroad and to make as in queen mab the whole universe the object and subject of his song in the spring of 1815 an eminent physician pronounced that he was dying rapidly of a consumption abscesses were formed on his lungs and he suffered acute spasms suddenly a complete change took place and though through life he was a martyr to pain and debility every symptom of pulmonary disease vanished his nerves which nature had formed sensitive to an unexampled degree were rendered still more susceptible by the state of his health  as soon as the peace of 1814 had opened the continent he went abroad he visited some of the more magnificent scenes of switzerland and returned to england from lucerne by the reuss and the rhine this rivernavigation enchanted him in his favourite poem of thalaba his imagination had been excited by a description of such a voyage in the summer of 1815 after a tour along the southern coast of devonshire and a visit to clifton he rented a house on bishopgate heath on the borders of windsor forest where he enjoyed several months of comparative health and tranquil happiness the later summer months were warm and dry accompanied by a few friends he visited the source of the thames making a voyage in a wherry from windsor to crichlade his beautiful stanzas in the churchyard of lechlade were written on that occasion alastor was composed on his return he spent his days under the oakshades of windsor great park and the magnificent woodland was a fitting study to inspire the various descriptions of forest scenery we find in the poem  none of shelleys poems is more characteristic than this the solemn spirit that reigns throughout the worship of the majesty of nature the broodings of a poets heart in solitudethe mingling of the exulting joy which the various aspects of the visible universe inspires with the sad and struggling pangs which human passion impartsgive a touching interest to the whole the death which he had often contemplated during the last months as certain and near he here represented in such colours as had in his lonely musings soothed his soul to peace the versification sustains the solemn spirit which breathes throughout it is peculiarly melodious the poem ought rather to be considered didactic than narrative it was the outpouring of his own emotions embodied in the purest form he could conceive painted in the ideal hues which his brilliant imagination inspired and softened by the recent anticipation of death     the revolt of islam  a poem in twelve cantos  osais de broton

world is an attempt from which i scarcely dare to expect success and in which a writer of established fame might fail without disgrace it is an experiment on the temper of the public mind as to how far a thirst for a happier condition of moral and political society survives among the enlightened and refined the tempests which have shaken the age in which we live i have sought to enlist the harmony of metrical language the ethereal combinations of the fancy the rapid and subtle transitions of human passion all those elements which essentially compose a poem in the cause of a liberal and comprehensive morality and in the view of kindling within the bosoms of my readers a virtuous enthusiasm for those doctrines of liberty and justice that faith and hope in something good which neither violence nor misrepresentation nor prejudice can ever totally extinguish among mankind  for this purpose i have chosen a story of human passion in its most universal character diversified with moving and romantic adventures and appealing in contempt of all artificial opinions or institutions to the common sympathies of every human breast i have made no attempt to recommend the motives which i would substitute for those at present governing mankind by methodical and systematic argument i would only awaken the feelings so that the reader should see the beauty of true virtue and be incited to those inquiries which have led to my moral and political creed and that of some of the sublimest intellects in the world the poem therefore with the exception of the first canto which is purely introductory is narrative not didactic it is a succession of pictures illustrating the growth and progress of individual mind aspiring after excellence and devoted to the love of mankind its influence in refining and making pure the most daring and uncommon impulses of the imagination the understanding and the senses its impatience at all the oppressions which are done under the sun its tendency to awaken public hope and to enlighten and improve mankind the rapid effects of the application of that tendency the awakening of an immense nation from their slavery and degradation to a true sense of moral dignity and freedom the bloodless dethronement of their oppressors and the unveiling of the religious frauds by which they had been deluded into submission the tranquillity of successful patriotism and the universal toleration and benevolence of true philanthropy the treachery and barbarity of hired soldiers vice not the object of punishment and hatred but kindness and pity the faithlessness of tyrants the confederacy of the rulers of the world and the restoration of the expelled dynasty by foreign arms the massacre and extermination of the patriots and the victory of established power the consequences of legitimate despotismcivil war famine plague superstition and an utter extinction of the domestic affections the judicial murder of the advocates of liberty the temporary triumph of oppression that secure earnest of its final and inevitable fall the transient nature of ignorance and error and the eternity of genius and virtue such is the series of delineations of which the poem consists and if the lofty passions with which it has been my scope to distinguish this story shall not excite in the reader a generous impulse an ardent thirst for excellence an interest profound and strong such as belongs to no meaner desires let not the failure be imputed to a natural unfitness for human sympathy in these sublime and animating themes it is the business of the poet to communicate to others the pleasure and the enthusiasm arising out of those images and feelings in the vivid presence of which within his own mind consists at once his inspiration and his reward  the panic which like an epidemic transport seized upon all classes of men during the excesses consequent upon the french revolution is gradually giving place to sanity it has ceased to be believed that whole generations of mankind ought to consign themselves to a hopeless inheritance of ignorance and misery because a nation of men who had been dupes and slaves for centuries were incapable of conducting themselves with the wisdom and tranquillity of freemen so soon as some of their fetters were partially loosened that their conduct could not have been marked by any other characters than ferocity and thoughtlessness is the historical fact from which liberty derives all its recommendations and falsehood the worst features of its deformity there is a reflux in the tide of human things which bears the shipwrecked hopes of men into a secure haven after the storms are past methinks those who now live have survived an age of despair  the french revolution may be considered as one of those manifestations of a general state of feeling among civilised mankind produced by a defect of correspondence between the knowledge existing in society and the improvement or gradual abolition of political institutions the year 1788 may be assumed as the epoch of one of the most important crises produced by this feeling the sympathies connected with that event extended to every bosom the most generous and amiable natures were those which participated the most extensively in these sympathies but such a degree of unmingled good was expected as it was impossible to realise if the revolution had been in every respect prosperous then misrule and superstition would lose half their claims to our abhorrence as fetters which the captive can unlock with the slightest motion of his fingers and which do not eat with poisonous rust into the soul the revulsion occasioned by the atrocities of the demagogues and the reestablishment of successive tyrannies in france was terrible and felt in the remotest corner of the civilised world could they listen to the plea of reason who had groaned under the calamities of a social state according to the provisions of which one man riots in luxury whilst another famishes for want of bread can he who the day before was a trampled slave suddenly become liberalminded forbearing and independent this is the consequence of the habits of a state of society to be produced by resolute perseverance and indefatigable hope and longsuffering and longbelieving courage and the systematic efforts of generations of men of intellect and virtue such is the lesson which experience teaches now but on the first reverses of hope in the progress of french liberty the sanguine eagerness for good overleaped the solution of these questions and for a time extinguished itself in the unexpectedness of their result thus many of the most ardent and tenderhearted of the worshippers of public good have been morally ruined by what a partial glimpse of the events they deplored appeared to show as the melancholy desolation of all their cherished hopes hence gloom and misanthropy have become the characteristics of the age in which we live the solace of a disappointment that unconsciously finds relief only in the wilful exaggeration of its own despair this influence has tainted the literature of the age with the hopelessness of the minds from which it flows metaphysics i ought to except sir w drummonds academical questions a volume of very acute and powerful metaphysical criticism and inquiries into moral and political science have become little else than vain attempts to revive exploded superstitions or sophisms like those of mr malthus it is remarkable as a symptom of the revival of public hope that mr malthus has assigned in the later editions of his work an indefinite dominion to moral restraint over the principle of population this concession answers all the inferences from his doctrine unfavourable to human improvement and reduces the essay on population to a commentary illustrative of the unanswerableness of political justice calculated to lull the oppressors of mankind into a security of everlasting triumph our works of fiction and poetry have been overshadowed by the same infectious gloom but mankind appear to me to be emerging from their trance i am aware methinks of a slow gradual silent change in that belief i have composed the following poem  i do not presume to enter into competition with our greatest contemporary poets yet i am unwilling to tread in the footsteps of any who have preceded me i have sought to avoid the imitation of any style of language or versification peculiar to the original minds of which it is the character designing that even if what i have produced be worthless it should still be properly my own nor have i permitted any system relating to mere words to divert the attention of the reader from whatever interest i may have succeeded in creating to my own ingenuity in contriving to disgust them according to the rules of criticism i have simply clothed my thoughts in what appeared to me the most obvious and appropriate language a person familiar with nature and with the most celebrated productions of the human mind can scarcely err in following the instinct with respect to selection of language produced by that familiarity  there is an education peculiarly fitted for a poet without which genius and sensibility can hardly fill the circle of their capacities no education indeed can entitle to this appellation a dull and unobservant mind or one though neither dull nor unobservant in which the channels of communication between thought and expression have been obstructed or closed how far it is my fortune to belong to either of the latter classes i cannot know i aspire to be something better the circumstances of my accidental education have been favourable to this ambition i have been familiar from boyhood with mountains and lakes and the sea and the solitude of forests danger which sports upon the brink of precipices has been my playmate i have trodden the glaciers of the alps and lived under the eye of mont blanc i have been a wanderer among distant fields i have sailed down mighty rivers and seen the sun rise and set and the stars come forth whilst i have sailed night and day down a rapid stream among mountains i have seen populous cities and have watched the passions which rise and spread and sink and change amongst assembled multitudes of men i have seen the theatre of the more visible ravages of tyranny and war cities and villages reduced to scattered groups of black and roofless houses and the naked inhabitants sitting famished upon their desolated thresholds i have conversed with living men of genius the poetry of ancient greece and rome and modern italy and our own country has been to me like external nature a passion and an enjoyment such are the sources from which the materials for the imagery of my poem have been drawn i have considered poetry in its most comprehensive sense and have read the poets and the historians and the metaphysicians in this sense there may be such a thing as perfectibility in works of fiction notwithstanding the concession often made by the advocates of human improvement that perfectibility is a term applicable only to science whose writings have been accessible to me and have looked upon the beautiful and majestic scenery of the earth as common sources of those elements which it is the province of the poet to embody and combine yet the experience and the feelings to which i refer do not in themselves constitute men poets but only prepares them to be the auditors of those who are how far i shall be found to possess that more essential attribute of poetry the power of awakening in others sensations like those which animate my own bosom is that which to speak sincerely i know not and which with an acquiescent and contented spirit i expect to be taught by the effect which i shall produce upon those whom i now address  i have avoided as i have said before the imitation of any contemporary style but there must be a resemblance which does not depend upon their own will between all the writers of any particular age they cannot escape from subjection to a common influence which arises out of an infinite combination of circumstances belonging to the times in which they live though each is in a degree the author of the very influence by which his being is thus pervaded thus the tragic poets of the age of pericles the italian revivers of ancient learning those mighty intellects of our own country that succeeded the reformation the translators of the bible shakespeare spenser the dramatists of the reign of elizabeth and lord bacon milton stands alone in the age which he illumined the colder spirits of the interval that succeededall resemble each other and differ from every other in their several classes in this view of things ford can no more be called the imitator of shakespeare than shakespeare the imitator of ford there were perhaps few other points of resemblance between these two men than that which the universal and inevitable influence of their age produced and this is an influence which neither the meanest scribbler nor the sublimest genius of any era can escape and which i have not attempted to escape  i have adopted the stanza of spenser a measure inexpressibly beautiful not because i consider it a finer model of poetical harmony than the blank verse of shakespeare and milton but because in the latter there is no shelter for mediocrity you must either succeed or fail this perhaps an aspiring spirit should desire but i was enticed also by the brilliancy and magnificence of sound which a mind that has been nourished upon musical thoughts can produce by a just and harmonious arrangement of the pauses of this measure yet there will be found some instances where i have completely failed in this attempt and one which i here request the reader to consider as an erratum where there is left most inadvertently an alexandrine in the middle of a stanza  but in this as in every other respect i have written fearlessly it is the misfortune of this age that its writers too thoughtless of immortality are exquisitely sensible to temporary praise or blame they write with the fear of reviews before their eyes this system of criticism sprang up in that torpid interval when poetry was not poetry and the art which professes to regulate and limit its powers cannot subsist together longinus could not have been the contemporary of homer nor boileau of horace yet this species of criticism never presumed to assert an understanding of its own it has always unlike true science followed not preceded the opinion of mankind and would even now bribe with worthless adulation some of our greatest poets to impose gratuitous fetters on their own imaginations and become unconscious accomplices in the daily murder of all genius either not so aspiring or not so fortunate as their own i have sought therefore to write as i believe that homer shakespeare and milton wrote with an utter disregard of anonymous censure i am certain that calumny and misrepresentation though it may move me to compassion cannot disturb my peace i shall understand the expressive silence of those sagacious enemies who dare not trust themselves to speak i shall endeavour to extract from the midst of insult and contempt and maledictions those admonitions which may tend to correct whatever imperfections such censurers may discover in this my first serious appeal to the public if certain critics were as clearsighted as they are malignant how great would be the benefit to be derived from their virulent writings as it is i fear i shall be malicious enough to be amused with their paltry tricks and lame invectives should the public judge that my composition is worthless i shall indeed bow before the tribunal from which milton received his crown of immortality and shall seek to gather if i live strength from that defeat which may nerve me to some new enterprise of thought which may not be worthless i cannot conceive that lucretius when he meditated that poem whose doctrines are yet the basis of our metaphysical knowledge and whose eloquence has been the wonder of mankind wrote in awe of such censure as the hired sophists of the impure and superstitious noblemen of rome might affix to what he should produce it was at the period when greece was led captive and asia made tributary to the republic fast verging itself to slavery and ruin that a multitude of syrian captives bigoted to the worship of their obscene ashtaroth and the unworthy successors of socrates and zeno found there a precarious subsistence by administering under the name of freedmen to the vices and vanities of the great these wretched men were skilled to plead with a superficial but plausible set of sophisms in favour of that contempt for virtue which is the portion of slaves and that faith in portents the most fatal substitute for benevolence in the imaginations of men which arising from the enslaved communities of the east then first began to overwhelm the western nations in its stream were these the kind of men whose disapprobation the wise and loftyminded lucretius should have regarded with a salutary awe the latest and perhaps the meanest of those who follow in his footsteps would disdain to hold life on such conditions  the poem now presented to the public occupied little more than six months in the composition that period has been devoted to the task with unremitting ardour and enthusiasm i have exercised a watchful and earnest criticism on my work as it grew under my hands i would willingly have sent it forth to the world with that perfection which long labour and revision is said to bestow but i found that if i should gain something in exactness by this method i might lose much of the newness and energy of imagery and language as it flowed fresh from my mind and although the mere composition occupied no more than six months the thoughts thus arranged were slowly gathered in as many years  i trust that the reader will carefully distinguish between those opinions which have a dramatic propriety in reference to the characters which they are designed to elucidate and such as are properly my own the erroneous and degrading idea which men have conceived of a supreme being for instance is spoken against but not the supreme being itself the belief which some superstitious persons whom i have brought upon the stage entertain of the deity as injurious to the character of his benevolence is widely different from my own in recommending also a great and important change in the spirit which animates the social institutions of mankind i have avoided all flattery to those violent and malignant passions of our nature which are ever on the watch to mingle with and to alloy the most beneficial innovations there is no quarter given to revenge or envy or prejudice love is celebrated everywhere as the sole law which should govern the moral world   dedication  there is no danger to a man that knows what life and death is theres not any law exceeds his knowledge neither is it lawful that he should stoop to any other lawchapman  to mary    1 so now my summertask is ended mary and i return to thee mine own hearts home as to his queen some victor knight of faery earning bright spoils for her enchanted dome nor thou disdain that ere my fame become                            5 a star among the stars of mortal night if it indeed may cleave its natal gloom its doubtful promise thus i would unite with thy beloved name thou child of love and light  2 the toil which stole from thee so many an hour                      10 is endedand the fruit is at thy feet no longer where the woods to frame a bower with interlaced branches mix and meet or where with sound like many voices sweet waterfalls leap among wild islands green                            15 which framed for my lone boat a lone retreat of mossgrown trees and weeds shall i be seen but beside thee where still my heart has ever been  3 thoughts of great deeds were mine dear friend when first the clouds which wrap this world from youth did pass                20 i do remember well the hour which burst my spirits sleep a fresh maydawn it was when i walked forth upon the glittering grass and wept i knew not why until there rose from the near schoolroom voices that alas                         25 were but one echo from a world of woes the harsh and grating strife of tyrants and of foes  4 and then i clasped my hands and looked around but none was near to mock my streaming eyes which poured their warm drops on the sunny ground                  30 so without shame i spakei will be wise and just and free and mild if in me lies such power for i grow weary to behold the selfish and the strong still tyrannise without reproach or check i then controlled                        35 my tears my heart grew calm and i was meek and bold  5 and from that hour did i with earnest thought heap knowledge from forbidden mines of lore yet nothing that my tyrants knew or taught i cared to learn but from that secret store                         40 wrought linked armour for my soul before it might walk forth to war among mankind thus power and hope were strengthened more and more within me till there came upon my mind a sense of loneliness a thirst with which i pined                  45  6 alas that love should be a blight and snare to those who seek all sympathies in one such once i sought in vain then black despair the shadow of a starless night was thrown over the world in which i moved alone                             50 yet never found i one not false to me hard hearts and cold like weights of icy stone which crushed and withered mine that could not be aught but a lifeless clod until revived by thee  7 thou friend whose presence on my wintry heart                       55 fell like bright spring upon some herbless plain how beautiful and calm and free thou wert in thy young wisdom when the mortal chain of custom thou didst burst and rend in twain and walked as free as light the clouds among                        60 which many an envious slave then breathed in vain from his dim dungeon and my spirit sprung to meet thee from the woes which had begirt it long  8 no more alone through the worlds wilderness although i trod the paths of high intent                            65 i journeyed now no more companionless where solitude is like despair i went there is the wisdom of a stern content when poverty can blight the just and good when infamy dares mock the innocent                                 70 and cherished friends turn with the multitude to trample this was ours and we unshaken stood  9 now has descended a serener hour and with inconstant fortune friends return though suffering leaves the knowledge and the power                  75 which sayslet scorn be not repaid with scorn and from thy side two gentle babes are born to fill our home with smiles and thus are we most fortunate beneath lifes beaming morn and these delights and thou have been to me                        80 the parents of the song i consecrate to thee  10 is it that now my inexperienced fingers but strike the prelude of a loftier strain or must the lyre on which my spirit lingers soon pause in silence neer to sound again                         85 though it might shake the anarch customs reign and charm the minds of men to truths own sway holier than was amphions i would fain reply in hopebut i am worn away and death and love are yet contending for their prey                90  11 and what art thou i know but dare not speak time may interpret to his silent years yet in the paleness of thy thoughtful cheek and in the light thine ample forehead wears and in thy sweetest smiles and in thy tears                        95 and in thy gentle speech a prophecy is whispered to subdue my fondest fears and through thine eyes even in thy soul i see a lamp of vestal fire burning internally  12 they say that thou wert lovely from thy birth                       100 of glorious parents thou aspiring child i wonder notfor one then left this earth whose life was like a setting planet mild which clothed thee in the radiance undefiled of its departing glory still her fame                               105 shines on thee through the tempests dark and wild which shake these latter days and thou canst claim the shelter from thy sire of an immortal name  13 one voice came forth from many a mighty spirit which was the echo of three thousand years                          110 and the tumultuous world stood mute to hear it as some lone man who in a desert hears the music of his homeunwonted fears fell on the pale oppressors of our race and faith and custom and lowthoughted cares                      115 like thunderstricken dragons for a space left the torn human heart their food and dwellingplace  14 truths deathless voice pauses among mankind if there must be no response to my cry if men must rise and stamp with fury blind                           120 on his pure name who loves themthou and i sweet friend can look from our tranquillity like lamps into the worlds tempestuous night two tranquil stars while clouds are passing by which wrap them from the foundering seamans sight                  125 that burn from year to year with unextinguished light   notes 54 cloaking edition 1818 see notes at end   canto 1  1 when the last hope of trampled france had failed like a brief dream of unremaining glory from visions of despair i rose and scaled the peak of an aerial promontory                                    130 whose caverned base with the vexed surge was hoary and saw the golden dawn break forth and waken each cloud and every wavebut transitory the calm for sudden the firm earth was shaken as if by the last wreck its frame were overtaken                    135  2 so as i stood one blast of muttering thunder burst in far peals along the waveless deep when gathering fast around above and under long trains of tremulous mist began to creep until their complicating lines did steep                             140 the orient sun in shadownot a sound was heard one horrible repose did keep the forests and the floods and all around darkness more dread than night was poured upon the ground  3 hark tis the rushing of a wind that sweeps                         145 earth and the ocean see the lightnings yawn deluging heaven with fire and the lashed deeps glitter and boil beneath it rages on one mighty stream whirlwind and waves upthrown lightning and hail and darkness eddying by                        150 there is a pausethe seabirds that were gone into their caves to shriek come forth to spy what calm has falln on earth what light is in the sky  4 for where the irresistible storm had cloven that fearful darkness the blue sky was seen                         155 fretted with many a fair cloud interwoven most delicately and the ocean green beneath that opening spot of blue serene quivered like burning emerald calm was spread on all below but far on high between                               160 earth and the upper air the vast clouds fled countless and swift as leaves on autumns tempest shed  5 for ever as the war became more fierce between the whirlwinds and the rack on high that spot grew more serene blue light did pierce                    165 the woof of those white clouds which seem to lie far deep and motionless while through the sky the pallid semicircle of the moon passed on in slow and moving majesty its upper horn arrayed in mists which soon                          170 but slowly fled like dew beneath the beams of noon  6 i could not choose but gaze a fascination dwelt in that moon and sky and clouds which drew my fancy thither and in expectation of what i knew not i remainedthe hue                             175 of the white moon amid that heaven so blue suddenly stained with shadow did appear a speck a cloud a shape approaching grew like a great ship in the suns sinking sphere beheld afar at sea and swift it came anear                         180  7 even like a bark which from a chasm of mountains dark vast and overhanging on a river which there collects the strength of all its fountains comes forth whilst with the speed its frame doth quiver sails oars and stream tending to one endeavour                    185 so from that chasm of light a winged form on all the winds of heaven approaching ever floated dilating as it came the storm pursued it with fierce blasts and lightnings swift and warm  8 a course precipitous of dizzy speed                                190 suspending thought and breath a monstrous sight for in the air do i behold indeed an eagle and a serpent wreathed in fight and now relaxing its impetuous flight before the aerial rock on which i stood                             195 the eagle hovering wheeled to left and right and hung with lingering wings over the flood and startled with its yells the wide airs solitude  9 a shaft of light upon its wings descended and every golden feather gleamed therein                           200 feather and scale inextricably blended the serpents mailed and manycoloured skin shone through the plumes its coils were twined within by many a swoln and knotted fold and high and far the neck receding lithe and thin                          205 sustained a crested head which warily shifted and glanced before the eagles steadfast eye  10 around around in ceaseless circles wheeling with clang of wings and scream the eagle sailed incessantlysometimes on high concealing                            210 its lessening orbs sometimes as if it failed drooped through the air and still it shrieked and wailed and casting back its eager head with beak and talon unremittingly assailed the wreathed serpent who did ever seek                              215 upon his enemys heart a mortal wound to wreak  11 what life what power was kindled and arose within the sphere of that appalling fray for from the encounter of those wondrous foes a vapour like the seas suspended spray                              220 hung gathered in the void air far away floated the shattered plumes bright scales did leap whereer the eagles talons made their way like sparks into the darknessas they sweep blood stains the snowy foam of the tumultuous deep                  225  12 swift chances in that combatmany a check and many a change a dark and wild turmoil sometimes the snake around his enemys neck locked in stiff rings his adamantine coil until the eagle faint with pain and toil                           230 remitted his strong flight and near the sea languidly fluttered hopeless so to foil his adversary who then reared on high his red and burning crest radiant with victory  13 then on the white edge of the bursting surge                        235 where they had sunk together would the snake relax his suffocating grasp and scourge the wind with his wild writhings for to break that chain of torment the vast bird would shake the strength of his unconquerable wings                              240 as in despair and with his sinewy neck dissolve in sudden shock those linked rings then soar as swift as smoke from a volcano springs  14 wile baffled wile and strength encountered strength thus long but unprevailingthe event                              245 of that portentous fight appeared at length until the lamp of day was almost spent it had endured when lifeless stark and rent hung high that mighty serpent and at last fell to the sea while oer the continent                            250 with clang of wings and scream the eagle passed heavily borne away on the exhausted blast  15 and with it fled the tempest so that ocean and earth and sky shone through the atmosphere only twas strange to see the red commotion                         255 of waves like mountains oer the sinking sphere of sunset sweep and their fierce roar to hear amid the calm down the steep path i wound to the seashorethe evening was most clear and beautiful and there the sea i found                             260 calm as a cradled child in dreamless slumber bound  16 there was a woman beautiful as morning sitting beneath the rocks upon the sand of the waste seafair as one flower adorning an icy wilderness each delicate hand                                265 lay crossed upon her bosom and the band of her dark hair had falln and so she sate looking upon the waves on the bare strand upon the seamark a small boat did wait fair as herself like love by hope left desolate                    270  17 it seemed that this fair shape had looked upon that unimaginable fight and now that her sweet eyes were weary of the sun as brightly it illustrated her woe for in the tears which silently to flow                              275 paused not its lustre hung she watching aye the foamwreaths which the faint tide wove below upon the spangled sands groaned heavily and after every groan looked up over the sea  18 and when she saw the wounded serpent make                            280 his path between the waves her lips grew pale parted and quivered the tears ceased to break from her immovable eyes no voice of wail escaped her but she rose and on the gale loosening her starbright robe and shadowy hair                      285 poured forth her voice the caverns of the vale that opened to the ocean caught it there and filled with silver sounds the overflowing air  19 she spake in language whose strange melody might not belong to earth i heard alone                            290 what made its music more melodious be the pity and the love of every tone but to the snake those accents sweet were known his native tongue and hers nor did he beat the hoar spray idly then but winding on                             295 through the green shadows of the waves that meet near to the shore did pause beside her snowy feet  20 then on the sands the woman sate again and wept and clasped her hands and all between renewed the unintelligible strain                                    300 of her melodious voice and eloquent mien and she unveiled her bosom and the green and glancing shadows of the sea did play oer its marmoreal depthone moment seen for ere the next the serpent did obey                               305 her voice and coiled in rest in her embrace it lay  21 then she arose and smiled on me with eyes serene yet sorrowing like that planet fair while yet the daylight lingereth in the skies which cleaves with arrowy beams the darkred air                    310 and said to grieve is wise but the despair was weak and vain which led thee here from sleep this shalt thou know and more if thou dost dare with me and with this serpent oer the deep a voyage divine and strange companionship to keep                 315  22 her voice was like the wildest saddest tone yet sweet of some loved voice heard long ago i wept shall this fair woman all alone over the sea with that fierce serpent go his head is on her heart and who can know                           320 how soon he may devour his feeble prey such were my thoughts when the tide gan to flow and that strange boat like the moons shade did sway amid reflected stars that in the waters lay  23 a boat of rare device which had no sail                             325 but its own curved prow of thin moonstone wrought like a web of texture fine and frail to catch those gentlest winds which are not known to breathe but by the steady speed alone with which it cleaves the sparkling sea and now                     330 we are embarkedthe mountains hang and frown over the starry deep that gleams below a vast and dim expanse as oer the waves we go  24 and as we sailed a strange and awful tale that woman told like such mysterious dream                          335 as makes the slumberers cheek with wonder pale twas midnight and around a shoreless stream wide ocean rolled when that majestic theme shrined in her heart found utterance and she bent her looks on mine those eyes a kindling beam                        340 of love divine into my spirit sent and ere her lips could move made the air eloquent  25 speak not to me but hear much shalt thou learn much must remain unthought and more untold in the dark futures everflowing urn                               345 know then that from the depth of ages old two powers oer mortal things dominion hold ruling the world with a divided lot immortal allpervading manifold twin genii equal godswhen life and thought                        350 sprang forth they burst the womb of inessential nought  26 the earliest dweller of the world alone

their beams in combatas he stood all thoughts within his mind waged mutual war in dreadful sympathywhen to the flood that fair star fell he turned and shed his brothers blood         360  27 thus evil triumphed and the spirit of evil one power of many shapes which none may know one shape of many names the fiend did revel in victory reigning oer a world of woe for the new race of man went to and fro                             365 famished and homeless loathed and loathing wild and hating goodfor his immortal foe he changed from starry shape beauteous and mild to a dire snake with man and beast unreconciled  28 the darkness lingering oer the dawn of things                     370 was evils breath and life this made him strong to soar aloft with overshadowing wings and the great spirit of good did creep among the nations of mankind and every tongue cursed and blasphemed him as he passed for none                     375 knew good from evil though their names were hung in mockery oer the fane where many a groan as king and lord and god the conquering fiend did own  29 the fiend whose name was legion death decay earthquake and blight and want and madness pale                   380 winged and wan diseases an array numerous as leaves that strew the autumnal gale poison a snake in flowers beneath the veil of food and mirth hiding his mortal head and without whom all these might nought avail                      385 fear hatred faith and tyranny who spread those subtle nets which snare the living and the dead  30 his spirit is their power and they his slaves in air and light

in dream unnatural watch beside an infants sleep  36 woe could not be mine own since far from men i dwelt a free and happy orphan child by the seashore in a deep mountain glen and near the waves and

yet too tumultuously for peace and clasped my hands aloft in ecstasy                    450  37 these were forebodings of my fatebefore a womans heart beat in my virgin breast it had been nurtured in divinest lore a dying poet gave me books and blessed with wild but holy talk the sweet unrest                             455 in which i watched him as he died away a youth with hoary haira fleeting guest of our lone mountains and this lore did sway my spirit like a storm contending there alway  38 thus the dark tale which history doth unfold                        460 i knew but not methinks as others know for they weep not and wisdom had unrolled the clouds which hide the gulf of mortal woe to few can she that warning vision show for i loved all things with intense devotion                        465 so that when hopes deep source in fullest flow like earthquake did uplift the stagnant ocean of human thoughtsmine shook beneath the wide emotion  39 when first the living blood through all these veins kindled a thought in sense great france sprang forth               470 and seized as if to break the ponderous chains which bind in woe the nations of the earth i saw and started from my cottagehearth and to the clouds and waves in tameless gladness shrieked till they caught immeasurable mirth                      475 and laughed in light and music soon sweet madness was poured upon my heart a soft and thrilling sadness  40 deep slumber fell on memy dreams were fire soft and delightful thoughts did rest and hover like shadows oer my brain and strange desire                      480 the tempest of a passion raging over my tranquil soul its depths with light did cover which passed and calm and darkness sweeter far camethen i loved but not a human lover for when i rose from sleep the morning star                         485 shone through the woodbinewreaths which round my casement were  41 twas like an eye which seemed to smile on me i watched till by the sun made pale it sank under the billows of the heaving sea but from its beams deep love my spirit drank                        490 and to my brain the boundless world now shrank into one thoughtone imageyes for ever even like the dayspring poured on vapours dank the beams of that one star did shoot and quiver through my benighted mindand were extinguished never              495  42 the day passed thus at night methought in dream a shape of speechless beauty did appear it stood like light on a careering stream of golden clouds which shook the atmosphere a winged youth his radiant brow did wear                            500 the morning star a wild dissolving bliss over my frame he breathed approaching near and bent his eyes of kindling tenderness near mine and on my lips impressed a lingering kiss  43 and said a spirit loves thee mortal maiden                      505 how wilt thou prove thy worth then joy and sleep together fled my soul was deeply laden and to the shore i went to muse and weep but as i moved over my heart did creep a joy less soft but more profound and strong                        510 than my sweet dream and it forbade to keep the path of the seashore that spirits tongue seemed whispering in my heart and bore my steps along  44 how to that vast and peopled city led which was a field of holy warfare then                              515 i walked among the dying and the dead and shared in fearless deeds with evil men calm as an angel in the dragons den how i braved death for liberty and truth and spurned at peace and power and fameand when                  520 those hopes had lost the glory of their youth how sadly i returnedmight move the hearers ruth  45 warm tears throng fast the tale may not be said know then that when this grief had been subdued i was not left like others cold and dead                          525 the spirit whom i loved in solitude sustained his child the tempestshaken wood the waves the fountains and the hush of night these were his voice and well i understood his smile divine when the calm sea was bright                       530 with silent stars and heaven was breathless with delight  46 in lonely glens amid the roar of rivers when the dim nights were moonless have i known joys which no tongue can tell my pale lip quivers when thought revisits themknow thou alone                        535 that after many wondrous years were flown i was awakened by a shriek of woe and over me a mystic robe was thrown by viewless hands and a bright star did glow before my stepsthe snake then met his mortal foe                 540  47 thou fearest not then the serpent on thy heart fear it she said with brief and passionate cry and spake no more that silence made me start i looked and we were sailing pleasantly swift as a cloud between the sea and sky                            545 beneath the rising moon seen far away mountains of ice like sapphire piled on high hemming the horizon round in silence lay on the still watersthese we did approach alway  48 and swift and swifter grew the vessels motion                      550 so that a dizzy trance fell on my brain wild music woke me we had passed the ocean which girds the pole natures remotest reign and we glode fast oer a pellucid plain of waters azure with the noontide day                              555 ethereal mountains shone arounda fane stood in the midst girt by green isles which lay on the blue sunny deep resplendent far away  49 it was a temple such as mortal hand has never built nor ecstasy nor dream                              560 reared in the cities of enchanted land twas likest heaven ere yet days purple stream ebbs oer the western forest while the gleam of the unrisen moon among the clouds is gatheringwhen with many a golden beam                           565 the thronging constellations rush in crowds paving with fire the sky and the marmoreal floods  50 like what may be conceived of this vast dome when from the depths which thought can seldom pierce genius beholds it rise his native home                             570 girt by the deserts of the universe yet nor in paintings light or mightier verse or sculptures marble language can invest that shape to mortal sensesuch glooms immerse that incommunicable sight and rest                                  575 upon the labouring brain and overburdened breast  51 winding among the lawny islands fair whose blosmy forests starred the shadowy deep the wingless boat paused where an ivory stair its fretwork in the crystal sea did steep                           580 encircling that vast fanes aerial heap we disembarked and through a portal wide we passedwhose roof of moonstone carved did keep a glimmering oer the forms on every side sculptures like life and thought immovable deepeyed              585  52 we came to a vast hall whose glorious roof was diamond which had drunk the lightnings sheen in darkness and now poured it through the woof of spellinwoven clouds hung there to screen its blinding splendourthrough such veil was seen                   590 that work of subtlest power divine and rare orb above orb with starry shapes between and horned moons and meteors strange and fair on nightblack columns poisedone hollow hemisphere  53 ten thousand columns in that quivering light                         595 distinctbetween whose shafts wound far away the long and labyrinthine aislesmore bright with their own radiance than the heaven of day and on the jasper walls around there lay paintings the poesy of mightiest thought                           600 which did the spirits history display a tale of passionate change divinely taught which in their winged dance unconscious genii wrought  54 beneath there sate on many a sapphire throne the great who had departed from mankind                            605 a mighty senatesome whose white hair shone like mountain snow mild beautiful and blind some female forms whose gestures beamed with mind and ardent youths and children bright and fair and some had lyres whose strings were intertwined                    610 with pale and clinging flames which ever there waked faint yet thrilling sounds that pierced the crystal air  55 one seat was vacant in the midst a throne reared on a pyramid like sculptured flame distinct with circling steps which rested on                         615 their own deep firesoon as the woman came into that hall she shrieked the spirits name and fell and vanished slowly from the sight darkness arose from her dissolving frame which gathering filled that dome of woven light                    620 blotting its sphered stars with supernatural night  56 then first two glittering lights were seen to glide in circles on the amethystine floor small serpent eyes trailing from side to side like meteors on a rivers grassy shore                              625 they round each other rolled dilating more and morethen rose commingling into one one clear and mighty planet hanging oer a cloud of deepest shadow which was thrown athwart the glowing steps and the crystalline throne                630  57 the cloud which rested on that cone of flame was cloven beneath the planet sate a form fairer than tongue can speak or thought may frame the radiance of whose limbs roselike and warm flowed forth and did with softest light inform                      635 the shadowy dome the sculptures and the state of those assembled shapeswith clinging charm sinking upon their hearts and mine he sate majestic yet most mildcalm yet compassionate  58 wonder and joy a passing faintness threw                             640 over my browa hand supported me whose touch was magic strength an eye of blue looked into mine like moonlight soothingly and a voice saidthou must a listener be this daytwo mighty spirits now return                             645 like birds of calm from the worlds raging sea they pour fresh light from hopes immortal urn a tale of human powerdespair notlist and learn  59 i looked and lo one stood forth eloquently his eyes were dark and deep and the clear brow                      650 which shadowed them was like the morning sky the cloudless heaven of spring when in their flow through the bright air the soft winds as they blow wake the green worldhis gestures did obey the oracular mind that made his features glow                       655 and where his curved lips halfopen lay passions divinest stream had made impetuous way  60 beneath the darkness of his outspread hair he stood thus beautiful but there was one who sate beside him like his shadow there                           660 and held his handfar lovelier she was known to be thus fair by the few lines alone which through her floating locks and gathered cloak glances of souldissolving glory shone none else beheld her eyesin him they woke                          665 memories which found a tongue as thus he silence broke   canto 2  1 the starlight smile of children the sweet looks of women the fair breast from which i fed the murmur of the unreposing brooks and the green light which shifting overhead                        670 some tangled bower of vines around me shed the shells on the seasand and the wild flowers the lamplight through the rafters cheerly spread and on the twining flaxin lifes young hours these sights and sounds did nurse my spirits folded powers         675  2 in argolis beside the echoing sea such impulses within my mortal frame arose and they were dear to memory like tokens of the deadbut others came soon in another shape the wondrous fame                            680 of the past world the vital words and deeds of minds whom neither time nor change can tame traditions dark and old whence evil creeds start forth and whose dim shade a stream of poison feeds  3 i heard as all have heard the various story                        685 of human life and wept unwilling tears feeble historians of its shame and glory false disputants on all its hopes and fears victims who worshipped ruin chroniclers of daily scorn and slaves who loathed their state                   690 yet flattering power had given its ministers a throne of judgement in the gravetwas fate that among such as these my youth should seek its mate  4 the land in which i lived by a fell bane was withered up tyrants dwelt side by side                         695 and stabled in our homesuntil the chain stifled the captives cry and to abide that blasting curse men had no shameall vied in evil slave and despot fear with lust strange fellowship through mutual hate had tied                     700 like two dark serpents tangled in the dust which on the paths of men their mingling poison thrust  5 earth our bright home its mountains and its waters and the ethereal shapes which are suspended over its green expanse and those fair daughters                    705 the clouds of sun and ocean who have blended the colours of the air since first extended it cradled the young world none wandered forth to see or feel a darkness had descended on every heart the light which shows its worth                     710 must among gentle thoughts and fearless take its birth  6 this vital world this home of happy spirits was as a dungeon to my blasted kind all that despair from murdered hope inherits they sought and in their helpless misery blind                     715 a deeper prison and heavier chains did find and stronger tyrantsa dark gulf before the realm of a stern ruler yawned behind terror and time conflicting drove and bore on their tempestuous flood the shrieking wretch from shore          720  7 out of that oceans wrecks had guilt and woe framed a dark dwelling for their homeless thought and starting at the ghosts which to and fro glide oer its dim and gloomy strand had brought the worship thence which they each other taught                     725 well might men loathe their life well might they turn even to the ills again from which they sought such refuge after deathwell might they learn to gaze on this fair world with hopeless unconcern  8 for they all pined in bondage body and soul                        730 tyrant and slave victim and torturer bent before one power to which supreme control over their will by their own weakness lent made all its many names omnipotent all symbols of things evil all divine                              735 and hymns of blood or mockery which rent the air from all its fanes did intertwine impostures impious toils round each discordant shrine  9 i heard as all have heard lifes various story and in no careless heart transcribed the tale                       740 but from the sneers of men who had grown hoary in shame and scorn from groans of crowds made pale by famine from a mothers desolate wail oer her polluted child from innocent blood poured on the earth and brows anxious and pale                      745 with the hearts warfare did i gather food to feed my many thoughtsa tameless multitude  10 i wandered through the wrecks of days departed far by the desolated shore when even oer the still sea and jagged islets darted                          750 the light of moonrise in the northern heaven among the clouds near the horizon driven the mountains lay beneath one planet pale around me broken tombs and columns riven looked vast in twilight and the sorrowing gale                      755 waked in those ruins gray its everlasting wail  11 i knew not who had framed these wonders then nor had i heard the story of their deeds but dwellings of a race of mightier men and monuments of less ungentle creeds                                760 tell their own tale to him who wisely heeds the language which they speak and now to me the moonlight making pale the blooming weeds the bright stars shining in the breathless sea interpreted those scrolls of mortal mystery                         765  12 such man has been and such may yet become ay wiser greater gentler even than they who on the fragments of yon shattered dome have stamped the sign of poweri felt the sway of the vast stream of ages bear away                                 770 my floating thoughtsmy heart beat loud and fast even as a storm let loose beneath the ray of the still moon my spirit onward passed beneath truths steady beams upon its tumult cast  13 it shall be thus no more too long too long                        775 sons of the glorious dead have ye lain bound in darkness and in ruinhope is strong justice and truth their winged child have found awake arise until the mighty sound of your career shall scatter in its gust                             780 the thrones of the oppressor and the ground hide the last altars unregarded dust whose idol has so long betrayed your impious trust  14 it must be soi will arise and waken the multitude and like a sulphurous hill                           785 which on a sudden from its snows has shaken the swoon of ages it shall burst and fill the world with cleansing fire it must it will it may not be restrainedand who shall stand amid the rocking earthquake steadfast still                         790 but laon on high freedoms desert land a tower whose marble walls the leagued storms withstand  15 one summer night in commune with the hope thus deeply fed amid those ruins gray i watched beneath the dark skys starry cope                       795 and ever from that hour upon me lay the burden of this hope and night or day in vision or in dream clove to my breast among mankind or when gone far away to the lone shores and mountains twas a guest                      800 which followed where i fled and watched when i did rest  16 these hopes found words through which my spirit sought to weave a bondage of such sympathy as might create some response to the thought which ruled me nowand as the vapours lie                           805 bright in the outspread mornings radiancy so were these thoughts invested with the light of language and all bosoms made reply on which its lustre streamed wheneer it might through darkness wide and deep those tranced spirits smite          810  17 yes many an eye with dizzy tears was dim and oft i thought to clasp my own hearts brother when i could feel the listeners senses swim and hear his breath its own swift gaspings smother even as my words evoked themand another                           815 and yet another i did fondly deem felt that we all were sons of one great mother and the cold truth such sad reverse did seem as to awake in grief from some delightful dream  18 yes oft beside the ruined labyrinth                                 820 which skirts the hoary caves of the green deep did laon and his friend on one gray plinth round whose worn base the wild waves hiss and leap resting at eve a lofty converse keep and that this friend was false may now be said                      825 calmlythat he like other men could weep tears which are lies and could betray and spread snares for that guileless heart which for his own had bled  19 then had no great aim recompensed my sorrow i must have sought dark respite from its stress                      830 in dreamless rest in sleep that sees no morrow for to tread lifes dismaying wilderness without one smile to cheer one voice to bless amid the snares and scoffs of human kind is hardbut i betrayed it not nor less                             835 with love that scorned return sought to unbind the interwoven clouds which make its wisdom blind  20 with deathless minds which leave where they have passed a path of light my soul communion knew till from that glorious intercourse at last                        840 as from a mine of magic store i drew words which were weaponsround my heart there grew the adamantine armour of their power and from my fancy wings of golden hue sprang forthyet not alone from wisdoms tower                     845 a minister of truth these plumes young laon bore  21 an orphan with my parents lived whose eyes were lodestars of delight which drew me home when i might wander forth nor did i prize aught human thing beneath heavens mighty dome                       850 beyond this child so when sad hours were come and baffled hope like ice still clung to me since kin were cold and friends had now become heartless and false i turned from all to be cythna the only source of tears and smiles to thee                 855  22 what wert thou then a child most infantine yet wandering far beyond that innocent age in all but its sweet looks and mien divine even then methought with the worlds tyrant rage a patient warfare thy young heart did wage                          860 when those soft eyes of scarcely conscious thought some tale or thine own fancies would engage to overflow with tears or converse fraught with passion oer their depths its fleeting light had wrought  23 she moved upon this earth a shape of brightness                     865 a power that from its objects scarcely drew one impulse of her beingin her lightness most like some radiant cloud of morning dew which wanders through the waste airs pathless blue to nourish some far desert she did seem                             870 beside me gathering beauty as she grew like the bright shade of some immortal dream which walks when tempest sleeps the wave of lifes dark stream  24 as mine own shadow was this child to me a second self far dearer and more fair                             875 which clothed in undissolving radiancy all those steep paths which languor and despair of human things had made so dark and bare but which i trod alonenor till bereft of friends and overcome by lonely care                             880 knew i what solace for that loss was left though by a bitter wound my trusting heart was cleft  25 once she was dear now she was all i had to love in human lifethis playmate sweet this child of twelve years oldso she was made                      885 my sole associate and her willing feet wandered with mine where earth and ocean meet beyond the aereal mountains whose vast cells the unreposing billows ever beat through forests wild and old and lawny dells                        890 where boughs of incense droop over the emerald wells  26 and warm and light i felt her clasping hand when twined in mine she followed where i went through the lone paths of our immortal land it had no waste but some memorial lent                               895 which strung me to my toilsome monument vital with mind then cythna by my side until the bright and beaming day were spent would rest with looks entreating to abide too earnest and too sweet ever to be denied                         900  27 and soon i could not have refused herthus for ever day and night we two were neer parted but when brief sleep divided us and when the pauses of the lulling air of noon beside the sea had made a lair                               905 for her soothed senses in my arms she slept and i kept watch over her slumbers there while as the shifting visions over her swept amid her innocent rest by turns she smiled and wept  28 and in the murmur of her dreams was heard                           910 sometimes the name of laonsuddenly she would arise and like the secret bird whom sunset wakens fill the shore and sky with her sweet accents a wild melody hymns which my soul had woven to freedom strong                     915 the source of passion whence they rose to be triumphant strains which like a spirits tongue to the enchanted waves that child of glory sung  29 her white arms lifted through the shadowy stream of her loose hair oh excellently great                             920 seemed to me then my purpose the vast theme of those impassioned songs when cythna sate amid the calm which rapture doth create after its tumult her heart vibrating her spirit oer the oceans floating state                           925 from her deep eyes far wandering on the wing of visions that were mine beyond its utmost spring  30 for before cythna loved it had my song peopled with thoughts the boundless universe a mighty congregation which were strong                             930 whereer they trod the darkness to disperse the cloud of that unutterable curse which clings upon mankindall things became slaves to my holy and heroic verse earth sea and sky the planets life and fame                       935 and fate or whateer else binds the worlds wondrous frame  31 and this beloved child thus felt the sway of my conceptions gathering like a cloud the very wind on which it rolls away hers too were all my thoughts ere yet endowed                      940 with music and with light their fountains flowed in poesy and her still and earnest face pallid with feelings which intensely glowed within was turned on mine with speechless grace watching the hopes which there her heart had learned to trace       945  32 in me communion with this purest being kindled intenser zeal and made me wise in knowledge which in hers mine own mind seeing left in the human world few mysteries how without fear of evil or disguise                                 950 was cythnawhat a spirit strong and mild which death or pain or peril could despise yet melt in tenderness what genius wild yet mighty was enclosed within one simple child  33 new lore was thisold age with its gray hair                       955 and wrinkled legends of unworthy things and icy sneers is nought it cannot dare to burst the chains which life for ever flings on the entangled souls aspiring wings so is it cold and cruel and is made                                 960 the careless slave of that dark power which brings evil like blight on man who still betrayed laughs oer the grave in which his living hopes are laid  34 nor are the strong and the severe to keep the empire of the world thus cythna taught                          965 even in the visions of her eloquent sleep unconscious of the power through which she wrought the woof of such intelligible thought as from the tranquil strength which cradled lay in her smilepeopled rest my spirit sought                          970 why the deceiver and the slave has sway oer heralds so divine of truths arising day  35 within that fairest form the female mind untainted by the poison clouds which rest on the dark world a sacred home did find                           975 but else from the wide earths maternal breast victorious evil which had dispossessed all native power had those fair children torn and made them

till she became my only friend who had endued my purpose with a wider sympathy thus cythna mourned with me the servitude                           985 in which the half of humankind were mewed victims of lust and hate the slaves of slaves she mourned that grace and power were thrown as food to the hyena lust who among graves over his loathed meal laughing in agony raves                     990  37

and wound her own about my neck till some reply she found  39 i smiled and spake notwherefore dost thou smile at what i say laon i am not weak                                  1010 and though my cheek might become pale the while with thee if thou desirest will i seek through their array of banded slaves to wreak ruin upon the tyrants i had thought it was more hard to turn my unpractised cheek

unskilfully and none will heed me i remember now how once a slave in tortures doomed to die was saved because in accents sweet and low                          1030 he sung a song his judge loved long

music of thine own sweet spells                       1040 will disenchant the captives and will pour for the despairing from the crystal wells of thy deep spirit reasons mighty lore and power shall then abound and hope arise once more  43 can man be free if woman be a slave                                1045 chain one who lives and breathes this boundless air to the corruption of a closed grave

the charmed bird that haunts the serpents den        1080  47 we parto laon i must dare nor tremble to meet those looks no moreoh heavy stroke sweet brother of my soul can i dissemble the agony of this thoughtas thus she spoke the gathered sobs her quivering accents broke                       1085 and in my arms she hid her beating breast i remained still for tearssudden she woke as one awakes from sleep and wildly pressed my bosom her whole frame impetuously possessed  48 we part to meet againbut yon blue waste                          1090 yon desert wide and deep holds no recess within whose happy silence thus embraced we might survive all ills in one caress nor doth the gravei fear tis passionless nor yon cold vacant heavenwe meet again                           1095 within the minds of men whose lips shall bless our memory and whose hopes its light retain when these dissevered bones are trodden in the plain  49 i could not speak though she had ceased for now the fountains of her feeling swift and deep                        1100 seemed to suspend the tumult of their flow so we arose and by the starlight steep went homewardneither did we speak nor weep but pale were calm with passionthus subdued like evening shades that oer the mountains creep                   1105 we moved towards our home where in this mood each from the other sought refuge in solitude   canto 3  1 what thoughts had sway oer cythnas lonely slumber that night i know not but my own did seem as if they might ten thousand years outnumber                        1110 of waking life the visions of a dream which hid in one dim gulf the troubled stream of mind a boundless chaos wild and vast whose limits yet were never memorys theme and i lay struggling as its whirlwinds passed                       1115 sometimes for rapture sick sometimes for pain aghast  2 two hours whose mighty circle did embrace more time than might make gray the infant world rolled thus a weary and tumultuous space when the third came like mist on breezes curled                    1120 from my dim sleep a shadow was unfurled methought upon the threshold of a cave i sate with cythna drooping briony pearled with dew from the wild streamlets shattered wave hung where we sate to taste the joys which nature gave             1125  3 we lived a day as we were wont to live but nature had a robe of glory on and the bright air oer every shape did weave intenser hues so that the herbless stone the leafless bough among the leaves alone                           1130 had being clearer than its own could be and cythnas pure and radiant self was shown in this strange vision so divine to me that if i loved before now love was agony  4 morn fled noon came evening then night descended                 1135 and we prolonged calm talk beneath the sphere of the calm moonwhen suddenly was blended with our repose a nameless sense of fear and from the cave behind i seemed to hear sounds gathering upwardsaccents incomplete                       1140 and stifled shrieksand now more near and near a tumult and a rush of thronging feet the caverns secret depths beneath the earth did beat  5 the scene was changed and away away away through the air and over the sea we sped                            1145 and cythna in my sheltering bosom lay and the winds bore methrough the darkness spread around the gaping earth then vomited legions of foul and ghastly shapes which hung upon my flight and ever as we fled                                1150 they plucked at cythnasoon to me then clung a sense of actual things those monstrous dreams among  6 and i lay struggling in the impotence of sleep while outward life had burst its bound though still deluded strove the tortured sense                     1155 to its dire wanderings to adapt the sound which in the light of morn was poured around our dwelling breathless pale and unaware i rose and all the cottage crowded found with armed men whose glittering swords were bare                   1160 and whose degraded limbs the tyrants garb did wear  7 and ere with rapid lips and gathered brow i could demand the causea feeble shriek it was a feeble shriek faint far and low arrested memy mien grew calm and meek                             1165 and grasping a small knife i went to seek that voice among the crowdtwas cythnas cry beneath most calm resolve did agony wreak its whirlwind rageso i passed quietly till i beheld where bound that dearest child did lie              1170  8 i started to behold her for delight and exultation and a joyance free solemn serene and lofty filled the light of the calm smile with which she looked on me so that i feared some brainless ecstasy                             1175 wrought from that bitter woe had wildered her farewell farewell she said as i drew nigh at first my peace was marred by this strange stir now i am calm as truthits chosen minister  9 look not so laonsay farewell in hope                            1180 these bloody men are but the slaves who bear their mistress to her taskit was my scope the slavery where they drag me now to share and among captives willing chains to wear awhilethe rest thou knowestreturn dear friend                  1185 let our first triumph trample the despair which would ensnare us now for in the end in victory or in death our hopes and fears must blend  10 these words had fallen on my unheeding ear whilst i had watched the motions of the crew                         1190 with seemingcareless glance not many were around her for their comrades just withdrew to guard some other victimso i drew my knife and with one impulse suddenly all unaware three of their number slew                              1195 and grasped a fourth by the throat and with loud cry my countrymen invoked to death or liberty  11 what followed then i know notfor a stroke on my raised arm and naked head came down filling my eyes with bloodwhen i awoke                           1200 i felt that they had bound me in my swoon and up a rock which overhangs the town by the steep path were bearing me below the plain was filled with slaughteroverthrown the vineyards and the harvests and the glow                         1205 of blazing roofs shone far oer the white oceans flow  12 upon that rock a mighty column stood whose capital seemed sculptured in the sky which to the wanderers oer the solitude of distant seas from ages long gone by                             1210 had made a landmark oer its height to fly scarcely the cloud the vulture or the blast has powerand when the shades of evening lie on earth and ocean its carved summits cast the sunken daylight far through the aerial waste                    1215  13 they bore me to a cavern in the hill beneath that column and unbound me there and one did strip me stark and one did fill a vessel from the putrid pool one bare a lighted torch and four with friendless care                       1220 guided my steps the cavernpaths along then up a steep and dark and narrow stair we wound until the torchs fiery tongue amid the gushing day beamless and pallid hung  14 they raised me to the platform of the pile                          1225 that columns dizzy heightthe grate of brass through which they thrust me open stood the while as to its ponderous and suspended mass with chains which eat into the flesh alas with brazen links my naked limbs they bound                        1230 the grate as they departed to repass with horrid clangour fell and the far sound of their retiring steps in the dense gloom was drowned  15 the noon was calm and brightaround that column the overhanging sky and circling sea                                 1235 spread forth in silentness profound and solemn the darkness of brief frenzy cast on me so that i knew not my own misery the islands and the mountains in the day like clouds reposed afar and i could see                            1240 the town among the woods below that lay and the dark rocks which bound the bright and glassy bay  16 it was so calm that scarce the feathery weed sown by some eagle on the topmost stone swayed in the airso bright that noon did breed                   1245 no shadow in the sky beside mine own mine and the shadow of my chain alone below the smoke of roofs involved in flame rested like night all else was clearly shown in that broad glare yet sound to me none came                      1250 but of the living blood that ran within my frame  17 the peace of madness fled and ah too soon a ship was lying on the sunny main its sails were flagging in the breathless noon its shadow lay beyondthat sight again                              1255 waked with its presence in my tranced brain the stings of a known sorrow keen and cold i knew that ship bore cythna oer the plain of waters to her blighting slavery sold and watched it with such thoughts as must remain untold             1260  18 i watched until the shades of evening wrapped earth like an exhalationthen the bark moved for that calm was by the sunset snapped it moved a speck upon the ocean dark soon the wan stars came forth and i could mark                      1265 its path no morei sought to close mine eyes but like the balls their lids were stiff and stark i would have risen but ere that i could rise my parched skin was split with piercing agonies  19 i gnawed my brazen chain and sought to sever                        1270 its adamantine links that i might die o liberty forgive the base endeavour forgive me if reserved for victory the champion of thy faith eer sought to fly that starry night with its clear silence sent                      1275 tameless resolve which laughed at misery into my soullinked remembrance lent to that such power to me such a severe content  20 to breathe to be to hope or to despair and die i questioned not nor though the sun                       1280 its shafts of agony kindling through the air moved over me nor though in evening dun or when the stars their visible courses run or morning the wide universe was spread in dreary calmness round me did i shun                              1285 its presence nor seek refuge with the dead from one faint hope whose flower a dropping poison shed  21 two days thus passedi neither raved nor died thirst raged within me like a scorpions nest built in mine entrails i had spurned aside                          1290 the watervessel while despair possessed my thoughts and now no drop remained the uprest of the third sun brought hungerbut the crust which had been left was to my craving breast fuel not food i chewed the bitter dust                            1295 and bit my bloodless arm and licked the brazen rust  22 my brain began to fail when the fourth morn burst oer the golden islesa fearful sleep which through the caverns dreary and forlorn of the riven soul sent its foul dreams to sweep                     1300 with whirlwind swiftnessa fall far and deep a gulf a void a sense of senselessness these things dwelt in me even as shadows keep their watch in some dim charnels loneliness a shoreless sea a sky sunless and planetless                       1305  23 the forms which peopled this terrific trance i well rememberlike a choir of devils around me they involved a giddy dance legions seemed gathering from the misty levels of ocean to supply those ceaseless revels                          1310 foul ceaseless shadowsthought could not divide the actual world from these entangling evils which so bemocked themselves that i descried all shapes like mine own self hideously multiplied  24 the sense of day and night of false and true                       1315 was dead within me yet two visions burst that darknessone as since that hour i knew was not a phantom of the realms accursed where then my spirit dweltbut of the first i know not yet was it a dream or no                                1320 but both though not distincter were immersed in hues which when through memorys waste they flow make their divided streams more bright and rapid now  25 methought that grate was lifted and the seven who brought me thither four stiff corpses bare                      1325 and from the frieze to the four winds of heaven hung them on high by the entangled hair swarthy were threethe fourth was very fair as they retired the golden moon upsprung and eagerly out in the giddy air                                   1330 leaning that i might eat i stretched and clung over the shapeless depth in which those corpses hung  26 a womans shape now lank and cold and blue the dwelling of the manycoloured worm hung there the white and hollow cheek i drew                        1335 to my dry lipswhat radiance did inform those horny eyes whose was that withered form alas alas it seemed that cythnas ghost laughed in those looks and that the flesh was warm within my teetha whirlwind keen as frost                          1340 then in its sinking gulfs my sickening spirit tossed  27 then seemed it that a tameless hurricane arose and bore me in its dark career beyond the sun beyond the stars that wane on the verge of formless spaceit languished there                 1345 and dying left a silence lone and drear more horrible than faminein the deep the shape of an old man did then appear stately and beautiful that dreadful sleep his heavenly smiles dispersed and i could wake and weep            1350  28 and when the blinding tears had fallen i saw that column and those corpses and the moon and felt the poisonous tooth of hunger gnaw my vitals i rejoiced as if the boon of senseless death would be accorded soon                         1355 when from that stony gloom a voice arose solemn and sweet as when low winds attune the midnight pines the grate did then unclose and on that reverend form the moonlight did repose  29 he struck my chains and gently spake and smiled                    1360 as they were loosened by that hermit old mine eyes were of their madness half beguiled to answer those kind looks he did enfold his giant arms around me to uphold my wretched frame my scorched limbs he wound                        1365 in linen moist and balmy and as cold as dew to drooping leavesthe chain with sound like earthquake through the chasm of that steep stair did bound  30 as lifting me it fellwhat next i heard were billows leaping on the harbourbar                             1370 and the shrill seawind whose breath idly stirred my hairi looked abroad and saw a star shining beside a sail and distant far that mountain and its column the known mark of those who in the wide deep wandering are                         1375 so that i feared some spirit fell and dark in trance had lain me thus within a fiendish bark  31 for now indeed over the salt seabillow i sailed yet dared not look upon the shape of him who ruled the helm although the pillow                       1380 for my light head was hollowed in his lap and my bare limbs his mantle did enwrap fearing it was a fiend at last he bent oer me his aged face as if to snap those dreadful thoughts the gentle grandsire bent                   1385 and to my inmost soul his soothing looks he sent  32 a soft and healing potion to my lips at intervals he raisednow looked on high to mark if yet the starry giant dips his zone in the dim seanow cheeringly                             1390 though he said little did he speak to me it is a friend beside theetake good cheer poor victim thou art now at liberty i joyed as those a human tone to hear who in cells deep and lone have languished many a year              1395  33 a dim and feeble joy whose glimpses oft were quenched in a relapse of wildering dreams yet still methought we sailed until aloft the stars of night grew pallid and the beams of morn descended on the oceanstreams                              1400 and still that aged man so grand and mild tended me even as some sick mother seems to hang in hope over a dying child till in the azure east darkness again was piled  34 and then the nightwind steaming from the shore                     1405 sent odours dying sweet across the sea and the swift boat the little waves which bore were cut by its keen keel though slantingly soon i could hear the leaves sigh and could see the myrtleblossoms starring the dim grove                          1410 as past the pebbly beach the boat did flee on sidelong wing into a silent cove where ebon pines a shade under the starlight wove   notes 1223 torches editions 1818 1839 1385 bentmeant cj j nettleship   canto 4  1 the old man took the oars and soon the bark smote on the beach beside a tower of stone                          1415 it was a crumbling heap whose portal dark with blooming ivytrails was overgrown upon whose floor the spangling sands were strown and rarest seashells which the eternal flood slave to the mother of the months had thrown                        1420 within the walls of that gray tower which stood a changeling of mans art nursed amid natures brood  2 when the old man his boat had anchored he wound me in his arms with tender care and very few but kindly words he said                              1425 and bore me through the tower adown a stair whose smooth descent some ceaseless step to wear for many a year had fallenwe came at last to a small chamber which with mosses rare was tapestried where me his soft hands placed                       1430 upon a couch of grass and oakleaves interlaced  3 the moon was darting through the lattices its yellow light warm as the beams of day so warm that to admit the dewy breeze the old man opened them the moonlight lay                           1435 upon a lake whose waters wove their play even to the threshold of that lonely home within was seen in the dim wavering ray the antique sculptured roof and many a tome whose lore had made that sage all that he had become                1440  4 the rockbuilt barrier of the sea was past and i was on the margin of a lake a lonely lake amid the forests vast and snowy mountainsdid my spirit wake from sleep as manycoloured as the snake                             1445 that girds eternity in life and truth might not my heart its cravings ever slake was cythna then a dream and all my youth and all its hopes and fears and all its joy and ruth  5 thus madness came againa milder madness                          1450 which darkened nought but times unquiet flow with supernatural shades of clinging sadness that gentle hermit in my helpless woe by my sick couch was busy to and fro like a strong spirit ministrant of good                             1455 when i was healed he led me forth to show the wonders of his sylvan solitude and we together sate by that islefretted flood  6 he knew his soothing words to weave with skill from all my madness told like mine own heart                       1460 of cythna would he question me until that thrilling name had ceased to make me start from his familiar lipsit was not art of wisdom and of justice when he spoke when mid soft looks of pity there would dart                        1465 a glance as keen as is the lightnings stroke when it doth rive the knots of some ancestral oak  7 thus slowly from my brain the darkness rolled my thoughts their due array did reassume through the enchantments of that hermit old                         1470 then i bethought me of the glorious doom of those who sternly struggle to relume the lamp of hope oer mans bewildered lot and sitting by the waters in the gloom of eve to that friends heart i told my thought                   1475 that heart which had grown old but had corrupted not  8 that hoary man had spent his livelong age in converse with the dead who leave the stamp of everburning thoughts on many a page when they are gone into the senseless damp                           1480 of graveshis spirit thus became a lamp of splendour like to those on which it fed through peopled haunts the city and the camp deep thirst for knowledge had his footsteps led and all the ways of men among mankind he read                       1485  9 but custom maketh blind and obdurate the loftiest heartshe had beheld the woe in which mankind was bound but deemed that fate which made them abject would preserve them so and in such faith some steadfast joy to know                       1490 he sought this cell but when fame went abroad that one in argolis did undergo torture for liberty and that the crowd high truths from gifted lips had heard and understood  10 and that the multitude was gathering wide                         1495 his spirit leaped within his aged frame in lonely peace he could no more abide but to the land on which the victors flame had fed my native land the hermit came each heart was there a shield and every tongue                      1500 was as a sword of truthyoung laons name rallied their secret hopes though tyrants sung hymns of triumphant

made them melt in tears of penitence they gave him entrance free to bear me thence since this the old man said seven years are spent while slowly truth on thy benighted sense

my wakened thoughts create                           1515 out of the hopes of thine aspirings bold have i collected language to unfold truth to my countrymen from shore to shore doctrines of human power my words have told they have been heard and men aspire to more                         1520 than they have ever gained or ever lost of yore  13 in secret chambers parents read and weep my writings to their babes no longer blind and young men gather when their tyrants sleep and vows of faith each to the other bind                            1525 and marriageable maidens who have pined with love till life seemed melting through their look a warmer zeal a nobler hope now find and every bosom thus is rapt and shook like autumns myriad leaves in one swoln mountainbrook             1530

which time nor chance                     1555 nor change may not extinguish and my share of good was oer the world its gathered beams to bear  17 but i alas am both unknown and old and though the woof of wisdom i know well to dye in hues of language i am cold                                1560 in seeming and the hopes which inly dwell my manners note that i did long repel but laons name to the tumultuous throng were like the star whose beams the waves compel and tempests and his soulsubduing tongue                           1565 were as a lance to quell the mailed crest of wrong  18

the green earth lightly i did arise as one out of dim dreams that doth awake and looked upon the depth of that reposing lake                     1665  29 i saw my countenance reflected there and then my youth fell on me like a wind descending on still watersmy thin hair was prematurely gray my face was lined with channels such as suffering leaves behind                      1670 not age my brow was pale but in my cheek and lips a flush of gnawing fire did find their food and dwelling though mine eyes might speak a subtle mind and strong within a frame thus weak  30 and though their lustre now was spent and faded                     1675 yet in my hollow looks and withered mien the likeness of a shape for which was braided the brightest woof of genius still was seen one who methought had gone from the worlds scene and left it vacanttwas her lovers face                         1680 it might resemble herit once had been the mirror of her thoughts and still the grace which her minds shadow cast left there a lingering trace  31 what then was i she slumbered with the dead glory and joy and peace had come and gone                          1685 doth the cloud perish when the beams are fled which steeped its skirts in gold or dark and lone doth it not through the paths of night unknown on outspread wings of its own wind upborne pour rain upon the earth the stars are shown                       1690 when the cold moon sharpens her silver horn under the sea and make the wide night not forlorn  32 strengthened in heart yet sad that aged man i left with interchange of looks and tears and lingering speech and to the camp began                          1695 my war oer many a mountainchain which rears its hundred crests aloft my spirit bears my frame oer many a dale and many a moor and gaily now meseems serene earth wears the blosmy springs starbright investiture                         1700 a vision which aught sad from sadness might allure  33 my powers revived within me and i went as one whom winds waft oer the bending grass through many a vale of that broad continent at night when i reposed fair dreams did pass                        1705 before my pillowmy own cythna was not like a child of death among them ever when i arose from rest a woful mass that gentlest sleep seemed from my life to sever as if the light of youth were not withdrawn for ever                1710  34 aye as i went that maiden who had reared the torch of truth afar of whose high deeds the hermit in his pilgrimage had heard haunted my thoughtsah hope its sickness feeds with whatsoeer

around my steps which would not ever fade   notes 1625 wherewhen edition 1818   canto 5  1 over the utmost hill at length i sped                               1720 a snowy steepthe moon was hanging low over the asian mountains and outspread the plain the city and the camp below skirted the midnight oceans glimmering flow the citys moonlit spires and myriad lamps                          1725 like stars in a sublunar sky did glow and fires blazed far amid the scattered camps like springs of flame which burst whereer swift earthquake stamps  2 all slept but those in watchful arms who stood and those who sate tending the beacons light                       1730 and the few sounds from that vast multitude made silence more profoundoh what a might of human thought was cradled in that night how many hearts impenetrably veiled beat underneath its shade what secret fight                         1735 evil and good in woven passions mailed waged through that silent thronga war that never failed  3 and now the power of good held victory so through the labyrinth of many a tent among the silent millions who did lie                                1740 in innocent sleep exultingly i went the moon had left heaven desert now but lent from eastern morn the first faint lustre showed an armed youthover his spear he bent his downward facea friend i cried aloud                       1745 and quickly common hopes made freemen understood  4 i sate beside him while the morning beam crept slowly over heaven and talked with him of those immortal hopes a glorious theme which led us forth until the stars grew dim                        1750 and all the while methought his voice did swim as if it drowned in remembrance were of thoughts which make the moist eyes overbrim at last when daylight gan to fill the air he looked on me and cried in wonderthou art here               1755  5 then suddenly i knew it was the youth in whom its earliest hopes my spirit found but envious tongues had stained his spotless truth and thoughtless pride his love in silence bound and shame and sorrow mine in toils had wound                        1760 whilst he was innocent and i deluded the truth now came upon me on the ground tears of repenting joy which fast intruded fell fast and oer its peace our mingling spirits brooded  6 thus while with rapid lips and earnest eyes                         1765 we talked a sound of sweeping conflict spread as from the earth did suddenly arise from every tent roused by that clamour dread our bands outsprung and seized their armswe sped towards the sound our tribes were gathering far                    1770 those sanguine slaves amid ten thousand dead stabbed in their sleep trampled in treacherous war the gentle hearts whose power their lives had sought to spare  7 like rabid snakes that sting some gentle child who brings them food when winter false and fair                     1775 allures them forth with its cold smiles so wild they rage among the campthey overbear the patriot hostsconfusion then despair descends like nightwhen laon one did cry like a bright ghost from heaven that shout did scare                 1780 the slaves and widening through the vaulted sky seemed sent from earth to heaven in sign of victory  8 in sudden panic those false murderers fled like insect tribes before the northern gale but swifter still our hosts encompassed                             1785 their shattered ranks and in a craggy vale where even their fierce despair might nought avail hemmed them aroundand then revenge and fear made the high virtue of the patriots fail one pointed on his foe the mortal spear                            1790 i rushed before its point and cried forbear forbear  9 the spear transfixed my arm that was uplifted in swift expostulation and the blood gushed round its point i smiled andoh thou gifted with eloquence which shall not be withstood                         1795 flow thus i cried in joy thou

slaves who kill for hire are men and to avenge misdeed on the misdoer doth but misery feed with her own broken heart o earth o heaven                        1815 and thou dread nature which to every deed and all that lives or is to be hath given even as to thee have these done ill and are forgiven  12 join then your hands and hearts and let the past be as a grave which gives not up its dead                            1820 to evil thoughtsa film then overcast my sense with dimness for the wound which bled freshly swift shadows oer mine eyes had shed when i awoke i lay mid friends and foes and earnest countenances on me shed                                  1825 the light of questioning looks whilst one did close my wound with balmiest herbs and soothed me to repose  13 and one whose spear had pierced me leaned beside with quivering lips and humid eyesand all seemed like some brothers on a journey wide                          1830 gone forth whom now strange meeting did befall in a strange land round one whom they might call their friend their chief their father for assay of peril which had saved them from the thrall of death now suffering thus the vast array                         1835 of those fraternal bands were reconciled that day  14 lifting the thunder of their acclamation towards the city then the multitude and i among them went in joya nation made free by lovea mighty brotherhood                             1840 linked by a jealous interchange of good a glorious pageant more magnificent than kingly slaves arrayed in gold and blood when they return from carnage and are sent in triumph bright beneath the populous battlement                   1845  15 afar the citywalls were thronged on high and myriads on each giddy turret clung and to each spire far lessening in the sky bright pennons on the idle winds were hung as we approached a shout of joyance sprung                          1850 at once from all the crowd as if the vast and peopled earth its boundless skies among the sudden clamour of delight had cast when from before its face some general wreck had passed  16 our armies through the citys hundred gates                          1855 were poured like brooks which to the rocky lair of some deep lake whose silence them awaits throng from the mountains when the storms are there and as we passed through the calm sunny air a thousand flowerinwoven crowns were shed                          1860 the token flowers of truth and freedom fair and fairest hands bound them on many a head those angels of loves heaven that over all was spread  17 i trod as one tranced in some rapturous vision those bloody bands so lately reconciled                             1865 were ever as they went by the contrition of anger turned to love from ill beguiled and every one on them more gently smiled because they had done evilthe sweet awe of such mild looks made their own hearts grow mild                  1870 and did with soft attraction ever draw their spirits to the love of freedoms equal law  18 and they and all in one loud symphony my name with liberty commingling lifted the friend and the preserver of the free                           1875 the parent of this joy and fair eyes gifted with feelings caught from one who had uplifted the light of a great spirit round me shone and all the shapes of this grand scenery shifted like restless clouds before the steadfast sun                     1880 where was that maid i asked but it was known of none  19 laone was the name her love had chosen for she was nameless and her birth none knew where was laone nowthe words were frozen within my lips with fear but to subdue                              1885 such dreadful hope to my great task was due and when at length one brought reply that she tomorrow would appear i then withdrew to judge what need for that great throng might be for now the stars came thick over the twilight sea                  1890  20 yet need was none for rest or food to care even though that multitude was passing great since each one for the other did prepare all kindly succourtherefore to the gate of the imperial house now desolate                                 1895 i passed and there was found aghast alone the fallen tyrantsilently he sate upon the footstool of his golden throne which starred with sunny gems in its own lustre shone  21 alone but for one child who led before him                         1900 a graceful dance the only living thing of all the crowd which thither to adore him flocked yesterday who solace sought to bring in his abandonmentshe knew the king had praised her dance of yore and now she wove                      1905 its circles aye weeping and murmuring mid her sad task of unregarded love that to no smiles it might his speechless sadness move  22 she fled to him and wildly clasped his feet when human steps were heardhe moved nor spoke                    1910 nor changed his hue nor raised his looks to meet the gaze of strangersour loud entrance woke the echoes of the hall which circling broke the calm of its recesseslike a tomb its sculptured walls vacantly to the stroke                          1915 of footfalls answered and the twilights gloom lay like a charnels mist within the radiant dome  23 the little child stood up when we came nigh her lips and cheeks seemed very pale and wan but on her forehead and within her eye                              1920 lay beauty which makes hearts that feed thereon sick with excess of sweetness on the throne she leanedthe king with gathered brow and lips wreathed by long scorn did inly sneer and frown with hue like that when some great painter dips                      1925 his pencil in the gloom of earthquake and eclipse  24 she stood beside him like a rainbow braided within some storm when scarce its shadows vast from the blue paths of the swift sun have faded a sweet and solemn smile like cythnas cast                        1930 one moments light which made my heart beat fast oer that childs parted lipsa gleam of bliss a shade of vanished daysas the tears passed which wrapped it even as with a fathers kiss i pressed those softest eyes in trembling tenderness                1935  25 the sceptred wretch then from that solitude i drew and of his change compassionate with words of sadness soothed his rugged mood but he while pride and fear held deep debate with sullen guile of illdissembled hate                             1940 glared on me as a toothless snake might glare pity not scorn i felt though desolate the desolator now and unaware the curses which he mocked had caught him by the hair  26 i led him forth from that which now might seem                       1945 a gorgeous grave through portals sculptured deep with imagery beautiful as dream we went and left the shades which tend on sleep over its unregarded gold to keep their silent watchthe child trod faintingly                      1950 and as she went the tears which she did weep glanced in the starlight wildered seemed she and when i spake for sobs she could not answer me  27 at last the tyrant cried she hungers slave stab her or give her breadit was a tone                         1955 such as sick fancies in a newmade grave might hear i trembled for the truth was known he with this child had thus been left alone and neither had gone forth for foodbut he in mingled pride and awe cowered near his throne                    1960 and she a nursling of captivity knew nought beyond those walls nor what such change might be  28 and he was troubled at a charm withdrawn thus suddenly that sceptres ruled no more that even from gold the dreadful strength was gone                  1965 which once made all things subject to its power such wonder seized him as if hour by hour the past had come again and the swift fall of one so great and terrible of yore to desolateness in the hearts of all                                1970 like wonder stirred who saw such awful change befall  29 a mighty crowd such as the wide land pours once in a thousand years now gathered round the fallen tyrantlike the rush of showers of hail in spring pattering along the ground                       1975 their many footsteps fell else came no sound from the wide multitude that lonely man then knew the burden of his change and found concealing in the dust his visage wan refuge from the keen looks which through his bosom ran              1980  30 and he was faint withal i sate beside him upon the earth and took that child so fair from his weak arms that ill might none betide him or herwhen food was brought to them her share to his averted lips the child did bear                              1985 but when she saw he had enough she ate and wept the whilethe lonely mans despair hunger then overcame and of his state forgetful on the dust as in a trance he sate  31 slowly the silence of the multitudes                                 1990 passed as when far is heard in some lone dell the gathering of a wind among the woods and he is fallen they cry he who did dwell like famine or the plague or aught more fell among our homes is fallen the murderer                             1995 who slaked his thirsting soul as from a well of blood and tears with ruin he is here sunk in a gulf of scorn from which none may him rear  32 then was heardhe who judged let him be brought to judgement blood for blood cries from the soil                    2000 on which his crimes have deep pollution wrought shall othman only unavenged despoil shall they who by the stress of grinding toil wrest from the unwilling earth his luxuries perish for crime while his foul blood may boil                     2005 or creep within his veins at willarise and to high justice make her chosen sacrifice  33 what do ye seek what fear ye then i cried suddenly starting forth that ye should shed the blood of othmanif your hearts are tried                       2010 in the true love of freedom cease to dread this one poor lonely manbeneath heaven spread in purest light above us all through earth maternal earth who doth her sweet smiles shed for all let him go free until the worth                            2015 of human nature win from these a second birth  34 what call ye justice is there one who neer in secret thought has wished anothers ill are ye all pure let those stand forth who hear and tremble not shall they insult and kill                         2020 if such they be their mild eyes can they fill with the false anger of the hypocrite alas such were not purethe chastened will of virtue sees that justice is the light of love and not revenge and terror and despite                   2025  35 the murmur of the people slowly dying paused as i spake then those who near me were cast gentle looks where the lone man was lying shrouding his head which now that infant fair clasped on her lap in silencethrough the air                      2030 sobs were then heard and many kissed my feet in pitys madness and to the despair of him whom late they cursed a solace sweet his very victims broughtsoft looks and speeches meet  36 then to a home for his repose assigned                              2035 accompanied by the still throng he went in silence where to soothe his rankling mind some likeness of his ancient state was lent and if his heart could have been innocent as those who pardoned him he might have ended                       2040 his days in peace but his straight lips were bent men said into a smile which guile portended a sight with which that child like hope with fear was blended  37 twas midnight now the eve of that great day whereon the many nations at whose call                               2045 the chains of earth like mist melted away decreed to hold a sacred festival a rite to attest the equality of all who live so to their homes to dream or wake all went the sleepless silence did recall                           2050 laone to my thoughts with hopes that make the flood recede from which their thirst they seek to slake  38 the dawn flowed forth and from its purple fountains i drank those hopes which make the spirit quail as to the plain between the misty mountains                          2055 and the great city with a countenance pale i wentit was a sight which might avail to make men weep exulting tears for whom now first from human power the reverend veil was torn to see earth from her general womb                         2060 pour forth her swarming sons to a fraternal doom  39 to see far glancing in the misty morning the signs of that innumerable host to hear one sound of many made the warning of earth to heaven from its free children tossed                    2065 while the eternal hills and the sea lost in wavering light and starring the blue sky the citys myriad spires of gold almost with human joy made mute society its witnesses with men who must hereafter be                        2070  40 to see like some vast island from the ocean the altar of the federation rear its pile i the midst a work which the devotion of millions in one night created there sudden as when the moonrise makes appear                             2075 strange clouds in the east a marble pyramid distinct with steps that mighty shape did wear the light of genius its still shadow hid far ships to know its height the morning mists forbid  41 to hear the restless multitudes for ever                             2080 around the base of that great altar flow as on some mountainislet burst and shiver atlantic waves and solemnly and slow as the wind bore that tumult to and fro to feel the dreamlike music which did swim                          2085 like beams through floating clouds on waves below falling in pauses from that altar dim as silversounding tongues breathed an aerial hymn  42 to hear to see to live was on that morn lethean joy so that all those assembled                             2090 cast off their memories of the past outworn two only bosoms with their own life trembled and mine was oneand we had both dissembled so with a beating heart i went and one who having much covets yet more resembled                         2095 a lost and dear possession which not won he walks in lonely gloom beneath the noonday sun  43 to the great pyramid i came its stair with female choirs was thronged the loveliest among the free grouped with its sculptures rare                    2100 as i approached the mornings golden mist which now the wonderstricken breezes kissed with their cold lips fled and the summit shone like athos seen from samothracia dressed in earliest light by vintagers and one                             2105 sate there a female shape upon an ivory throne  44 a form most like the imagined habitant of silver exhalations sprung from dawn by winds which feed on sunrise woven to enchant the faiths of men all mortal eyes were drawn                       2110 as famished mariners through strange seas gone gaze on a burning watchtower by the light of those divinest lineamentsalone with thoughts which none could share from that fair sight i turned in sickness for a veil shrouded her countenance bright    2115  45 and neither did i hear the acclamations which from brief silence bursting filled the air with her strange name and mine from all the nations which we they said in strength had gathered there from the sleep of bondage nor the vision fair                       2120 of that bright pageantry beheldbut blind and silent as a breathing corpse did fare leaning upon my friend till like a wind to fevered cheeks a voice flowed oer my troubled mind  46 like music of some minstrel heavenly gifted                         2125 to one whom fiends enthral this voice to me scarce did i wish her veil to be uplifted i was so calm and joyousi could see the platform where we stood the statues three which kept their marble watch on that high shrine                   2130 the multitudes the mountains and the sea as when eclipse hath passed things sudden shine to mens astonished eyes most clear and crystalline  47 at first laone spoke most tremulously but soon her voice the calmness which it shed                        2135 gathered andthou art whom i sought to see and thou art our first votary here she said i had a dear friend once but he is dead and of all those on the wide earth who breathe thou dost resemble him alonei spread                               2140 this veil between us two that thou beneath shouldst image one who may have been long lost in death  48 for this wilt thou not henceforth pardon me yes but those joys which silence well requite forbid replywhy men have chosen me                                2145 to be the priestess of this holiest rite i scarcely know but that the floods of light which flow over the world have borne me hither to meet thee long most dear and now unite thine hand with mine and may all comfort wither                     2150 from both the hearts whose pulse in joy now beat together  49 if our own will as others law we bind if the foul worship trampled here we fear if as ourselves we cease to love our kind she paused and pointed upwardssculptured there                    2155 three shapes around her ivory throne appear one was a giant like a child asleep on a loose rock whose grasp crushed as it were in dream sceptres and crowns and one did keep its watchful eyes in doubt whether to smile or weep                 2160  50 a woman sitting on the sculptured disk of the broad earth and feeding from one breast a human babe and a young basilisk her looks were sweet as heavens when loveliest in autumn eves the third image was dressed                          2165 in white wings swift as clouds in winter skies beneath his feet mongst ghastliest forms repressed lay faith an obscene worm who sought to rise while calmly on the sun he turned his diamond eyes  51 beside that image then i sate while she                             2170 stood mid the throngs which ever ebbed and flowed like light amid the shadows of the sea cast from one cloudless star and on the crowd that touch which none who feels forgets bestowed and whilst the sun returned the steadfast gaze                       2175 of the great image as oer heaven it glode that rite had place it ceased when sunsets blaze burned oer the isles all stood in joy and deep amaze when in the silence of all spirits there laones voice was felt and through the air                          2180 her thrilling gestures spoke most eloquently fair  511 calm art thou as yon sunset swift and strong as newfledged eagles beautiful and young that float among the blinding beams of morning and underneath

she had ceased the mists of night entwining their dim woof floated oer the infinite throng she like a spirit through the darkness shining in tones whose sweetness silence did prolong                        2275 as if to lingering winds they did belong poured forth her inmost soul a passionate speech with wild and thrilling pauses woven among which whoso heard was mute for it could teach to rapture like her own all listening hearts to reach               2280  53 her voice was as a mountain stream which sweeps the withered leaves of autumn to the lake and in some deep and narrow bay then sleeps in the shadow of the shores as dead leaves wake under the wave in flowers and herbs which make                      2285 those green depths beautiful when skies are blue the multitude so moveless did partake such living change and kindling murmurs flew as oer that speechless calm delight and wonder grew  54 over the plain the throngs were scattered then                       2290 in groups around the fires which from the sea even to the gorge of the first mountainglen blazed wide and far the banquet of the free was spread beneath many a dark cypresstree beneath whose spires which swayed in the red flame                 2295 reclining as they ate of liberty and hope and justice and laones name earths children did a woof of happy converse frame  55 their feast was such as earth the general mother pours from her fairest bosom when she smiles                        2300 in the embrace of autumnto each other as when some parent fondly reconciles her warring children she their wrath beguiles with her own sustenance they relenting weep such was this festival which from their isles                       2305 and continents and winds and oceans deep all shapes might throng to share that fly or walk or creep  56 might share in peace and innocence for gore or poison none this festal did pollute but piled on high an overflowing store                             2310 of pomegranates and citrons fairest fruit melons and dates and figs and many a root sweet and sustaining and bright grapes ere yet accursed fire their mild juice could transmute into a mortal bane and brown corn set                               2315 in baskets with pure streams their thirsting lips they wet  57 laone had descended from the shrine and every deepest look and holiest mind fed on her form though now those tones divine were silent as she passed she did unwind                            2320 her veil as with the crowds of her own kind she mixed some impulse made my heart refrain from seeking her that night so i reclined amidst a group where on the utmost plain a festal watchfire burned beside the dusky main                     2325  58 and joyous was our feast pathetic talk and wit and harmony of choral strains while far orion oer the waves did walk that flow among the isles held us in chains of sweet captivity which none disdains                               2330 who feels but when his zone grew dim in mist which clothes the oceans bosom oer the plains the multitudes went homeward to their rest which that delightful day with its own shadow blessed   notes 2295 flamelight edition 1818   canto 6  1 beside the dimness of the glimmering sea                            2335 weaving swift language from impassioned themes with that dear friend i lingered who to me so late had been restored beneath the gleams of the silver stars and ever in soft dreams of future love and peace sweet converse lapped                       2340 our willing fancies till the pallid beams of the last watchfire fell and darkness wrapped the waves and each bright chain of floating fire was snapped  2 and till we came even to the citys wall and the great gate then none knew whence or why                   2345 disquiet on the multitudes did fall and first one pale and breathless passed us by and stared and spoke notthen with piercing cry a troop of wildeyed women by the shrieks of their own terror driventumultuously                            2350 hither and thither hurrying with pale cheeks each one from fear unknown a sudden refuge seeks  3 then rallying cries of treason and of danger resounded andthey come to arms to arms the tyrant is amongst us and the stranger                           2355 comes to enslave us in his name to arms in vain for panic the pale fiend who charms strength to forswear her right those millions swept like waves before the tempestthese alarms came to me as to know their cause i lept                            2360 on the gates turret and in rage and grief and scorn i wept  4 for to the north i saw the town on fire and its red light made morning pallid now which burst over wide asialouder higher the yells of victory and the screams of woe                          2365 i heard approach and saw the throng below stream through the gates like foamwrought waterfalls fed from a thousand stormsthe fearful glow of bombs flares overheadat intervals the red artillerys bolt mangling among them falls                  2370  5 and now the horsemen comeand all was done swifter than i have spokeni beheld their red swords flash in the unrisen sun i rushed among the rout to have repelled that miserable flightone moment quelled                            2375 by voice and looks and eloquent despair as if reproach from their own hearts withheld their steps they stood but soon came pouring there new multitudes and did those rallied bands oerbear  6 i strove as drifted on some cataract                               2380 by irresistible streams

plain                     2385 disgorged at length the dead and the alive in one dread mass were parted and the stain of blood from mortal steel fell oer the fields like rain  7 for now the despots bloodhounds with their prey unarmed and unaware were gorging deep                               2390 their gluttony of death the loose array of horsemen oer the wide fields murdering sweep and with loud laughter for their tyrant reap a harvest sown with other hopes the while far overhead ships from propontis keep                              2395 a killing rain of firewhen the waves smile as

whose stony eyes glared in the morning light i trodto me there came no thought of flight but with loud cries of scorn which whoso heard that dreaded death felt in his veins the might of virtuous shame return the crowd i stirred                       2405 and desperations hope in many hearts recurred  9 a band of brothers gathering round me made although unarmed a steadfast front and still retreating with stern looks beneath the shade of gathered eyebrows did the victors fill                           2410 with doubt even in success deliberate will inspired our growing troop not overthrown it gained the shelter of a grassy hill and ever still our comrades were hewn down and their defenceless limbs beneath our footsteps strown            2415  10 immovably we stoodin joy i found beside me then firm as a giant pine among the mountainvapours driven around the old man whom i lovedhis eyes divine with a mild look of courage answered mine                           2420 and my young friend was near and ardently his hand grasped mine a momentnow the line of war extended to our rallying cry as myriads flocked in love and brotherhood to die  11 for ever while the sun was climbing heaven                           2425 the horseman hewed our unarmed myriads down safely though when by thirst of carnage driven too near those slaves were swiftly overthrown by hundreds leaping on themflesh and bone soon made our ghastly ramparts then the shaft                       2430 of the artillery from the sea was thrown more fast and fiery and the conquerors laughed in pride to hear the wind our screams of torment waft  12 for on one side alone the hill gave shelter so vast that phalanx of unconquered men                             2435 and there the living in the blood did welter of the dead and dying which in that green glen like stifled torrents made a plashy fen under the feetthus was the butchery waged while the sun clomb heavens eastern steepbut when                 2440 it gan to sinka fiercer combat raged for in more doubtful strife the armies were engaged  13 within a cave upon the hill were found a bundle of rude pikes the instrument of those who war but on their native ground                          2445 for natural rights a shout of joyance sent even from our hearts the wide air pierced and rent as those few arms the bravest and the best seized and each sixth thus armed did now present a line which covered and sustained the rest                         2450 a confident phalanx which the foes on every side invest  14 that onset turned the foes to flight almost but soon they saw their present strength and knew that coming night would to our resolute host bring victory so dismounting close they drew                       2455 their glittering files and then the combat grew unequal but most horribleand ever our myriads whom the swift bolt overthrew or the red sword failed like a mountain river which rushes forth in foam to sink in sands for ever                2460  15 sorrow and shame to see with their own kind our human brethren mix like beasts of blood to mutual ruin armed by one behind who sits and scoffsthat friend so mild and good who like its shadow near my youth had stood                         2465 was stabbedmy old preservers hoary hair with the flesh clinging to its roots was strewed under my feeti lost all sense or care and like the rest i grew desperate and unaware  16 the battle became ghastlierin the midst                            2470 i paused and saw how ugly and how fell o hate thou art even when thy life thou sheddst for love the ground in many a little dell was broken up and down whose steeps befell alternate victory and defeat and there                              2475 the combatants with rage most horrible strove and their eyes started with cracking stare and impotent their tongues they lolled into the air  17 flaccid and foamy like a mad dogs hanging want and moonmadness and the pests swift bane                    2480 when its shafts smitewhile yet its bow is twanging have each their mark and signsome ghastly stain and this was thine o war of hate and pain thou loathed slave i saw all shapes of death and ministered to many oer the plain                               2485 while carnage in the sunbeams warmth did seethe till twilight oer the east wove her serenest wreath  18 the few who yet survived resolute and firm around me fought at the decline of day winding above the mountains snowy term                              2490 new banners shone they quivered in the ray of the suns unseen orbere night the array of fresh troops hemmed us inof those brave bands i soon survived aloneand now i lay vanquished and faint the grasp of bloody hands                      2495 i felt and saw on high the glare of falling brands  19 when on my foes a sudden terror came and they fled scatteringlo with reinless speed a black tartarian horse of giant frame comes trampling over the dead the living bleed                      2500 beneath the hoofs of that tremendous steed on which like to an angel robed in white sate one waving a swordthe hosts recede and fly as through their ranks with awful might sweeps in the shadow of eve that phantom swift and bright           2505  20 and its path made a solitudei rose and marked its coming it relaxed its course as it approached me and the wind that flows through night bore accents to mine ear whose force might create smiles in deaththe tartar horse                       2510 paused and i saw the shape its might which swayed and heard her musical pants like the sweet source of waters in the desert as she said mount with me laon nowi rapidly obeyed  21 then away away she cried and stretched her sword               2515 as twere a scourge over the coursers head and lightly shook the reinswe spake no word but like the vapour of the tempest fled over the plain her dark hair was dispread like the pines locks upon the lingering blast                      2520 over mine eyes its shadowy strings it spread fitfully and the hills and streams fled fast as oer their glimmering forms the steeds broad shadow passed  22 and his hoofs ground the rocks to fire and dust his strong sides made the torrents rise in spray                    2525 and turbulence as of a whirlwinds gust surrounded usand still away away through the desert night we sped while she alway gazed on a mountain which we neared whose crest crowned with a marble ruin in the ray                               2530 of the obscure stars gleamedits rugged breast the steed strained up and then his impulse did arrest  23 a rocky hill which overhung the ocean from that lone ruin when the steed that panted paused might be heard the murmur of the motion                      2535 of waters as in spots for ever haunted by the choicest winds of heaven which are enchanted to music by the wand of solitude that wizard wild and the far tents implanted upon the plain be seen by those who stood                           2540 thence marking the dark shore of oceans curved flood  24 one moment these were heard and seenanother passed and the two who stood beneath that night each only heard or saw or felt the other as from the lofty steed she did alight                              2545 cythna for from the eyes whose deepest light of love and sadness made my lips feel pale with influence strange of mournfullest delight my own sweet cythna looked with joy did quail and felt her strength in tears of human weakness fail               2550  25 and for a space in my embrace she rested her head on my unquiet heart reposing while my faint arms her languid frame invested at length she looked on me and half unclosing her tremulous lips said friend thy bands were losing             2555 the battle as i stood before the king in bondsi burst them then and swiftly choosing the time did seize a tartars sword and spring upon his horse and swift as on the whirlwinds wing  26 have thou and i been borne beyond pursuer                          2560 and we are herethen turning to the steed she pressed the white moon on his front with pure and roselike lips and many a fragrant weed from the green ruin plucked that he might feed but i to a stone seat that maiden led                               2565 and kissing her fair eyes said thou hast need of rest and i heaped up the coursers bed in a green mossy nook with mountain flowers dispread  27 within that ruin where a shattered portal looks to the eastern stars abandoned now                            2570 by man to be the home of things immortal memories like awful ghosts which come and go and must inherit all he builds below when he is gone a hall stood oer whose roof fair clinging weeds with ivy pale did grow                          2575 clasping its gray rents with a verdurous woof a hanging dome of leaves a canopy moonproof  28 the autumnal winds as if spellbound had made a natural couch of leaves in that recess which seasons none disturbed but in the shade                      2580 of flowering parasites did spring love to dress with their sweet blooms the wintry loneliness of those dead leaves shedding their stars wheneer the wandering wind her nurslings might caress whose intertwining fingers ever there                                2585 made music wild and soft that filled the listening air  29 we know not where we go or what sweet dream may pilot us through caverns strange and fair of far and pathless passion while the stream of life our bark doth on its whirlpools bear                       2590 spreading swift wings as sails to the dim air nor should we seek to know so the devotion of love and gentle thoughts be heard still there louder and louder from the utmost ocean of universal life attuning its commotion                           2595  30 to the pure all things are pure oblivion wrapped our spirits and the fearful overthrow of public hope was from our being snapped though linked years had bound it there for now a power a thirst a knowledge which below                          2600 all thoughts like light beyond the atmosphere clothing its clouds with grace doth ever flow came on us as we sate in silence there beneath the golden stars of the clear azure air  31 in silence which doth follow talk that causes                        2605 the baffled heart to speak with sighs and tears when wildering passion swalloweth up the pauses of inexpressive speechthe youthful years which we together passed their hopes and fears the blood itself which ran within our frames                        2610 that likeness of the features which endears the thoughts expressed by them our very names and all the winged hours which speechless memory claims  32 had found a voiceand ere that voice did pass the night grew damp and dim and through a rent                     2615 of the ruin where we sate from the morass a wandering meteor by some wild wind sent hung high in the green dome to which it lent a faint and pallid lustre while the song of blasts in which its blue hair quivering bent                    2620 strewed strangest sounds the moving leaves among a wondrous light the sound as of a spirits tongue  33 the meteor showed the leaves on which we sate and cythnas glowing arms and the thick ties of her soft hair which bent with gathered weight                    2625 my neck near hers her dark and deepening eyes which as twin phantoms of one star that lies oer a dim well move though the star reposes swam in our mute and liquid ecstasies her marble brow and eager lips like roses                         2630 with their own fragrance pale which spring but half uncloses  34 the meteor to its far morass returned the beating of our veins one interval made still and then i felt the blood that burned within her frame mingle with mine and fall                         2635 around my heart like fire and over all a mist was spread the sickness of a deep and speechless swoon of joy as might befall two disunited spirits when they leap in union from this earths obscure and fading sleep                 2640  35 was it one moment that confounded thus all thought all sense all feeling into one unutterable power which shielded us even from our own cold looks when we had gone into a wide and wild oblivion                                        2645 of tumult and of tenderness or now had ages such as make the moon and sun the seasons and mankind their changes know left fear and time unfelt by us alone below  36 i know not what are kisses whose fire clasps                        2650 the failing heart in languishment or limb twined within limb or the quick dying gasps of the life meeting when the faint eyes swim through tears of a wide mist boundless and dim in one caress what is the strong control                            2655 which leads the heart that dizzy steep to climb where far over the world those vapours roll which blend two restless frames in one reposing soul 37 it is the shadow which doth float unseen but not unfelt oer blind mortality                                2660 whose divine darkness fled not from that green and lone recess where lapped in peace did lie our linked frames till from the changing sky that night and still another day had fled and then i saw and felt the moon was high                          2665 and clouds as of a coming storm were spread under its orbloud winds were gathering overhead  38 cythnas sweet lips seemed lurid in the moon her fairest limbs with the night wind were chill and her dark tresses were all loosely strewn                         2670 oer her pale bosomall within was still and the sweet peace of joy did almost fill the depth of her unfathomable look and we sate calmly though that rocky hill the waves contending in its caverns strook                          2675 for they foreknew the storm and the gray ruin shook  39 there we unheeding sate in the communion of interchanged vows which with a rite of faith most sweet and sacred stamped our union few were the living hearts which could unite                         2680 like ours or celebrate a bridal night with such close sympathies for they had sprung from linked youth and from the gentle might of earliest love delayed and cherished long which common hopes and fears made like a tempest strong           2685  40 and such is natures law divine that those who grow together cannot choose but love if faith or custom do not interpose or common slavery mar what else might move all gentlest thoughts as in the sacred grove                        2690 which shades the springs of ethiopian nile that living tree which if the arrowy dove strike with her shadow shrinks in fear awhile but its own kindred leaves clasps while the sunbeams smile  41 and clings to them when darkness may dissever                       2695 the close caresses of all duller plants which bloom on the wide earththus we for ever were linked for love had nursed us in the haunts where knowledge from its secret source enchants young hearts with the fresh music of its springing                  2700 ere yet its gathered flood feeds human wants as the great nile feeds egypt ever flinging light on the woven boughs which oer its waves are swinging  42 the tones of cythnas voice like echoes were of those far murmuring streams they rose and fell                  2705 mixed with mine own in the tempestuous air and so we sate until our talk befell of the late ruin swift and horrible and how those seeds of hope might yet be sown whose fruit is evils mortal poison well                           2710 for us this ruin made a watchtower lone but cythnas eyes looked faint and now two days were gone  43 since she had foodtherefore i did awaken the tartar steed who from his ebon mane soon as the clinging slumbers he had shaken                         2715 bent his thin head to seek the brazen rein following me obediently with pain of heart so deep and dread that one caress when lips and heart refuse to part again till they have told their fill could scarce express                 2720 the anguish of her mute and fearful tenderness  44 cythna beheld me part as i bestrode that willing steedthe tempest and the night which gave my path its safety as i rode down the ravine of rocks did soon unite                             2725 the darkness and the tumult of their might borne on all windsfar through the streaming rain floating at intervals the garments white of cythna gleamed and her voice once again came to me on the gust and soon i reached the plain                2730  45 i dreaded not the tempest nor did he who bore me but his eyeballs wide and red turned on the lightnings cleft exultingly and when the earth beneath his tameless tread shook with the sullen thunder he would spread                       2735 his nostrils to the blast and joyously mock the fierce peal with neighingsthus we sped oer the lit plain and soon i could descry where death and fire had gorged the spoil of victory  46 there was a desolate village in a wood                               2740 whose bloominwoven leaves now scattering fed the hungry storm it was a place of blood a heap of hearthless wallsthe flames were dead within those dwellings nowthe life had fled from all those corpses nowbut the wide sky                        2745 flooded with lightning was ribbed overhead by the black rafters and around did lie women and babes and men slaughtered confusedly  47 beside the fountain in the marketplace dismounting i beheld those corpses stare                            2750 with horny eyes upon each others face and on the earth and on the vacant air and upon me close to the waters where i stooped to slake my thirsti shrank to taste for the salt bitterness of blood was there                          2755 but tied the steed beside and sought in haste if any yet survived amid that ghastly waste  48 no living thing was there beside one woman whom i found wandering in the streets and she was withered from a likeness of aught human                          2760 into a fiend by some strange misery soon as she heard my steps she leaped on me and glued her burning lips to mine and laughed with a loud long and frantic laugh of glee and cried now mortal thou hast deeply quaffed                    2765 the plagues blue kissessoon millions shall pledge the draught  49 my name is pestilencethis bosom dry once fed two babesa sister and a brother when i came home one in the blood did lie of three deathwoundsthe flames had ate the other                 2770 since then i have no longer been a mother but i am pestilencehither and thither i flit about that i may slay and smother all lips which i have kissed must surely wither but deathsif thou art he well go to work together              2775  50 what seekst thou here the moonlight comes in flashes the dew is rising dankly from the dell twill moisten her and thou shalt see the gashes in my sweet boy now full of wormsbut tell first what thou seeksti seek for foodtis well           2780 thou shalt have food famine my paramour waits for us at the feastcruel and fell is famine but he drives not from his door those whom these lips have kissed alone no more no more  51 as thus she spake she grasped me with the strength                  2785 of madness and by many a ruined hearth she led and over many a corpseat length we came to a lone hut where on the earth which made its floor she in her ghastly mirth gathering from all those homes now desolate                         2790 had piled three heaps of loaves making a dearth among the deadround which she set in state a ring of cold stiff babes silent and stark they sate  52 she leaped upon a pile and lifted high her mad looks to the lightning and cried eat                     2795 share the great feasttomorrow we must die and then she spurned the loaves with her pale feet towards her bloodless gueststhat sight to meet mine eyes and my heart ached and but that she who loved me did with absent looks defeat                           2800 despair i might have raved in sympathy but now i took the food that woman offered me  53 and vainly having with her madness striven if i might win her to return with me departed in the eastern beams of heaven                             2805 the lightning now grew pallidrapidly as by the shore of the tempestuous sea the dark steed bore me and the mountain gray soon echoed to his hoofs and i could see cythna among the rocks where she alway                              2810 had sate with anxious eyes fixed on the lingering day  54 and joy was ours to meet she was most pale famished and wet and weary so i cast my arms around her lest her steps should fail as to our home we went and thus embraced                           2815 her full heart seemed a deeper joy to taste than eer the prosperous know the steed behind trod peacefully along the mountain waste we reached our home ere morning could unbind nights latest veil and on our bridalcouch reclined               2820  55 her chilled heart having cherished in my bosom and sweetest kisses past we two did share our peaceful mealas an autumnal blossom which spreads its shrunk leaves in the sunny air after cold showers like rainbows woven there                       2825 thus in her lips and cheeks the vital spirit mantled and in her eyes an atmosphere of health and hope and sorrow languished near it and fear and all that dark despondence doth inherit   notes 2397 isle bradley who cps mariannes dream st 12 see note at end   canto 7  1 so we sate joyous as the morning ray                                 2830 which fed upon the wrecks of night and storm now lingering on the winds light airs did play among the dewy weeds the sun was warm and we sate linked in the inwoven charm of converse and caresses sweet and deep                             2835 speechless caresses talk that might disarm time though he wield the darts of death and sleep and those thrice mortal barbs in his own poison steep  2 i told her of my sufferings and my madness and how awakened from that dreamy mood                              2840 by libertys uprise the strength of gladness came to my spirit in my solitude and all that now i waswhile tears pursued each other down her fair and listening cheek fast as the thoughts which fed them like a flood                    2845 from sunbright dales and when i ceased to speak her accents soft and sweet the pausing air did wake  3 she told me a strange tale of strange endurance like broken memories of many a heart woven into one to which no firm assurance                          2850 so wild were they could her own faith impart she said that not a tear did dare to start from the swoln brain and that her thoughts were firm when from all mortal hope she did depart borne by those slaves across the oceans term                       2855 and that she reached the port without one fear infirm  4 one was she among many there the thralls of the cold tyrants cruel lust and they laughed mournfully in those polluted halls but she was calm and sad musing alway                               2860 on loftiest enterprise till on a day the tyrant heard her singing to her lute a wild and sad and spiritthrilling lay like winds that die in wastesone moment mute the evil thoughts it made which did his breast pollute             2865  5 even when he saw her wondrous loveliness one moment to great natures sacred power he bent and was no longer passionless but when he bade her to his secret bower be borne a loveless victim and she tore                            2870 her locks in agony and her words of flame and mightier looks availed not then he bore again his load of slavery and became a king a heartless beast a pageant and a name  6 she told me what a loathsome agony                                   2875 is that when selfishness mocks loves delight foul as in dreams most fearful imagery to dally with the mowing deadthat night all torture fear or horror made seem light which the soul dreams or knows and when the day                     2880 shone on her awful frenzy from the sight where like a spirit in fleshly chains she lay struggling aghast and pale the tyrant fled away  7 her madness was a beam of light a power which dawned through the rent soul and words it gave               2885 gestures and looks such as in whirlwinds bore which might not be withstoodwhence none could save all who approached their spherelike some calm wave vexed into whirlpools by the chasms beneath and sympathy made each attendant slave                               2890 fearless and free and they began to breathe deep curses like the voice of flames far underneath  8 the king felt pale upon his noonday throne at night two slaves he to her chamber sent one was a green and wrinkled eunuch grown                           2895 from human shape into an instrument of all things illdistorted bowed and bent the other was a wretch from infancy made dumb by poison who nought knew or meant but to obey from the fire isles came he                            2900 a diver lean and strong of omans coral sea  9 they bore her to a bark and the swift stroke of silent rowers clove the blue moonlight seas until upon their path the morning broke they anchored then where be there calm or breeze                  2905 the gloomiest of the drear symplegades shakes with the sleepless surgethe ethiop there wound his long arms around her and with knees like iron clasped her feet and plunged with her among the closing waves out of the boundless air                    2910  10 swift as an eagle stooping from the plain of morning light into some shadowy wood he plunged through the green silence of the main through many a cavern which the eternal flood had scooped as dark lairs for its monster brood                    2915 and among mighty shapes which fled in wonder and among mightier shadows which pursued his heels he wound until the dark rocks under he touched a golden chaina sound arose like thunder  11 a stunning clang of massive bolts redoubling                        2920 beneath the deepa burst of waters driven as from the roots of the sea raging and bubbling and in that roof of crags a space was riven through which there shone the emerald beams of heaven shot through the lines of many waves inwoven                        2925 like sunlight through acacia woods at even through which his way the diver having cloven passed like a spark sent up out of a burning oven  12 and then she said he laid me in a cave above the waters by that chasm of sea                              2930 a fountain round and vast in which the wave imprisoned boiled and leaped perpetually down which one moment resting he did flee winning the adverse depth that spacious cell like an hupaithric temple wide and high                             2935 whose aery dome is inaccessible was pierced with one round cleft through which the sunbeams fell  13 below the fountains brink was richly paven with the deeps wealth coral and pearl and sand like spangling gold and purple shells engraven                      2940 with mystic legends by no mortal hand left there when thronging to the moons command the gathering waves rent the hesperian gate of mountains and on such bright floor did stand columns and shapes like statues and the state                      2945 of kingless thrones which earth did in her heart create  14 the fiend of madness which had made its prey of my poor heart was lulled to sleep awhile there was an interval of many a day and a seaeagle brought me food the while                           2950 whose nest was built in that untrodden isle and who to be the gaoler had been taught of that strange dungeon as a friend whose smile like light and rest at morn and even is sought that wild bird was to me till madness misery brought               2955  15 the misery of a madness slow and creeping which made the earth seem fire the sea seem air and the white clouds of noon which oft were sleeping in the blue heaven so beautiful and fair like hosts of ghastly shadows hovering there                        2960 and the seaeagle looked a fiend who bore thy mangled limbs for foodthus all things were transformed into the agony which i wore even as a poisoned robe around my bosoms core  16 again i knew the day and night fast fleeing                        2965 the eagle and the fountain and the air another frenzy camethere seemed a being within mea strange load my heart did bear as if some living thing had made its lair even in the fountains of my lifea long                            2970 and wondrous vision wrought from my despair then grew like sweet reality among dim visionary woes an unreposing throng  17 methought i was about to be a mother month after month went by and still i dreamed                       2975 that we should soon be all to one another i and my child and still new pulses seemed to beat beside my heart and still i deemed there was a babe withinand when the rain of winter through the rifted cavern streamed                        2980 methought after a lapse of lingering pain i saw that lovely shape which near my heart had lain  18 it was a babe beautiful from its birth it was like thee dear love its eyes were thine its brow its lips and so upon the earth                            2985 it laid its fingers as now rest on mine thine own belovedtwas a dream divine even to remember how it fled how swift how utterly might make the heart repine though twas a dreamthen cythna did uplift                       2990 her looks on mine as if some doubt she sought to shift  19 a doubt which would not flee a tenderness of questioning grief a source of thronging tears which having passed as one whom sobs oppress she spoke yes in the wilderness of years                          2995 her memory aye like a green home appears she sucked her fill even at this breast sweet love for many months i had no mortal fears methought i felt her lips and breath approve it was a human thing which to my bosom clove                        3000  20 i watched the dawn of her first smiles and soon when zenith stars were trembling on the wave or when the beams of the invisible moon or sun from many a prism within the cave their gemborn shadows to the water gave                            3005 her looks would hunt them and with outspread hand from the swift lights which might that fountain pave she would mark one and laugh when that command slighting it lingered there and could not understand  21 methought her looks began to talk with me                          3010 and no articulate sounds but something sweet her lips would frameso sweet it could not be that it was meaningless her touch would meet mine and our pulses calmly flow and beat in response while we slept and on a day                             3015 when i was happiest in that strange retreat with heaps of golden shells we two did play both infants weaving wings for times perpetual way  22 ere night methought her waning eyes were grown weary with joy and tired with our delight                          3020 we on the earth like sister twins lay down on one fair mothers bosomfrom that night she fledlike those illusions clear and bright which dwell in lakes when the red moon on high pause ere it wakens tempestand her flight                        3025 though twas the death of brainless fantasy yet smote my lonesome heart more than all misery  23 it seemed that in the dreary night the diver who brought me thither came again and bore my child away i saw the waters quiver                              3030 when he so swiftly sunk as once before then morning cameit shone even as of yore but i was changedthe very life was gone out of my hearti wasted more and more day after day and sitting there alone                              3035 vexed the inconstant waves with my perpetual moan  24 i was no longer mad and yet methought my breasts were swoln and changedin every vein the blood stood still one moment while that thought was passingwith a gush of sickening pain                           3040 it ebbed even to its withered springs again when my wan eyes in stern resolve i turned from that most strange delusion which would fain have waked the dream for which my spirit yearned with more than human lovethen left it unreturned                 3045  25 so now my reason was restored to me i struggled with that dream which like a beast most fierce and beauteous in my memory had made its lair and on my heart did feast but all that cave and all its shapes possessed                      3050 by thoughts which could not fade renewed each one some smile some look some gesture which had blessed me heretofore i sitting there alone vexed the inconstant waves with my perpetual moan  26 time passed i know not whether months or years                    3055 for day nor night nor change of seasons made its note but thoughts and unavailing tears and i became at last even as a shade a smoke a cloud on which the winds have preyed till it be thin as air until one even                             3060 a nautilus upon the fountain played spreading his azure sail where breath of heaven descended not among the waves and whirlpools driven  27 and when the eagle came that lovely thing oaring with rosy feet its silver boat                               3065 fled near me as for shelter on slow wing the eagle hovering oer his prey did float but when he saw that i with fear did note his purpose proffering my own food to him the eager plumes subsided on his throat                            3070 he came where that bright child of sea did swim and oer it cast in peace his shadow broad and dim  28 this wakened me it gave me human strength and hope i know not whence or wherefore rose but i resumed my ancient powers at length                           3075 my spirit felt again like one of those like thine whose fate it is to make the woes of humankind their preywhat was this cave its deep foundation no firm purpose knows immutable resistless strong to save                               3080 like mind while yet it mocks the alldevouring grave  29 and where was laon might my heart be dead while that far dearer heart could move and be or whilst over the earth the pall was spread which i had sworn to rend i might be free                          3085 could i but win that friendly bird to me to bring me ropes and long in vain i sought by intercourse of mutual imagery of objects if such aid he could be taught but fruit and flowers and boughs yet never ropes he brought      3090  30 we live in our own world and mine was made from glorious fantasies of hope departed aye we are darkened with their floating shade or cast a lustre on themtime imparted such power to mei became fearlesshearted                         3095 my eye and voice grew firm calm was my mind and piercing like the morn now it has darted its lustre on all hidden things behind yon dim and fading clouds which load the weary wind  31 my mind became the book through which i grew                        3100 wise in all human wisdom and its cave which like a mine i rifled through and through to me the keeping of its secrets gave one mind the type of all the moveless wave whose calm reflects all moving things that are                      3105 necessity and love and life the grave and sympathy fountains of hope and fear justice and truth and time and the worlds natural sphere  32 and on the sand would i make signs to range these woofs as they were woven of my thought                      3110 clear elemental shapes whose smallest change a subtler language within language wrought the key of truths which once were dimly taught in old crotonaand sweet melodies of love in that lorn solitude i caught                              3115 from mine own voice in dream when thy dear eyes shone through my sleep and did that utterance harmonize  33 thy songs were winds whereon i fled at will as in a winged chariot oer the plain of crystal youth and thou wert there to fill                        3120 my heart with joy and there we sate again on the gray margin of the glimmering main happy as then but wiser far for we smiled on the flowery grave in which were lain fear faith and slavery and mankind was free                       3125 equal and pure and wise in wisdoms prophecy  34 for to my will my fancies were as slaves to do their sweet and subtile ministries and oft from that bright fountains shadowy waves they would make human throngs gather and rise                        3130 to combat with my overflowing eyes and voice made deep with passionthus i grew familiar with the shock and the surprise and war of earthly minds from which i drew the power which has been mine to frame their thoughts anew          3135  35 and thus my prison was the populous earth where i saweven as misery dreams of morn before the east has given its glory birth religions pomp made desolate by the scorn of wisdoms faintest smile and thrones uptorn                      3140 and dwellings of mild people interspersed with undivided fields of ripening corn and love made freea hope which we have nursed even with our blood and tearsuntil its glory burst  36 all is not lost there is some recompense                           3145 for hope whose fountain can be thus profound even throned evils splendid impotence girt by its hell of power the secret sound of hymns to truth and freedomthe dread bound of life and death passed fearlessly and well                        3150 dungeons wherein the high resolve is found racks which degraded womans greatness tell and what may else be good and irresistible  37 such are the thoughts which like the fires that flare in stormencompassed isles we cherish yet                           3155 in this dark ruinsuch were mine even there as in its sleep some odorous violet while yet its leaves with nightly dews are wet breathes in prophetic dreams of days uprise or as ere scythian frost in fear has met                            3160 springs messengers descending from the skies the buds foreknow their lifethis hope must ever rise  38 so years had passed when sudden earthquake rent the depth of ocean and the cavern cracked with sound as if the worlds wide continent                         3165 had fallen in universal ruin wracked and through the cleft streamed in one cataract the stifling waterswhen i woke the flood whose banded waves that crystal cave had sacked was ebbing round me and my bright abode                             3170 before me yawneda chasm desert and bare and broad  39 above me was the sky beneath the sea i stood upon a point of shattered stone and heard loose rocks rushing tumultuously with splash and shock into the deepanon                            3175 all ceased and there was silence wide and lone i felt that i was free the oceanspray quivered beneath my feet the broad heaven shone around and in my hair the winds did play lingering as they pursued their unimpeded way                       3180  40 my spirit moved upon the sea like wind which round some thymy cape will lag and hover though it can wake the still cloud and unbind the strength of tempest day was almost over when through the fading light i could discover                       3185 a ship approachingits white sails were fed with the north windits moving shade did cover the twilight deep the mariners in dread cast anchor when they saw new rocks around them spread  41 and when they saw one sitting on a crag                            3190 they sent a boat to methe sailors rowed in awe through many a new and fearful jag of overhanging rock through which there flowed the foam of streams that cannot make abode they came and questioned me but when they heard                     3195 my voice they became silent and they stood and moved as men in whom new love had stirred deep thoughts so to the ship we passed without a word   notes 2877 dreams edition 1818 2994 opprest edition 1818 3115 lone solitude edition 1818

   3210 by wicked ghosts a phantom of the dead the night before we sailed came to my bed in dream like that the pilot then replied it cannot beshe is a human maid her low voice makes you weepshe is some bride                     3215 or daughter of high birthshe can be nought beside  3 we passed the islets borne by wind and stream and as we sailed the mariners came near and thronged around to listenin the gleam of the pale moon i stood as one whom fear                           3220 may not attaint and my calm voice did rear ye are all humanyon broad moon gives light to millions who the

their hearts his den  21 yes it is hate that shapeless fiendly thing of many names all evil some divine                                3380 whom selfcontempt arms with a mortal sting which when the heart its snaky folds entwine is wasted quite and when it doth repine to gorge such bitter prey on all beside it turns with ninefold rage as with its twine                       3385 when amphisbaena some fair bird has tied soon oer the putrid mass he threats on every side  22 reproach not thine own soul but know thyself nor hate anothers crime nor loathe thine own it is the dark idolatry of self

wearily oer the boundless deep we sailthou readest well the misery told in these faded eyes but much doth sleep                        3400 within which there the poor heart loves to keep or dare not write on the dishonoured brow even from our childhood have we learned to steep the bread of slavery in the tears of woe and never dreamed of hope or refuge until now                       3405  24 yesi must speakmy secret should have perished even with the heart it wasted as a brand fades in the dying flame whose life it cherished but that no human bosom can withstand thee wondrous lady and the mild command                            3410 of thy keen eyesyes we are wretched slaves who from their wonted loves and native land are reft and bear oer the dividing waves the unregarded prey of calm and happy graves  25 we drag afar from pastoral vales the fairest                       3415 among the daughters of those mountains lone we drag them there where all things best and rarest are stained and trampledyears have come and gone since like the ship which bears me i have known no thoughtbut now the eyes of one dear maid                       3420 on mine with light of mutual love have shone she is my lifei am but as the shade of hera smoke sent up from ashes soon to fade  26 for she must perish in the tyrants hall alas alashe ceased and by the sail                             3425 sate coweringbut his sobs were heard by all and still before the ocean and the gale the ship fled fast till the stars gan to fail and round me gathered with mute countenance the seamen gazed the pilot worn and pale                           3430 with toil the captain with gray locks whose glance met mine in restless awethey stood as in a trance  27 recede not pause not now thou art grown old but hope

we swear  28 the very darkness shook as with a blast of subterranean thunder at the cry the hollow shore its thousand echoes cast into the night as if the sea and sky                               3445 and earth rejoiced with newborn liberty for in that name they swore bolts were undrawn and on the deck with unaccustomed eye the captives gazing stood and every one shrank as the inconstant torch upon her countenance shone           3450  29 they were earths purest children young and fair with eyes the shrines of unawakened thought and brows as bright as spring or morning ere dark time had there its evil legend wrought in characters of cloud which wither not                           3455 the change was like a dream to them but soon they knew the glory of their altered lot in the bright wisdom of youths breathless noon sweet talk and smiles and sighs all bosoms did attune  30 but one was mute her cheeks and lips most fair                    3460 changing their hue like lilies newly blown beneath a bright acacias shadowy hair waved by the wind amid the sunny noon showed that her soul was quivering and full soon that youth arose and breathlessly did look                          3465 on her and me as for some speechless boon i smiled and both their hands in mine i took and felt a soft delight from what their spirits shook   canto 9  1 that night we anchored in a woody bay and sleep no more around us dared to hover                           3470 than when all doubt and fear has passed away it shades the couch of some unresting lover whose heart is now at rest thus night passed over in mutual joyaround a forest grew of poplars and dark oaks whose shade did cover                      3475 the waning stars pranked in the waters blue and trembled in the wind which from the morning flew  2 the joyous mariners and each free maiden now brought from the deep forest many a bough with woodland spoil most innocently laden                           3480 soon wreaths of budding foliage seemed to flow over the mast and sails the stern and prow were canopied with blooming boughsthe while on the slant suns path oer the waves we go rejoicing like the dwellers of an isle                              3485 doomed to pursue those waves that cannot cease to smile  3 the many ships spotting the dark blue deep with snowy sails fled fast as ours came nigh in fear and wonder and on every steep thousands did gaze they heard the startling cry                    3490 like earths own voice lifted unconquerably to all her children the unbounded mirth the glorious joy of thy nameliberty they heardas oer the mountains of the earth from peak to peak leap on the beams of mornings birth              3495  4 so from that cry over the boundless hills sudden was caught one universal sound like a volcanos voice whose thunder fills remotest skiessuch glorious madness found a path through human hearts with stream which drowned                3500 its struggling fears and cares dark customs brood they knew not whence it came but felt around a wide contagion pouredthey called aloud on libertythat name lived on the sunny flood  5 we reached the portalas from many spirits                       3505 the wisdom which had waked that cry was fled like the brief glory which dark heaven inherits from the false dawn which fades ere it is spread upon the nights devouring darkness shed yet soon bright day will bursteven like a chasm                    3510 of fire to burn the shrouds outworn and dead which wrap the world a wide enthusiasm to cleanse the fevered world as with an earthquakes spasm  6 i walked through the great city then but free from shame or fear those toilworn mariners                         3515 and happy maidens did encompass me and like a subterranean wind that stirs some forest among caves the hopes and fears from every human soul a murmur strange made as i passed and many wept with tears                          3520 of joy and awe and winged thoughts did range and halfextinguished words which prophesied of change  7 for with strong speech i tore the veil that hid nature and truth and liberty and love as one who from some mountains pyramid                              3525 points to the unrisen sunthe shades approve his truth and flee from every stream and grove thus gentle thoughts did many a bosom fill wisdom the mail of tried affections wove for many a heart and tameless scorn of ill                         3530 thrice steeped in molten steel the unconquerable will  8 some said i was a maniac wild and lost some that i scarce had risen from the grave the prophets virgin bride a heavenly ghost some said i was a fiend from my weird cave                         3535 who had stolen human shape and oer the wave the forest and the mountain camesome said i was the child of god sent down to save woman from bonds and death and on my head the burden of their sins would frightfully be laid                  3540  9 but soon my human words found sympathy in human hearts the purest and the best as friend with friend made common cause with me and they were few but resolutethe rest ere yet success the enterprise had blessed                          3545 leagued with me in their heartstheir meals their slumber their hourly occupations were possessed by hopes which i had armed to overnumber those hosts of meaner cares which lifes strong wings encumber  10 but chiefly women whom my voice did waken                          3550 from their cold careless willing slavery sought me one truth their dreary prison has shaken they looked around and lo they became free their many tyrants sitting desolately in slavedeserted halls could none restrain                        3555 for wraths red fire had withered in the eye whose lightning once was deathnor fear nor gain could tempt one captive now to lock anothers chain  11 those who were sent to bind me wept and felt their minds outsoar the bonds which clasped them round              3560 even as a waxen shape may waste and melt in the white furnace and a visioned swound a pause of hope and awe the city bound which like the silence of a tempests birth when in its awful shadow it has wound                                3565 the sun the wind the ocean and the earth hung terrible ere yet the lightnings have leaped forth  12 like clouds inwoven in the silent sky by winds from distant regions meeting there in the high name of truth and liberty                               3570 around the city millions gathered were by hopes which sprang from many a hidden lair words which the lore of truth in hues of flame arrayed thine own wild songs which in the air like homeless odours floated and the name                           3575 of thee and many a tongue which thou hadst dipped in flame  13 the tyrant knew his power was gone but fear the nurse of vengeance bade him wait the event that perfidy and custom gold and prayer and whatsoeer when force is impotent                              3580 to fraud the sceptre of the world has lent might as he judged confirm his failing sway therefore throughout the streets the priests he sent to curse the rebelsto their gods did they for earthquake plague and want kneel in the public way           3585  14 and grave and hoary men were bribed to tell from seats where law is made the slave of wrong how glorious athens in her splendour fell because her sons were freeand that among mankind the many to the few belong                                 3590 by heaven and nature and necessity they said that age was truth and that the young marred with wild hopes the peace of slavery with which old times and men had quelled the vain and free  15 and with the falsehood of their poisonous lips                      3595 they breathed on the enduring memory of sages and of bards a brief eclipse there was one teacher who necessity had armed with strength and wrong against mankind his slave and his avenger aye to be                                 3600 that we were weak and sinful frail and blind and that the will of one was peace and we should seek for nought on earth but toil and misery  16 for thus we might avoid the hell hereafter so spake the hypocrites who cursed and lied                        3605 alas their sway was past and tears and laughter clung to their hoary hair withering the pride which in their hollow hearts dared still abide and yet obscener slaves with smoother brow and sneers on their strait lips thin blue and wide                3610 said that the rule of men was over now and hence the subject world to womans will must bow  17 and gold was scattered through the streets and wine flowed at a hundred feasts within the wall in vain the steady towers in heaven did shine                       3615 as they were wont nor at the priestly call left plague her banquet in the ethiops hall nor famine from the rich mans portal came where at her ease she ever preys on all who throng to kneel for food nor fear nor shame                    3620 nor faith nor discord dimmed hopes newly kindled flame  18 for gold was as a god whose faith began to fade so that its worshippers were few and faith itself which in the heart of man gives shape voice name to spectral terror knew                   3625 its downfall as the altars lonelier grew till the priests stood alone within the fane the shafts of falsehood unpolluting flew and the cold sneers of calumny were vain the union of the free with discords brand to stain                 3630  19 the rest thou knowestlo we two are here we have survived a ruin wide and deep strange thoughts are minei cannot grieve or fear sitting with thee upon this lonely steep i smile though human love should make me weep                      3635 we have survived a joy that knows no sorrow and i do feel a mighty calmness creep over my heart which can no longer borrow its hues from chance or change dark children of tomorrow  20 we know not what will comeyet laon dearest                     3640 cythna shall be the prophetess of love her lips shall rob thee of the grace thou wearest to hide thy heart and clothe the shapes which rove within the homeless futures wintry grove for i now sitting thus beside thee seem                            3645 even with thy breath and blood to live and move and violence and wrong are as a dream which rolls from steadfast truth an unreturning stream  21 the blasts of autumn drive the winged seeds over the earthnext come the snows and rain                      3650 and frosts and storms which dreary winter leads out of his scythian cave a savage train behold spring sweeps over the world again shedding soft dews from her ethereal wings flowers on the mountains fruits over the plain                     3655 and music on the waves and woods she flings and love on all that lives and calm on lifeless things  22 o spring of hope and love and youth and gladness windwinged emblem brightest best and fairest whence comest thou when with dark winters sadness                 3660 the tears that fade in sunny smiles thou sharest sister of joy thou art the child who wearest thy mothers dying smile tender and sweet thy mother autumn for whose grave thou bearest fresh flowers and beams like flowers with gentle feet             3665 disturbing not the leaves which are her windingsheet  23 virtue and hope and love like light and heaven surround the worldwe are their chosen slaves has not the whirlwind of our spirit driven truths deathless germs to thoughts remotest caves                 3670 lo winter comesthe grief of many graves the frost of death the tempest of the sword the flood of tyranny whose sanguine waves stagnate like ice at faith the enchanters word and bind all human hearts in its repose abhorred                    3675  24 the seeds are sleeping in the soil meanwhile the tyrant peoples dungeons with his prey pale victims on the guarded scaffold smile because they cannot speak and day by day the moon of wasting science wanes away                               3680 among her stars and in that darkness vast the sons of earth to their foul idols pray and gray priests triumph and like blight or blast a shade of selfish care oer human looks is cast  25 this is the winter of the worldand here                          3685 we die even as the winds of autumn fade expiring in the frore and foggy air behold spring comes though we must pass who made the promise of its birtheven as the shade which from our death as from a mountain flings                     3690 the future a broad sunrise thus arrayed as with the plumes of overshadowing wings from its dark gulf of chains earth like an eagle springs  26 o dearest love we shall be dead and cold before this morn may on the world arise                             3695 wouldst thou the glory of its dawn behold alas gaze not on me but turn thine eyes on thine own heartit is a paradise which everlasting spring has made its own and while drear winter fills the naked skies                        3700 sweet streams of sunny thought and flowers freshblown are there and weave their sounds and odours into one  27 in their own hearts the earnest of the hope which made them great the good will ever find and though some envious shade may interlope                          3705 between the effect and it one comes behind who aye the future to the past will bind necessity whose sightless strength for ever evil with evil good with good must wind in bands of union which no power may sever                         3710 they must bring forth their kind and be divided never  28 the good and mighty of departed ages are in their graves the innocent and free heroes and poets and prevailing sages who leave the vesture of their majesty                               3715 to adorn and clothe this naked worldand we are like to themsuch perish but they leave all hope or love or truth or liberty whose forms their mighty spirits could conceive to be a rule and law to ages that survive                           3720  29 so be the turf heaped over our remains even in our happy youth and that strange lot whateer it be when in these mingling veins the blood is still be ours let sense and thought pass from our being or be numbered not                              3725 among the things that are let those who come behind for whom our steadfast will has bought a calm inheritance a glorious doom insult with careless tread our undivided tomb  30 our many thoughts and deeds our life and love                     3730 our happiness and all that we have been immortally must live and burn and move when we shall be no morethe world has seen a type of peace andas some most serene and lovely spot to a poor maniacs eye                              3735 after long years some sweet and moving scene of youthful hope returning suddenly quells his long madnessthus man shall remember thee  31 and calumny meanwhile shall feed on us as worms devour the dead and near the throne                        3740 and at the altar most accepted thus shall sneers and curses bewhat we have done none shall dare vouch though it be truly known that record shall remain when they must pass who built their pride on its oblivion                               3745 and fame in human hope which sculptured was survive the perished scrolls of unenduring brass  32 the while we two beloved must depart and sense and reason those enchanters fair whose wand of power is hope would bid the heart                     3750 that gazed beyond the wormy grave despair these eyes these lips this blood seems darkly there to fade in hideous ruin no calm sleep peopling with golden dreams

most soothing song out of her ivy bower when i sate pale                               3805 with grief and sighed beneath from many a dale the antelopes who flocked for food have spoken with happy sounds and motions that avail like mans own speech and such was now the token of waning night whose calm by that proud neigh was broken          3810  3 each night that mighty steed bore me abroad and i returned with food to our retreat and dark intelligence the blood which flowed over the fields had stained the coursers feet soon the dust drinks that bitter dewthen meet                     3815 the vulture and the wild dog and the snake the wolf and the hyaena gray and eat the dead in horrid truce their throngs did make behind the steed a chasm like waves in a ships wake  4 for from the utmost realms of earth came pouring                    3820 the banded slaves whom every despot sent at that throned traitors summons like the roaring of fire whose floods the wild deer circumvent in the scorched pastures of the south so bent the armies of the leagued kings around                               3825 their files of steel and flamethe continent trembled as with a zone of ruin bound beneath their feet the sea shook with their navies sound  5 from every nation of the earth they came the multitude of moving heartless things                            3830 whom slaves call men obediently they came like sheep whom from the fold the shepherd brings to the stall red with blood their many kings led them thus erring from their native land tartar and frank and millions whom the wings                        3835 of indian breezes lull and many a band the arctic anarch sent and idumeas sand  6 fertile in prodigies and liesso there strange natures made a brotherhood of ill the

smiles of wondering joy his face would fill and savage sympathy those slaves impure                            3845 each one the other thus from ill to ill did lure  7 for traitorously did that foul

and gold and glory shall be hisgo forth they rushed into the plainloud was the roar of their career the horsemen shook the earth                       3885 the wheeled artillerys speed the pavement tore the infantry file after file did pour their clouds on the utmost hills five days they slew among the wasted fields the sixth saw gore stream through the city on the seventh the dew                     3890 of slaughter became stiff and there was peace anew  12 peace in the desert fields and villages between the glutted beasts and mangled dead peace in the silent streets save when the cries of victims to their fiery judgement led                             3895 made pale their voiceless lips who seemed to dread even in their dearest kindred lest some tongue be faithless to the fear yet unbetrayed peace in the tyrants palace where the throng waste the triumphal hours in festival and song                      3900  13 day after day the burning sun rolled on over the deathpolluted landit came out of the east like fire and fiercely shone a lamp of autumn ripening with its flame the few lone ears of cornthe sky became                           3905 stagnate with heat so that each cloud and blast languished and diedthe thirsting air did claim all moisture and a rotting vapour passed from the unburied dead invisible and fast  14 first want then plague came on the beasts their food               3910 failed and they drew the breath of its decay millions on millions whom the scent of blood had lured or who from regions far away had tracked the hosts in festival array from their dark deserts gaunt and wasting now                      3915 stalked like fell shades among their perished prey in their green eyes a strange disease did glow they sank in hideous spasm or pains severe and slow  15 the fish were poisoned in the streams the birds in the green woods perished the insect race                         3920 was withered up the scattered flocks and herds who had survived the wild beasts hungry chase died moaning each upon the others face in helpless agony gazing round the city all night the lean hyaenas their sad case                           3925 like starving infants wailed a woeful ditty and many a mother wept pierced with unnatural pity  16 amid the aereal minarets on high the ethiopian vultures fluttering fell from their long line of brethren in the sky                         3930 startling the concourse of mankindtoo well these signs the coming mischief did foretell strange panic first a deep and sickening dread within each heart like ice did sink and dwell a voiceless thought of evil which did spread                        3935 with the quick glance of eyes like withering lightnings shed  17 day after day when the year wanes the frosts strip its green crown of leaves till all is bare so on those strange and congregated hosts came famine a swift shadow and the air                             3940 groaned with the burden of a new despair famine than whom misrule no deadlier daughter feeds from her thousand breasts though sleeping there with lidless eyes lie faith and plague and slaughter a ghastly brood conceived of lethes sullen water                  3945  18 there was no food the corn was trampled down the flocks and herds had perished on the shore the dead and putrid fish were ever thrown the deeps were foodless and the winds no more creaked with the weight of birds but as before                     3950 those winged things sprang forth were void of shade the vines and orchards autumns golden store were burnedso that the meanest food was weighed with gold and avarice died before the god it made  19 there was no cornin the wide marketplace                          3955 all loathliest things even human flesh was sold they weighed it in small scalesand many a face was fixed in eager horror then his gold the miser brought the tender maid grown bold through hunger bared her scorned charms in vain                    3960 the mother brought her eldest born controlled by instinct blind as love but turned again and bade her infant suck and died in silent pain  20 then fell blue plague upon the race of man o for the sheathed steel so late which gave                       3965 oblivion to the dead when the streets ran with brothers blood o that the earthquakes grave would gape or ocean lift its stifling wave vain criesthroughout the streets thousands pursued each by his fiery torture howl and rave                             3970 or sit in frenzys unimagined mood upon fresh heaps of dead a ghastly multitude  21 it was not hunger now but thirst each well was choked with rotting corpses and became a cauldron of green mist made visible                                3975 at sunrise thither still the myriads came seeking to quench the agony of the flame which raged like poison through their bursting veins naked they were from torture without shame spotted with nameless scars and lurid blains                        3980 childhood and youth and age writhing in savage pains  22 it was not thirst but madness many saw their own lean image everywhere it went a ghastlier self beside them till the awe of that dread sight to selfdestruction sent                         3985 those shrieking victims some ere life was spent sought with a horrid sympathy to shed contagion on the sound and others rent their matted hair and cried aloud we tread on fire the avenging power his hell on earth has spread           3990  23 sometimes the living by the dead were hid near the great fountain in the public square where corpses made a crumbling pyramid under the sun was heard one stifled prayer for life in the hot silence of the air                             3995 and strange twas amid that hideous heap to see some shrouded in their long and golden hair as if not dead but slumbering quietly like forms which sculptors carve then love to agony  24 famine had spared the palace of the king                          4000 he rioted in festival the while he and his guards and priests but plague did fling one shadow upon all famine can smile on him who brings it food and pass with guile of thankful falsehood like a courtier gray                         4005 the housedog of the throne but many a mile comes plague a winged wolf who loathes alway the garbage and the scum that strangers make her prey  25 so near the throne amid the gorgeous feast sheathed in resplendent arms or loosely dight                       4010 to luxury ere the mockery yet had ceased that lingered on his lips the warriors might was loosened and a new and ghastlier night in dreams of frenzy lapped his eyes he fell headlong or with stiff eyeballs sate upright                        4015 among the guests or raving mad did tell strange truths a dying seer of dark oppressions hell  26 the princes and the priests were pale with terror that monstrous faith wherewith they ruled mankind fell like a shaft loosed by the bowmans error                     4020 on their own hearts they sought and they could find no refugetwas the blind who led the blind so through the desolate streets to the high fane the manytongued and endless armies wind in sad procession each among the train                              4025 to his own idol lifts his supplications vain  27 o god they cried we know our secret pride has scorned thee and thy worship and thy name secure in human power we have defied thy fearful might we bend in fear and shame                         4030 before thy presence with the dust we claim kindred be merciful o king of heaven most justly have we suffered for thy fame made dim but be at length our sins forgiven ere to despair and death thy worshippers be driven                  4035  28 o king of glory thou alone hast power who can resist thy will who can restrain thy wrath when on the guilty thou dost shower the shafts of thy revenge a blistering rain greatest and best be merciful again                                4040 have we not stabbed thine enemies and made the earth an altar and the heavens a fane where thou wert worshipped with their blood and laid those hearts in dust which would thy searchless works have weighed  29 well didst thou loosen on this impious city                         4045 thine angels of revenge recall them now thy worshippers abased here kneel for pity and bind their souls by an immortal vow we swear by thee and to our oath do thou give sanction from thine hell of fiends and flame                  4050 that we will kill with fire and torments slow the last of those who mocked thy holy name and scorned the sacred laws thy prophets did proclaim  30 thus they with trembling limbs and pallid lips worshipped their own hearts image dim and vast                    4055 scared by the shade wherewith they would eclipse the light of other mindstroubled they passed from the great templefiercely still and fast the arrows of the plague among them fell and they on one another gazed aghast                                4060 and through the hosts contention wild befell as each of his own god the wondrous works did tell  31 and oromaze joshua and mahomet moses and buddh zerdusht and brahm and foh a tumult of strange names which never met                           4065 before as watchwords of a single woe arose each raging votary gan to throw aloft his armed hands and each did howl our god alone is godand slaughter now would have gone forth when from beneath a cowl                      4070 a voice came forth which pierced like ice through every soul  32 twas an iberian priest from whom it came a zealous man who led the legioned west with words which faith and pride had steeped in flame to quell the unbelievers a dire guest                               4075 even to his friends was he for in his breast did hate and guile lie watchful intertwined twin serpents in one deep and winding nest he loathed all faith beside his own and pined to wreak his fear of heaven in vengeance on mankind                 4080  33 but more he loathed and hated the clear light of wisdom and free thought and more did fear lest kindled once its beams might pierce the night even where his idol stood for far and near did many a heart in europe leap to hear                              4085 that faith and tyranny were trampled down many a pale victim doomed for truth to share the murderers cell or see with helpless groan the priests his children drag for slaves to serve their own  34 he dared not kill the infidels with fire                             4090 or steel in europe the slow agonies of legal torture mocked his keen desire so he made truce with those who did despise the expiation and the sacrifice that though detested islams kindred creed                         4095 might crush for him those deadlier enemies for fear of god did in his bosom breed a jealous hate of man an unreposing need  35 peace peace he cried when we are dead the day of judgement comes and all shall surely know                        4100 whose god is god each fearfully shall pay the errors of his faith in endless woe but there is sent a mortal vengeance now on earth because an impious race had spurned him whom we all adorea subtle foe                                4105 by whom for ye this dread reward was earned and kingly thrones which rest on faith nigh overturned  36 think ye because ye weep and kneel and pray that god will lull the pestilence it rose even from beneath his throne where many a day                     4110 his mercy soothed it to a dark repose it walks upon the earth to judge his foes and what are thou and i that he should deign to curb his ghastly minister or close the gates of death ere they receive the twain                       4115 who shook with mortal spells his undefended reign  37 ay there is famine in the gulf of hell its giant worms of fire for ever yawn their lurid eyes are on us those who fell by the swift shafts of pestilence ere dawn                          4120 are in their jaws they hunger for the spawn of satan their own brethren who were sent to make our souls their spoil see see they fawn

now a forests spoil of boughs and on the heap pour venomous gums which sullenly and slow when touched by flame shall burn and melt and flow               4130 a stream of clinging fireand fix on high a net of iron and spread forth below a couch of snakes and scorpions and the fry of centipedes and worms earths hellish progeny  39 let laon and laone on that pyre                                    4135 linked tight with burning brass perishthen pray that with this sacrifice the withering ire of heaven may be appeased he ceased and they a space stood silent as far far away the echoes of his voice among them died                             4140 and he knelt down upon the dust alway muttering the curses of his speechless pride whilst shame and fear and awe the armies did divide  40 his voice was like a blast that burst the portal of fabled hell and as he spake each one                            4145 saw gape beneath the chasms of fire immortal and heaven above seemed cloven where on a throne girt round with storms and shadows sate alone their king and judgefear killed in every breast all natural pity then a fear unknown                                4150 before and with an inward fire possessed they raged like homeless beasts whom burning woods invest  41 twas mornat noon the public crier went forth proclaiming through the living and the dead the monarch saith that his

forth the maniac multitude to rear this pyramidtottering and slow plaguestricken foodless like lean herds pursued by gadflies they have piled the heath and gums and wood          4170  43 night came a starless and a moonless gloom until the dawn those hosts of many a nation stood round that pile as near one lovers tomb two gentle sisters mourn their desolation and in the silence of that expectation                              4175 was heard on high the reptiles hiss and crawl it was so deepsave when the devastation of the swift pest with fearful interval marking its path with shrieks among the crowd would fall  44 morn cameamong those sleepless multitudes                        4180 madness and fear and plague and famine still heaped corpse on corpse as in autumnal woods the frosts of many a wind with dead leaves fill earths cold and sullen brooks in silence still the pale survivors stood ere noon the fear                         4185 of hell became a panic which did kill like hunger or disease with whispers drear as hush hark come they yetjust heaven thine hour is near  45 and priests rushed through their ranks some counterfeiting the rage they did inspire some mad indeed                           4190 with their own lies they said their god was waiting to see his enemies writhe and burn and bleed and that till then the snakes of hell had need of human soulsthree hundred furnaces soon blazed through the wide city where with speed                4195 men brought their infidel kindred to appease gods wrath and while they burned knelt round on quivering knees  46 the noontide sun was darkened with that smoke the winds of eve dispersed those ashes gray the madness which these rites had lulled awoke                      4200 again at sunsetwho shall dare to say the deeds which night and fear brought forth or weigh in balance just the good and evil there he might mans deep and searchless heart display and cast a light on those dim labyrinths where                      4205 hope near imagined chasms is struggling with despair  47 tis said a mother dragged three children then to those fierce flames which roast the eyes in the head and laughed and died and that unholy men feasting like fiends upon the infidel dead                          4210 looked from their meal and saw an angel tread the visible floor of heaven and it was she and on that night one without doubt or dread came to the fire and said stop i am he kill methey burned them both with hellish mockery               4215  48 and one by one that night young maidens came beauteous and calm like shapes of living stone clothed in the light of dreams and by the flame which shrank as overgorged they laid them down and sung a low sweet song of which alone                            4220 one word was heard and that was liberty and that some kissed their marble feet with moan like love and died and then that they did die with happy smiles which sunk in white tranquillity   notes 3834 native home edition

dropped many a spark                       4330 from its blue train and spreading widely clung to their wild hair like mist the topmost pines among  13 and many from the crowd collected there joined that strange dance in fearful sympathies there was the silence of a long despair                             4335 when the last echo of those terrible cries came from a distant street like agonies stifled afarbefore the tyrants throne all night his aged senate sate their eyes in stony expectation fixed when one                                 4340 sudden before them stood a stranger and alone  14 dark priests and haughty warriors gazed on him with baffled wonder for a hermits vest concealed his face but when he spake his tone ere yet the matter did their thoughts arrest

the long array of guards in golden arms and priests beside                        4460 singing their bloody hymns whose garbs betray the blackness of the faith it seems to hide and see the tyrants gemwrought chariot glide among the gloomy cowls and glittering spears a shape of light is sitting by his side                             4465 a child most beautiful i the midst appears laonexempt alone from mortal hopes and fears  3 his head and feet are bare his hands are bound behind with heavy chains yet none do wreak their scoffs on him though myriads throng around                   4470

love alone stood up before the king without avail                             4500 pleading for laons lifeher stifled groan was heardshe trembled like one aspen pale among the gloomy pines of a

can breed calm radiant like the phantom of the dawn                         4520 a spirit from the caves of daylight wandering gone  9 all thought it was gods angel come to sweep the lingering guilty to their fiery grave the tyrant from his throne in dread did leap her innocence his child from fear did save                          4525 scared by the faith they feigned each priestly slave knelt for his mercy whom they served with blood and like the refluence of a mighty wave sucked into the loud sea the multitude with crushing panic fled in terrors altered mood                  4530  10 they

thought the iberian priest indeed  11 and others too thought he was wise to see                         4540 in pain and fear and hate something divine in love and beauty no divinity now with a bitter smile whose light did shine like a fiends hope upon his lips and eyne he said and the persuasion of that sneer                            4545 rallied his trembling comradesis it mine to stand alone

                     4555 an infidel but for me she would have known another moments joy the glory be thine own  13 they trembled but replied not nor obeyed pausing in breathless silence cythna sprung from her gigantic steed who like a shade                           4560 chased by the winds those vacant streets among fled tameless as the brazen rein she flung upon his neck and kissed his mooned brow a piteous sight that one so fair and young the clasp of such a fearful death should woo                         4565 with smiles of tender joy as beamed from cythna now  14 the warm tears burst in spite of faith and fear from many a tremulous eye but like soft dews which feed springs earliest buds hung gathered there frozen by doubtalas they could not choose                        4570 but weep for when her faint limbs did refuse to climb the pyre upon the mutes she smiled and with her eloquent gestures and the hues of her quick lips even as a weary child wins sleep from some fond nurse with its caresses mild              4575  15 she won them though unwilling her to bind near me among the snakes when there had fled one soft reproach that was most thrilling kind she smiled on me and nothing then we said but each upon the others countenance fed                            4580 looks of insatiate love the mighty veil which doth divide the living and the dead was almost rent the world grew dim and pale all light in heaven or earth beside our love did fail  16 yetyetone brief relapse like the last beam                      4585 of dying flames the stainless air around hung silent and serenea bloodred gleam burst upwards hurling fiercely from the ground the globed smokei heard the mighty sound of its uprise like a tempestuous ocean                             4590 and through its chasms i saw as in a swound the tyrants child fall without life or motion before his throne subdued by some unseen emotion  17 and is this deaththe pyre has disappeared the pestilence the tyrant and the throng                          4595 the flames grow silentslowly there is heard the music of a breathsuspending song which like the kiss of love when life is young steeps the faint eyes in darkness sweet and deep with everchanging notes it floats along                            4600 till on my passive soul there seemed to creep a melody like waves on wrinkled sands that leap  18 the warm touch of a soft and tremulous hand wakened me then lo cythna sate reclined beside me on the waved and golden sand                              4605 of a clear pool upon a bank oertwined with strange and starbright flowers which to the wind breathed divine odour high above was spread the emerald heaven of trees of unknown kind whose moonlike blooms and bright fruit overhead                      4610 a shadow which was light upon the waters shed  19 and round about sloped many a lawny mountain with incensebearing forests and vast caves of marble radiance to that mighty fountain and where the flood its own bright margin laves                     4615 their echoes talk with its eternal waves which from the depths whose jagged caverns breed their unreposing strife it lifts and heaves till through a chasm of hills they roll and feed a river deep which flies with smooth but arrowy speed              4620  20 as we sate gazing in a trance of wonder a boat approached borne by the musical air along the waves which sung and sparkled under its rapid keela winged shape sate there a child with silvershining wings so fair                          4625 that as her bark did through the waters glide the shadow of the lingering waves did wear light as from starry beams from side to side while veering to the wind her plumes the bark did guide  21 the boat was one curved shell of hollow pearl                       4630 almost translucent with the light divine of her within the prow and stern did curl horned on high like the young moon supine when oer dim twilight mountains dark with pine it floats upon the sunsets sea of beams                            4635 whose golden waves in many a purple line fade fast till borne on sunlights ebbing streams dilating on

more sweet than happy love a wild and glad surprise glanced as she spake ay this is paradise and not a dream and we are all united lo that is mine own child who in the guise                         4645 of madness came like day to one benighted in lonesome woods my heart is now too well requited  23 and then she wept aloud and in her arms clasped that bright shape less marvellously fair than her own human hues and living charms                           4650 which as she leaned in passions silence there breathed warmth on the cold bosom of the air which seemed to blush and tremble with delight the glossy darkness of her streaming hair fell oer that snowy child and wrapped from sight                   4655 the fond and long embrace which did their hearts unite  24 then the bright child the plumed seraph came and fixed its blue and beaming eyes on mine and said i was disturbed by tremulous shame when once we met yet knew that i was thine                          4660 from the same hour in which thy lips divine kindled a clinging dream within my brain which ever waked when i might sleep to twine thine image with her memory dearagain we meet exempted now from mortal fear or pain                      4665  25 when the consuming flames had wrapped ye round the hope which i had cherished went away i fell in agony on the senseless ground and hid mine eyes in dust and far astray my mind was gone when bright like dawning day                     4670 the spectre of the plague before me flew and breathed upon my lips and seemed to say they wait for thee belovedthen i knew the deathmark on my breast and became calm anew  26 it was the calm of lovefor i was dying                           4675 i saw the black and halfextinguished pyre in its own gray and shrunken ashes lying the pitchy smoke of the departed fire still hung in many a hollow dome and spire above the towers like nightbeneath whose shade                   4680 awed by the ending of their own desire the armies stood a vacancy was made in expectations depth and so they stood dismayed  27 the frightful silence of that altered mood the tortures of the dying clove alone                               4685 till one uprose among the multitude and saidthe flood of time is rolling on we stand upon its brink whilst they are gone to glide in peace down deaths mysterious stream have ye done well they moulder flesh and bone                     4690 who might have made this lifes envenomed dream a sweeter draught than ye will ever taste i deem  28 these perish as the good and great of yore have perished and their murderers will repent yes vain and barren tears shall flow before                         4695 yon smoke has faded from the firmament even for this cause that ye who must lament the death of those that made this world so fair cannot recall them now but there is lent to man the wisdom of a high despair                                 4700 when such can die and he live on and linger here  29 ay ye may fear not now the pestilence from fabled hell as by a charm withdrawn all power and faith must pass since calmly hence in pain and fire have unbelievers gone                              4705 and ye must sadly turn away and moan in secret to his home each one returning and to long ages shall this hour be known and slowly shall its memory ever burning fill this dark night of things with an eternal morning              4710  30 for me that world is grown too void and cold since hope pursues immortal destiny with steps thus slowtherefore shall ye behold how those who love yet fear not dare to die tell to your children this then suddenly                           4715 he sheathed a dagger in his heart and fell my brain grew dark in death and yet to me there came a murmur from the crowd to tell of deep and mighty change which suddenly befell  31 then suddenly i stood a winged thought                            4720 before the immortal senate and the seat of that starshining

gossamer on the swift breath of morn the vessel flew                         4735 oer the bright whirlpools of that fountain fair whose shores receded fast while we seemed lingering there  33 till down that mighty stream dark calm and fleet between a chasm of cedarn mountains riven chased by the thronging winds whose viewless feet                    4740 as swift as twinkling beams had under heaven from woods and waves wild sounds and odours driven the boat fled visiblythree nights and days borne like a cloud through morn and noon and even we sailed along the winding watery ways                              4745 of the vast stream a long and labyrinthine maze  34 a scene of joy and wonder to behold that rivers shapes and shadows changing ever where the broad sunrise filled with deepening gold its whirlpools where all hues did spread and quiver                4750 and where melodious falls did burst and shiver among rocks clad with flowers the foam and spray sparkled like stars upon the sunny river or when the moonlight poured a holier day one vast and glittering lake around green islands lay               4755  35 morn noon and even that boat of pearl outran the

sometimes between the wide and flowering meadows                    4765 mile after mile we sailed and twas delight to see far off the sunbeams chase the shadows over the grass sometimes beneath the night of wide and vaulted caves whose roofs were bright with starry gems we fled whilst from their deep                    4770 and darkgreen chasms shades beautiful and white amid sweet sounds across our path would sweep like swift and lovely dreams that walk the waves of sleep  37 and ever as we sailed our minds were full of love and wisdom which would overflow                             4775 in converse wild and sweet and wonderful and in quick smiles whose light would come and go like music oer wide waves and in the flow of sudden tears and in the mute caress for a deep shade was cleft and

remarkable qualities of intellecta brilliant imagination and a logical exactness of reason his inclinations led him he fancied almost alike to poetry and metaphysical discussions i say he fancied because i believe the former to have been paramount and that it would have gained the mastery even had he struggled against it however he said that he deliberated at one time whether he should dedicate himself to poetry or metaphysics and resolving on the former he educated himself for it discarding in a great measure his philosophical pursuits and engaging himself in the study of the poets of greece italy and england to these may be added a constant perusal of portions of the old testamentthe psalms the book of job the prophet isaiah and others the sublime poetry of which filled him with delight  as a poet his intellect and compositions were powerfully influenced by exterior circumstances and especially by his place of abode he was very fond of travelling and illhealth increased this restlessness the sufferings occasioned by a cold english winter made him pine especially when our colder spring arrived for a more genial climate in 1816 he again visited switzerland and rented a house on the banks of the lake of geneva and many a day in cloud or sunshine was passed alone in his boatsailing as the wind listed or weltering on the calm waters the majestic aspect of nature ministered such thoughts as he afterwards enwove in verse his lines on the bridge of the arve and his hymn to intellectual beauty were written at this time perhaps during this summer his genius was checked by association with another poet whose nature was utterly dissimilar to his own yet who in the poem he wrote at that time gave tokens that he shared for a period the more abstract and etherealised inspiration of shelley the saddest events awaited his return to england but such was his fear to wound the feelings of others that he never expressed the anguish he felt and seldom gave vent to the indignation roused by the persecutions he underwent while the course of deep unexpressed passion and the sense of injury engendered the desire to embody themselves in forms defecated of all the weakness and evil which cling to real life  he chose therefore for his hero a youth nourished in dreams of liberty some of whose actions are in direct opposition to the opinions of the world but who is animated throughout by an ardent love of virtue and a resolution to confer the boons of political and intellectual freedom on his fellowcreatures he created for this youth a woman such as he delighted to imaginefull of enthusiasm for the same objects and they both with will unvanquished and the deepest sense of the justice of their cause met adversity and death there exists in this poem a memorial of a friend of his youth the character of the old man who liberates laon from his tower prison and tends on him in sickness is founded on that of doctor lind who when shelley was at eton had often stood by to befriend and support him and whose name he never mentioned without love and veneration  during the year 1817 we were established at marlow in buckinghamshire shelleys choice of abode was fixed chiefly by this town being at no great distance from london and its neighbourhood to the thames the poem was written in his boat as it floated under the beech groves of bisham or during wanderings in the neighbouring country which is distinguished for peculiar beauty the chalk hills break into cliffs that overhang the thames or form valleys clothed with beech the wilder portion of the country is rendered beautiful by exuberant vegetation and the cultivated part is peculiarly fertile with all this wealth of nature which either in the form of gentlemens parks or soil dedicated to agriculture flourishes around marlow was inhabited i hope it is altered now by a very poor population the women are lacemakers and lose their health by sedentary labour for which they were very ill paid the poorlaws ground to the dust not only the paupers but those who had risen just above that state and were obliged to pay poorrates the changes produced by peace following a long war and a bad harvest brought with them the most heartrending evils to the poor shelley afforded what alleviation he could in the winter while bringing out his poem he had a severe attack of ophthalmia caught while visiting the poor cottages i mention these thingsfor this minute and active sympathy with his fellowcreatures gives a thousandfold interest to his speculations and stamps with reality his pleadings for the human race  the poem bold in its opinions and uncompromising in their expression met with many censurers not only among those who allow of no virtue but such as supports the cause they espouse but even among those whose opinions were similar to his own i extract a portion of a letter written in answer to one of these friends it best details the impulses of shelleys mind and his motives it was written with entire unreserve and is therefore a precious monument of his own opinion of his powers of the purity of his designs and the ardour with which he clung in adversity and through the valley of the shadow of death to views from which he believed the permanent happiness of mankind must eventually spring  marlowe december 11 1817  i have read and considered all that you say about my general powers and the particular instance of the poem in which i have attempted to develop them nothing can be more satisfactory to me than the interest which your admonitions express but i think you are mistaken in some points with regard to the peculiar nature of my powers whatever be their amount i listened with deference and selfsuspicion to your censures of the revolt of islam but the productions of mine which you commend hold a very low place in my own esteem and this reassures me in some degree at least the poem was produced by a series of thoughts which filled my mind with unbounded and sustained enthusiasm i felt the precariousness of my life and i engaged in this task resolved to leave some record of myself much of what the volume contains was written with the same feelingas real though not so propheticas the communications of a dying man i never presumed indeed to consider it anything approaching to faultless but when i consider contemporary productions of the same apparent pretensions i own i was filled with confidence i felt that it was in many respects a genuine picture of my own mind i felt that the sentiments were true not assumed and in this have i long believed that my power consists in sympathy and that part of the imagination which relates to sentiment and contemplation i am formed if for anything not in common with the herd of mankind to apprehend minute and remote distinctions of feeling whether relative to external nature or the living beings which surround us and to communicate the conceptions which result from considering either the moral or the material universe as a whole of course i believe these faculties which perhaps comprehend all that is sublime in man to exist very imperfectly in my own mind but when you advert to my chancerypaper a cold forced unimpassioned insignificant piece of cramped and cautious argument and to the little scrap about mandeville which expressed my feelings indeed but cost scarcely two minutes thought to express as specimens of my powers more favourable than that which grew as it were from the agony and bloody sweat of intellectual travail surely i must feel that in some manner either i am mistaken in believing that i have any talent at all or you in the selection of the specimens of it yet after all i cannot but be conscious in much of what i write of an absence of that tranquillity which is the attribute and accompaniment of power this feeling alone would make your most kind and wise admonitions on the subject of the economy of intellectual force valuable to me and if i live or if i see any trust in coming years doubt not but that i shall do something whatever it may be which a serious and earnest estimate of my powers will suggest to me and which will be in every respect accommodated to their utmost limits  shelley to godwin     prince athanase  a fragment  the idea shelley had formed of prince athanase was a good deal modelled on alastor in the first sketch of the poem he named it pandemos and urania athanase seeks through the world the one whom he may love he meets in the ship in which he is embarked a lady who appears to him to embody his ideal of love and beauty but she proves to be pandemos or the earthly and unworthy venus who after disappointing his cherished dreams and hopes deserts him athanase crushed by sorrow pines and dies on his deathbed the lady who can really reply to his soul comes and kisses his lips the deathbed of athanase the poet describes her in the words of the final fragment page 164 this

before his time nor any could the restless griefs unravel  which burned within him withering up his prime and goading him like fiends from land to land                     5 not his the load of any secret crime  for nought of ill his heart could understand but pity and wild sorrow for the same not his the thirst for glory or command  baffled with blast of hopeconsuming shame                          10 nor evil joys which fire the vulgar breast and quench in speedy smoke its feeble flame  had left within his soul their dark unrest nor what religion fables of the grave feared hephilosophys accepted guest                             15  for none than he a purer heart could have or that loved good more for itself alone of nought in heaven or earth was he the slave  what sorrow strange and shadowy and unknown sent him a hopeless wanderer through mankind                    20 if with a human sadness he did groan  he had a gentle yet aspiring mind just innocent with varied learning fed and such a glorious consolation find  in others joy when all their own is dead                          25 he loved and laboured for his kind in grief and yet unlike all others it is said  that from such toil he never found relief although a child of fortune and of power of an ancestral name the orphan chief                               30  his soul had wedded wisdom and her dower is love and justice clothed in which he sate apart from men as in a lonely tower  pitying the tumult of their dark estate yet even in youth did he not eer abuse                              35 the strength of wealth or thought to consecrate  those false opinions which the harsh rich use to blind the world they famish for their pride nor did he hold from any man his dues  but like a steward in honest dealings tried                        40 with those who toiled and wept the poor and wise his riches and his cares he did divide  fearless he was and scorning all disguise what he dared do or think though men might start he spoke with mild yet unaverted eyes                               45  liberal he was of soul and frank of heart and to his many friendsall loved him well whateer he knew or felt he would impart  if words he found those inmost thoughts to tell if not he smiled or wept and his weak foes                         50 he neither spurned nor hatedthough with fell  and mortal hate their thousand voices rose they passed like aimless arrows from his ear nor did his heart or mind its portal close  to those or them or any whom lifes sphere                        55 may comprehend within its wide array what sadness made that vernal spirit sere  he knew not though his life day after day was failing like an unreplenished stream though in his eyes a cloud and burthen lay                          60  through which his soul like vespers serene beam piercing the chasms of ever rising clouds shone softly burning though his lips did seem  like reeds which quiver in impetuous floods and through his sleep and oer each waking hour                    65 thoughts after thoughts unresting multitudes  were driven within him by some secret power which bade them blaze and live and roll afar like lights and sounds from haunted tower to tower  oer castled mountains borne when tempests war                     70 is levied by the nightcontending winds and the pale dalesmen watch with eager ear  though such were in his spirit as the fiends which wake and feed an everliving woe what was this grief which neer in other minds                      75  a mirror foundhe knew notnone could know but on whoeer might question him he turned the light of his frank eyes as if to show  he knew not of the grief within that burned but asked forbearance with a mournful look                          80 or spoke in words from which none ever learned  the cause of his disquietude or shook with spasms of silent passion or turned pale so that his friends soon rarely undertook  to stir his secret pain without avail                             85 for all who knew and loved him then perceived that there was drawn an adamantine veil  between his heart and mindboth unrelieved wrought in his brain and bosom separate strife some said that he was mad others believed                           90  that memories of an antenatal life made this where now he dwelt a penal hell and others said that such mysterious grief  from gods displeasure like a darkness fell on souls like his which owned no higher law                         95 than love love calm steadfast invincible  by mortal fear or supernatural awe and otherstis the shadow of a dream which the veiled eye of memory never saw  but through the souls abyss like some dark stream                 100 through shattered mines and caverns underground rolls shaking its foundations and no beam  of joy may rise but it is quenched and drowned in the dim whirlpools of this dream obscure soon its exhausted waters will have found                            105  a lair of rest beneath thy spirit pure o athanasein one so good and great evil or tumult cannot long endure  so spake they idly of anothers state

talk as if its theme might be  another not himself he to and fro                                  115 questioned and canvassed it with subtlest wit and none but those who loved him best could know  that which he knew not how it galled and bit his weary mind this converse vain and cold for like an eyeless nightmare grief did sit                          120  upon his being a snake which fold by

hairs glittering in the light  of the wood fire and round his shoulders fall and his wan visage and his withered mien yet calm and gentle and majestical                                  160  and

verbal alterations are recorded in the footnotes punctual in the editors notes at the end of volume 3  advertisement  the story of rosalind and helen is undoubtedly not an attempt in the highest style of poetry it is in no degree calculated to excite profound meditation and if by interesting the affections and amusing the imagination it awakens a certain ideal melancholy favourable to the reception of more important impressions it will produce in the reader all that the writer experienced in the composition i resigned myself as i wrote to the impulses of the feelings which moulded the conception of the story and this impulse determined the pauses of a measure which only pretends to be regular inasmuch as it corresponds with and expresses the irregularity of the imaginations which inspired it  i do not know which of the few scattered poems i left in england will be selected by my bookseller to add to this collection one lines written among the euganean hillseditor which i sent from italy was written after a days excursion among those lovely mountains which surround what was once the retreat and where is now the sepulchre of petrarch if any one is inclined to condemn the insertion of the introductory lines which image forth the sudden relief of a state of deep despondency by the radiant visions disclosed by the sudden burst of an italian sunrise in autumn on the highest peak of those delightful mountains i can only offer as my excuse that they were not erased at the request of a dear friend with whom added years of intercourse only add to my apprehension of its value and who would have had more right than any one to complain that she has not been able to extinguish in me the very power of delineating sadness  naples december 20 1818   rosalind helen and her child  scene

                        5 by this lone lake in this far land thy loose hair in the light wind flying thy sweet voice to each tone of even united and thine eyes replying to the hues of yon fair heaven

         20 of that our land whose wilds and floods barren and dark although they be were dearer than these chestnut woods those heathy paths that inland stream and the blue mountains shapes which seem                            25 like wrecks of childhoods sunny dream which that we have abandoned now weighs on the heart like that remorse which altered friendship leaves i seek no more our

not frown i would not chide thee though thy faith is broken                  35 but turn to me oh by this cherished token of woven hair which thou wilt not disown turn as twere but the memory of me and not my scorned self who prayed to thee  rosalind is it a dream or do i see                                           40 and hear frail helen i would flee thy tainting touch but former years arise and bring forbidden tears and my oerburthened memory seeks yet its lost repose in thee                                   45 i share thy crime i cannot choose but weep for thee mine own strange grief but seldom stoops to such relief nor ever did i love thee less though mourning oer thy wickedness                                  50 even with a sisters woe i knew what to the evil world is due and therefore sternly did refuse to link me with the infamy of one so lost as helen now                                         55 bewildered by my dire despair wondering i blush and weep that thou

suffocating sorrow in the dell of yon dark chestnutwood is a stone seat a solitude less like our own the ghost of peace                                70 will not desert this spot tomorrow if thy kind

laughed with the glee of light and unsuspecting infancy and whispered in her ear bring home with you                       90 that sweet strange ladyfriend then off he flew but stopped and beckoned with a meaning smile where the road turned pale rosalind the while hiding her face stood weeping silently  in silence then they took the way                                    95 beneath the forests solitude it was a vast and antique wood thro which they took their way and the gray shades of evening oer that green wilderness did fling                                 100 still deeper solitude pursuing still the path that wound the vast and knotted trees around through which slow shades were wandering to a deep lawny dell they came                                      105 to a stone seat beside a spring oer which the columned wood did frame a roofless temple like the fane where ere new creeds could faith obtain mans early race once knelt beneath                                  110 the overhanging deity oer this fair fountain hung the sky now spangled with rare stars the snake the pale snake that with eager breath creeps here his noontide thirst to slake                            115 is beaming with many a mingled hue shed from yon domes eternal blue when he floats on that dark and lucid flood in the light of his own loveliness and the birds that in the fountain dip                               120 their plumes with fearless fellowship above and round him wheel and hover the fitful wind is heard to stir one solitary leaf on high the chirping of the grasshopper                                      125 fills every pause there is emotion in all that dwells at noontide here then through the intricate wild wood a maze of life and light and motion is woven but there is stillness now                                130 gloom and the trance of nature now the snake is in his cave asleep the birds are on the branches dreaming only the shadows creep only the glowworm is gleaming                                      135 only the owls and the nightingales wake in this dell when daylight fails and gray shades gather in the woods and the owls have all fled far away in a merrier glen to hoot and play                                  140 for the moon is veiled and sleeping now the accustomed nightingale still broods on her accustomed bough but she is mute for her false mate has fled and left her desolate                                      145  this silent spot tradition old had peopled with the spectral dead for the roots of the speakers hair felt cold and stiff as with tremulous lips he told that a hellish shape at midnight led                                 150 the ghost of a youth with hoary hair and sate on the seat beside him there till a naked child came wandering by when the fiend would change to a lady fair a fearful tale the truth was worse                                 155 for here a sister and a brother had solemnized a monstrous curse meeting in this fair solitude for beneath yon very sky had they resigned to one another                                     160 body and soul the multitude tracking them to the secret wood tore limb from limb their innocent child and stabbed and trampled on its mother but the youth for gods most holy grace                            165 a priest saved to burn in the marketplace  duly at evening helen came to this lone silent spot from the wrecks of a tale of wilder sorrow so much of sympathy to borrow                                        170 as soothed her own dark lot duly each evening from her home with her fair child would helen come to sit upon that antique seat while the hues of day were pale                                     175 and the bright boy beside her feet now lay lifting at intervals his broad blue eyes on her now where some sudden impulse calls following he was a gentle boy                                       180 and in all gentle sorts took joy oft in a dry leaf for a boat with a small feather for a sail his fancy on that spring would float if some invisible breeze might stir                                  185 its marble calm and helen smiled through tears of awe on the gay child to think that a boy as fair as he in years which never more may be by that same fount in that same wood                               190 the like sweet fancies had pursued and that a mother lost like her had mournfully sate watching him then all the scene was wont to swim through the mist of a burning tear                                  195  for many months had helen known this scene and now she thither turned her footsteps not alone the friend whose falsehood she had mourned sate with her on that seat of stone                                 200 silent they sate for evening and the power its glimpses bring had with one awful shadow quelled the passion of their grief they sate with linked hands for unrepelled                                    205 had helen taken rosalinds like the autumn wind when it unbinds the tangled locks of the nightshades hair which is twined in the sultry summer air round the walls of an outworn sepulchre                             210 did the voice of helen sad and sweet and the sound of her heart that ever beat as with sighs and words she breathed on her unbind the knots of her friends despair till her thoughts were free to float and flow                       215 and from her labouring bosom now like the bursting of a prisoned flame the voice of a long pent sorrow came  rosalind i saw the dark earth fall upon the coffin and i saw the stone                                      220 laid over him whom this cold breast had pillowed to his nightly rest thou knowest not thou canst not know my agony oh i could not weep the sources whence such blessings flow                               225 were not to be approached by me but i could smile and i could sleep though with a selfaccusing heart in mornings light in evenings gloom i watchedand would not thence depart                            230 my husbands unlamented tomb my children knew their sire was gone but when i told themhe is dead they laughed aloud in frantic glee they clapped their hands and leaped about                           235 answering each others ecstasy with many a prank and merry shout but i sate silent and alone wrapped in the mock of mourning weed  they laughed for he was dead but i                                 240 sate with a hard and tearless eye and with a heart which would deny the secret joy it could not quell low muttering oer his loathed name till from that selfcontention came                                  245 remorse where sin was none a hell which in pure spirits should not dwell  ill tell thee truth he was a man hard selfish loving only gold yet full of guile his pale eyes ran                                 250 with tears which each some falsehood told and oft his smooth and bridled tongue would give the lie to his flushing cheek he was a coward to the strong he was a tyrant to the weak                                         255 on whom his vengeance he would wreak for scorn whose arrows search the heart from many a strangers eye would dart and on his memory cling and follow his soul to its home so cold and hollow                             260 he was a tyrant to the weak and we were such alas the day oft when my little ones at play were in youths natural lightness gay or if they listened to some tale                                     265 of travellers or of fairy land when the light from the woodfires dying brand flashed on their facesif they heard or thought they heard upon the stair his footstep the suspended word                                     270 died on my lips we all grew pale the babe at my bosom was hushed with fear if it thought it heard its father near and my two wild boys would near my knee cling cowed and cowering fearfully                                 275  ill tell thee truth i loved another his name in my ear was ever ringing his form to my brain was ever clinging yet if some stranger breathed that name my lips turned white and my heart beat fast                        280 my nights were once haunted by dreams of flame my days were dim in the shadow cast by the memory of the same day and night day and night he was my breath and life and light                                 285 for three short years which soon were passed on the fourth my gentle mother led me to the shrine to be his sworn bride eternally and now we stood on the altar stair                                 290 when my father came from a distant land and with a loud and fearful cry rushed between us suddenly i saw the stream of his thin gray hair i saw his lean and lifted hand                                      295 and heard his wordsand live oh god wherefore do i livehold hold he cried i tell thee tis her brother thy mother boy beneath the sod of yon churchyard rests in her shroud so cold                       300 i am now weak and pale and old we were once dear to one another i and that corpse thou art our child then with a laugh both long and wild the youth upon the pavement fell                                    305 they found him dead all looked on me the spasms of my despair to see but i was calm i went away i was clammycold like clay i did not weep i did not speak                                     310 but day by day week after week i walked about like a corpse alive alas sweet friend you must believe this heart is stone it did not break my father lived a little while                                      315 but all might see that he was dying he smiled with such a woeful smile when he was in the churchyard lying among the worms we grew quite poor so that no one would give us bread                                  320 my mother looked at me and said faint words of cheer which only meant that she could die and be content so i went forth from the same church door to another husbands bed                                            325 and this was he who died at last when weeks and months and years had passed through which i firmly did fulfil my duties a devoted wife with the stern step of vanquished will                              330 walking beneath the night of life whose hours extinguished like slow rain falling for ever pain by pain the very hope of deaths dear rest which since the heart within my breast                              335 of natural life was dispossessed its strange sustainer there had been  when flowers were dead and grass was green upon my mothers gravethat mother whom to outlive and cheer and make                                 340 my wan eyes glitter for her sake was my vowed task the single care which once gave life to my despair when she was a thing that did not stir and the crawling worms were cradling her                             345 to a sleep more deep and so more sweet than a babys rocked on its nurses knee i lived a living pulse then beat beneath my heart that awakened me what was this pulse so warm and free                                350 alas i knew it could not be my own dull blood twas like a thought of liquid love that spread and wrought under my bosom and in my brain and crept with the blood through every vein                         355 and hour by hour day after day the wonder could not charm away but laid in sleep my wakeful pain until i knew it was a child and then i wept for long long years                                360 these frozen eyes had shed no tears but nowtwas the season fair and mild when april has wept itself to may i sate through the sweet sunny day by my window bowered round with leaves                              365 and down my cheeks the quick tears fell like twinkling raindrops from the eaves when warm spring showers are passing oer o helen none can ever tell the joy it was to weep once more                                    370  i wept to think how hard it were to kill my babe and take from it the sense of light and the warm air and my own fond and tender care and love and smiles ere i knew yet                                  375 that these for it might as for me be the masks of a grinning mockery and haply i would dream twere sweet to feed it from my faded breast or mark my own hearts restless beat                                 380 rock it to its untroubled rest and watch the growing soul beneath dawn in faint smiles and hear its breath half interrupted by calm sighs and search the depth of its fair eyes                                385 for long departed memories and so i lived till that sweet load was lightened darkly forward flowed the stream of years and on it bore two shapes of gladness to my sight                                  390 two other babes delightful more in my lost souls abandoned night than their own country ships may be sailing towards wrecked mariners who cling to the rock of a wintry sea                               395 for each as it came brought soothing tears and a loosening warmth as each one lay sucking the sullen milk away about my frozen heart did play and weaned it oh how painfully                                    400 as they themselves were weaned each one from that sweet foodeven from the thirst of death and nothingness and rest strange inmate of a living breast which all that i had undergone                                       405 of grief and shame since she who first the gates of that dark refuge closed came to my sight and almost burst the seal of that lethean spring but these fair shadows interposed                                   410 for all delights are shadows now and from my brain to my dull brow the heavy tears gather and flow i cannot speak oh let me weep  the tears which fell from her wan eyes                               415 glimmered among the moonlight dew her deep hard sobs and heavy sighs their echoes in the darkness threw when she grew calm she thus did keep the tenor of her tale he died                                                             420 i know not how he was not old if age be numbered by its years but he was bowed and bent with fears pale with the quenchless thirst of gold which like fierce fever left him weak                             425 and his strait lip and bloated cheek were warped in spasms by hollow sneers and selfish cares with barren plough not age had lined his narrow brow and foul and cruel thoughts which feed                              430 upon the withering life within like vipers on some poisonous weed whether his ill were death or sin none knew until he died indeed and then men owned they were the same                               435  seven days within my chamber lay that corse and my babes made holiday at last i told them what is death the eldest with a kind of shame came to my knees with silent breath                                 440 and sate awestricken at my feet and soon the others left their play and sate there too it is unmeet to shed on the brief flower of youth the withering knowledge of the grave                                445 from me remorse then wrung that truth i could not bear the joy which gave too just a response to mine own in vain i dared not feign a groan and in their artless looks i saw                                    450 between the mists of fear and awe that my own thought was theirs and they expressed it not in words but said each in its heart how every day will pass in happy work and play                                    455 now he is dead and gone away  after the funeral all our kin assembled and the will was read my friend i tell thee even the dead have strength their putrid shrouds within                          460 to blast and torture those who live still fear the living but a corse is merciless and power doth give to such pale tyrants half the spoil he rends from those who groan and toil                              465 because they blush not with remorse among their crawling worms behold i have no child my tale grows old with grief and staggers let it reach the limits of my feeble speech                                      470 and languidly at length recline on the brink of its own grave and mine  thou knowest what a thing is poverty among the fallen on evil days tis crime and fear and infamy                                    475 and houseless want in frozen ways wandering ungarmented and pain and worse than all that inward stain foul selfcontempt which drowns in sneers youths starlight smile and makes its tears                         480 first like hot gall then dry for ever and well thou knowest a mother never could doom her children to this ill and well he knew the same the will imported that if eer again                                         485 i sought my children to behold or in my birthplace did remain beyond three days whose hours were told they should inherit nought and he to whom next came their patrimony                                   490 a sallow lawyer cruel and cold aye watched me as the will was read with eyes askance which sought to see the secrets of my agony and with close lips and anxious brow                                 495 stood canvassing still to and fro the chance of my resolve and all the dead mans caution just did call for in that killing lie twas said she is adulterous and doth hold                                    500 in secret that the christian creed is false and therefore is much need that i should have a care to save my children from eternal fire friend he was sheltered by the grave                               505 and therefore dared to be a liar in truth the indian on the pyre of her dead husband half consumed as well might there be false as i to those abhorred embraces doomed                                   510 far worse than fires brief agony as to the christian creed if true or false i never questioned it i took it as the vulgar do nor my vexed soul had leisure yet                                    515 to doubt the things men say or deem that they are other than they seem  all present who those crimes did hear in feigned or actual scorn and fear men women children slunk away                                    520 whispering with selfcontented pride which half suspects its own base lie i spoke to none nor did abide but silently i went my way nor noticed i where joyously                                         525 sate my two younger babes at play in the courtyard through which i passed but went with footsteps firm and fast till i came to the brink of the ocean green and there a woman with gray hairs                                  530 who had my mothers servant been kneeling with many tears and prayers made me accept a purse of gold half of the earnings she had kept to refuge her when weak and old                                     535  with woe which never sleeps or slept i wander now tis a vain thought but on yon alp whose snowy head mid the azure air is islanded we see it oer the flood of cloud                                  540 which sunrise from its eastern caves drives wrinkling into golden waves hung with its precipices proud from that gray stone where first we met there nowwho knows the dead feel nought                         545 should be my grave for he who yet is my souls soul once said twere sweet mid stars and lightnings to abide and winds and lulling snows that beat with their soft flakes the mountain wide                            550 where weary meteor lamps repose and languid storms their pinions close and all things strong and bright and pure and ever during aye endure who knows if one were buried there                                 555 but these things might our spirits make amid the allsurrounding air their own eternity partake then twas a wild and playful saying at which i laughed or seemed to laugh                              560 they were his words now heed my praying and let them be my epitaph thy memory for a term may be my monument wilt remember me i know thou wilt and canst forgive                                  565 whilst in this erring world to live my soul disdained not that i thought its lying forms were worthy aught and much less thee  helen o speak not so but come to me and pour thy woe                                      570 into this heart full though it be ay overflowing with its own i thought that grief had severed me from all beside who weep and groan its likeness upon earth to be                                       575 its express image but thou art more wretched sweet we will not part henceforth if death be not division if so the dead feel no contrition but wilt thou hear since last we parted                              580 all that has left me broken hearted  rosalind yes speak the faintest stars are scarcely shorn of their thin beams by that delusive morn which sinks again in darkness like the light of early love soon lost in total night                             585  helen alas italian winds are mild but my bosom is coldwintry cold when the warm air weaves among the fresh leaves soft music my poor brain is wild and i am weak like a nursling child                                 590 though my soul with grief is gray and old  rosalind weep not at thine own words though they must make me weep what is thy tale  helen i fear twill shake thy gentle heart with tears thou well rememberest when we met no more                                     595 and though i dwelt with lionel that friendless caution pierced me sore with grief a wound my spirit bore indignantly but when he died with him lay dead both hope and pride                               600 alas all hope is buried now but then men dreamed the aged earth was labouring in that mighty birth which many a poet and a sage has aye foreseenthe happy age                                      605 when truth and love shall dwell below among the works and ways of men which on this world not power but will even now is wanting to fulfil  among mankind what thence befell                                     610 of strife how vain is known too well when libertys dear paean fell mid murderous howls to lionel though of great wealth and lineage high yet through those dungeon walls there came                           615 thy thrilling light o liberty and as the meteors midnight flame startles the dreamer sunlike truth flashed on his visionary youth and filled him not with love but faith                            620 and hope and courage mute in death for love and life in him were twins born at one birth in every other first life then love its course begins though they be children of one mother                               625 and so through this dark world they fleet divided till in death they meet but he loved all things ever then he passed amid the strife of men and stood at the throne of armed power                               630 pleading for a world of woe secure as one on a rockbuilt tower oer the wrecks which the surge trails to and fro mid the passions wild of human kind he stood like a spirit calming them                                635 for it was said his words could bind like music the lulled crowd and stem that torrent of unquiet dream which mortals truth and reason deem but is revenge and fear and pride                                   640 joyous he was and hope and peace on all who heard him did abide raining like dew from his sweet talk as where the evening star may walk along the brink of the gloomy seas                                  645 liquid mists of splendour quiver his very gestures touched to tears the unpersuaded tyrant never so moved before his presence stung the torturers with their victims pain                              650 and none knew how and through their ears the subtle witchcraft of his tongue unlocked the hearts of those who keep gold the worlds bond of slavery men wondered and some sneered to see                                655 one sow what he could never reap for he is rich they said and young and might drink from the depths of luxury if he seeks fame fame never crowned the champion of a trampled creed                                    660 if he seeks power power is enthroned mid ancient rights and wrongs to feed which hungry wolves with praise and spoil those who would sit near power must toil and such there sitting all may see                                665 what seeks he all that others seek he casts away like a vile weed which the sea casts unreturningly that poor and hungry men should break the laws which wreak them toil and scorn                            670 we understand but lionel we know is rich and nobly born so wondered they yet all men loved young lionel though few approved all but the priests whose hatred fell                               675 like the unseen blight of a smiling day the withering honey dew which clings under the bright green buds of may whilst they unfold their emerald wings for he made verses wild and queer                                    680 on the strange creeds priests hold so dear because they bring them land and gold of devils and saints and all such gear he made tales which whoso heard or read would laugh till he were almost dead                                685 so this grew a proverb dont get old till lionels banquet in hell you hear and then you will laugh yourself young again so the priests hated him and he repaid their hate with cheerful glee                                690  ah smiles and joyance quickly died for public hope grew pale and dim in an altered time and tide and in its wasting withered him as a summer flower that blows too soon                               695 droops in the smile of the waning moon when it scatters through an april night the frozen dews of wrinkling blight none now hoped more gray power was seated safely on her ancestral throne                                      700 and faith the python undefeated even to its bloodstained steps dragged on her foul and wounded train and men were trampled and deceived again and words and shows again could bind                                 705 the wailing tribes of human kind in scorn and famine fire and blood raged round the raging multitude to fields remote by tyrants sent to be the scorned instrument                                         710 with which they drag from mines of gore the chains their slaves yet ever wore and in the streets men met each other and by old altars and in halls and smiled again at festivals                                       715 but each man found in his hearts brother cold cheer for all though half deceived the outworn creeds again believed and the same round anew began which the weary world yet ever ran                                  720  many then wept not tears but gall within their hearts like drops which fall wasting the fountainstone away and in that dark and evil day did all desires and thoughts that claim                             725 mens careambition friendship fame love hope though hope was now despair indue the colours of this change as from the allsurrounding air the earth takes hues obscure and strange                            730 when storm and earthquake linger there  and so my friend it then befell to many most to lionel whose hope was like the life of youth within him and when dead became                                    735 a spirit of unresting flame which goaded him in his distress over the worlds vast wilderness three years he left his native land and on the fourth when he returned                                 740 none knew him he was stricken deep with some disease of mind and turned into aught unlike lionel on him on whom did he pause in sleep serenest smiles were wont to keep                                   745 and did he wake a winged band of bright persuasions which had fed on his sweet lips and liquid eyes kept their swift pinions half outspread to do on men his least command                                      750 on him whom once twas paradise even to behold now misery lay in his own heart twas merciless to all things else none may express its innocence and tenderness                                        755  twas said that he had refuge sought in love from his unquiet thought in distant lands and been deceived by some strange show for there were found blotted with tears as those relieved                                 760 by their own words are wont to do these mournful verses on the ground by all who read them blotted too  how am i changed my hopes were once like fire i loved and i believed that life was love                          765 how am i lost on wings of swift desire among heavens winds my spirit once did move i slept and silver dreams did aye inspire my liquid sleep i woke and did approve all nature to my heart and thought to make                          770 a paradise of earth for one sweet sake  i love but i believe in love no more i feel desire but hope not o from sleep most vainly must my weary brain implore its long lost flattery now i wake to weep                          775 and sit through the long day gnawing the core of my bitter heart and like a miser keep since none in what i feel take pain or pleasure to my own soul its selfconsuming treasure  he dwelt beside me near the sea                                     780 and oft in evening did we meet when the waves beneath the starlight flee oer the yellow sands with silver feet and talked our talk was sad and sweet till slowly from his mien there passed                               785 the desolation which it spoke and smilesas when the lightnings blast has parched some heavendelighting oak the next spring shows leaves pale and rare but like flowers delicate and fair                                  790 on its rent boughsagain arrayed his countenance in tender light his words grew subtile fire which made the air his hearers breathed delight his motions like the winds were free                              795 which bend the bright grass gracefully then fade away in circlets faint and winged hope on which upborne his soul seemed hovering in his eyes like some bright spirit newly born                                   800 floating amid the sunny skies sprang forth from his rent heart anew yet oer his talk and looks and mien tempering their loveliness too keen past woe its shadow backward threw                                  805 till like an exhalation spread from flowers half drunk with evening dew they did become infectious sweet and subtle mists of sense and thought which wrapped us soon when we might meet                           810 almost from our own looks and aught the wild world holds and so his mind was healed while mine grew sick with fear for ever now his health declined like some frail bark which cannot bear                               815 the impulse of an altered wind though prosperous and my heart grew full mid its new joy of a new care for his cheek became not pale but fair as roseoershadowed lilies are                                     820 and soon his deep and sunny hair in this alone less beautiful like grass in tombs grew wild and rare the blood in his translucent veins beat not like animal life but love                                 825 seemed now its sullen springs to move when life had failed and all its pains and sudden sleep would seize him oft like death so calm but that a tear his pointed eyelashes between                                       830 would gather in the light serene of smiles whose lustre bright and soft beneath lay undulating there his breath was like inconstant flame as eagerly it went and came                                         835 and i hung oer him in his sleep till like an image in the lake which rains disturb my tears would break the shadow of that slumber deep then he would bid me not to weep                                    840 and say with flattery false yet sweet that death and he could never meet if i would never part with him and so we loved and did unite all that in us was yet divided                                      845 for when he said that many a rite by men to bind but once provided could not be shared by him and me or they would kill him in their glee i shuddered and then laughing said                                850 we will have rites our faith to bind but our church shall be the starry night our altar the grassy earth outspread and our priest the muttering wind  twas sunset as i spoke one star                                    855 had scarce burst forth when from afar the ministers of misrule sent seized upon lionel and bore his chained limbs to a dreary tower in the midst of a city vast and wide                                860 for he they said from his mind had bent against their gods keen blasphemy for which though his soul must roasted be in hells red lakes immortally yet even on earth must he abide                                      865 the vengeance of their slaves a trial i think men call it what avail are prayers and tears which chase denial from the fierce savage nursed in hate what the knit soul that pleading and pale                            870 makes wan the quivering cheek which late it painted with its own delight we were divided as i could i stilled the tingling of my blood and followed him in their despite                                   875 as a widow follows pale and wild the murderers and corse of her only child and when we came to the prison door and i prayed to share his dungeon floor with prayers which rarely have been spurned                         880 and when men drove me forth and i stared with blank frenzy on the sky a farewell look of love he turned half calming me then gazed awhile as if thro that black and massy pile                               885 and thro the crowd around him there and thro the dense and murky air and the thronged streets he did espy what poets know and prophesy and said with voice that made them shiver                           890 and clung like music in my brain and which the mute walls spoke again prolonging it with deepened strain fear not the tyrants shall rule for ever or the priests of the bloody faith                                  895 they stand on the brink of that mighty river whose waves they have tainted with death it is fed from the depths of a thousand dells around them it foams and rages and swells and their swords and their sceptres i floating see                  900 like wrecks in the surge of eternity  i dwelt beside the prison gate and the strange crowd that out and in passed some no doubt with mine own fate might have fretted me with its ceaseless din                        905 but the fever of care was louder within soon but too late in penitence or fear his foes released him thence i saw his thin and languid form as leaning on the jailors arm                                      910 whose hardened eyes grew moist the while to meet his mute and faded smile and hear his words of kind farewell he tottered forth from his damp cell many had never wept before                                          915 from whom fast tears then gushed and fell many will relent no more who sobbed like infants then aye all who thronged the prisons stony hall the rulers or the slaves of law                                     920 felt with a new surprise and awe that they were human till strong shame made them again become the same the prison bloodhounds huge and grim from human looks the infection caught                               925 and fondly crouched and fawned on him and men have heard the prisoners say who in their rotting dungeons lay that from that hour throughout one day the fierce despair and hate which kept                               930 their trampled bosoms almost slept where like twin vultures they hung feeding on each hearts wound wide torn and bleeding because their jailors rule they thought grew merciful like a parents sway                                 935  i know not how but we were free and lionel sate alone with me as the carriage drove thro the streets apace and we looked upon each others face and the blood in our fingers intertwined                             940 ran like the thoughts of a single mind as the swift emotions went and came thro the veins of each united frame so thro the long long streets we passed of the millionpeopled city vast                                    945 which is that desert where each one seeks his mate yet is alone beloved and sought and mourned of none until the clear blue sky was seen and the grassy meadows bright and green                             950 and then i sunk in his embrace enclosing there a mighty space of love and so we travelled on by woods and fields of yellow flowers and towns and villages and towers                                 955 day after day of happy hours it was the azure time of june when the skies are deep in the stainless noon and the warm and fitful breezes shake the fresh green leaves of the hedgerow briar                        960 and there were odours then to make the very breath we did respire a liquid element whereon our spirits like delighted things that walk the air on subtle wings                                   965 floated and mingled far away mid the warm winds of the sunny day and when the evening star came forth above the curve of the new bent moon and light and sound ebbed from the earth                            970 like the tide of the full and the weary sea to the depths of its own tranquillity our natures to its own repose did the earths breathless sleep attune like flowers which on each other close                              975 their languid leaves when daylights gone we lay till new emotions came which seemed to make each mortal frame one soul of interwoven flame a life in life a second birth                                       980 in worlds diviner far than earth which like two strains of harmony that mingle in the silent sky then slowly disunite passed by and left the tenderness of tears                                    985 a soft oblivion of all fears a sweet sleep so we travelled on till we came to the home of lionel among the mountains wild and lone beside the hoary western sea                                        990 which near the verge of the echoing shore the massy forest shadowed oer  the ancient steward with hair all hoar as we alighted wept to see his master changed so fearfully                                     995 and the old mans sobs did waken me from my dream of unremaining gladness the truth flashed oer me like quick madness when i looked and saw that there was death on lionel yet day by day                                            1000 he lived till fear grew hope and faith and in my soul i dared to say nothing so bright can pass away death is dark and foul and dull but he iso how beautiful                                          1005 yet day by day he grew more weak and his sweet voice when he might speak which neer was loud became more low and the light which flashed through his waxen cheek grew faint as the roselike hues which flow                         1010 from sunset oer the alpine snow and death seemed not like death in him for the spirit of life oer every limb lingered a mist of sense and thought when the summer wind faint odours brought                            1015 from mountain flowers even as it passed his cheek would change as the noonday sea which the dying breeze sweeps fitfully if but a cloud the sky oercast you might see his colour come and go                                1020 and the softest strain of music made sweet smiles yet sad arise and fade amid the dew of his tender eyes and the breath with intermitting flow made his pale lips quiver and part                                  1025 you might hear the beatings of his heart quick but not strong and with my tresses when oft he playfully would bind in the bowers of mossy lonelinesses his neck and win me so to mingle                                    1030 in the sweet depth of woven caresses and our faint limbs were intertwined alas the unquiet life did tingle from mine own heart through every vein like a captive in dreams of liberty                                 1035 who beats the walls of his stony cell but his it seemed already free like the shadow of fire surrounding me on my faint eyes and limbs did dwell that spirit as it passed till soon                                 1040 as a frail cloud wandering oer the moon beneath its light invisible is seen when it folds its gray wings again to alight on midnights dusky plain i lived and saw and the gathering soul                              1045 passed from beneath that strong control and i fell on a life which was sick with fear of all the woe that now i bear  amid a bloomless myrtle wood on a green and seagirt promontory                                  1050 not far from where we dwelt there stood in record of a sweet sad story an altar and a temple bright circled by steps and oer the gate was sculptured to fidelity                                       1055 and in the shrine an image sate all veiled but there was seen the light of smiles which faintly could express a mingled pain and tenderness through that ethereal drapery                                       1060 the left hand held the head the right beyond the veil beneath the skin you might see the nerves quivering within was forcing the point of a barbed dart into its sideconvulsing heart                                      1065 an unskilled hand yet one informed with genius had the marble warmed with that pathetic life this tale it told a dog had from the sea when the tide was raging fearfully                                  1070 dragged lionels mother weak and pale then died beside her on the sand and she that temple thence had planned but it was lionels own hand had wrought the image each new moon                                 1075 that lady did in this lone fane the rites of a religion sweet whose god was in her heart and brain the seasons loveliest flowers were strewn on the marble floor beneath her feet                                1080 and she brought crowns of seabuds white whose odour is so sweet and faint and weeds like branching chrysolite woven in devices fine and quaint and tears from her brown eyes did stain                              1085 the altar need but look upon that dying statue fair and wan if tears should cease to weep again and rare arabian odours came through the myrtle copses steaming thence                            1090 from the hissing frankincense whose smoke woolwhite as ocean foam hung in dense flocks beneath the dome that ivory dome whose azure night with golden stars like heaven was bright                         1095 oer the split cedars pointed flame and the ladys harp would kindle there the melody of an old air softer than sleep the villagers mixed their religion up with hers                                   1100 and as they listened round shed tears  one eve he led me to this fane daylight on its last purple cloud was lingering gray and soon her strain the nightingale began now loud                                     1105 climbing in circles the windless sky now dying music suddenly tis scattered in a thousand notes and now to the hushed ear it floats like field smells known in infancy                                  1110 then failing soothes the air again we sate within that temple lone pavilioned round with parian stone his mothers harp stood near and oft i had awakened music soft                                            1115 amid its wires the nightingale was pausing in her heaventaught tale now drain the cup said lionel which the poetbird has crowned so well with the wine of her bright and liquid song                         1120 heardst thou not sweet words among that heavenresounding minstrelsy heardst thou not that those who die awake in a world of ecstasy that love when limbs are interwoven                                1125 and sleep when the night of life is cloven and thought to the worlds dim boundaries clinging and music when one beloved is singing is death let us drain right joyously the cup which the sweet bird fills for me                          1130 he paused and to my lips he bent his own like spirit his words went through all my limbs with the speed of fire and his keen eyes glittering through mine filled me with the flame divine                                     1135 which in their orbs was burning far like the light of an unmeasured star in the sky of midnight dark and deep yes twas his soul that did inspire sounds which my skill could neer awaken                           1140 and first i felt my fingers sweep the harp and a long quivering cry burst from my lips in symphony the dusk and solid air was shaken as swift and swifter the notes came                                  1145 from my touch that wandered like quick flame and from my bosom labouring with some unutterable thing the awful sound of my own voice made my faint lips tremble in some mood                                  1150 of wordless thought lionel stood so pale that even beside his cheek the snowy column from its shade caught whiteness yet his countenance raised upward burned with radiance                                  1155 of spiritpiercing joy whose light like the moon struggling through the night of whirlwindrifted clouds did break with beams that might not be confined i paused but soon his gestures kindled                              1160 new power as by the moving wind the waves are lifted and my song to low soft notes now changed and dwindled and from the twinkling wires among my languid fingers drew and flung                                    1165 circles of lifedissolving sound yet faint in aery rings they bound my lionel who as every strain grew fainter but more sweet his mien sunk with the sound relaxedly                                       1170 and slowly now he turned to me as slowly faded from his face that awful joy with looks serene he was soon drawn to my embrace and my wild song then died away                                      1175 in murmurs words i dare not say we mixed and on his lips mine fed till they methought felt still and cold what is it with thee love i said no word no look no motion yes                                    1180 there was a change but spare to guess nor let that moments hope be told i looked and knew that he was dead and fell as the eagle on the plain falls when life deserts her brain                                   1185 and the mortal lightning is veiled again  o that i were now dead but such did they not love demand too much those dying murmurs he forbade o that i once again were mad                                        1190 and yet dear rosalind not so for i would live to share thy woe sweet boy did i forget thee too alas we know not what we do when we speak words no memory more                                                       1195 is in my mind of that sea shore madness came on me and a troop of misty shapes did seem to sit beside me on a vessels poop and the clear north wind was driving it                             1200 then i heard strange tongues and saw strange flowers and the stars methought grew unlike ours and the azure sky and the stormless sea made me believe that i had died and waked in a world which was to me                                1205 drear hell though heaven to all beside then a dead sleep fell on my mind whilst animal life many long years had rescued from a chasm of tears and when i woke i wept to find                                      1210 that the same lady bright and wise with silver locks and quick brown eyes the mother of my lionel had tended me in my distress and died some months before nor less                                1215 wonder but far more peace and joy brought in that hour my lovely boy for through that trance my soul had well the impress of thy being kept and if i waked or if i slept                                       1220 no doubt though memory faithless be thy image ever dwelt on me and thus o lionel like thee is our sweet child tis sure most strange i knew not of so great a change                                     1225 as that which gave him birth who now is all the solace of my woe  that lionel great wealth had left by will to me and that of all the ready lies of law bereft                                         1230 my child and me might well befall but let me think not of the scorn which from the meanest i have borne when for my childs beloved sake i mixed with slaves to vindicate                                    1235 the very laws themselves do make let me not say scorn is my fate lest i be proud suffering the same with those who live in deathless fame  she ceasedlo where red morning thro the woods                  1240 is burning oer the dew said rosalind and with these words they rose and towards the flood of the blue lake beneath the leaves now wind with equal steps and fingers intertwined thence to a lonely dwelling where the shore                         1245 is shadowed with steep rocks and cypresses cleave with their dark green cones the silent skies and with their shadows the clear depths below and where a little terrace from its bowers of blooming myrtle and faint lemonflowers                          1250 scatters its sensedissolving fragrance oer the liquid marble of the windless lake and where the aged forests limbs look hoar under the leaves which their green garments make they come tis helens home and clean and white                   1255 like one which tyrants spare on our own land in some such solitude

home dim memory disturbed poor rosalind she stood as one whose mind is where his body cannot be till helen led her where her child yet slept and said observe that brow was lionels                          1265 those lips were his and so he ever kept one arm in sleep pillowing his head with it you cannot see his eyesthey are two wells of liquid love let us not wake him yet but rosalind could bear no more and wept                            1270 a shower of burning tears which fell upon his face and so his opening lashes shone with tears unlike his own as he did leap in sudden wonder from his innocent sleep  so rosalind and helen lived together                                 1275 thenceforth changed in all else yet friends again such as they were when oer the mountain heather they wandered in their youth through sun and rain and after many years for human things change even like the ocean and the wind                             1280 her daughter was restored to rosalind and in their circle thence some visitings of joy mid their new calm would intervene a lovely child she was of looks serene and motions which oer things indifferent shed                       1285 the grace and gentleness from whence they came and helens boy grew with her and they fed from the same flowers of thought until each mind like springs which mingle in one flood became and in their union soon their parents saw                            1290 the shadow of the peace denied to them and rosalind for when the living stem is cankered in its heart the tree must fall died ere her time and with deep grief and awe the pale survivors followed her remains                              1295 beyond the region of dissolving rains up the cold mountain she was wont to call her tomb and on chiavennas precipice they raised a pyramid of lasting ice whose polished sides ere day had yet begun                         1300 caught the first glow of the unrisen sun the last when it had sunk and thro the night the charioteers of arctos wheeled round its glittering point as seen from helens home whose sad inhabitants each year would come                          1305 with willing steps climbing that rugged height and hang long locks of hair and garlands bound with amaranth flowers which in the climes despite filled the frore air with unaccustomed light such flowers as in the wintry memory bloom

and helen was begun at marlow and thrown asidetill i found it and at my request it was completed shelley had no care for any of his poems that did not emanate from the depths of his mind and develop some high or abstruse truth when he does touch on human life and the human heart no pictures can be more faithful more delicate more subtle or more pathetic he never mentioned love but he shed a grace borrowed from his own nature that scarcely any other poet has bestowed on that passion when he spoke of it as the law of life which inasmuch as we rebel against we err and injure ourselves and others he promulgated that which he considered an irrefragable truth in his eyes it was the essence of our being and all woe and pain arose from the war made against it by selfishness or insensibility or mistake by reverting in his mind to this first principle he discovered the source of many emotions and could disclose the secrets of all hearts and his delineations of passion and emotion touch the finest chords of our nature  rosalind and helen was finished during the summer of 1818 while we were at the baths of lucca     julian and maddalo  a conversation  composed at este after shelleys first

love with tearsvirgils gallus  count maddalo is a venetian nobleman of ancient family and of great fortune who without mixing much in the society of his countrymen resides chiefly at his magnificent palace in that city he is a person of the most consummate genius and capable if he would direct his energies to such an end of becoming the redeemer of his degraded country but it is his weakness to be proud he derives from a comparison of his own extraordinary mind with the dwarfish intellects that surround him an intense apprehension of the nothingness of human life his passions and his powers are incomparably greater than those of other men and instead of the latter having been employed in curbing the former they have mutually lent each other strength his ambition preys upon itself for want of objects which it can consider worthy of exertion i say that maddalo is proud because i can find no other word to express the concentred and impatient feelings which consume him but it is on his own hopes and affections only that he seems to trample for in social life no human being can be more gentle patient and unassuming than maddalo he is cheerful frank and witty his more serious conversation is a sort of intoxication men are held by it as by a spell he has travelled much and there is an inexpressible charm in his relation of his adventures in different countries  julian is an englishman of good family passionately attached to those philosophical notions which assert the power of man over his own mind and the immense improvements of which by the extinction of certain moral superstitions human society may be yet susceptible without concealing the evil in the world he is for ever speculating how good may be made superior he is a complete infidel and a scoffer at all things reputed holy and maddalo takes a wicked pleasure in drawing out his taunts against religion what maddalo thinks on these matters is not exactly known julian in spite of his heterodox opinions is conjectured by his friends to possess some good qualities how far this is possible the pious reader will determine julian is rather serious  of the maniac i can give no information he seems by his own account to have been disappointed in love he was evidently a very cultivated and amiable person when in his right senses his story told at length might be like many other stories of the same kind the unconnected exclamations of his agony will perhaps be found a sufficient comment for the text of every heart   i rode one evening with count maddalo upon the bank of land which breaks the flow of adria towards venice a bare strand of hillocks heaped from evershifting sand matted with thistles and amphibious weeds                           5 such as from earths embrace the salt ooze breeds is this an uninhabited seaside which the lone fisher when his nets are dried abandons and no other object breaks the waste but one dwarf tree and some few stakes                    10 broken and unrepaired and the tide makes a narrow space of level sand thereon where twas our wont to ride while day went down this ride was my delight i love all waste and solitary places where we taste                                  15 the pleasure of believing what we see is boundless as we wish our souls to be and such was this wide ocean and this shore more barren than its billows and yet more than all with a remembered friend i love                            20 to ride as then i rodefor the winds drove the living spray along the sunny air into our faces the blue heavens were bare stripped to their depths by the awakening north and from the waves sound like delight broke forth                  25 harmonising with solitude and sent into our hearts aereal merriment so as we rode we talked and the swift thought winging itself with laughter lingered not but flew from brain to brainsuch glee was ours                   30 charged with light memories of remembered hours none slow enough for sadness till we came homeward which always makes the spirit tame this day had been cheerful but cold and now the sun was sinking and the wind also                              35 our talk grew somewhat serious as may be talk interrupted with such raillery as mocks itself because it cannot scorn the thoughts it would extinguish twas forlorn yet pleasing such as once so poets tell                           40 the devils held within the dales of hell concerning god freewill and destiny of all that earth has been or yet may be all that vain men imagine or believe or hope can paint or suffering may achieve                          45 we descanted and i for ever still is it not wise to make the best of ill argued against despondency but pride made my companion take the darker side the sense that he was greater than his kind                          50 had struck methinks his eagle spirit blind by gazing on its own exceeding light meanwhile the sun paused ere it should alight over the horizon of the mountainsoh how beautiful is sunset when the glow                               55 of heaven descends upon a land like thee thou paradise of exiles italy thy mountains seas and vineyards and the towers of cities they encircleit was ours to stand on thee beholding it and then                            60 just where we had dismounted the counts men were waiting for us with the gondola as those who pause on some delightful way though bent on pleasant pilgrimage we stood looking upon the evening and the flood                              65 which lay between the city and the shore paved with the image of the skythe hoar and aery alps towards the north appeared through mist an heavensustaining bulwark reared between the east and west and half the sky                          70 was roofed with clouds of rich emblazonry dark purple at the zenith which still grew down the steep west into a wondrous hue brighter than burning gold even to the rent where the swift sun yet paused in his descent                        75 among the manyfolded hills they were those famous euganean hills which bear as seen from lido thro the harbour piles the likeness of a clump of peaked isles and thenas if the earth and sea had been                           80 dissolved into one lake of fire were seen those mountains towering as from waves of flame around the vaporous sun from which there came the inmost purple spirit of light and made their very peaks transparent ere it fade                         85 said my companion i will show you soon a better stationso oer the lagune we glided and from that funereal bark i leaned and saw the city and could mark how from their many isles in evenings gleam                       90 its temples and its palaces did seem like fabrics of enchantment piled to heaven i was about to speak whenwe are even now at the point i meant said maddalo and bade the gondolieri cease to row                                95 look julian on the west and listen well if you hear not a deep and heavy bell i looked and saw between us and the sun a building on an island such a one as age to age might add for uses vile                              100 a windowless deformed and dreary pile and on the top an open tower where hung a bell which in the radiance swayed and swung we could just hear its hoarse and iron tongue the broad sun sunk behind it and it tolled                          105 in strong and black reliefwhat we behold shall be the madhouse and its belfry tower said maddalo and ever at this hour those who may cross the water hear that bell which calls the maniacs each one from his cell                     110 to vespersas much skill as need to pray in thanks or hope for their dark lot have they to their stern maker i replied o ho you talk as in years past said maddalo tis strange men change not you were ever still                    115 among christs flock a perilous infidel a wolf for the meek lambsif you cant swim beware of providence i looked on him but the gay smile had faded in his eye and suchhe cried is our mortality                            120 and this must be the emblem and the sign of what should be eternal and divine and like that black and dreary bell the soul hung in a heavenillumined tower must toll our thoughts and our desires to meet below                           125 round the rent heart and prayas madmen do for what they know nottill the night of death as sunset that strange vision severeth our memory from itself and us from all we sought and yet were baffled i recall                            130 the sense of what he said although i mar the force of his expressions the broad star of day meanwhile had sunk behind the hill and the black bell became invisible and the red tower looked gray and all between                       135 the churches ships and palaces were seen huddled in gloominto the purple sea the orange hues of heaven sunk silently we hardly spoke and soon the gondola conveyed me to my lodging by the way                                140 the following morn was rainy cold and dim ere maddalo arose i called on him and whilst i waited with his child i played a lovelier toy sweet nature never made a serious subtle wild yet gentle being                           145 graceful without design and unforeseeing with eyesoh speak not of her eyeswhich seem twin mirrors of italian heaven yet gleam with such deep meaning as we never see but in the human countenance with me                                150 she was a special favourite i had nursed her fine and feeble limbs when she came first to this bleak world and she yet seemed to know on second sight her ancient playfellow less changed than she was by six months or so                       155 for after her first shyness was worn out we sate there rolling billiard balls about when the count entered salutations past the word you spoke last night might well have cast a darkness on my spiritif man be                                   160 the passive thing you say i should not see much harm in the religions and old saws tho i may never own such leaden laws which break a teachless nature to the yoke mine is another faiththus much i spoke                           165 and noting he replied not added see this lovely child blithe innocent and free she spends a happy time with little care while we to such sick thoughts subjected are as came on you last night it is our will                            170 that thus enchains us to permitted ill we might be otherwisewe might be all we dream of happy high majestical where is the love beauty and truth we seek but in our mind and if we were not weak                             175 should we be less in deed than in desire ay if we were not weakand we aspire how vainly to be strong said maddalo you talk utopia it remains to know i then rejoined and those who try may find                         180 how strong the chains are which our spirit bind brittle perchance as strawwe are assured much may be conquered much may be endured of what degrades and crushes us we know that we have power over ourselves to do                              185 and sufferwhat we know not till we try but something nobler than to live and die so taught those kings of old philosophy who reigned before religion made men blind and those who suffer with their suffering kind                       190 yet feel their faith religion my dear friend said maddalo my judgement will not bend to your opinion though i think you might make such a system refutationtight as far as words go i knew one like you                              195 who to this city came some months ago with whom i argued in this sort and he is now gone madand so he answered me poor fellow but if you would like to go well visit him and his wild talk will show                         200 how vain are such aspiring theories i hope to prove the induction otherwise and that a want of that true theory still which seeks a soul of goodness in things ill or in himself or others has thus bowed                              205 his beingthere are some by nature proud who patient in all else demand but this to love and be beloved with gentleness and being scorned what wonder if they die some living death this is not destiny                               210 but mans own wilful ill as thus i spoke servants announced the gondola and we through the fastfalling rain and highwrought sea sailed to the island where the madhouse stands we disembarked the clap of tortured hands                          215 fierce yells and howlings and lamentings keen and laughter where complaint had merrier been moans shrieks and curses and blaspheming prayers accosted us we climbed the oozy stairs into an old courtyard i heard on high                              220 then fragments of most touching melody but looking up saw not the singer there through the black bars in the tempestuous air i saw like weeds on a wrecked palace growing long tangled locks flung wildly forth and flowing                  225 of those who on a sudden were beguiled into strange silence and looked forth and smiled hearing sweet sounds then i methinks there were a cure of these with patience and kind care if music can thus movebut what is he                              230 whom we seek here of his sad history i know but this said maddalo he came to venice a dejected man and fame said he was wealthy or he had been so some thought the loss of fortune wrought him woe                    235 but he was ever talking in such sort as you dofar more sadlyhe seemed hurt even as a man with his peculiar wrong to hear but of the oppression of the strong or those absurd deceits i think with you                            240 in some respects you know which carry through the excellent impostors of this earth when they outface detectionhe had worth poor fellow but a humorist in his way alas what drove him mad i cannot say                           245 a lady came with him from france and when she left him and returned he wandered then about yon lonely isles of desert sand till he grew wildhe had no cash or land remainingthe police had brought him here                        250 some fancy took him and he would not bear removal so i fitted up for him those rooms beside the sea to please his whim and sent him busts and books and urns for flowers which had adorned his life in happier hours                         255 and instruments of musicyou may guess a stranger could do little more or less for one so gentle and unfortunate and those are his sweet strains which charm the weight from madmens chains and make this hell appear                      260 a heaven of sacred silence hushed to hear nay this was kind of youhe had no claim as the world saysnonebut the very same which i on all mankind were i as he fallen to such deep reversehis melody                             265 is interruptednow we hear the din of madmen shriek on shriek again begin let us now visit him after this strain he ever communes with himself again and sees nor hears not any having said                             270 these words we called the keeper and he led to an apartment opening on the sea there the poor wretch was sitting mournfully near a piano his pale fingers twined one with the other and the ooze and wind                            275 rushed through an open casement and did sway his hair and starred it with the brackish spray his head was leaning on a music book and he was muttering and his lean limbs shook his lips were pressed against a folded leaf                          280 in hue too beautiful for health and grief smiled in their motions as they lay apart as one who wrought from his own fervid heart the eloquence of passion soon he raised his sad meek face and eyes lustrous and glazed                       285 and spokesometimes as one who wrote and thought his words might move some heart that heeded not if sent to distant lands and then as one reproaching deeds never to be undone with wondering selfcompassion then his speech                      290 was lost in grief and then his words came each unmodulated cold expressionless but that from one jarred accent you might guess it was despair made them so uniform and all the while the loud and gusty storm                           295 hissed through the window and we stood behind stealing his accents from the envious wind unseen i yet remember what he said distinctly such impression his words made  month after month he cried to bear this load                    300 and as a jade urged by the whip and goad to drag life on which like a heavy chain lengthens behind with many a link of pain and not to speak my griefo not to dare to give a human voice to my despair                                 305 but live and move and wretched thing smile on as if i never went aside to groan and wear this mask of falsehood even to those who are most dearnot for my own repose alas no scorn or pain or hate could be                              310 so heavy as that falsehood is to me but that i cannot bear more altered faces than needs must be more changed and cold embraces more misery disappointment and mistrust to own me for their fatherwould the dust                          315 were covered in upon my body now that the life ceased to toil within my brow and then these thoughts would at the least be fled let us not fear such pain can vex the dead  what power delights to torture us i know                           320 that to myself i do not wholly owe what now i suffer though in part i may alas none strewed sweet flowers upon the way where wandering heedlessly i met pale pain my shadow which will leave me not again                           325 if i have erred there was no joy in error but pain and insult and unrest and terror i have not as some do bought penitence with pleasure and a dark yet sweet offence for thenif love and tenderness and truth                          330 had overlived hopes momentary youth my creed should have redeemed me from repenting but loathed scorn and outrage unrelenting met love excited by far other seeming until the end was gainedas one from dreaming                      335 of sweetest peace i woke and found my state such as it is o thou my spirits mate who for thou art compassionate and wise wouldst pity me from thy most gentle eyes if this sad writing thou shouldst ever see                         340 my secret groans must be unheard by thee thou wouldst weep tears bitter as blood to know thy lost friends incommunicable woe  ye few by whom my nature has been weighed in friendship let me not that name degrade                          345 by placing on your hearts the secret load which crushes mine to dust there is one road to peace and that is truth which follow ye love sometimes leads astray to misery yet think not though subduedand i may well                         350 say that i am subduedthat the full hell within me would infect the untainted breast of sacred nature with its own unrest as some perverted beings think to find in scorn or hate a medicine for the mind                             355 which scorn or hate have woundedo how vain the dagger heals not but may rend again believe that i am ever still the same in creed as in resolve and what may tame my heart must leave the understanding free                         360 or all would sink in this keen agony nor dream that i will join the vulgar cry or with my silence sanction tyranny or seek a moments shelter from my pain in any madness which the world calls gain                           365 ambition or revenge or thoughts as stern as those which make me what i am or turn to avarice or misanthropy or lust heap on me soon o grave thy welcome dust till then the dungeon may demand its prey                           370 and poverty and shame may meet and say halting beside me on the public way that lovedevoted youth is ourslets sit beside himhe may live some six months yet or the red scaffold as our country bends                           375 may ask some willing victim or ye friends may fall under some sorrow which this heart or hand may share or vanquish or avert i am preparedin truth with no proud joy to do or suffer aught as when a boy                                 380 i did devote to justice and to love my nature worthless now i must remove a veil from my pent mind tis torn aside o pallid as deaths dedicated bride thou mockery which art sitting by my side                           385 am i not wan like thee at the graves call i haste invited to thy weddingball to greet the ghastly paramour for whom thou hast deserted meand made the tomb thy bridal bedbut i beside your feet                              390 will lie and watch ye from my windingsheet thuswide awake tho deadyet stay o stay go not so sooni know not what i say hear but my reasonsi am mad i fear my fancy is oerwroughtthou art not here                       395 pale art thou tis most truebut thou art gone thy work is finishedi am left alone  nay was it i who wooed thee to this breast which like a serpent thou envenomest as in repayment of the warmth it lent                               400 didst thou not seek me for thine own content did not thy love awaken mine i thought that thou wert she who said you kiss me not ever i fear you do not love me now in truth i loved even to my overthrow                                405 her who would fain forget these words but they cling to her mind and cannot pass away  you say that i am proudthat when i speak my lip is tortured with the wrongs which break the spirit it expressesnever one                                  410 humbled himself before as i have done even the instinctive worm on which we tread turns though it wound notthen with prostrate head sinks in the dusk and writhes like meand dies no wears a living death of agonies                                 415 as the slow shadows of the pointed grass mark the eternal periods his pangs pass slow evermovingmaking moments be as mine seemeach an immortality  that you had never seen menever heard                             420 my voice and more than all had neer endured the deep pollution of my loathed embrace that your eyes neer had lied love in my face that like some maniac monk i had torn out the nerves of manhood by their bleeding root                         425 with mine own quivering fingers so that neer our hearts had for a moment mingled there to disunite in horrorthese were not with thee like some suppressed and hideous thought which flits athwart our musings but can find                        430 no rest within a pure and gentle mind thou sealedst them with many a bare broad word and searedst my memory oer themfor i heard and can forget notthey were ministered one after one those curses mix them up                             435 like selfdestroying poisons in one cup and they will make one blessing which thou neer didst imprecate for on medeath  it were a cruel punishment for one most cruel if such can love to make that love the fuel                         440 of the minds hell hate scorn remorse despair but mewhose heart a strangers tear might wear as waterdrops the sandy fountainstone who loved and pitied all things and could moan for woes which others hear not and could see                        445 the absent with the glance of phantasy and with the poor and trampled sit and weep following the captive to his dungeon deep mewho am as a nerve oer which do creep the else unfelt oppressions of this earth                           450 and was to thee the flame upon thy hearth when all beside was coldthat thou on me shouldst rain these plagues of blistering agony such curses are from lips once eloquent with loves too partial praiselet none relent                      455 who intend deeds too dreadful for a name henceforth if an example for the same they seekfor thou on me lookedst so and so and didst speak thusand thusi live to show how much men bear and die not  thou wilt tell                                                      460 with the grimace of hate how horrible it was to meet my love when thine grew less thou wilt admire how i could eer address such features to loves workthis taunt though true for indeed nature nor in form nor hue                               465 bestowed on me her choicest workmanship shall not be thy defencefor since thy lip met mine first years long past since thine eye kindled with soft fire under mine i have not dwindled nor changed in mind or body or in aught                             470 but as love changes what it loveth not after long years and many trials  how vain are words i thought never to speak again not even in secretnot to mine own heart but from my lips the unwilling accents start                        475 and from my pen the words flow as i write dazzling my eyes with scalding tearsmy sight is dim to see that charactered in vain on this unfeeling leaf which burns the brain and eats into itblotting all things fair                          480 and wise and good which time had written there  those who inflict must suffer for they see the work of their own hearts and this must be our chastisement or recompenseo child i would that thine were like to be more mild                         485 for both our wretched sakesfor thine the most who feelest already all that thou hast lost without the power to wish it thine again and as slow years pass a funereal train each with the ghost of some lost hope or friend                      490 following it like its shadow wilt thou bend no thought on my dead memory  alas love fear me notagainst thee i would not move a finger in despite do i not live that thou mayst have less bitter cause to grieve                    495 i give thee tears for scorn and love for hate and that thy lot may be less desolate than his on whom thou tramplest i refrain from that sweet sleep which medicines all pain then when thou speakest of me never say                            500 he could forgive not here i cast away all human passions all revenge all pride i think speak act no ill i do but hide under these words like embers every spark of that which has consumed mequick and dark                        505 the grave is yawningas its roof shall cover my limbs with dust and worms under and over so let oblivion hide this griefthe air closes upon my accents as despair upon my heartlet death upon despair                              510  he ceased and overcome leant back awhile then rising with a melancholy smile went to a sofa and lay down and slept a heavy sleep and in his dreams he wept and muttered some familiar name and we                              515 wept without shame in his society i think i never was impressed so much the man who were not must have lacked a touch of human naturethen we lingered not although our argument was quite forgot                              520 but calling the attendants went to dine at maddalos yet neither cheer nor wine could give us spirits for we talked of him and nothing else till daylight made stars dim and we agreed his was some dreadful ill                              525 wrought on him boldly yet unspeakable by a dear friend some deadly change in love of one vowed deeply which he dreamed not of for whose sake he it seemed had fixed a blot of falsehood on his mind which flourished not                        530 but in the light of allbeholding truth and having stamped this canker on his youth she had abandoned himand how much more might be his woe we guessed nothe had store of friends and fortune once as we could guess                       535 from his nice habits and his gentleness these were now lostit were a grief indeed if he had changed one unsustaining reed for all that such a man might else adorn the colours of his mind seemed yet unworn                           540 for the wild language of his grief was high such as in measure were called poetry and i remember one remark which then maddalo made he said most wretched men are cradled into poetry by wrong                                    545 they learn in suffering what they teach in song  if i had been an unconnected man i from this moment should have formed some plan never to leave sweet venicefor to me it was delight to ride by the lone sea                              550 and then the town is silentone may write or read in gondolas by day or night having the little brazen lamp alight unseen uninterrupted books are there pictures and casts from all those statues fair                      555 which were twinborn with poetry and all we seek in towns with little to recall regrets for the green country i might sit in maddalos great palace and his wit and subtle talk would cheer the winter night                         560 and make me know myself and the firelight would flash upon our faces till the day might dawn and make me wonder at my stay but i had friends in london too the chief attraction here was that i sought relief                            565 from the deep tenderness that maniac wrought within metwas perhaps an idle thought but i imagined that if day by day i watched him and but seldom went away and studied all the beatings of his heart                            570 with zeal as men study some stubborn art for their own good and could by patience find an entrance to the caverns of his mind i might reclaim him from this dark estate in friendships i had been most fortunate                           575 yet never saw i one whom i would call more willingly my friend and this was all accomplished not such dreams of baseless good oft come and go in crowds or solitude and leave no tracebut what i now designed                          580 made for long years impression on my mind the following morning urged by my affairs i left bright venice after many years and many changes i returned the name of venice and its aspect was the same                             585 but maddalo was travelling far away among the mountains of armenia his dog was dead his child had now become a woman such as it has been my doom to meet with fewa wonder of this earth                           590 where there is little of transcendent worth like one of shakespeares women kindly she and with a manner beyond courtesy received her fathers friend and when i asked of the lorn maniac she her memory tasked                           595 and told as she had heard the mournful tale that the poor sufferers health began to fail two years from my departure but that then the lady who had left him came again her mien had been imperious but she now                             600 looked meekperhaps remorse had brought her low her coming made him better and they stayed together at my fathersfor i played as i remember with the ladys shawl i might be six years oldbut after all                              605 she left himwhy her heart must have been tough how did it end and was not this enough they metthey partedchild is there no more something within that interval which bore the stamp of why they parted how they met                          610 yet if thine aged eyes disdain to wet those wrinkled cheeks with youths remembered tears ask me no more but let the silent years be closed and cered over their memory as yon mute marble where their corpses lie                         615 i urged and questioned still she told me how all happenedbut the cold world shall not know   cancelled fragments of julian and maddalo  what think you the dead are why dust and clay what should they be tis the last hour of day look on the west how beautiful it is                                620 vaulted with radiant vapours the deep bliss of that unutterable light has made the edges of that cloud  fade into a hue like some harmonious thought wasting itself on that which it had wrought                         625 till it dies  and  between the light hues of the tender pure serene and infinite tranquillity of heaven ay beautiful but when not  perhaps the only comfort which remains                              630 is the unheeded

eligible that we should remain a few weeks in the neighbourhood of that city he accepted the offer of lord byron who lent him the use of a villa he rented near este and he sent for his family from lucca to join him  i capuccini was a villa built on the site of a capuchin convent demolished when the french suppressed religious houses it was situated on the very overhanging brow of a low hill at the foot of a range of higher ones the house was cheerful and pleasant a vinetrellised walk a pergola as it is called in italian led from the halldoor to a summerhouse at the end of the garden which shelley made his study and in which he began the prometheus and here also as he mentions in a letter he wrote julian and maddalo a slight ravine with a road in its depth divided the garden from the hill on which stood the ruins of the ancient castle of este whose dark massive wall gave forth an echo and from whose ruined crevices owls and bats flitted forth at night as the crescent moon sunk behind the black and heavy battlements we looked from the garden over the wide plain of lombardy bounded to the west by the far apennines while to the east the horizon was lost in misty distance after the picturesque but limited view of mountain ravine and chestnutwood at the baths of lucca there was something infinitely gratifying to the eye in the wide range of prospect commanded by our new abode  our first misfortune of the kind from which we soon suffered even more severely happened here our little girl an infant in whose small features i fancied that i traced great resemblance to her father showed symptoms of suffering from the heat of the climate teething increased her illness and danger we were at este and when we became alarmed hastened to venice for the best advice when we arrived at fusina we found that we had forgotten our passport and the soldiers on duty attempted to prevent our crossing the laguna but they could not resist shelleys impetuosity at such a moment we had scarcely arrived at venice before life fled from the little sufferer and we returned to este to weep her loss  after a few weeks spent in this retreat which was interspersed by visits to venice we proceeded

volume   preface  the greek tragic writers in selecting as their subject any portion of their national history or mythology employed in their treatment of it a certain arbitrary discretion they by no means conceived themselves bound to adhere to the common interpretation or to imitate in story as in title their rivals and predecessors such a system would have amounted to a resignation of those claims to preference over their competitors which incited the composition the agamemnonian story was exhibited on the athenian theatre with as many variations as dramas  i have presumed to employ a similar license the prometheus unbound of aeschylus supposed the reconciliation of jupiter with his victim as the price of the disclosure of the danger threatened to his empire by the consummation of his marriage with thetis thetis according to this view of the subject was given in marriage to peleus and prometheus by the permission of jupiter delivered from his captivity by hercules had i framed my story on this model i should have done no more than have attempted to restore the lost drama of aeschylus an ambition which if my preference to this mode of treating the subject had incited me to cherish the recollection of the high comparison such an attempt would challenge might well abate but in truth i was averse from a catastrophe so feeble as that of reconciling the champion with the oppressor of mankind the moral interest of the fable which is so powerfully sustained by the sufferings and endurance of prometheus would be annihilated if we could conceive of him as unsaying his high language and quailing before his successful and perfidious adversary the only imaginary being resembling in any degree prometheus is satan and prometheus is in my judgement a more poetical character than satan because in addition to courage and majesty and firm and patient opposition to omnipotent force he is susceptible of being described as exempt from the taints of ambition envy revenge and a desire for personal aggrandisement which in the hero of paradise lost interfere with the interest the character of satan engenders in the mind a pernicious casuistry which leads us to weigh his faults with his wrongs and to excuse the former because the latter exceed all measure in the minds of those who consider that magnificent fiction with a religious feeling it engenders something worse but prometheus is as it were the type of the highest perfection of moral and intellectual nature impelled by the purest and the truest motives to the best and noblest ends  this poem was chiefly written upon the mountainous ruins of the baths of caracalla among the flowery glades and thickets of odoriferous blossoming trees which are extended in ever winding labyrinths upon its immense platforms and dizzy arches suspended in the air the bright blue sky of rome and the effect of the vigorous awakening spring in that divinest climate and the new life with which it drenches the spirits even to intoxication were the inspiration of this drama  the imagery which i have employed will be found in many instances to have been drawn from the operations of the human mind or from those external actions by which they are expressed this is unusual in modern poetry although dante and shakespeare are full of instances of the same kind dante indeed more than any other poet and with greater success but the greek poets as writers to whom no resource of awakening the sympathy of their contemporaries was unknown were in the habitual use of this power and it is the study of their works since a higher merit would probably be denied me to which i am willing that my readers should impute this singularity  one word is due in candour to the degree in which the study of contemporary writings may have tinged my composition for such has been a topic of censure with regard to poems far more popular and indeed more deservedly popular than mine it is impossible that any one who inhabits the same age with such writers as those who stand in the foremost ranks of our own can conscientiously assure himself that his language and tone of thought may not have been modified by the study of the productions of those extraordinary intellects it is true that not the spirit of their genius but the forms in which it has manifested itself are due less to the peculiarities of their own minds than to the peculiarity of the moral and intellectual condition of the minds among which they have been produced thus a number of writers possess the form whilst they want the spirit of those whom it is alleged they imitate because the former is the endowment of the age in which they live and the latter must be the uncommunicated lightning of their own mind  the peculiar style of intense and comprehensive imagery which distinguishes the modern literature of england has not been as a general power the product of the imitation of any particular writer the mass of capabilities remains at every period materially the same the circumstances which awaken it to action perpetually change if england were divided into forty republics each equal in population and extent to athens there is no reason to suppose but that under institutions not more perfect than those of athens each would produce philosophers and poets equal to those who if we except shakespeare have never been surpassed we owe the great writers of the golden age of our literature to that fervid awakening of the public mind which shook to dust the oldest and most oppressive form of the christian religion we owe milton to the progress and development of the same spirit the sacred milton was let it ever be remembered a republican and a bold inquirer into morals and religion the great writers of our own age are we have reason to suppose the companions and forerunners of some unimagined change in our social condition or the opinions which cement it the cloud of mind is discharging its collected lightning and the equilibrium between institutions and opinions is now restoring or is about to be restored  as to imitation poetry is a mimetic art it creates but it creates by combination and representation poetical abstractions are beautiful and new not because the portions of which they are composed had no previous existence in the mind of man or in nature but because the whole produced by their combination has some intelligible and beautiful analogy with those sources of emotion and thought and with the contemporary condition of them one great poet is a masterpiece of nature which another not only ought to study but must study he might as wisely and as easily determine that his mind should no longer be the mirror of all that is lovely in the visible universe as exclude from his contemplation the beautiful which exists in the writings of a great contemporary the pretence of doing it would be a presumption in any but the greatest the effect even in him would be strained unnatural and ineffectual a poet is the combined product of such internal powers as modify the nature of others and of such external influences as excite and sustain these powers he is not one but both every mans mind is in this respect modified by all the objects of nature and art by every word and every suggestion which he ever admitted to act upon his consciousness it is the mirror upon which all forms are reflected and in which they compose one form poets not otherwise than philosophers painters sculptors and musicians are in one sense the creators and in another the creations of their age from this subjection the loftiest do not escape there is a similarity between homer and hesiod between aeschylus and euripides between virgil and horace between dante and petrarch between shakespeare and fletcher between dryden and pope each has a generic resemblance under which their specific distinctions are arranged if this similarity be the result of imitation i am willing to confess that i have imitated  let this opportunity be conceded to me of acknowledging that i have what a scotch philosopher characteristically terms a passion for reforming the world what passion incited him to write and publish his book he omits to explain for my part i had rather be damned with plato and lord bacon than go to heaven with paley and malthus but it is a mistake to suppose that i dedicate my poetical compositions solely to the direct enforcement of reform or that i consider them in any degree as containing a reasoned system on the theory of human life didactic poetry is my abhorrence nothing can be equally well expressed in prose that is not tedious and supererogatory in verse my purpose has hitherto been simply to familiarise the highly refined imagination of the more select classes of poetical readers with beautiful idealisms of moral excellence aware that until the mind can love and admire and trust and hope and endure reasoned principles of moral conduct are seeds cast upon the highway of life which the unconscious passenger tramples into dust although they would bear the harvest of his happiness should i live to accomplish what i purpose that is produce a systematical history of what appear to me to be the genuine elements of human society let not the advocates of injustice and superstition flatter themselves that i should take aeschylus rather than plato as my model  the having spoken of myself with unaffected freedom will need little apology with the candid and let the uncandid consider that they injure me less than their own hearts and minds by misrepresentation whatever talents a person may possess to amuse and instruct others be they ever so inconsiderable he is yet bound to exert them if his attempt be ineffectual let the punishment of an unaccomplished purpose have been sufficient let none trouble themselves to heap the dust of oblivion upon his efforts the pile they raise will betray his grave which might otherwise have been unknown

55 than any voice but thine sweetest of all a long long sound as it would never end and all the inhabitants leaped suddenly out of their rest and gathered in the streets looking in wonder up to heaven while yet                            60 the music pealed along i hid myself within a fountain in the public square where i lay like the reflex of the moon seen in a wave under green leaves and soon those ugly human shapes and visages                                  65 of which i spoke as having wrought me pain passed floating through the air and fading still into the winds that scattered them and those from whom they passed seemed mild and lovely forms after some foul disguise had fallen and all                         70 were somewhat changed and after brief surprise and greetings of delighted wonder all went to their sleep again and when the dawn came wouldst thou think that toads and snakes and efts could eer be beautiful yet so they were                           75 and that with little change of shape or hue all things had put their evil nature off i cannot tell my joy when oer a lake upon a drooping bough with nightshade twined i saw two azure halcyons clinging downward                           80 and thinning one bright bunch of amber berries with quick long beaks and in the deep there lay those lovely forms imaged as in a sky so with my thoughts full of these

transformed as if the sense of love dissolved in them had folded itself round the sphered world my vision then grew clear and i could see into the mysteries of the universe

england never to return his principal motive was the hope that his health would be improved by a milder climate he suffered very much during the winter previous to his emigration and this decided his vacillating purpose in december 1817 he had written from marlow to a friend saying  my health has been materially worse my feelings at intervals are of a deadly and torpid kind or awakened to such a state of unnatural and keen excitement that only to instance the organ of sight i find the very blades of grass and the boughs of distant trees present themselves to me with microscopic distinctness towards evening i sink into a state of lethargy and inanimation and often remain for hours on the sofa between sleep and waking a prey to the most painful irritability of thought such with little intermission is my condition the hours devoted to study are selected with vigilant caution from among these periods of endurance it is not for this that i think of travelling to italy even if i knew that italy would relieve me but i have experienced a decisive pulmonary attack and although at present it has passed away without any considerable vestige of its existence yet this symptom sufficiently shows the true nature of my disease to be consumptive it is to my advantage that this malady is in its nature slow and if one is sufficiently alive to its advances is susceptible of cure from a warm climate in the event of its assuming any decided shape it would be my duty to go to italy without delay it is not mere health but life that i should seek and that not for my own sakei feel i am capable of trampling on all such weakness but for the sake of those to whom my life may be a source of happiness utility security and honour and to some of whom my death might be all that is the reverse  in almost every respect his journey to italy was advantageous he left behind friends to whom he was attached but cares of a thousand kinds many springing from his lavish generosity crowded round him in his native country and except the society of one or two friends he had no compensation the climate caused him to consume half his existence in helpless suffering his dearest pleasure the free enjoyment of the scenes of nature was marred by the same circumstance  he went direct to italy avoiding even paris and did not make any pause till he arrived at milan the first aspect of italy enchanted shelley it seemed a garden of delight placed beneath a clearer and brighter heaven than any he had lived under before he wrote long descriptive letters during the first year of his residence in italy which as compositions are the most beautiful in the world and show how truly he appreciated and studied the wonders of nature and art in that divine land  the poetical spirit within him speedily revived with all the power and with more than all the beauty of his first attempts he meditated three subjects as the groundwork for lyrical dramas one was the story of tasso of this a slight fragment of a song of tasso remains the other was one founded on the book of job which he never abandoned in idea but of which no trace remains among his papers the third was the prometheus unbound the greek tragedians were now his most familiar companions in his wanderings and the sublime majesty of aeschylus filled him with wonder and delight the father of greek tragedy does not possess the pathos of sophocles nor the variety and tenderness of euripides the interest on which he founds his dramas is often elevated above human vicissitudes into the mighty passions and throes of gods and demigods such fascinated the abstract imagination of shelley  we spent a month at milan visiting the lake of como during that interval thence we passed in succession to pisa leghorn the baths of lucca venice este rome naples and back again to rome whither we returned early in march 1819 during all this time shelley meditated the subject of his drama and wrote portions of it other poems were composed during this interval and while at the bagni di lucca he translated platos symposium but though he diversified his studies his thoughts centred in the prometheus at last when at rome during a bright and beautiful spring he gave up his whole time to the composition the spot selected for his study was as he mentions in his preface the mountainous ruins of the baths of caracalla these are little known to the ordinary visitor at rome he describes them in a letter with that poetry and delicacy and truth of description which render his narrated impressions of scenery of unequalled beauty and interest  at first he completed the drama in three acts it was not till several months after when at florence that he conceived that a fourth act a sort of hymn of rejoicing in the fulfilment of the prophecies with regard to prometheus ought to be added to complete the composition  the prominent feature of shelleys theory of the destiny of the human species was that evil is not inherent in the system of the creation but an accident that might be expelled this also forms a portion of christianity god made earth and man perfect till he by his fall  brought death into the world and all our woe  shelley believed that mankind had only to will that there should be no evil and there would be none it is not my part in these notes to notice the arguments that have been urged against this opinion but to mention the fact that he entertained it and was indeed attached to it with fervent enthusiasm that man could be so perfectionized as to be able to expel evil from his own nature and from the greater part of the creation was the cardinal point of his system and the subject he loved best to dwell on was the image of one warring with the evil principle oppressed not only by it but by alleven the good who were deluded into considering evil a necessary portion of humanity a victim full of fortitude and hope and the spirit of triumph emanating from a reliance in the ultimate omnipotence of good such he had depicted in his last poem when he made laon the enemy and the victim of tyrants he now took a more idealized image of the same subject he followed certain classical authorities in figuring saturn as the good principle jupiter the usurping evil one and prometheus as the regenerator who unable to bring mankind back to primitive innocence used knowledge as a weapon to defeat evil by leading mankind beyond the state wherein they are sinless through ignorance to that in which they are virtuous through wisdom jupiter punished the temerity of the titan by chaining him to a rock of caucasus and causing a vulture to devour his stillrenewed heart there was a prophecy afloat in heaven portending the fall of jove the secret of averting which was known only to prometheus and the god offered freedom from torture on condition of its being communicated to him according to the mythological story this referred to the offspring of thetis who was destined to be greater than his father prometheus at last bought pardon for his crime of enriching mankind with his gifts by revealing the prophecy hercules killed the vulture and set him free and thetis was married to peleus the father of achilles  shelley adapted the catastrophe of this story to his peculiar views the son greater than his father born of the nuptials of jupiter and thetis was to dethrone evil and bring back a happier reign than that of saturn prometheus defies the power of his enemy and endures centuries of torture till the hour arrives when jove blind to the real event but darkly guessing that some great good to himself will flow espouses thetis at the moment the primal power of the world drives him from his usurped throne and strength in the person of hercules liberates humanity typified in prometheus from the tortures generated by evil done or suffered asia one of the oceanides is the wife of prometheusshe was according to other mythological interpretations the same as venus and nature when the benefactor of mankind is liberated nature resumes the beauty of her prime and is united to her husband the emblem of the human race in perfect and happy union in the fourth act the poet gives further scope to his imagination and idealizes the forms of creationsuch as we know them instead of such as they appeared to the greeks maternal earth the mighty parent is superseded by the spirit of the earth the guide of our planet through the realms of sky while his fair and weaker companion and attendant the spirit of the moon receives bliss from the annihilation of evil in the superior sphere  shelley develops more particularly in the lyrics of this drama his abstruse and imaginative theories with regard to the creation it requires a mind as subtle and penetrating as his own to understand the mystic meanings scattered throughout the poem they elude the ordinary reader by their abstraction and delicacy of distinction but they are far from vague it was his design to write prose metaphysical essays on the nature of man which would have served to explain much of what is obscure in his poetry a few scattered fragments of observations and remarks alone remain he considered these philosophical views of mind and nature to be instinct with the intensest spirit of poetry  more popular poets clothe the ideal with familiar and sensible imagery shelley loved to idealize the realto gift the mechanism of the material universe with a soul and a voice and to bestow such also on the most delicate and abstract emotions and thoughts of the mind sophocles was his great master in this species of imagery  i find in one of his manuscript books some remarks on a line in the oedipus tyrannus which show at once the critical subtlety of shelleys mind and explain his apprehension of those minute and remote distinctions of feeling whether relative to external nature or the living beings which surround us which he pronounces in the letter quoted in the note to the revolt of islam to comprehend all that is sublime in man  in the greek shakespeare sophocles we find the image  pollas d odous elthonta phrontidos planois  a line of almost unfathomable depth of poetry yet how simple are the images in which it is arrayed  coming to many ways in the wanderings of careful thought  if the words odous and planois had not been used the line might have been explained in a metaphorical instead of an absolute sense as we say ways and means and wanderings for error and confusion but they meant literally paths or roads such as we tread with our feet and wanderings such as a man makes when he loses himself in a desert or roams from city to cityas oedipus the speaker of this verse was destined to wander blind and asking charity what a picture does this line suggest of the mind as a wilderness of intricate paths wide as the universe which is here made its symbol a world within a world which he who seeks some knowledge with respect to what he ought to do searches throughout as he would search the external universe for some valued thing which was hidden from him upon its surface  in reading shelleys poetry we often find similar verses resembling but not imitating the greek in this species of imagery for though he adopted the style he gifted it with that originality of form and colouring which sprung from his own genius  in the prometheus unbound shelley fulfils the promise quoted from a letter in the note on the revolt of islam while correcting the proofsheets of that poem it struck me that the poet had indulged in an exaggerated view of the evils of restored despotism which however injurious and degrading were less openly sanguinary than the triumph of anarchy such as it appeared in france at the close of the last century but at this time a book scenes of spanish life translated by lieutenant crawford from the german of dr huber of rostock fell into my hands the account of the triumph of the priests and the serviles after the french invasion of spain in 1823 bears a strong and frightful resemblance to some of the descriptions of the massacre of the patriots in the revolt of islam the tone of the composition is calmer and more majestic the poetry more perfect as a whole and the imagination displayed at once more pleasingly beautiful and more varied and daring the description of the hours as they are seen in the cave of demogorgon is an instance of thisit fills the mind as the most charming picturewe long to see an artist at work to bring to our view the  cars drawn by rainbowwinged steeds which trample the dim winds in each there stands a wildeyed charioteer urging their flight some look behind as fiends pursued them there and yet i see no shapes but the keen stars others with burning eyes lean forth and drink with eager lips the wind of their own speed as if the thing they loved fled on before and now even now they clasped it their bright locks stream like a comets flashing hair they all sweep onward  through the whole poem there reigns a sort of calm and holy spirit of love it soothes the tortured and is hope to the expectant till the prophecy is fulfilled and love untainted by any evil becomes the law of the world  england had been rendered a painful residence to shelley as much by the sort of persecution with which in those days all men of liberal opinions were visited and by the injustice he had lately endured in the court of chancery as by the symptoms of disease which made him regard a visit to italy as necessary to prolong his life an exile and strongly impressed with the feeling that the majority of his countrymen regarded him with sentiments of aversion such as his own heart could experience towards none he sheltered himself from such disgusting and painful thoughts in the calm retreats of poetry and built up a world of his ownwith the more pleasure since he hoped to induce some one or two to believe that the earth might become such did mankind themselves consent the charm of the roman climate helped to clothe his thoughts in greater beauty than they had ever worn before and as he wandered among the ruins made one with nature in their decay or gazed on the praxitelean shapes that throng the vatican the capitol and the palaces of rome his soul imbibed forms of loveliness which became a portion of itself there are many passages in the prometheus which show the intense delight he received from such studies and give back the impression with a beauty of poetical description peculiarly his own he felt this as a poet must feel when he satisfies himself by the result of his labours and he wrote from rome my prometheus unbound is just finished and in a month or two i shall send it it is a drama with characters and mechanism of a kind yet unattempted and i think the execution is better than any of my former attempts  i may mention for the information of the more critical reader that the verbal alterations in this edition of prometheus are made

with your name from a distant country and after an absence whose months have seemed years this the latest of my literary efforts  those writings which i have hitherto published have been little else than visions which impersonate my own apprehensions of the beautiful and the just i can also perceive in them the literary defects incidental to youth and impatience they are dreams of what ought to

during my travels in italy which was copied from the archives of the cenci palace at rome and contains a detailed account of the horrors which ended in the extinction of one of the noblest and richest families of that city during the pontificate of clement viii in the year 1599 the story is that an old man having spent his life in debauchery and wickedness conceived at length an implacable hatred towards his children which showed itself towards one daughter under the form of an incestuous passion aggravated by every circumstance of cruelty and violence this daughter after long and vain attempts to escape from what she considered a perpetual contamination both of body and mind at length plotted with her motherinlaw and brother to murder their common tyrant the young maiden who was urged to this tremendous deed by an impulse which overpowered its horror was evidently a most gentle and amiable being a creature formed to adorn and be admired and thus violently thwarted from her nature by the necessity of circumstance and opinion the deed was quickly discovered and in spite of the most earnest prayers made to the pope by the highest persons in rome the criminals were put to death the old man had during his life repeatedly bought his pardon from the pope for capital crimes of the most enormous and unspeakable kind at the price of a hundred thousand crowns the death therefore of his victims can scarcely be accounted for by the love of justice the pope among other motives for severity probably felt that whoever killed the count cenci deprived his treasury of a certain and copious source of revenue the papal government formerly took the most extraordinary precautions against the publicity of facts which offer so tragical a demonstration of its own wickedness and weakness so that the communication of the manuscript had become until very lately a matter of some difficulty such a story if told so as to present to the reader all the feelings of those who once acted it their hopes and fears their confidences and misgivings their various interests passions and opinions acting upon and with each other yet all conspiring to one tremendous end would be as a light to make apparent some of the most dark and secret caverns of the human heart  on my arrival at rome i found that the story of the cenci was a subject not to be mentioned in italian society without awakening a deep and breathless interest and that the feelings of the company never failed to incline to a romantic pity for the wrongs and a passionate exculpation of the horrible deed to which they urged her who has been mingled two centuries with the common dust all ranks of people knew the outlines of this history and participated in the overwhelming interest which it seems to have the magic of exciting in the human heart i had a copy of guidos picture of beatrice which is preserved in the colonna palace and my servant instantly recognized it as the portrait of la cenci  this national and universal interest which the story produces and has produced for two centuries and among all ranks of people in a great city where the imagination is kept for ever active and awake first suggested to me the conception of its fitness for a dramatic purpose in fact it is a tragedy which has already received from its capacity of awakening and sustaining the sympathy of men approbation and success nothing remained as i imagined but to clothe it to the apprehensions of my countrymen in such language and action as would bring it home to their hearts the deepest and the sublimest tragic compositions king lear and the two plays in which the tale of oedipus is told were stories which already existed in tradition as matters of popular belief and interest before shakspeare and sophocles made them familiar to the sympathy of all succeeding generations of mankind  this story of the cenci is indeed eminently fearful and monstrous anything like a dry exhibition of it on the stage would be insupportable the person who would treat such a subject must increase the ideal and diminish the actual horror of the events so that the pleasure which arises from the poetry which exists in these tempestuous sufferings and crimes may mitigate the pain of the contemplation of the moral deformity from which they spring there must also be nothing attempted to make the exhibition subservient to what is vulgarly termed a moral purpose the highest moral purpose aimed at in the highest species of the drama is the teaching the human heart through its sympathies and antipathies the knowledge of itself in proportion to the possession of which knowledge every human being is wise just sincere tolerant and kind if dogmas can do more it is well but a drama is no fit place for the enforcement of them undoubtedly no person can be truly dishonoured by the act of another and the fit return to make to the most enormous injuries is kindness and forbearance and a resolution to convert the injurer from his dark passions by peace and love revenge retaliation atonement are pernicious mistakes if beatrice had thought in this manner she would have been wiser and better but she would never have been a tragic character the few whom such an exhibition would have interested could never have been sufficiently interested for a dramatic purpose from the want of finding sympathy in their interest among the mass who surround them it is in the restless and anatomizing casuistry with which men seek the justification of beatrice yet feel that she has done what needs justification it is in the superstitious horror with which they contemplate alike her wrongs and their revenge that the dramatic character of what she did and suffered consists  i have endeavoured as nearly as possible to represent the characters as they probably were and have sought to avoid the error of making them actuated by my own conceptions of right or wrong false or true thus under a thin veil converting names and actions of the sixteenth century into cold impersonations of my own mind they are represented as catholics and as catholics deeply tinged with religion to a protestant apprehension there will appear something unnatural in the earnest and perpetual sentiment of the relations between god and men which pervade the tragedy of the cenci it will especially be startled at the combination of an undoubting persuasion of the truth of the popular religion with a cool and determined perseverance in enormous guilt but religion in italy is not as in protestant countries a cloak to be worn on particular days or a passport which those who do not wish to be railed at carry with them to exhibit or a gloomy passion for penetrating the impenetrable mysteries of our being which terrifies its possessor at the darkness of the abyss to the brink of which it has conducted him religion coexists as it were in the mind of an italian catholic with a faith in that of which all men have the most certain knowledge it is interwoven with the whole fabric of life it is adoration faith submission penitence blind admiration not a rule for moral conduct it has no necessary connection with any one virtue the most atrocious villain may be rigidly devout and without any shock to established faith confess himself to be so religion pervades intensely the whole frame of society and is according to the temper of the mind which it inhabits a passion a persuasion an excuse a refuge never a check cenci himself built a chapel in the court of his palace and dedicated it to st thomas the apostle and established masses for the peace of his soul thus in the first scene of the fourth act lucretias design in exposing herself to the consequences of an expostulation with cenci after having administered the opiate was to induce him by a feigned tale to confess himself before death this being esteemed by catholics as essential to salvation and she only relinquishes her purpose when she perceives that her perseverance would expose beatrice to new outrages  i have avoided with great care in writing this play the introduction of what is commonly called mere poetry and i imagine there will scarcely be found a detached simile or a single isolated description unless beatrices description of the chasm appointed for her fathers murder should be judged to be of that nature an idea in this speech was suggested by a most sublime passage in el purgaterio de san patricio of calderon the only plagiarism which i have intentionally committed in the whole piece  in a dramatic composition the imagery and the passion should interpenetrate one another the former being reserved simply for the full development and illustration of the latter imagination is as the immortal god which should assume flesh for the redemption of mortal passion it is thus that the most remote and the most familiar imagery may alike be fit for dramatic purposes when employed in the illustration of strong feeling which raises what is low and levels to the apprehension that which is lofty casting over all the shadow of its own greatness in other respects i have written more carelessly that is without an overfastidious and learned choice of words in this respect i entirely agree with those modern critics who assert that in order to move men to true sympathy we must use the familiar language of men and that our great ancestors the ancient english poets are the writers a study of whom might incite us to do that for our own age which they have done for theirs but it must be the real language of men in general and not that of any particular class to whose society the writer happens to belong so much for what i have attempted i need not be assured that success is a very different matter particularly for one whose attention has but newly been awakened to the study of dramatic literature  i endeavoured whilst at rome to observe such monuments of this story as might be accessible to a stranger the portrait of beatrice at the colonna palace is admirable as a work of art it was taken by guido during her confinement in prison but it is most interesting as a just representation of one of the loveliest specimens of the workmanship of nature there is a fixed and pale composure upon the features she seems sad and stricken down in spirit yet the despair thus expressed is lightened by the patience of gentleness her head is bound with folds of white drapery from which the yellow strings of her golden hair escape and fall about her neck the moulding of her face is exquisitely delicate the eyebrows are distinct and arched the lips have that permanent meaning of imagination and sensibility which suffering has not repressed and which it seems as if death scarcely could extinguish her forehead is large and clear her eyes which we are told were remarkable for their vivacity are swollen with weeping and lustreless but beautifully tender and serene in the whole mien there is a simplicity and dignity which united with her exquisite loveliness and deep sorrow are inexpressibly pathetic beatrice cenci appears to have been one of those rare persons in whom energy and gentleness dwell together without destroying one another her nature was simple and profound the crimes and miseries in which she was an actor and a sufferer are as the mask and the mantle in which circumstances clothed her for her impersonation on the scene of the world  the cenci palace is of great extent and though in part modernized there yet remains a vast and gloomy pile of feudal architecture in the same state as during the dreadful scenes which are the subject of this tragedy the palace is situated in an obscure corner of rome near the quarter of the jews and from the upper windows you see the immense ruins of mount palatine half hidden under their profuse overgrowth of trees there is a court in one part of the palace perhaps that in which cenci built the chapel to st thomas supported by granite columns and adorned with antique friezes of fine workmanship and built up according to the ancient italian fashion with balcony over balcony of openwork one of the gates of the palace formed of immense stones and leading through a passage dark and lofty and opening into gloomy subterranean chambers struck me particularly  of the castle of petrella i could obtain no

                  35 after that dreadful feast could it be worse than when he smiled and cried my sons are dead and every one looked in his neighbours face to see if others were as white as he at the first word he spoke i felt the blood                          40 rush to my heart and fell into a trance and when it passed i sat all weak and wild whilst you alone stood up and with strong words checked his unnatural pride and i could see the devil was rebuked that lives in him                             45 until this hour thus you have ever stood between us and your fathers moody wrath like a protecting presence your firm mind has been our only refuge and defence what can have thus subdued it what can now                          50 have given you that cold melancholy look succeeding to

beatrice and bernardo aside so much has passed between us as must make me bold her fearfultis an awful thing to touch such mischief as i now conceive                            125 so men sit shivering on the dewy bank and try the chill stream with their feet once in how the delighted spirit pants for joy  lucretia advancing timidly towards him o husband pray forgive poor beatrice she

conspiring you said nothing of how i might be dungeoned as a madman or be condemned to death for some offence and you would be the witnessesthis failing                       140 how just it were to hire assassins or put sudden poison in my evening drink or smother me when overcome by wine seeing we had no other judge but god and he had sentenced me and there were none                         145 but you to be the executioners of his decree enregistered in heaven oh no you said not this  lucretia so help me god i never thought the things you charge me with  cenci if you dare to speak that wicked lie again                           150 ill kill you what it was not by your counsel that beatrice disturbed the feast last night you did not hope to stir some enemies against me and escape and laugh to scorn what every nerve of you now trembles at                             155 you judged that men were bolder than they are few dare to stand between their grave and me  lucretia look not so dreadfully by my salvation i knew not aught that beatrice designed nor do i think she designed any thing                                160 until she heard you talk of her dead brothers  cenci blaspheming liar you are damned for this but i will take you where you may persuade the stones you tread on to deliver you for men shall there be none but those who dare                       165 all

highborn necessities which i could meet not by my daily toil the eldest son of a rich nobleman                                    10 is heir to all his incapacities he has wide wants and narrow powers

the pope would interpose                            25 and stretch authority beyond the law  camillo though your peculiar case is hard i know the pope will not divert the course of law after that impious feast the other night i spoke with him and urged him then to check                        30 your fathers cruel hand he frowned and said children are disobedient and they sting their fathers

known the crime of my destroyer and that done                            155 my tongue should like a knife tear out the secret which cankers my hearts core ay lay all bare so that my unpolluted fame

   180  orsino blaspheme not his high providence commits its glory on this earth and their own wrongs into the hands of men if they neglect to punish crime  lucretia but if one like this wretch should mock with gold opinion law and power                     185 if there be no appeal to that which makes the guiltiest tremble if because our wrongs for that they are unnatural strange and monstrous exceed all measure of belief o god if for the very reasons which should make                           190 redress most swift and sure our injurer triumphs and we the victims bear worse punishment than that appointed for their torturer  orsino think not but that there is redress where there is wrong so we be bold enough to seize it  lucretia how                                                                 195 if there were any way to make all sure i know notbut i think it might be good to  orsino why his late outrage to beatrice for it is such as i but faintly guess as makes remorse dishonour and leaves her                           200 only one duty how she may avenge you but one refuge from ills ill endured me but one counsel  lucretia for we cannot hope that aid or retribution or resource will arise thence where every other one                             205 might find them with less need  beatrice advances  orsino then  beatrice peace orsino and honoured lady while i speak i pray that you put off as garments overworn forbearance and respect remorse and fear and all the fit restraints of daily life                            210 which have been borne from childhood but which now would be a mockery to my holier plea as i have said i have endured a wrong which though it be expressionless is such as asks atonement both for what is past                            215 and lest i be reserved day after day to load with crimes an overburthened soul and bewhat ye can dream not i have prayed to god and i have talked with my own heart and have unravelled my entangled will                               220 and have at length determined what is right art thou my friend orsino false or true pledge thy salvation ere i speak  orsino i swear to dedicate my cunning and my strength my silence and whatever else is mine                               225 to thy commands  lucretia you think we should devise his death  beatrice and execute what is devised and suddenly we must be brief and bold  orsino and yet most cautious  lucretia for the jealous laws would punish us with death and infamy                                230 for that which it became themselves to do  beatrice be cautious as ye may but prompt orsino what are the means  orsino i know two dull fierce outlaws who think mans spirit as a worms and they would trample out for any slight caprice                           235 the meanest or the noblest life this mood is marketable here in rome they sell what we now want  lucretia tomorrow before dawn cenci will take us to that lonely rock petrella in the apulian apennines                                  240 if he arrive there  beatrice he must not arrive  orsino will it be dark before you reach the tower  lucretia the sun will scarce be set  beatrice but i remember two miles on this side of the fort the road crosses a deep ravine tis rough and narrow                        245 and winds with short turns down the precipice and in its depth there is a mighty rock which has from unimaginable years sustained itself with terror and with toil over a gulf and with the agony                                      250 with which it clings seems slowly coming down even as a wretched soul hour after hour clings to the mass of life yet clinging leans and leaning makes more dark the dread abyss in which it fears to fall beneath this crag                         255 huge as despair as if in weariness the melancholy mountain yawnsbelow you hear but see not an impetuous torrent raging among the caverns and a bridge crosses the chasm and high above there grow                        260 with intersecting trunks from crag to crag cedars and yews and pines whose tangled hair is matted in one solid roof of shade by the dark ivys twine at noonday here tis twilight and at sunset blackest night                         265  orsino before you reach that bridge make some excuse for spurring on your mules or loitering until  beatrice what sound is that  lucretia hark no it cannot be a servants step it must be cenci unexpectedly                                       270 returnedmake some excuse for being here  beatrice to orsino as she goes out that step we hear approach must never pass the bridge of which we spoke  exeunt lucretia and beatrice  orsino what shall i do cenci must find me here and i must bear the imperious inquisition of his looks                               275 as to what brought me hither let me mask mine own in some inane and vacant smile enter giacomo in a hurried manner how have you ventured hither know you then

slanderer to the slandered foe to foe                          285 he has cast nature off which was his shield and nature casts him off who is her shame and i spurn both is it a fathers throat which i will shake and say i ask not gold i ask not happy years nor memories                                  290 of tranquil childhood nor homesheltered love though all these hast thou torn from me and more but only my fair fame only one hoard of peace which i thought hidden from thy hate under the penury heaped on me by thee                               295 or i willgod can understand and pardon why should i speak with man  orsino be calm dear friend  giacomo well i will calmly tell you what he did this old francesco cenci as you know borrowed the dowry of my wife from me                               300 and then denied the loan and left me so in poverty the which i sought to mend by holding a poor office in the state it had been promised to me and already i bought new clothing for my ragged babes                           305 and my wife smiled and my heart knew repose when cencis intercession as i found conferred this office on a wretch whom thus he paid for vilest service i returned with this ill news and we sate sad together                         310 solacing our despondency with tears of such affection and unbroken faith as temper lifes worst bitterness when he as he is wont came to upbraid and curse mocking our poverty and telling us                                  315 such was gods scourge for disobedient sons and then that i might strike him dumb with shame i spoke of my wifes dowry but he coined a brief yet specious tale how i had wasted the sum in secret riot and he saw                                   320 my wife was touched and he went smiling forth and when i knew the impression he had made and felt my wife insult with silent scorn my ardent truth and look averse and cold i went forth too but soon returned again                           325 yet not so soon but that my wife had taught my children her harsh thoughts and they all cried give us clothes father give us better food what you in one night squander were enough for months i looked and saw that home was hell                   330 and to that hell will i return no more until mine enemy has rendered up atonement or as he gave life to me i will reversing natures law  orsino trust me the compensation which thou seekest here                             335 will be denied  giacomo thenare you not my friend did you not hint at the alternative upon the brink of which you see i stand the other day when we conversed together my wrongs were then less that word parricide                       340 although i am resolved haunts me like fear  orsino it must be fear itself for the bare word is hollow mockery mark how wisest god draws to one point the threads of a just doom so sanctifying it what you devise                                   345 is as it were accomplished  giacomo is he dead  orsino his grave is ready know that since we met cenci has done an outrage to his daughter  giacomo what outrage  orsino that she speaks not but you may conceive such half conjectures as i do                              350 from her fixed paleness and the lofty grief of her stern brow bent on the idle air and her severe unmodulated voice drowning both tenderness and dread and last from this that whilst her stepmother and i                        355 bewildered in our horror talked together with obscure hints both selfmisunderstood and darkly guessing stumbling in our talk over the truth and yet to its revenge she interrupted us and with a look                                  360 which told before she spoke it he must die  giacomo it is enough my doubts are well appeased there is a

returns when its scared game is roused cheering the hounds of conscience to their prey alas alas it was a wicked thought a piteous deed                             10 to kill an old and hoaryheaded

shelley  the sort of mistake that shelley made as to the extent of his own genius and powers which led him deviously at first but lastly into the direct track that enabled him fully to develop them is a curious instance of his modesty of feeling and of the methods which the human mind uses at once to deceive itself and yet in its very delusion to make its way out of error into the path which nature has marked out as its right one he often incited me to attempt the writing a tragedy he conceived that i possessed some dramatic talent and he was always most earnest and energetic in his exhortations that i should cultivate any talent i possessed to the utmost i entertained a truer estimate of my powers and above all though at that time not exactly aware of the fact i was far too young to have any chance of succeeding even moderately in a species of composition that requires a greater scope of experience in and sympathy with human passion than could then have fallen to my lotor than any perhaps except shelley ever possessed even at the age of twentysix at which he wrote the cenci  on the other hand shelley most erroneously conceived himself to be destitute of this talent he believed that one of the first requisites was the capacity of forming and followingup a story or plot he fancied himself to he defective in this portion of imagination it was that which gave him least pleasure in the writings of others though he laid great store by it as the proper framework to support the sublimest efforts of poetry he asserted that he was too metaphysical and abstract too fond of the theoretical and the ideal to succeed as a tragedian it perhaps is not strange that i shared this opinion with himself for he had hitherto shown no inclination for nor given any specimen of his powers in framing and supporting the interest of a story either in prose or verse once or twice when he attempted such he had speedily thrown it aside as being even disagreeable to him as an occupation  the subject he had suggested for a tragedy was charles i and he had written to me remember remember charles i i have been already imagining how you would conduct some scenes the second volume of st leon begins with this proud and true sentiment there is nothing which the human mind can conceive which it may not execute shakespeare was only a human being these words were written in 1818 while we were in lombardy when he little thought how soon a work of his own would prove a proud comment on the passage he quoted when in rome in 1819 a friend put into our hands the old manuscript account of the story of the cenci we visited the colonna and doria palaces where the portraits of beatrice were to be found and her beauty cast the reflection of its own grace over her appalling story shelleys imagination became strongly excited and he urged the subject to me as one fitted for a tragedy more than ever i felt my incompetence but i entreated him to write it instead and he began and proceeded swiftly urged on by intense sympathy with the sufferings of the human beings whose passions so long cold in the tomb he revived and gifted with poetic language this tragedy is the only one of his works that he communicated to me during its progress we talked over the arrangement of the scenes together i speedily saw the great mistake we had made and triumphed in the discovery of the new talent brought to light from that mine of wealth never alas through his untimely death worked to its depthshis richly gifted mind  we suffered a severe affliction in rome by the loss of our eldest child who was of such beauty and promise as to cause him deservedly to be the idol of our hearts we left the capital of the world anxious for a time to escape a spot associated too intimately with his presence and loss such feelings haunted him when in the cenci he makes beatrice speak to cardinal camillo of  that fair blueeyed child who was the lodestar of your lifeand say all see since his most swift and piteous death that day and night and heaven and earth and time and all the things hoped for or done therein are changed to you through your exceeding grief  some friends of ours were residing in the neighbourhood of leghorn and we took a small house villa valsovano about halfway between the town and monte nero where we remained during the summer our villa was situated in the midst of a podere the peasants sang as they worked beneath our windows during the heats of a very hot season and in the evening the waterwheel creaked as the process of irrigation went on and the fireflies flashed from among the myrtle hedges nature was bright sunshiny and cheerful or diversified by storms of a majestic terror such as we had never before witnessed  at the top of the house there was a sort of terrace there is often such in italy generally roofed this one was very small yet not only roofed but glazed this shelley made his study it looked out on a wide prospect of fertile country and commanded a view of the near sea the storms that sometimes varied our day showed themselves most picturesquely as they were driven across the ocean sometimes the dark lurid clouds dipped towards the waves and became waterspouts that churned up the waters beneath as they were chased onward and scattered by the tempest at other times the dazzling sunlight and heat made it almost intolerable to every other but shelley basked in both and his health and spirits revived under their influence in this airy cell he wrote the principal part of the cenci he was making a study of calderon at the time reading his best tragedies with an accomplished lady living near us to whom his letter from leghorn was addressed during the following year he admired calderon both for his poetry and his dramatic genius but it shows his judgement and originality that though greatly struck by his first acquaintance with the spanish poet none of his peculiarities crept into the composition of the cenci and there is no trace of his new studies except in that passage to which he himself alludes as suggested by one in el purgatorio de san patricio  shelley wished the cenci to be acted he was not a playgoer being of such fastidious taste that he was easily disgusted by the bad fillingup of the inferior parts while preparing for our departure from england however he saw miss oneil several times she was then in the zenith of her glory and shelley was deeply moved by her impersonation of several parts and by the graceful sweetness the intense pathos the sublime vehemence of passion she displayed she was often in his thoughts as he wrote and when he had finished he became anxious that his tragedy should be acted and receive the advantage of having this accomplished actress to fill the part of the heroine with this view he wrote the following letter to a friend in london  the object of the present letter us to ask a favour of you i have written a tragedy on a story well known in italy and in my conception eminently dramatic i have taken some pains to make my play fit for representation and those who have already seen it judge favourably it is written without any of the peculiar feelings and opinions which characterize my other compositions i have attended simply to the impartial development of such characters as it is probable the persons represented really were together with the greatest degree of popular effect to be produced by such a development i send you a translation of the italian manuscript on which my play is founded the chief circumstance of which i have touched very delicately for my principal doubt as to whether it would succeed as an acting play hangs entirely on the question as to whether any such a thing as incest in this shape however treated would be admitted on the stage i think however it will form no objection considering first that the facts are matter of history and secondly the peculiar delicacy with which i have treated it in speaking of his mode of treating this main incident shelley said that it might be remarked that in the course of the play he had never mentioned expressly cencis worst crime every one knew what it must be but it was never imaged in wordsthe nearest allusion to it being that portion of cencis curse beginning  that if she have a child etc  i am exceedingly interested in the question of whether this attempt of mine will succeed or not i am strongly inclined to the affirmative at present founding my hopes on thisthat as a composition it is certainly not inferior to any of the modern plays that have been acted with the exception of remorse that the interest of the plot is incredibly greater and more real and that there is nothing beyond what the multitude are contented to believe that they can understand either in imagery opinion or sentiment i wish to preserve a complete incognito and can trust to you that whatever else you do you will at least favour me on this point indeed this is essential deeply essential to its success after it had been acted and successfully could i hope for such a thing i would own it if i pleased and use the celebrity it might acquire to my own purposes  what i want you to do is to procure for me its presentation at covent garden the principal character beatrice is precisely fitted for miss oneil and it might even seem to have been written for her god forbid that i should see her play itit would tear my nerves to pieces and in all respects it is fitted only for covent garden the chief male character i confess i should be very unwilling that any one but kean should play that is impossible and i must be contented with an inferior actor  the play was accordingly sent to mr harris he pronounced the subject to be so objectionable that he could not even submit the part to miss oneil for perusal but expressed his desire that the author would write a tragedy on some other subject which he would gladly accept shelley printed a small edition at leghorn to ensure its correctness as he was much annoyed by the many mistakes that crept into his text when distance prevented him from correcting the press  universal approbation soon stamped the cenci as the best tragedy of modern times writing concerning it shelley said i have been cautious to avoid the introducing faults of youthful composition diffuseness a profusion of inapplicable imagery vagueness generality and as hamlet says words words there is nothing that is not purely dramatic throughout and the character of beatrice proceeding from vehement struggle to horror to deadly resolution and lastly to the elevated dignity of calm suffering joined to passionate tenderness and pathos is touched with hues so vivid and so beautiful that the poet seems to have read intimately the secrets of the noble heart imaged in the lovely countenance of the unfortunate girl the fifth act is a masterpiece it is the finest thing he ever wrote and may claim proud comparison not only with any contemporary but preceding poet the varying feelings of beatrice are expressed with passionate heartreaching eloquence every character has a voice that echoes truth in its tones it is curious to one acquainted with the written story to mark the success with which the poet has inwoven the real incidents of the tragedy into his scenes and yet through the power of poetry has obliterated all that would otherwise have shown too harsh or too hideous in the picture his success was a double triumph and often after he was earnestly entreated to write again in a style that commanded popular favour while it was not less instinct with truth and genius but the bent of his mind went the other way and even when employed on subjects whose interest depended on character and incident he would start off in another direction and leave the delineations of human passion which he could depict in so able a manner for fantastic creations of his fancy or the expression of those opinions and sentiments with regard to human nature and its destiny a desire to diffuse which was the master passion of his soul     the mask of anarchy  written on the occasion of the massacre at manchester  composed at the villa valsovano near leghornor possibly later during shelleys sojourn at florencein the autumn of 1819 shortly after the peterloo riot at manchester august 16 edited with preface by leigh hunt and published under the poets name by edward moxon 1832 bradbury  evans printers two manuscripts are extant a transcript by mrs shelley with shelleys autograph corrections known as the hunt manuscript and an earlier draft not quite complete in the poets handwriting presented by mrs shelley to sir john bowring in 1826 and now in the possession of mr thomas j wise the wise manuscript mrs shelleys copy was sent to leigh hunt in 1819 with view to its publication in the examiner hence the name hunt manuscript a facsimile of the wise manuscript was published by the shelley society in 1887 sources of the text are 1 the hunt

authoritative  1 as i lay asleep in italy there came a voice from over the sea and with great power it forth led me to walk in the visions of poesy  2 i met murder on the way                                            5 he had a mask like castlereagh very smooth he looked yet grim seven bloodhounds followed him  3 all were fat and well they might be in admirable plight                                              10 for one by one and two by two he tossed them human hearts to chew which from his wide cloak he drew  4 next came fraud and he had on like eldon an ermined gown                                         15 his big tears for he wept well turned to millstones as they fell  5 and the little children who round his feet played to and fro thinking every tear a gem                                           20 had their brains knocked out by them  6 clothed with the bible as with light and the shadows of the night like sidmouth next hypocrisy on a crocodile rode by                                              25  7 and many more destructions played in this ghastly masquerade all disguised even to the eyes like bishops lawyers peers or spies  8 last came anarchy he rode                                           30 on a white horse splashed with blood he was pale even to the lips like death in the apocalypse  9 and he wore a kingly crown and in his grasp a sceptre shone                                    35 on his brow this mark i saw i am god and king and law  10 with a pace stately and fast over english land he passed trampling to a mire of blood                                         40 the adoring multitude  11 and a mighty troop around with their trampling shook the ground waving each a bloody sword for the service of their lord                                       45  12 and with glorious triumph they rode through england proud and gay drunk as with intoxication of the wine of desolation  13 oer fields and towns from sea to sea                              50 passed the pageant swift and free tearing up and trampling down till they came to london town  14 and each dweller panicstricken felt his heart with terror sicken                                    55 hearing the tempestuous cry of the triumph of anarchy  15 for with pomp to meet him came clothed in arms like blood and flame the hired murderers who did sing                                    60 thou art god and law and king  16 we have waited weak and lone for thy coming mighty one our purses are empty our swords are cold give us glory and blood and gold                                 65  17 lawyers and priests a motley crowd to the earth their pale brows bowed like a bad prayer not over loud whisperingthou art law and god  18 then all cried with one accord                                      70 thou art king and god and lord anarchy to thee we bow be thy name made holy now  19 and anarchy the skeleton bowed and grinned to every one                                      75 as well as if his education had cost ten millions to the nation  20 for he knew the palaces of our kings were rightly his his the sceptre crown and globe                                   80 and the goldinwoven robe  21 so he sent his slaves before to seize upon the bank and tower and was proceeding with intent to meet his pensioned parliament                                     85  22 when one fled past a maniac maid and her name was hope she said but she looked more like despair and she cried out in the air  23 my father time is weak and gray                                     90 with waiting for a better day see how idiotlike he stands fumbling with his palsied hands  24 he has had child after child and the dust of death is piled                                       95 over every one but me misery oh misery  25 then she lay down in the street right before the horses feet expecting with a patient eye                                       100 murder fraud and anarchy  26 when between her and her foes a mist a light an image rose small at first and weak and frail like the vapour of a vale                                           105  27 till as clouds grow on the blast like towercrowned giants striding fast and glare with lightnings as they fly and speak in thunder to the sky  28 it grewa shape arrayed in mail                                     110 brighter than the vipers scale and upborne on wings whose grain was as the light of sunny rain  29 on its helm seen far away a planet like the mornings lay                                   115 and those plumes its light rained through like a shower of crimson dew  30 with step as soft as wind it passed oer the heads of menso fast that they knew the presence there                                   120 and lookedbut all was empty air  31 as flowers beneath mays footstep waken as stars from nights loose hair are shaken as waves arise when loud winds call thoughts sprung whereer that step did fall                         125  32 and the prostrate multitude lookedand ankledeep in blood hope that maiden most serene was walking with a quiet mien  33 and anarchy the ghastly birth                                      130 lay dead earth upon the earth the horse of death tameless as wind fled and with his hoofs did grind to dust the murderers thronged behind  34 a rushing light of clouds and splendour                             135 a sense awakening and yet tender was heard and feltand at its close these words of joy and fear arose  35 as if their own indignant earth which gave the sons of england birth                                 140 had felt their blood upon her brow and shuddering with a mothers throe  36 had turned every drop of blood by which her face had been bedewed to an accent unwithstood                                          145 as if her heart had cried aloud  37 men of england heirs of glory heroes of unwritten story nurslings of one mighty mother hopes of her and one

cares which sows the human heart with tares  70 lastly from the palaces where the murmur of distress echoes like the distant sound                                       285 of a wind alive around  71 those prison halls of wealth and fashion where some few feel such compassion for those who groan and toil and wail as must make their brethren pale  72 ye who suffer woes untold

mrs shelley  though shelleys first eager desire to excite his countrymen to resist openly the oppressions existent during the good old times had faded with early youth still his warmest sympathies were for the people he was a republican and loved a democracy he looked on all human beings as inheriting an equal right to possess the dearest privileges of our nature the necessaries of life when fairly earned by labour and intellectual instruction his hatred of any despotism that looked upon the people as not to be consulted or protected from want and ignorance was intense he was residing near leghorn at villa valsovano writing the cenci when the news of the manchester massacre reached us it roused in him violent emotions of indignation and compassion the great truth that the many if accordant and resolute could control the few as was shown some years after made him long to teach his injured countrymen how to resist inspired by these feelings he wrote the mask of anarchy which he sent to his friend leigh hunt to be inserted in the examiner of which he was then the editor  i did not insert it leigh hunt writes in his valuable and interesting preface to this poem when he printed it in 1832 because i thought that the public at large had not become sufficiently discerning to do justice to the sincerity and kindheartedness of the spirit that walked in this flaming robe of verse days of outrage have passed away and with them the exasperation that would cause such an appeal to the many to be injurious without being aware of them they at one time acted on his suggestions and gained the day but they rose when human life was respected by the minister in power such was not the case during the administration which excited shelleys abhorrence  the poem was written for the people and is therefore in a more popular tone than usual portions strike as abrupt and unpolished but many stanzas are all his own i heard him repeat and admired those beginning  my father time is old and gray  before i knew to what poem they were to belong but the most touching passage is that which describes the blessed effects of liberty it might make a patriot of any man whose heart was not wholly closed against his humbler fellowcreatures     peter bell the third  by miching mallecho esq  is it a party in a parlour crammed just as they on earth were crammed some sipping punchsome sipping tea but as you by their faces see all silent and alldamned peter bell by w wordsworth  opheliawhat means this my lord hamletmarry this is miching mallecho it means mischief shakespeare  composed at florence october 1819 and forwarded to hunt november 2 to be published by c  j ollier without the authors name ultimately printed by mrs shelley in the second edition of the poetical works 1839 a skit by john hamilton reynolds peter bell a lyrical ballad had already appeared april 1819 a few days before the publication of wordsworths peter bell a tale these productions were reviewed in leigh hunts examiner april 26 may 3 1819 and to the entertainment derived from his perusal of hunts criticisms the composition of shelleys peter bell the third is chiefly owing  dedication  to thomas brown esq the younger hf  dear tom  allow me to request you to introduce mr peter bell to the respectable family of the fudges although he may fall short of those very considerable personages in the more active properties which characterize the rat and the apostate i suspect that even you their historian will confess that he surpasses them in the more peculiarly legitimate qualification of intolerable dulness  you know mr examiner hunt wellit was he who presented me to two of the mr bells my intimacy with the younger mr bell naturally sprung from this introduction to his brothers and in presenting him to you i have the satisfaction of being able to assure you that he is considerably the dullest of the three  there is this particular advantage in an acquaintance with any one of the peter bells that if you know one peter bell you know three peter bells they are not one but three not three but one an awful mystery which after having caused torrents of blood and having been hymned by groans enough to deafen the music of the spheres is at length illustrated to the satisfaction of all parties in the theological world by the nature of mr peter bell  peter is a polyhedric peter or a peter with many sides he changes colours like a chameleon and his coat like a snake he is a proteus of a peter he was at first sublime pathetic impressive profound then dull then prosy and dull and now dulloh so very dull it is an ultralegitimate dulness  you will perceive that it is not necessary to consider hell and the devil as supernatural machinery the whole scene of my epic is in this world which isso peter informed us before his conversion to white obi  the world of all of us and where we find our happiness or not at all  let me observe that i have spent six or seven days in composing this sublime piece the orb of my moonlike genius has made the fourth part of its revolution round the dull earth which you inhabit driving you mad while it has retained its calmness and its splendour and i have been fitting this its last phase to occupy a permanent station in the literature of my country  your works indeed dear tom sell better but mine are far superior the public is no judge posterity sets all to rights  allow me to observe that so much has been written of peter bell that the present history can be considered only like the iliad as a continuation of that series of cyclic poems which have already been candidates for bestowing immortality upon at the same time that they receive it from his character and adventures in this point of view i have violated no rule of syntax in beginning my composition with a conjunction the full stop which closes the poem continued by me being like the full stops at the end of the iliad and odyssey a full stop of a very qualified import  hoping that the immortality which you have given to the fudges you will receive from them and in the firm expectation that when london shall be an habitation of bitterns when st pauls and westminster abbey shall stand shapeless and nameless ruins in the midst of an unpeopled marsh when the piers of waterloo bridge shall become the nuclei of islets of reeds and osiers and cast the jagged shadows of their broken arches on the solitary stream some transatlantic commentator will be weighing in the scales of some new and now unimagined system of criticism the respective merits of the bells and the fudges and their historians i remain dear tom yours sincerely  miching mallecho  december 1 1819  pspray excuse the date of place so soon as the profits of the publication come in i mean to hire lodgings in a more respectable street   prologue  peter bells one two and three oer the wide world wandering be first the antenatal peter wrapped in weeds of the same metre the solongpredestined raiment                                      5 clothed in which to walk his way meant the second peter whose ambition is to link the proposition as the mean of two extremes this was learned from aldrics themes                              10 shielding from the guilt of schism the orthodoxal syllogism the first peterhe who was like the shadow in the glass of the second yet unripe                                           15 his substantial antitype  then came peter bell the second who henceforward must be reckoned the body of a double soul and that portion of the whole                                        20 without which the rest would seem ends of a disjointed dream and the third is he who has oer the grave been forced to pass to the other side which is                                       25 go and try elsejust like this  peter bell the first was peter smugger milder softer neater like the soul before it is born from that world into this                                      30 the next peter bell was he predevote like you and me to good or evil as may come his was the severer doom for he was an evil cotter                                           35 and a polygamic potter and the last is peter bell damned since our first parents fell damned eternally to hell surely he deserves it well                                          40  notes 10 aldrics ie aldrichsa spelling adopted here by woodberry  36 the oldest scholiasts read a dodecagamic potter this is at once more descriptive and more megalophonousbut the alliteration of the text had captivated the vulgar ear of the herd of later commentatorsshelleys note   part 1  death  1 and peter bell when he had been with freshimported hellfire warmed grew seriousfrom his dress and mien twas very plainly to be seen peter was quite reformed                                            5  2 his eyes turned up his mouth turned down his accent caught a nasal twang he oiled his hair there might be heard the grace of god in every word which peter said or sang                                            10  3 but peter now grew old and had an ill no doctor could unravel his torments almost drove him mad some said it was a fever bad some swore it was the gravel                                        15  4 his holy friends then came about and with long preaching and persuasion convinced the patient that without the smallest shadow of a doubt he was predestined to damnation                                     20  5 they saidthy name is peter bell thy skin is of a brimstone hue alive or deaday sick or well the one god made to rhyme with hell the other i think rhymes with you                                 25  6 then peter set up such a yell the nurse who with some water gruel was climbing up the stairs as well as her old legs could climb themfell and broke them boththe fall was cruel                             30  7 the parson from the casement lept into the lake of windermere and many an eelthough no adept in gods right reason for itkept gnawing his kidneys half a year                                     35  8 and all the rest rushed through the door and tumbled over one another and broke their skullsupon the floor meanwhile sat peter bell and swore and cursed his father and his mother                                40  9 and raved of god and sin and death blaspheming like an infidel and said that with his clenched teeth hed seize the earth from underneath and drag it with him down to hell                                   45  10 as he was speaking came a spasm and wrenched his gnashing teeth asunder like one who sees a strange phantasm he laythere was a silent chasm between his upper jaw and under                                     50  11 and yellow death lay on his face and a fixed smile that was not human told as i understand the case that he was gone to the wrong place i heard all this from the old woman                                 55  12 then there came down from langdale pike a cloud with lightning wind and hail it swept over the mountains like an oceanand i heard it strike the woods and crags of grasmere vale                                60  13 and i saw the black storm come nearer minute after minute its thunder made the cataracts dumb with hiss and clash and hollow hum it neared as if the devil was in it                                 65  14 the devil was in ithe had bought peter for halfacrown and when the storm which bore him vanished nought that in the house that storm had caught was ever seen again                                                 70  15 the gaping neighbours came next day they found all vanished from the shore the bible whence he used to pray half scorched under a hencoop lay smashed glassand nothing more                                     75   part 2  the devil  1 the devil i safely can aver has neither hoof nor tail nor sting nor is he as some sages swear a spirit neither here nor there in nothingyet in everything                                       80  2 he iswhat we are for sometimes the devil is a gentleman at others a bard bartering rhymes for sack a statesman spinning crimes a swindler living as he can                                        85  3 a thief who cometh in the night with whole boots and net pantaloons like some one whom it were not right to mentionor the luckless wight from whom he steals nine silver spoons                              90  4 but in this case he did appear like a slopmerchant from wapping and with smug face and eye severe on every side did perk and peer till he saw peter dead or napping                                   95  5 he had on an upper benjamin for he was of the driving schism in the which he wrapped his skin from the storm he travelled in for fear of rheumatism                                              100  6 he called the ghost out of the corse it was exceedingly like peter only its voice was hollow and hoarse it had a queerish look of course its dress too was a little neater                                   105  7 the devil knew not his name and lot peter knew not that he was bell each had an upper stream of thought which made all seem as it was not fitting itself to all things well                                   110  8 peter thought he had parents dear brothers sisters cousins cronies in the fens of lincolnshire he perhaps had found them there had he gone and boldly shown his                                     115  9 solemn phiz in his own village where he thought oft when a boy hed clomb the orchard walls to pillage the produce of his neighbours tillage with marvellous pride and joy                                       120  10 and the devil thought he had mid the misery and confusion of an unjust war just made a fortune by the gainful trade of giving soldiers rations bad                                     125 the world is full of strange delusion  11 that he had a mansion planned in a square like grosvenor square that he was aping fashion and that he now came to westmoreland                                     130 to see what was romantic there  12 and all this though quite ideal ready at a breath to vanish was a state not more unreal than the peace he could not feel                                    135 or the care he could not banish  13 after a little conversation the devil told peter if he chose hed bring him to the world of fashion by giving him a situation                                            140 in his own serviceand new clothes  14 and peter bowed quite

peter saw and felt had a peculiar aspect to him and when they came within the belt                                   275 of his own nature seemed to melt like cloud to cloud into him  4 and so the

335 he looked as he no doubt felt queer and in his dream sate down  16 the devil was no uncommon creature a leadenwitted thiefjust huddled out of the dross and scum of nature

as a maid                                    375 and peter noted what he said standing behind his masters chair  2 he was a mighty poetand a subtlesouled psychologist all things he seemed to understand                                  380 of old or newof sea or land but his own mindwhich was a mist  3 this was a man who might have turned hell into heavenand so in gladness a heaven unto

light on earthtruths brightest beam                    395 and when he ceased there lay the gleam of those words upon his face  6 now peter when he heard such talk would heedless of a broken pate stand like a man asleep or balk                                     400 some wishing guest of knife or fork or drop and break his masters plate  7 at night he oft would start and wake like a lover and began in a wild measure songs to make                                      405 on moor and glen and rocky lake and on the heart of man  8 and on the universal sky and the wide earths bosom green and the sweet strange mystery                                       410 of what beyond these things may lie and yet remain unseen  9 for in his thought he visited the spots in which ere dead and damned he his wayward life had led                                         415 yet knew not whence the thoughts were fed which thus his fancy crammed  10 and these obscure remembrances stirred such harmony in peter that whensoever he should please                                   420 he could speak of rocks and trees in poetic metre  11 for though it was without a sense of memory yet he remembered well many a ditch and quickset fence                                    425 of lakes he had intelligence he knew something of heath and fell  12 he had also dim recollections of pedlars tramping on their rounds milkpans and pails and odd collections                             430 of saws and proverbs and reflections old parsons make in buryinggrounds  13 but peters verse was clear and came announcing from the frozen hearth of a cold age that none might tame                                  435 the soul of that diviner flame it augured to the earth  14 like gentle rains on the dry plains making

                                510 he bought oblivion or renown from gods own voice 1 in a review  12 all peter did on this occasion was writing some sad stuff in prose it is a dangerous invasion

see of truths clear wellwhen i and you maam                        540 go as we shall do subter humum we may know more than he  18 now peter ran to seed in soul into a walking paradox for he was neither part nor whole                                   545 nor good nor badnor knave nor fool among the woods and rocks  19 furious he rode where late he ran lashing and spurring his tame hobby

came home to his heart and found from thence                             560 much stolen of its accustomed flame his thoughts grew weak drowsy and lame of their intelligence  22 to peters view all seemed one hue he was no whig he was no tory                                      565 no deist and no christian he he got so subtle that to be nothing was all his glory  23 one single point in his

thus were undermined the old peterthe hard old potter                                580 was born anew within his mind he grew dull harsh sly unrefined as when he tramped beside the otter 1  26 in the death hues of agony lambently flashing from a fish                                      585 now peter felt amused to see shades like a rainbows rise and flee mixed with a certain hungry wish2  27 so in his countrys dying face he lookedand lovely as she lay                                   590 seeking in vain his last embrace wailing her own abandoned case with hardened sneer he turned away  28

desert me too  30 and so his soul would not be gay but moaned within him like a fawn                                   605 moaning within a cave it lay wounded and wasting day by day till all its life of life was gone  31 as troubled skies stain waters clear the storm in peters heart and mind                                  610 now made his verses dark and queer they were the ghosts of what they were shaking dim graveclothes in the wind  32 for he now raved enormous folly of baptisms sundayschools and graves                             615 twould make george colman melancholy to have heard him like a male molly chanting those stupid staves  33 yet the reviews who heaped abuse on peter while he wrote for freedom                                 620 so soon as in his song they spy the folly which soothes tyranny praise him for those who feed em  34 he was a man too great to scan a planet lost in truths keen rays                                625 his virtue awful and prodigious he was the most sublime religious pureminded poet of these days  35 as soon as he read that cried peter eureka i have found the way                                        630 to make a better thing of metre than eer was made by living creature up to this blessed day  36 then peter wrote odes to the devil in one of which he meekly said                                      635 may carnage and slaughter thy niece and thy daughter may rapine and famine thy gorge ever cramming glut thee with living and dead                                      640  37 may death and damnation and consternation

           680 followed his hearse along the town where was the devil himself  7 when peter heard of his promotion his eyes grew like two stars for bliss there was a bow of sleek devotion                                    685 engendering in his back each motion seemed a lords shoe to kiss  8 he hired a house bought plate and made a genteel drive up to his door with sifted gravel neatly laid                                    690 as if defying all who said peter was ever poor  9 but a disease soon struck into the very life and soul of peter he walked aboutslepthad the hue                                  695 of health upon his cheeksand few dug betternone a heartier eater  10 and yet a strange and horrid curse clung upon peter night and day month after month the thing grew worse                              700 and deadlier than in this my verse i can find strength to say  11 peter was dullhe was at first dulloh so dullso very dull whether he talked wrote or rehearsed                             705 still with this dulness was he cursed dullbeyond all conceptiondull  12 no one could read his booksno mortal but a few natural friends would hear him the parson came not near his portal                                 710 his state was like that of the immortal described by swiftno man could bear him  13 his sister wife and children yawned with a long slow and drear ennui all human patience far beyond                                       715 their hopes of heaven each would have pawned anywhere else to be  14 but in his verse and in his prose the essence of his dulness was concentred and compressed so close                                  720 twould have made guatimozin doze on his red gridiron of brass  15 a printers boy folding those pages fell slumbrously upon one

chargeshelleys note   note on peter bell the third by mrs shelley  in this new edition i have added peter bell the third a critique on wordsworths peter bell reached us at leghorn which amused shelley exceedingly and suggested this poem  i need scarcely observe that nothing personal to the author of peter bell is intended in this poem no man ever admired wordsworths poetry morehe read it perpetually and taught others to appreciate its beauties this poem is like all others written by shelley ideal he conceived the idealism of a poeta man of lofty and creative geniusquitting the glorious calling of discovering and announcing the beautiful and good to support and propagate ignorant prejudices and pernicious errors imparting to the unenlightened not that ardour for truth and spirit of toleration which shelley looked on as the sources of the moral improvement and happiness of mankind but false and injurious opinions that evil was good and that ignorance and force were the best allies of purity and virtue his idea was that a man gifted even as transcendently as the author of peter bell with the highest qualities of genius must if he fostered such errors be infected with dulness this poem was written as a warningnot as a narration of the reality he was unacquainted personally with wordsworth or with coleridge to whom he alludes in the fifth part of the poem and therefore i repeat his poem is purely idealit contains something of criticism on the compositions of those great poets but nothing injurious to the men themselves  no poem contains more of shelleys peculiar views with regard to the errors into which many of the wisest have fallen and the pernicious effects of certain opinions on society much of it is beautifully written and though like the burlesque drama of swellfoot it must be looked on as a plaything it has so much merit and poetryso much of himself in itthat it cannot fail to interest greatly and by right belongs to the world for

of atlas  1 before those cruel twins whom at one birth incestuous change bore to her father time                           50 error and truth had hunted from the earth all those bright natures which adorned its prime and left us nothing to believe in worth the pains of putting into learned rhyme a ladywitch there lived on atlas mountain                          55 within a cavern by a secret fountain  2 her mother was one of the atlantides the allbeholding sun had neer beholden in his wide voyage oer continents and seas so fair a creature as she lay enfolden                              60 in the warm shadow of her loveliness he kissed her with his beams and made all golden the chamber of gray rock in which she lay she in that dream of joy dissolved away  3 tis said she first was changed into a vapour                      65 and then into a cloud such clouds as flit like splendourwinged moths about a taper round the red west when the sun dies in it and then into a meteor such as caper on hilltops when the moon is in a fit                              70 then into one of those mysterious stars which hide themselves between the earth and mars  4 ten times the mother of the months had bent her bow beside the foldingstar and bidden with that bright sign the billows to indent                          75 the seadeserted sandlike children chidden at her command they ever came and went since in that cave a dewy splendour hidden took shape and motion with the living form of this embodied power the cave grew warm                          80  5 a lovely lady garmented in light from her own beautydeep her eyes as are two openings of unfathomable night seen through a temples cloven roofher hair darkthe dim brain whirls dizzy with delight                       85 picturing her form her soft smiles shone afar and her low voice was heard like love and drew all living things towards this wonder new  6 and first the spotted cameleopard came and then the wise and fearless elephant                             90 then the sly serpent in the golden flame of his own volumes intervolvedall gaunt and sanguine beasts her gentle looks made tame they drank before her at her sacred fount and every beast of beating heart grew bold                          95 such gentleness and power even to behold  7 the brinded lioness led forth her young that she might teach them how they should forego their inborn thirst of death the pard unstrung his sinews at her feet and sought to know                           100 with looks whose motions spoke without a tongue how he might be as gentle as the doe the magic circle of her voice and eyes all savage natures did imparadise  8 and old silenus shaking a green stick                               105 of lilies and the woodgods in a crew came blithe as in the olive copses thick cicadae are drunk with the noonday dew and dryope and faunus followed quick teasing the god to sing them something new                          110 till in this cave they found the lady lone sitting upon a seat of emerald stone  9 and universal pan tis said was there and though none saw himthrough the adamant of the deep mountains through the trackless air                    115 and through those living spirits like a want he passed out of his everlasting lair where the quick heart of the great world doth pant and felt that wondrous lady all alone and she felt him upon her emerald throne                           120  10 and every nymph of stream and spreading tree and every shepherdess of oceans flocks who drives her white waves over the green sea and ocean with the brine on his gray locks and quaint priapus with his company                                 125 all came much wondering how the enwombed rocks could have brought forth so beautiful a birth her love subdued their wonder and their mirth  11 the herdsmen and the mountain maidens came and the rude kings of pastoral garamant                            130 their spirits shook within them as a flame stirred by the air under a cavern gaunt pigmies and polyphemes by many a name centaurs and satyrs and such shapes as haunt wet cleftsand lumps neither alive nor dead                       135 dogheaded bosomeyed and birdfooted  12 for she was beautifulher beauty made the bright world dim and everything beside seemed like the fleeting image of a shade no thought of living spirit could abide                             140 which to her looks had ever been betrayed on any object in the world so wide on any hope within the circling skies but on her form and in her inmost eyes  13 which when the lady knew she took her spindle                       145 and twined three threads of fleecy mist and three long lines of light such as the dawn may kindle the clouds and waves and mountains with and she as many starbeams ere their lamps could dwindle in the belated moon wound skilfully                                150 and with these threads a subtle veil she wove a shadow for the splendour of her love  14 the deep recesses of her odorous dwelling were stored with magic treasuressounds of air which had the power all spirits of compelling                       155 folded in cells of crystal silence there such as we hear in youth and think the feeling will never dieyet ere we are aware the feeling and the sound are fled and gone and the regret they leave remains alone                             160  15 and there lay visions swift and sweet and quaint each in its thin sheath like a chrysalis some eager to burst forth some weak and faint with the soft burthen of intensest bliss it was its work to bear to many a saint                              165 whose heart adores the shrine which holiest is even lovesand others white green gray and black and of all shapesand each was at her beck  16 and odours in a kind of aviary of everblooming edentrees she kept                                170 clipped in a floating net a lovesick fairy had woven from dewbeams while the moon yet slept as bats at the wired window of a dairy they beat their vans and each was an adept when loosed and missioned making wings of winds                    175 to stir sweet thoughts or sad in destined minds  17 and liquors clear and sweet whose healthful might could medicine the sick soul to happy sleep and change eternal death into a night of glorious dreamsor if eyes needs must weep                      180 could make their tears all wonder and delight she in her crystal vials did closely keep if men could drink of those clear vials tis said the living were not envied of the dead  18 her cave was stored with scrolls of strange device                  185 the works of some saturnian archimage which taught the expiations at whose price men from the gods might win that happy age too lightly lost redeeming native vice and which might quench the earthconsuming rage                      190 of gold and bloodtill men should live and move harmonious as the sacred stars above  19 and how all things that seem untameable not to be checked and not to be confined obey the spells of wisdoms wizard skill                            195 time earth and firethe

            200  20 and wondrous works of substances unknown to which the enchantment of her fathers power had changed those ragged blocks of savage stone were heaped in the recesses of her bower carved lamps and chalices and vials which shone                     205 in their own golden beamseach like a flower out of whose depth a firefly shakes his light under a cypress in a starless night  21 at first she lived alone in this wild home and her own thoughts were each a minister                           210 clothing themselves or with the ocean foam or with the wind or with the speed of fire to work whatever purposes might come into her mind such power her mighty sire had girt them with whether to fly or run                           215 through all the regions which he shines upon  22 the oceannymphs and hamadryades oreads and naiads with long weedy locks offered to do her bidding through the seas under the earth and in the hollow rocks                            220 and far beneath the matted roots of trees and in the gnarled heart of stubborn oaks so they might live for ever in the light of her sweet presenceeach a satellite  23 this may not be the wizard maid replied

sparkled beneath the shower of her bright tears and every little circlet where they fell flung to the cavernroof inconstant spheres and intertangled lines of lighta knell                            245 of sobbing voices came upon her ears from those departing forms oer the serene of the white streams and of the forest green  26 all day the wizard lady sate aloof spelling out scrolls of dread antiquity                             250 under the caverns fountainlighted roof or broidering the pictured poesy of some high tale upon her growing woof which the sweet splendour of her smiles could dye in hues outshining heavenand ever she                              255 added some grace to the wrought poesy  27 while on her hearth lay blazing many a piece of sandal wood rare gums and cinnamon men scarcely know how beautiful fire is each flame of it is as a precious stone                              260 dissolved in evermoving light and this belongs to each and all who gaze upon the witch beheld it not for in her hand she held a woof that dimmed the burning brand  28 this lady never slept but lay in trance                             265 all night within the fountainas in sleep its emerald crags glowed in her beautys glance through the green splendour of the water deep she saw the constellations reel and dance like firefliesand withal did ever keep                            270 the tenour of her contemplations calm with open eyes closed feet and folded palm  29 and when the whirlwinds and the clouds descended from the white pinnacles of that cold hill she passed at dewfall to a space extended                           275 where in a lawn of flowering asphodel amid a wood of pines and cedars blended there yawned an inextinguishable well of crimson firefull even to the brim and overflowing all the margin trim                                 280  30 within the which she lay when the fierce war of wintry winds shook that innocuous liquor in many a mimic moon and bearded star oer woods and lawnsthe serpent heard it flicker in sleep and dreaming still he crept afar                        285 and when the windless snow descended thicker than autumn leaves she watched it as it came melt on the surface of the level flame  31 she had a boat which some say vulcan wrought for venus as the chariot of her star                               290 but it was found too feeble to be fraught with all the ardours in that sphere which are and so she sold it and apollo bought and gave it to this daughter from a car changed to the fairest and the lightest boat                         295 which ever upon mortal stream did float  32 and others say that when but three hours old the firstborn love out of his cradle lept and clove dun chaos with his wings of gold and like a horticultural adept                                      300 stole a strange seed and wrapped it up in mould and sowed it in his mothers star and kept watering it all the summer with sweet dew and with his wings fanning it as it grew  33 the plant grew strong and green the snowy flower                    305 fell and the long and gourdlike fruit began to turn the light and dew by inward power to its own substance woven tracery ran of light firm texture ribbed and branching oer the solid rind like a leafs veined fan                           310 of which love scooped this boatand with soft motion piloted it round the circumfluous ocean  34 this boat she moored upon her fount and lit a living spirit within all its frame breathing the soul of swiftness into it                             315 couched on the fountain like a panther tame one of the twain at evans feet that sit or as on vestas sceptre a swift flame or on blind homers heart a winged thought in joyous expectation lay the boat                                  320  35 then by strange art she kneaded fire and snow together tempering the repugnant mass with liquid loveall things together grow through which the harmony of love can pass and a fair shape out of her hands did flow                         325 a living image which did far surpass in beauty that bright shape of vital stone which drew the heart out of pygmalion  36 a sexless thing it was and in its growth it seemed to have developed no defect                                330 of either sex yet all the grace of both in gentleness and strength its limbs were decked the bosom swelled lightly with its full youth the countenance was such as might select some artist that his skill should never die                         335 imaging forth such perfect purity  37 from its smooth shoulders hung two rapid wings fit to have borne it to the seventh sphere tipped with the speed of liquid lightenings dyed in the ardours of the atmosphere                               340 she led her creature to the boiling springs where the light boat was moored and said sit here and pointed to the prow and took her seat beside the rudder with opposing feet  38 and down the streams which clove those mountains vast               345 around their inland islets and amid the pantherpeopled forests whose shade cast darkness and odours and a pleasure hid in melancholy gloom the pinnace passed by many a starsurrounded pyramid                                    350 of icy crag cleaving the purple sky and caverns yawning round unfathomably  39 the silver noon into that winding dell with slanted gleam athwart the forest tops tempered like golden evening feebly fell                           355 a green and glowing light like that which drops from folded lilies in which glowworms dwell when earth over her face nights mantle wraps between the severed mountains lay on high over the stream a narrow rift of sky                               360  40 and ever as she went the image lay with folded wings and unawakened eyes and oer its gentle countenance did play the busy dreams as thick as summer flies chasing the rapid smiles that would not stay                        365 and drinking the warm tears and the sweet sighs inhaling which with busy murmur vain they had aroused from that full heart and brain  41 and ever down the prone vale like a cloud upon a stream of wind the pinnace went                             370 now lingering on the pools in which abode the calm and darkness of the deep content in which they paused now oer the shallow road of white and dancing waters all besprent with sand and polished pebblesmortal boat                         375 in such a shallow rapid could not float  42 and down the earthquaking cataracts which shiver their snowlike waters into golden air or under chasms unfathomable ever sepulchre them till in their rage they tear                         380 a subterranean portal for the river it fledthe circling sunbows did upbear its fall down the hoar precipice of spray lighting it far upon its lampless way  43 and when the wizard lady would ascend                                385 the labyrinths of some manywinding vale which to the inmost mountain upward tend she called hermaphroditusand the pale and heavy hue which slumber could extend over its lips and eyes as on the gale                               390 a rapid shadow from a slope of grass into the darkness of the stream did pass  44 and it unfurled its heavencoloured pinions with stars of fire spotting the stream below and from above into the suns dominions                              395 flinging a glory like the golden glow in which spring clothes her emeraldwinged minions all interwoven with fine feathery snow and moonlight splendour of intensest rime with which frost paints the pines in winter time                    400  45 and then it winnowed the elysian air which ever hung about that lady bright with its aethereal vansand speeding there like a star up the torrent of the night or a swift eagle in the morning glare                                405 breasting the whirlwind with impetuous flight the pinnace oared by those enchanted wings clove the fierce streams towards their upper springs  46 the water flashed like sunlight by the prow of a noonwandering meteor flung to heaven                          410 the still air seemed as if its waves did flow in tempest down the mountains loosely driven the ladys radiant hair streamed to and fro beneath the billows having vainly striven indignant and impetuous roared to feel                              415 the swift and steady motion of the keel  47 or when the weary moon was in the wane or in the noon of interlunar night the ladywitch in visions could not chain her spirit but sailed forth under the light                         420 of shooting stars and bade extend amain its stormoutspeeding wings the hermaphrodite she to the austral waters took her way beyond the fabulous thamondocana  48 where like a meadow which no scythe has shaven                     425 which rain could never bend or whirlblast shake with the antarctic constellations paven canopus and his crew lay the austral lake there she would build herself a windless haven out of the clouds whose moving turrets make                          430 the bastions of the storm when through the sky the spirits of the tempest thundered by  49 a haven beneath whose translucent floor the tremulous stars sparkled unfathomably and around which the solid vapours hoar                             435 based on the level waters to the sky lifted their dreadful crags and like a shore of wintry mountains inaccessibly hemmed in with rifts and precipices gray and hanging crags many a cove and bay                              440  50 and whilst the outer lake beneath the lash of the winds scourge foamed like a wounded thing and the incessant hail with stony clash ploughed up the waters and the flagging wing of the roused cormorant in the lightning flash                       445 looked like the wreck of some windwandering fragment of inky thundersmokethis haven was as a gem to copy heaven engraven  51 on which that lady played her many pranks circling the image of a shooting star                               450 even as a tiger on hydaspes banks outspeeds the antelopes which speediest are in her light boat and many quips and cranks she played upon the water till the car of the late moon like a sick matron wan                            455 to journey from the misty east began  52 and then she called out of the hollow turrets of those high clouds white golden and vermilion the armies of her ministering spirits in mighty legions million after million                            460 they came each troop emblazoning its merits on meteor flags and many a proud pavilion of the intertexture of the atmosphere they pitched upon the plain of the calm mere  53 they framed the imperial tent of their great queen                   465 of woven exhalations underlaid with lambent lightningfire as may be seen a dome of thin and open ivory inlaid with crimson silkcressets from the serene hung there and on the water for her tread                           470 a tapestry of fleecelike mist was strewn dyed in the beams of the ascending moon  54 and on a throne oerlaid with starlight caught upon those wandering isles of aery dew which highest shoals of mountain shipwreck not                      475 she sate and heard all that had happened new between the earth and moon since they had brought the last intelligenceand now she grew pale as that moon lost in the watery night and now she wept and now she laughed outright                      480  55 these were tame pleasures she would often climb the steepest ladder of the crudded rack up to some beaked cape of cloud sublime and like arion on the dolphins back ride singing through the shoreless airofttime                    485 following the serpent lightnings winding track she ran upon the platforms of the wind and laughed to bear the fireballs roar behind  56 and sometimes to those streams of upper air which whirl the earth in its diurnal round                          490 she would ascend and win the spirits there to let her join their chorus mortals found that on those days the sky was calm and fair and mystic snatches of harmonious sound wandered upon the earth whereer she passed                         495 and happy thoughts of hope too sweet to last  57 but her choice sport was in the hours of sleep to glide adown old nilus where he threads egypt and aethiopia from the steep of utmost axume until he spreads                                   500 like a calm flock of silverfleeced sheep his waters on the plain and crested heads of cities and proud temples gleam amid and many a vapourbelted pyramid  58 by moeris and the mareotid lakes                                    505 strewn with faint blooms like bridal chamber floors where naked boys bridling tame watersnakes or charioteering ghastly alligators had left on the sweet waters mighty wakes of those huge formswithin the brazen doors                         510 of the great labyrinth slept both boy and beast tired with the pomp of their osirian feast  59 and where within the surface of the river the shadows of the massy temples lie and never are erasedbut tremble ever                               515 like things which every cloud can doom to die through lotuspaven canals and wheresoever the works of man pierced that serenest sky with tombs and towers and fanes twas her delight to wander in the shadow of the night                                520  60 with motion like the spirit of that wind whose soft step deepens slumber her light feet passed through the peopled haunts of humankind scattering sweet visions from her presence sweet through fane and palacecourt and labyrinth mined                  525 with many a dark and subterranean street under the nile through chambers high and deep she passed observing mortals in their sleep  61 a pleasure sweet doubtless it was to see mortals subdued in all the shapes of sleep                          530 here lay two sister twins in infancy there a lone youth who in his dreams did weep within two lovers linked innocently in their loose locks which over both did creep like ivy from one stemand there lay calm                          535 old age with snowbright hair and folded palm  62 but other troubled forms of sleep she saw not to be mirrored in a holy song distortions foul of supernatural awe and pale imaginings of visioned wrong                               540 and all the code of customs lawless law written upon the brows of old and young this said the wizard maiden is the strife which stirs the liquid surface of mans life  63 and little did the sight disturb her soul

her way could take                       550 where in bright bowers immortal forms abide beneath the weltering of the restless tide  64 and she saw princes couched under the glow of sunlike gems and round each templecourt in dormitories ranged row after row                                555 she saw the priests asleepall of one sort for all were educated to be so the peasants in their huts and in the port the sailors she saw cradled on the waves and the dead lulled within their dreamless graves                   560  65 and all the forms in which those spirits lay were to her sight like the diaphanous veils in which those sweet ladies oft array their delicate limbs who would conceal from us only their scorn of all concealment they                            565 move in the light of their own beauty thus but these and all now lay with sleep upon them and little thought a witch was looking on them  66 she all those human figures breathing there beheld as living spiritsto her eyes                                570 the naked beauty of the soul lay bare and often through a rude and worn disguise she saw the inner form most bright and fair and then she had a charm of strange device which murmured on mute lips with tender tone                       575 could make that spirit mingle with her own  67 alas aurora what wouldst thou have given for such a charm when tithon became gray

wizardmaiden passed with an eye serene and heart unladen  69 to those she saw most beautiful she gave strange panacea in a crystal bowl they drank in their deep sleep of that sweet wave                   595 and lived thenceforward as if some control mightier than life were in them and the grave of such when death oppressed the weary soul was as a green and overarching bower lit by the gems of many a starry flower                             600  70 for on the night when they were buried she restored the embalmers ruining and shook the light out of the funeral lamps to be a mimic day within that deathy nook and she unwound the woven imagery                                    605 of second childhoods swaddling bands and took the coffin its last cradle from its niche and threw it with contempt into a ditch  71 and there the body lay age after age mute breathing beating warm and undecaying                      610 like one asleep in a green hermitage with gentle smiles about its eyelids playing and living in its dreams beyond the rage of death or life while they were still arraying in liveries ever new the rapid blind                               615 and fleeting generations of mankind  72 and she would write strange dreams upon the brain of those who were less beautiful and make all harsh and crooked purposes more vain than in the desert is the serpents wake

great use to shelley in soothing his nervous irritability we made several excursions in the neighbourhood the country around is fertile and diversified and rendered picturesque by ranges of near hills and more distant mountains the peasantry are a handsome intelligent race and there was a gladsome sunny heaven spread over us that rendered home and every scene we visited cheerful and bright during some of the hottest days of august shelley made a solitary journey on foot to the summit of monte san pellegrinoa mountain of some height on the top of which there is a chapel the object during certain days of the year of many pilgrimages the excursion delighted him while it lasted though he exerted himself too much and the effect was considerable lassitude and weakness on his return during the expedition he conceived the idea and wrote in the three days immediately succeeding to his return the witch of atlas this poem is peculiarly characteristic of his tasteswildly fanciful full of brilliant imagery and discarding human interest and passion to revel in the fantastic ideas that his imagination suggested  the surpassing excellence of the cenci had made me greatly desire that shelley should increase his popularity by adopting subjects that would more suit the popular taste than a poem conceived in the abstract and dreamy spirit of the witch of atlas it was not only that i wished him to acquire popularity as redounding to his fame but i believed that he would obtain a greater mastery over his own powers and greater happiness in his mind if public applause crowned his endeavours the few stanzas that precede the poem were addressed to me on my representing these ideas to him even now i believe that i was in the right shelley did not expect sympathy and approbation from the public but the want of it took away a portion of the ardour that ought to have sustained him while writing he was thrown on his own resources and on the inspiration of his own soul and wrote because his mind overflowed without the hope of being appreciated i had not the most distant wish that he should truckle in opinion or submit his lofty aspirations for the human race to the low ambition and pride of the many but i felt sure that if his poems were more addressed to the common feelings of men his proper rank among the writers of the day would be acknowledged and that popularity as a poet would enable his countrymen to do justice to his character and virtues which in those days it was the mode to attack with the most flagitious calumnies and insulting abuse that he felt these things deeply cannot be doubted though he armed himself with the consciousness of acting from a lofty and heroic sense of right the truth burst from his heart sometimes in solitude and he would writes few unfinished verses that showed that he felt the sting among such i find the following  alas this is not what i thought life was i knew that there were crimes and evil men misery and hate nor did i hope to pass untouched by suffering through the rugged glen in mine own heart i saw as in a glass the hearts of othersand when i went among my kind with triple brass of calm endurance my weak breast i armed to bear scorn fear and hatea woful mass  i believed that all this morbid feeling would vanish if the chord of sympathy between him and his countrymen were touched but my persuasions were vain the mind could not be bent from its natural inclination shelley shrunk instinctively from portraying human passion with its mixture of good and evil of disappointment and disquiet such opened again the wounds of his own heart and he loved to shelter himself rather in the airiest flights of fancy forgetting love and hate and regret and lost hope in such imaginations as borrowed their hues from sunrise or sunset from the yellow moonshine or paly twilight from the aspect of the far ocean or the shadows of the woodswhich celebrated the singing of the winds among the pines the flow of a murmuring stream and the thousand harmonious sounds which nature creates in her solitudes these are the materials which form the witch of atlas it is a brilliant congregation of ideas such as his senses gathered and his fancy coloured during his rambles in the sunny land he so much loved     oedipus tyrannus  or  swellfoot the tyrant  a tragedy in two acts  translated from

which the greeks were accustomed to connect their dramatic representations elucidating the wonderful and appalling fortunes of the swellfoot dynasty it was evidently written by some learned theban and from its characteristic dulness apparently before the duties on the importation of attic salt had been repealed by the boeotarchs the tenderness with which he treats the pigs proves him to have been a sus boeotiae possibly epicuri de grege porcus for as the poet observes  a fellow feeling makes us wondrous kind  no liberty has been taken with the translation of this remarkable piece of antiquity except the suppressing a seditious and blasphemous chorus of the pigs and bulls at the last act the work hoydipouse or more properly oedipus has been rendered literally swellfoot without its having been conceived necessary to determine whether a swelling of the hind or the fore feet of the swinish monarch is particularly indicated  should the remaining portions of this tragedy be found entitled

shelley  in the brief journal i kept in those days i find recorded in august 1820 shelley begins swellfoot the tyrant suggested by the pigs at the fair of san giuliano this was the period of queen carolines landing in england and the struggles made by george iv to get rid of her claims which failing lord castlereagh placed the green bag on the table of the house of commons demanding in the kings name that an enquiry should be instituted into his wifes conduct these circumstances were the theme of all conversation among the english we were then at the baths of san giuliano a friend came to visit us on the day when a fair was held in the square beneath our windows shelley read to us his ode to liberty and was riotously accompanied by the grunting of a quantity of pigs brought for sale to the fair he compared it to the chorus of frogs in the satiric drama of aristophanes and it being an hour of merriment and one ludicrous association suggesting another he imagined a politicalsatirical drama on the circumstances of the day to which the pigs would serve as chorusand swellfoot was begun when finished it was transmitted to england printed and published anonymously but stifled at the very dawn of its existence by the society for the suppression of vice who threatened to prosecute it if not immediately withdrawn the friend who had taken the trouble of bringing it out of course did not think it worth the annoyance and expense of a contest and it was laid aside  hesitation of whether it would do honour to shelley prevented my publishing it at first but i cannot bring myself to keep back anything he ever wrote for each word is fraught with the peculiar views and sentiments which he believed to be beneficial to the human race and the bright light of poetry irradiates every thought the world has a right to the entire compositions of such a man for it does not live and thrive by the outworn lesson of the dullard or the hypocrite but by the original free thoughts of men of genius who aspire to pluck bright truth  from the palefaced moon or dive into the bottom of the deep where fathomline would never touch the ground and pluck up drowned  truth even those who may dissent from his opinions will consider that he was a man of genius and that the world will take more interest in his slightest word than in the waters of lethe which are so eagerly prescribed as medicinal for all its wrongs and woe this drama however must not be judged for more than was meant it is a mere plaything of the imagination which even may not excite smiles among many who will not see wit in those combinations of thought which were full of the ridiculous to the author but like everything he wrote it breathes that deep sympathy for the sorrows of humanity and indignation against its oppressors which make it worthy of his name     epipsychidion  verses addressed to the noble and unfortunate lady emilia v  now imprisoned in the convent of   lanima amante si slancia fuori del creato e si crea nell infinito un mondo tutto per essa diverso assai da questo oscuro e pauroso baratro her own words  epipsychidion was composed at pisa january february 1821 and published without the authors name in the following summer by c  j ollier london the poem was included by mrs shelley in the poetical works 1839 both editions amongst the shelley manuscripts in the bodleian is a first draft of epipsychidion consisting of three versions more or less complete of the preface advertisement a version in ink and pencil much cancelled of the last eighty lines of the poem and some additional lines which did not appear in print examination of the shelley manuscripts in the bodleian library by cd locock oxford clarendon press 1903 page 3 this draft the writing of which is extraordinarily confused and illegible has been carefully deciphered and printed by mr locock in the volume named above our text follows that of the editio princeps 1821  advertisement  the writer of the following lines died at florence as he was preparing for a voyage to one of the wildest of the sporades which he had bought and where he had fitted up the ruins of an old building and where it was his hope to have realised a scheme of life suited perhaps to that happier and better world of which he is now an inhabitant but hardly practicable in this his life was singular less on account of the romantic vicissitudes which diversified it than the ideal tinge which it received from his own character and feelings the present poem like the vita nuova of dante is sufficiently intelligible to a certain class of readers without a matteroffact history of the circumstances to which it relates and to a certain other class it must ever remain incomprehensible from a defect of a common organ of perception for the ideas of which it treats not but that gran vergogna sarebbe a colui che rimasse cosa sotto veste di figura o di colore rettorico e domandato non sapesse denudare le sue parole da cotal veste in guisa che avessero verace intendimento  the present poem appears to have been intended by the writer as the dedication to some longer one the stanza on the opposite page 1 is almost a literal translation from dantes famous canzone  voi ch intendendo il terzo ciel movete etc  the presumptuous application of the concluding lines to his own composition will raise a smile at the expense of my unfortunate friend be it a smile not of contempt but pity s  1 ie the nine lines which follow beginning my song i fear etced  my song i fear that thou wilt find but few who fitly

                          60 which moves not in the moving heavens alone a smile amid dark frowns a gentle tone amid rude voices a beloved light a solitude a refuge a delight a lute which those whom

as night by day winter by spring or sorrow by swift hope led into light life peace an antelope                            75 in the suspended impulse of its lightness were less aethereally light the brightness of her divinest presence trembles through her limbs as underneath a cloud of dew embodied in the windless heaven of june                              80 amid the splendourwinged stars the moon burns inextinguishably beautiful and from her lips as from a hyacinth full of honeydew a liquid murmur drops killing the sense with passion sweet as stops                       85 of planetary music heard in trance in her mild lights the starry spirits dance the sunbeams of those wells which ever leap under the lightnings of the soultoo deep for the brief fathomline of thought or sense                       90 the glory of her being issuing thence stains the dead blank cold air with a warm shade of unentangled intermixture made by love of light and motion one intense diffusion one serene omnipresence                                  95 whose flowing outlines mingle in their flowing around her cheeks and utmost fingers glowing with the unintermitted blood which there quivers as in a fleece of snowlike air the crimson pulse of living morning quiver                         100 continuously prolonged and ending never till they are lost and in that beauty furled which penetrates and clasps and fills the world scarce visible from extreme loveliness warm fragrance seems to fall from her light dress                    105 and her loose hair and where some heavy tress the air of her own speed has disentwined the sweetness seems to satiate the faint wind and in the soul a wild odour is felt beyond the sense like fiery dews that melt                          110 into the bosom of a frozen bud see where she stands a mortal shape indued with love and life and light and deity and motion which may change but cannot die an image of some bright eternity                                    115 a shadow of some golden dream a splendour leaving the third sphere pilotless a tender reflection of the eternal moon of love under whose motions lifes dull billows move a metaphor of spring and youth and morning                          120 a vision like incarnate april warning with smiles and tears frost the anatomy into his summer grave ah woe is me what have i dared where am i lifted how shall i descend and perish not i know                              125 that love makes all things equal i have heard by mine own heart this joyous truth averred the spirit of the worm beneath the sod

the fields of immortality my spirit should at first have worshipped thine a divine presence in a place divine                                 135 or should have moved beside it on this earth a shadow of that substance from its birth but not as nowi love thee yes i feel that on the fountain of my heart a seal is set to keep its waters pure and bright                           140 for thee since in those tears thou hast delight weare we not formed as notes of music are for one another though dissimilar such difference without discord as can make those sweetest sounds in which all spirits shake                    145 as trembling leaves in a continuous air  thy wisdom speaks in me and bids me dare beacon the rocks on which high hearts are wrecked i never was attached to that great sect whose doctrine is that each one should select                       150 out of the crowd a mistress or a friend and all the rest though fair and wise commend to cold oblivion though it is in the code of modern morals and the beaten road which those poor slaves with weary footsteps tread                  155 who travel to their home among the dead by the broad highway of the world and so with one chained friend perhaps a jealous foe the dreariest and the longest journey go  true love in this differs from gold and clay                        160 that to divide is not to take away love is like understanding that grows bright gazing on many truths tis like thy light imagination which from earth and sky and from the depths of human fantasy                                165 as from a thousand prisms and mirrors fills the universe with glorious beams and kills error the worm with many a sunlike arrow of its reverberated lightning narrow the heart that loves the brain that contemplates                   170 the life that wears the spirit that creates one object and one form and builds thereby a sepulchre for its eternity  mind from its object differs most in this evil from good misery from happiness                               175 the baser from the nobler the impure and frail from what is clear and must endure if you divide suffering and dross you may diminish till it is consumed away if you divide pleasure and love and thought                         180 each part exceeds the whole and we know not how much while any yet remains unshared of pleasure may be gained of sorrow spared this truth is that deep well whence sages draw the unenvied light of hope the eternal law                          185 by which those live to whom this world of life is as a garden ravaged and whose strife tills for the promise of a later birth the wilderness of this elysian earth  there was a being whom my spirit oft                                 190 met on its visioned wanderings far aloft in the clear golden prime of my youths dawn upon the fairy isles of sunny lawn amid the enchanted mountains and the caves of divine sleep and on the airlike waves                           195 of wonderlevel dream whose tremulous floor paved her light stepson an imagined shore under the gray beak of some promontory she met me robed in such exceeding glory that i beheld her not in solitudes                                  200 her voice came to me through the whispering woods and from the fountains and the odours deep of flowers which like lips murmuring in their sleep of the sweet kisses which had lulled them there breathed but of her to the enamoured air                            205 and from the breezes whether low or loud and from the rain of every passing cloud and from the singing of the summerbirds and from all sounds all silence in the words of antique verse and high romancein form                         210 sound colourin whatever checks that storm which with the shattered present chokes the past and in that best philosophy whose taste makes this cold common hell our life a doom as glorious as a fiery martyrdom                                    215 her spirit was the harmony of truth  then from the caverns of my dreamy youth i sprang as one sandalled with plumes of fire and towards the lodestar of my one desire i flitted like a dizzy moth whose flight                           220 is as a dead leafs in the owlet light when it would seek in hespers setting sphere a radiant death a fiery sepulchre as if it were a lamp of earthly flame but she whom prayers or tears then could not tame                  225 passed like a god throned on a winged planet whose burning plumes to tenfold swiftness fan it into the dreary cone of our lifes shade and as a man with mighty loss dismayed i would have followed though the grave between                      230 yawned like a gulf whose spectres are unseen when a voice saido thou of hearts the weakest the phantom is beside thee whom thou seekest then iwherethe worlds echo answered where and in that silence and in my despair                              235 i questioned every tongueless wind that flew over my tower of mourning if it knew whither twas fled this soul out of my soul and murmured names and spells which have control over the sightless tyrants of our fate                              240 but neither prayer nor verse could dissipate the night which closed on her nor uncreate that world within this chaos mine and me of which she was the veiled divinity the world i say of thoughts that worshipped her                     245 and therefore i went forth with hope and fear and every gentle passion sick to death feeding my course with expectations breath into the wintry forest of our life and struggling through its error with vain strife                   250 and stumbling in my weakness and my haste and half bewildered by new forms i passed seeking among those untaught foresters if i could find one form resembling hers in which she might have masked herself from me                      255 thereone whose voice was venomed melody sate by a well under blue nightshade bowers the breath of her false mouth was like faint flowers her touch was as electric poisonflame out of her looks into my vitals came                                260 and from her living cheeks and bosom flew a killing air which pierced like honeydew into the core of my green heart and lay upon its leaves until as hair grown gray oer a young brow they hid its unblown prime                        265 with ruins of unseasonable time  in many mortal forms i rashly sought the shadow of that idol of my thought and some were fairbut beauty dies away others were wisebut honeyed words betray                          270 and one was trueoh why not true to me then as a hunted deer that could not flee i turned upon my thoughts and stood at bay wounded and weak and panting the cold day trembled for pity of my strife and pain                            275 when like a noonday dawn there shone again deliverance one stood on my path who seemed as like the glorious shape which i had d reamed as is the moon whose changes ever run into themselves to the eternal sun                                 280 the cold chaste moon the queen of heavens bright isles who makes all beautiful on which she smiles that wandering shrine of soft yet icy flame which ever is transformed yet still the same and warms not but illumines young and fair                          285 as the descended spirit of that sphere she hid me as the moon may hide the night from its own darkness until all was bright between the heaven and earth of my calm mind and as a cloud charioted by the wind                               290 she led me to a cave in that wild place and sate beside me with her downward face illumining my slumbers like the moon waxing and waning oer endymion and i was laid asleep spirit and limb                              295 and all my being became bright or dim as the moons image in a summer sea according as she smiled or frowned on me and there i lay within a chaste cold bed alas i then was nor alive nor dead                               300 for at her silver voice came death and life unmindful each of their accustomed strife masked like twin babes a sister and a brother the wandering hopes of one abandoned mother and through the cavern without wings they flew                      305 and cried away he is not of our crew i wept and though it be a dream i weep  what storms then shook the ocean of my sleep blotting that moon whose pale and waning lips then shrank as in the sickness of eclipse                         310 and how my soul was as a lampless sea and who was then its tempest and when she the planet of that hour was quenched what frost crept oer those waters till from coast to coast the moving billows of my being fell                                  315 into a death of ice immovable and thenwhat earthquakes made it gape and split the white moon smiling all the while on it these words concealif not each word would be the key of staunchless tears weep not for me                       320  at length into the obscure forest came the vision i had sought through grief and shame athwart that wintry wilderness of thorns flashed from her motion splendour like the morns and from her presence life was radiated                              325 through the gray earth and branches bare and dead so that her way was paved and roofed above with flowers as soft as thoughts of budding love and music from her respiration spread like lightall other sounds were penetrated                        330 by the small still sweet spirit of that sound so that the savage winds hung mute around and odours warm and fresh fell from her hair dissolving the dull cold in the frore air soft as an incarnation of the sun                                   335 when light is changed to love this glorious one floated into the cavern where i lay and called my spirit and the dreaming clay was lifted by the thing that dreamed below as smoke by fire and in her beautys glow                           340 i stood and felt the dawn of my long night was penetrating me with living light i knew it was the vision veiled from me so many yearsthat it was emily  twin spheres of light who rule this passive earth                   345 this world of loves this me and into birth awaken all its fruits and flowers and dart magnetic might into its central heart and lift its billows and its mists and guide by everlasting laws each wind and tide                              350 to its fit cloud and its appointed cave and lull its storms each in the craggy grave which was its cradle luring to faint bowers the armies of the rainbowwinged showers and as those married lights which from the towers                  355 of heaven look forth and fold the wandering globe in liquid sleep and splendour as a robe and all their manymingled influence blend if equal yet unlike to one sweet end so ye bright regents with alternate sway                           360 govern my sphere of being night and day thou not disdaining even a borrowed might thou not eclipsing a remoter light and through the shadow of the seasons three from spring to autumns sere maturity

wrecked in that convulsion                 370 alternating attraction and repulsion thine went astray and that was rent in twain oh float into our azure heaven again be there loves foldingstar at thy return the living sun will feed thee from its urn                           375 of golden fire the moon will veil her horn in thy last smiles adoring even and morn will worship thee with incense of calm breath and lights and shadows as the star of death and birth is worshipped by those sisters wild                        380 called hope and fearupon the heart are piled their offeringsof this sacrifice divine a world shall be the altar lady mine scorn not these flowers of thought the fading birth which from its heart of hearts that plant puts forth                 385 whose fruit made

and palace and the array of arms more strength has love than he or they for it can burst his charnel and make free                          405 the limbs in chains the heart in agony the soul in dust

   415 our bark is as an albatross whose nest is a far eden of the purple east and we between her wings will sit while night and day and storm and calm pursue their flight our ministers along the boundless sea                              420 treading each others heels unheededly it is an isle under ionian skies beautiful as a wreck of paradise and for the harbours are not safe and good this land would have remained a solitude                             425 but for some pastoral people native there who from the elysian clear and golden air draw the last spirit of the age of gold simple and spirited innocent and bold the blue aegean girds this chosen home                              430 with everchanging sound and light and foam kissing the sifted sands and caverns hoar and all the winds wandering along the shore undulate with the undulating tide there are thick woods where sylvan forms abide                      435 and many a fountain rivulet and pond as clear as elemental

the light clear element which the isle wears is heavy with the scent of lemonflowers which floats like mist laden with unseen showers and falls upon the eyelids like faint sleep and from the moss

fall clear exhalations soft and bright veil after veil each hiding some delight which sun or moon or zephyr draw aside till the isles beauty like a naked bride glowing at once with love and loveliness                            475 blushes and trembles at its own excess yet like a buried lamp a soul no less burns in the heart of this delicious isle an atom of th eternal whose own smile unfolds itself and may be felt not seen                            480 oer the gray rocks blue waves and forests green filling their bare and void interstices but the chief marvel of the wilderness is a lone

might have been supposed to be his wife  an effeminate looking youth to whom he shewed an attachment so singular excessive an attachment as to give rise to the suspicion that she was a womanat his death this suspicion was confirmedobject speedily found a refuge both from the taunts of the brute multitude and from theof her grief in the same grave that contained her loverhe had bought one of the sporades  fitted up a saracenic castle which accident had preserved in some repair with simple elegance  it was his intention to dedicate the remainder of his life to undisturbed intercourse with his companions  these verses apparently were intended as a dedication of a longer poem or series of poems   preface 3  the writer of these lines died at florence in january 1820 while he was preparing   for one wildest of the of the sporades where he bought  fitted up the ruins of some old buildinghis life was singular less on account of the romantic vicissitudes which diversified it than the ideal tinge which they received from his own character  feelings  the verses were apparently intended by the writer to accompany some longer poem or collection of poems of which there are no remnants in his

of its lamented object to be classed among the writers of the highest genius who have adorned our age my known repugnance to the narrow principles of taste on which several of his earlier compositions were modelled prove at least that i am an impartial judge i consider the fragment of hyperion as second to nothing that was ever produced by a writer of the same years  john keats died at rome of a consumption in his twentyfourth year on the  of  1821 and was buried in the romantic and lonely cemetery of the protestants in that city under the pyramid which is the tomb of cestius and the massy walls and towers now mouldering and desolate which formed the circuit of ancient rome the cemetery is an open space among the ruins covered in winter with violets and daisies it might make one in love with death to think that one should be buried in so sweet a place  the genius of the lamented person to whose memory i have dedicated these unworthy verses was not less delicate and fragile than it was beautiful and where cankerworms abound what wonder if its young flower was blighted in the bud the savage criticism on his endymion which appeared in the quarterly review produced the most violent effect on his susceptible mind the agitation thus originated ended in the rupture of a bloodvessel in the lungs a rapid consumption ensued and the succeeding acknowledgements from more candid critics of the true greatness of his powers were ineffectual to heal the wound thus wantonly inflicted  it may be well said that these wretched men know not what they do they scatter their insults and their slanders without heed as to whether the poisoned shaft lights on a heart made callous by many blows or one like keatss composed of more penetrable stuff one of their associates is to my knowledge a most base and unprincipled calumniator as to endymion was it a poem whatever might be its defects to be treated contemptuously by those who had celebrated with various degrees of complacency and panegyric paris and woman and a syrian tale and mrs lefanu and mr barrett and mr howard payne and a long list of the illustrious obscure are these the men who in their venal good nature presumed to draw a parallel between the reverend mr milman and lord byron what gnat did they strain at here after having swallowed all those camels against what woman taken in adultery dares the foremost of these literary prostitutes to cast his opprobrious stone miserable man you one of the meanest have wantonly defaced one of the noblest specimens of the workmanship of god nor shall it be your excuse that murderer as you are you have spoken daggers but used none  the circumstances of the closing scene of poor keatss life were not made known to me until the elegy was ready for the press i am given to understand that the wound which his sensitive spirit had received from the criticism of endymion was exasperated by the bitter sense of unrequited benefits the poor fellow seems to have been hooted from the stage of life no less by those on whom he had wasted the promise of his genius than those on whom he had lavished his fortune and his care he was accompanied to rome and attended in his last illness by mr severn a young artist of the highest promise who i have been informed almost risked his own life and sacrificed every prospect to unwearied attendance upon his dying friend had i known these circumstances before the completion of my poem i should have been tempted to add my feeble tribute of applause to the more solid recompense which the virtuous man finds in the recollection of his own motives mr severn can dispense with a reward from such stuff as dreams are made of his conduct is a golden augury of the success of his future careermay the unextinguished spirit of his

10 and one with trembling hands clasps his cold head and fans him with her moonlight wings and cries our love our hope our sorrow is not dead see on the silken fringe of his faint eyes                         85 like dew upon a sleeping flower there lies a tear some dream has loosened from his brain lost angel of a ruined paradise she knew not twas her own as with no stain she faded like a cloud which had outwept its rain                  90  11 one from a lucid urn of starry dew washed his light limbs as if embalming them another clipped her profuse locks and threw the wreath upon him like an anadem which frozen tears instead of pearls begem                          95 another in her wilful grief would break her bow and winged reeds as if to stem a greater loss with one which was more weak and dull the barbed fire against his frozen cheek  12 another splendour on his mouth alit                                 100 that mouth whence it was wont to draw the breath which gave it strength to pierce the guarded wit and pass into the panting heart beneath with lightning and with music the damp death quenched its caress upon his icy lips                               105 and as a dying meteor stains a wreath of moonlight vapour which the cold night clips it flushed through his pale limbs and passed to its eclipse  13 and others camedesires and adorations winged persuasions and veiled destinies                             110 splendours and glooms and glimmering incarnations of hopes and fears and twilight phantasies and sorrow with her family of sighs and pleasure blind with tears led by the gleam of her own dying smile instead of eyes                              115 came in slow pompthe moving pomp might seem like pageantry of mist on an autumnal stream  14 all he

with the tears which should adorn the ground dimmed the aereal eyes that kindle day afar the melancholy thunder moaned pale ocean in unquiet slumber lay                                   125 and the wild winds flew round sobbing in their dismay  15 lost echo sits amid the voiceless mountains and feeds her grief with his remembered lay and will no more reply to winds or fountains or amorous birds perched on the young green spray                   130 or herdsmans horn or bell at closing day since she can mimic not his lips more dear than those for whose disdain she pined away into a shadow of all soundsa drear murmur between their songs is all the woodmen hear                135  16 grief made the young spring wild and she threw down her kindling buds as if she autumn were or they dead leaves since her delight is flown for whom should she have waked the sullen year to phoebus was not hyacinth so dear                                  140 nor to himself narcissus as to both thou

mourns not her mate with such melodious pain not so the eagle who like thee could scale heaven and could nourish in the suns domain her mighty youth with morning doth complain soaring and screaming round her empty nest                          150 as albion wails for thee the curse of cain light on his head who pierced thy innocent breast and scared the angel soul that was its earthly guest  18 ah woe is me winter is come and gone but grief returns with the revolving year                           155 the airs and streams renew their joyous tone the ants the bees the swallows reappear fresh leaves and flowers deck the dead seasons bier the amorous birds now pair in every brake and build their mossy homes in field and brere                      160 and the green lizard and the golden snake like unimprisoned flames out of their trance awake  19 through wood and stream and field and hill and ocean a quickening life from the earths heart has burst as it has ever done with change and motion                         165 from the great morning of the world when first god dawned on chaos in its stream immersed the lamps of heaven flash with a softer light all baser things pant with lifes sacred thirst diffuse themselves and spend in loves delight                     170 the beauty and the joy of their renewed might  20 the leprous corpse touched by this spirit tender exhales

hearts core a wound more fierce than his with tears and sighs and all the dreams that watched uranias eyes and all the echoes whom their sisters song                          195 had held in holy silence cried arise swift as a thought by the snake memory stung from her ambrosial rest the fading splendour sprung  23 she rose like an autumnal night that springs out of the east and follows wild and drear                          200 the golden day which on eternal wings even as a ghost abandoning a bier had left the earth a corpse sorrow and fear so struck so roused so rapped urania so saddened round her like an atmosphere                             205 of stormy mist so swept her on her way even to the mournful place where adonais lay  24 out of her secret paradise she sped through camps and cities rough with stone and steel and human hearts which to her aery tread                            210 yielding not wounded the invisible palms of her tender feet whereer they fell and barbed tongues and thoughts more sharp than they rent the soft form they never could repel whose sacred blood like the young tears of may                     215 paved with eternal flowers that undeserving way  25 in the deathchamber for a moment death shamed by the presence of that living might blushed to annihilation and the breath revisited those lips and lifes pale light                          220 flashed through those limbs so late her dear delight leave me not wild and drear and comfortless as silent lightning leaves the starless night leave me not cried urania her distress roused death death rose and smiled and met her vain caress        225  26 stay yet awhile speak to me once again kiss me so long but as a kiss may live and in my heartless breast and burning brain that word that kiss shall all thoughts else survive with food of saddest memory kept alive                              230 now thou art dead as if it were a part of thee my adonais i would give all that i am to be as thou now art but i am chained to time and cannot thence depart  27 o gentle child beautiful as thou wert                             235 why didst thou leave the trodden paths of men too soon and with weak hands though mighty heart dare the unpastured dragon in his den defenceless as thou wert oh where was then wisdom the mirrored shield or scorn the spear                      240 or hadst thou waited the full cycle when thy spirit should have filled its crescent sphere the monsters of lifes waste had fled from thee like deer  28 the herded wolves bold only to pursue the obscene ravens clamorous oer the dead                         245 the vultures to the conquerors banner true who feed where desolation first has fed and whose wings rain contagionhow they fled when like apollo from his golden bow the pythian of the age one arrow sped                                250 and smiledthe spoilers tempt no second blow they fawn on the proud feet that spurn them lying low  29 the sun comes forth and many reptiles spawn he sets and each ephemeral insect then is gathered into death without a dawn                               255 and the immortal stars awake again so is it in the world of living men a godlike mind soars forth in its delight making earth bare and veiling heaven and when it sinks the swarms that dimmed or shared its light                 260 leave to its kindred lamps the spirits awful night  30 thus ceased she and the mountain shepherds came their garlands sere their magic mantles rent the pilgrim of eternity whose fame over his living head like heaven is bent                            265 an early but enduring monument came veiling all the lightnings of his song in sorrow from her wilds ierne sent the sweetest lyrist of her saddest wrong and love taught grief to fall like music from his tongue            270  31 midst others of less note came one frail form a phantom among men companionless as the last cloud of an expiring storm whose thunder is its knell he as i guess had gazed on natures naked loveliness                              275 actaeonlike and now he fled astray with feeble steps oer the worlds wilderness and his own thoughts along that rugged way pursued like raging hounds their father and their prey  32 a pardlike spirit beautiful and swift                              280 a love in desolation maskeda power girt round with weaknessit can scarce uplift the weight of the superincumbent hour it is a dying lamp a falling shower a breaking billoweven whilst we speak                             285 is it not broken on the withering flower the killing sun smiles brightly on a cheek the life can burn in blood even while the heart may break  33 his head was bound with pansies overblown and faded violets white and pied and blue                        290 and a light spear topped with a cypress cone round whose rude shaft dark ivytresses grew yet dripping with the forests noonday dew vibrated as the everbeating heart shook the weak hand that grasped it of that crew                    295 he came the last neglected and apart a herdabandoned deer struck by the hunters dart  34 all stood aloof and at his partial moan smiled through their tears well knew that gentle band who in anothers fate now wept his own                              300 as in the accents of an unknown land he sung new sorrow sad urania scanned the strangers mien and murmured who art thou he answered not but with a sudden hand made bare his branded and ensanguined brow                          305 which was like cains or christsoh that it should be so  35 what softer voice is hushed over the dead athwart what brow is that dark mantle thrown what form leans sadly oer the white deathbed in mockery of monumental stone                                      310 the heavy heart heaving without a moan if it be he who gentlest of the wise taught soothed loved honoured the departed one let me not vex with inharmonious sighs the silence of that hearts accepted sacrifice                      315  36 our adonais has drunk poisonoh what deaf and viperous murderer could crown lifes early cup with such a draught of woe the nameless worm would now itself disown it felt yet could escape the magic tone                            320 whose prelude held all envy hate and wrong but what was howling in one breast alone silent with expectation of the song whose masters hand is cold whose silver lyre unstrung  37 live thou whose infamy is not thy fame                             325 live fear no heavier chastisement from me thou noteless blot on a remembered name but be thyself and know thyself to be and ever at thy season be thou free to spill the venom when thy fangs oerflow                          330 remorse and selfcontempt shall cling to thee hot shame shall burn upon thy secret brow and like a beaten hound tremble thou shaltas now  38 nor let us weep that our delight is fled far from these carrion kites

fountain whence it came a portion of the eternal which must glow                            340 through time and change unquenchably the same whilst thy cold embers choke the sordid hearth of shame  39 peace peace he is not dead he doth not sleep he hath awakened from the dream of life tis we who lost in stormy visions keep                            345 with phantoms an unprofitable strife and in mad trance strike with our spirits knife invulnerable nothingswe decay like corpses in a charnel fear and grief convulse us and consume us day by day                               350 and cold hopes swarm like worms within our living clay  40 he has outsoared the shadow of our night envy and calumny and hate and pain and that unrest which men miscall delight can touch him not and torture not again                             355 from the contagion of the worlds slow stain he is secure and now can never mourn a heart grown cold a head grown gray in vain nor when the spirits self has ceased to burn with sparkless ashes load an unlamented urn                         360  41 he lives he wakestis death is dead not he mourn not for adonaisthou young dawn turn all thy dew to splendour for from thee the spirit thou lamentest is not gone ye caverns and ye forests cease to moan                            365 cease ye faint flowers and fountains and thou air which like a mourning veil thy scarf hadst thrown oer the abandoned earth now leave it bare even to the joyous stars which smile on its despair  42 he is made one with nature there is heard                           370 his voice in all her music from the moan of thunder to the song of nights sweet bird he is a presence to be felt and known in darkness and in light from herb and stone spreading itself whereer that power may move                        375 which has withdrawn his being to its own which wields the world with neverwearied love sustains it from beneath and kindles it above  43 he is a portion of the loveliness which once he made more lovely he doth bear                         380 his part while the one spirits plastic stress sweeps through the dull dense world compelling there all new successions to the forms they wear torturing th unwilling dross that checks its flight to its own likeness as each mass may bear                          385 and bursting in its beauty and its might from trees and beasts and men into the heavens light  44 the splendours of the firmament of time may be eclipsed but are extinguished not like stars to their appointed height they climb                     390 and death is a low mist which cannot blot the brightness it may veil when lofty thought lifts a young heart above its mortal lair and love and life contend in it for what shall be its earthly doom the dead live there                       395 and move like winds of light on dark and stormy air  45 the inheritors of unfulfilled renown rose from their thrones built beyond mortal thought far

spirit without spot arose and lucan by his death approved oblivion as they rose shrank like a thing reproved                  405  46 and many more whose names on earth are dark but whose transmitted effluence cannot die so long as fire outlives the parent spark rose robed in dazzling immortality thou art become as one of us they cry                            410 it was for thee yon kingless sphere has long swung blind in unascended majesty silent alone amid a heaven of song assume thy winged throne thou vesper of our throng  47 who mourns for adonais oh come forth

dead                         440 a light of laughing flowers along the grass is spread  50 and gray walls moulder round on which dull time feeds like slow fire upon a hoary brand and one keen pyramid with wedge sublime pavilioning the dust of him who planned                              445 this refuge for his memory doth stand like flame transformed to marble and beneath a field is spread on

subject of calumny as it relates to me as an author i have dared and invited censure if i understand myself i have written neither for profit nor for fame i have employed my poetical compositions and publications simply as the instruments of that sympathy between myself and others which the ardent and unbounded love i cherished for my kind incited me to acquire i expected all sorts of stupidity and insolent contempt from those  these compositions excepting the tragedy of the cenci which was written rather to try my powers than to unburthen my full heart are insufficientlycommendation than

a most stupid and malignant race as a bankrupt thief turns thieftaker in despair so an unsuccessful author turns critic but a young spirit panting for fame doubtful of its powers and certain only of its aspirations is ill qualified to assign its true value to the sneer of this world he knows not that such stuff as this is of the abortive and monstrous births which time consumes as fast as it produces he sees the truth and falsehood the merits and demerits of his case inextricably entangledno personal offence should have drawn from me this public comment upon such stuff  the offence of

derives its interest should it be found to possess any solely from the intense sympathy which the author feels with the cause he would celebrate  the subject in its present state is insusceptible of being treated otherwise than lyrically and if i have called this poem a drama from the circumstance of its being composed in dialogue the licence is not greater than that which has been assumed by other poets who have called their productions epics only because they have been divided into twelve or twentyfour books  the persae of aeschylus afforded me the first model of my conception although the decision of the glorious contest now waging in greece being yet suspended forbids a catastrophe parallel to the return of xerxes and the desolation of the persians i have therefore contented myself with exhibiting a series of lyric pictures and with having wrought upon the curtain of futurity which falls upon the unfinished scene such figures of indistinct and visionary delineation as suggest the final triumph of the greek cause as a portion of the cause of civilisation and social improvement  the drama if drama it must be called is however so inartificial that i doubt whether if recited on the thespian waggon to an athenian village at the dionysiaca it would have obtained the prize of the goat i shall bear with equanimity any punishment greater than the loss of such a reward which the aristarchi of the hour may think fit to inflict  the only goatsong which i have yet attempted has i confess in spite of the unfavourable nature of the subject received a greater and a more valuable portion of applause than i expected or than it deserved  common fame is the only authority which i can allege for the details which form the basis of the poem and i must trespass upon the forgiveness of my readers for the display of newspaper erudition to which i have been reduced undoubtedly until the conclusion of the war it will be impossible to obtain an account of it sufficiently authentic for historical materials but poets have their privilege and it is unquestionable that actions of the most exalted courage have been performed by the greeksthat they have gained more than one naval victory and that their defeat in wallachia was signalized by circumstances of heroism more glorious even than victory  the apathy of the rulers of the civilised world to the astonishing circumstance of the descendants of that nation to which they owe their civilisation rising as it were from the ashes of their ruin is something perfectly inexplicable to a mere spectator of the shows of this mortal scene we are all greeks our laws our literature our religion our arts have their root in greece but for greecerome the instructor the conqueror or the metropolis of our ancestors would have spread no illumination with her arms and we might still have been savages and idolaters or what is worse might have arrived at such a stagnant and miserable state of social institution as china and japan possess  the human form and the human mind attained to a perfection in greece which has impressed its image on those faultless productions whose very fragments are the despair of modern art and has propagated impulses which cannot cease through a thousand channels of manifest or imperceptible operation to ennoble and delight mankind until the extinction of the race  the modern greek is the descendant of those glorious beings whom the imagination almost refuses to figure to itself as belonging to our kind and he inherits much of their sensibility their rapidity of conception their enthusiasm and their courage if in many instances he is degraded by moral and political slavery to the practice of the basest vices it engendersand that below the level of ordinary degradationlet us reflect that the corruption of the best produces the worst and that habits which subsist only in relation to a peculiar state of social institution may be expected to cease as soon as that relation is dissolved in fact the greeks since the admirable novel of anastasius could have been a faithful picture of their manners have undergone most important changes the flower of their youth returning to their country from the universities of italy germany and france have communicated to their fellowcitizens the latest results of that social perfection of which their ancestors were the original source the university of chios contained before the breaking out of the revolution eight hundred students and among them several germans and americans the munificence and energy of many of the greek princes and merchants directed to the renovation of their country with a spirit and a wisdom which has few examples is above all praise  the english permit their own oppressors to act according to their natural sympathy with the turkish tyrant and to brand upon their name the indelible blot of an alliance with the enemies of domestic happiness of christianity and civilisation  russia desires to possess not to liberate greece and is contented to see the turks its natural enemies and the greeks its intended slaves enfeeble each other until one or both fall into its net the wise and generous policy of england would have consisted in establishing the independence of greece and in maintaining it both against russia and the turkbut when was the oppressor generous or just  should the english people ever become free they will reflect upon the part which those who presume to represent their will have played in the great drama of the revival of liberty with feelings which it would become them to anticipate this is the age of the war of the oppressed against the oppressors and every one of those ringleaders of the privileged gangs of murderers and swindlers called sovereigns look to each other for aid against the common enemy and suspend their mutual jealousies in the presence of a mightier fear of this holy alliance all the despots of the earth are virtual members but a new race has arisen throughout europe nursed in the abhorrence of the opinions which are its chains and she will continue to produce fresh generations to accomplish that destiny which tyrants foresee and dread

done much towards awakening the italians to an imitation of their great ancestors  2 the chorus l 197  the popular notions of christianity are represented in this chorus as true in their relation to the worship they superseded and that which in all probability they will supersede without considering their merits in a relation more universal the first stanza contrasts the immortality of the living and thinking beings which inhabit the planets and to use a common and inadequate phrase clothe themselves in matter with the transience of the noblest manifestations of the external world  the concluding verses indicate a progressive state of more or loss exalted existence according to the degree of perfection which every distinct intelligence may have attained let it not be supposed that i mean to dogmatise upon a subject concerning which all men are equally ignorant or that i think the gordian knot of the origin of evil can be disentangled by that or any similar assertions the received hypothesis of a being resembling men in the moral attributes of his nature having called us out of nonexistence and after inflicting on us the misery of the commission of error should superadd that of the punishment and the privations consequent upon it still would remain inexplicable and incredible that there is a true solution of the riddle and that in our present state that solution is unattainable by us are propositions which may be regarded as equally certain meanwhile as it is the province of the poet to attach himself to those ideas which exalt and ennoble humanity let him be permitted to have conjectured the condition of that futurity towards which we are all impelled by an inextinguishable thirst for immortality until better arguments can be produced than sophisms which disgrace the cause this desire itself must remain the strongest and the only presumption that eternity is the inheritance of every thinking being  3 no hoary priests after that patriarch l 245  the greek patriarch after haying been compelled to fulminate an anathema against the insurgents was put to death by the turks  fortunately the greeks have been taught that they cannot buy security by degradation and the turks though equally cruel are less cunning than the smoothfaced tyrants of europe as to the anathema his holiness might as well have thrown his mitre at mount athos for any effect that it produced the chiefs of the greeks are almost all men of comprehension and enlightened views on religion and politics  4 the freedman of a western poetchief l 563  a greek who had been lord byrons servant commands the insurgents in attica this greek lord byron informs me though a poet and an enthusiastic patriot gave him rather the idea of a timid and unenterprising person it appears that circumstances make men what they are and that we all contain the germ of a degree of degradation or of greatness whose connection with our character is determined by events  5 the greeks expect a saviour from the west l 598  it is reported that this messiah had arrived at a seaport near lacedaemon in an american brig the association of names and ideas is irresistibly ludicrous but the

easily have made the jew a regular conjuror and the phantom an ordinary ghost i have preferred to represent the jew as disclaiming all pretension or even belief in supernatural agency and as tempting mahmud to that state of mind in which ideas may be supposed to assume the force of sensations through the confusion of thought with the objects of thought and the excess of passion animating the creations of imagination  it is a sort of natural magic susceptible of being exercised in a degree by any one who should have made himself master of the secret associations of anothers thoughts  7 the chorus l 1060  the final chorus is indistinct and obscure as the event of the living drama whose arrival it foretells prophecies of wars and rumours of wars etc may safely be made by poet or prophet in any age but to anticipate however darkly a period of regeneration and happiness is a more hazardous exercise of the faculty which bards possess or feign it will remind the reader magno nec proximus intervallo of isaiah and virgil whose ardent spirits overleaping the actual reign of evil which we endure and bewail already saw the possible and perhaps approaching state of society in which the lion shall lie down with the lamb and omnis feret omnia tellus let these great names be my authority and my excuse  8 saturn and love their long repose shall burst l 1090  saturn and love were among the deities of a real or imaginary state of innocence and happiness all those who fell or the gods of greece asia and egypt the one who rose or jesus christ at whose appearance the idols of the pagan world wore amerced of their worship and the many unsubdued or the monstrous objects of the idolatry of china india the antarctic islands and the native tribes of america certainly have reigned over the understandings of men in conjunction or in succession during periods in which all we know of evil has been in a state of portentous and until the revival of learning and the arts perpetually increasing activity the grecian gods seem indeed to have been personally more innocent although it cannot be said that as far as temperance and chastity are concerned they gave so edifying an example as their successor the sublime human character of jesus christ was deformed by an imputed identification with a power who tempted betrayed and punished the innocent beings who were called into existence by his sole will and for the period of a thousand years the spirit of this most just wise and benevolent of men has been propitiated with myriads of hecatombs of those who approached the nearest to his innocence and wisdom sacrificed under every aggravation of atrocity and variety of torture the horrors of the mexican the peruvian and the indian superstitions are well known  note on hellas by mrs shelley  the south of europe was in a state of great political excitement at the beginning of the year 1821 the spanish revolution had been a signal to italy secrete societies were formed and when naples rose to declare the constitution the call was responded to from brundusium to the foot of the alps to crush these attempts to obtain liberty early in 1821 the austrians poured their armies into the peninsula at first their coming rather seemed to add energy and resolution to a people long enslaved the piedmontese asserted their freedom genoa threw off the yoke of the king of sardinia and as if in playful imitation the people of the little state of massa and carrara gave the conge to their sovereign and set up a republic  tuscany alone was perfectly tranquil it was said that the austrian minister presented a list of sixty carbonari to the grand duke urging their imprisonment and the grand duke replied i do not know whether these sixty men are carbonari but i know if i imprison them i shall directly have sixty thousand start up but though the tuscans had no desire to disturb the paternal government beneath whose shelter they slumbered they regarded the progress of the various italian revolutions with intense interest and hatred for the austrian was warm in every bosom but they had slender hopes they knew that the neapolitans would offer no fit resistance to the regular german troops and that the overthrow of the constitution in naples would act as a decisive blow against all struggles for liberty in italy  we have seen the rise and progress of reform but the holy alliance was alive and active in those days and few could dream of the peaceful triumph of liberty it seemed then that the armed assertion of freedom in the south of europe was the only hope of the liberals as if it prevailed the nations of the north would imitate the example happily the reverse has proved the fact the countries accustomed to the exercise of the privileges of freemen to a limited extent have extended and are extending these limits freedom and knowledge have now a chance of proceeding hand in hand and if it continue thus we may hope for the durability of both then as i have saidin 1821shelley as well as every other lover of liberty looked upon the struggles in spain and italy as decisive of the destinies of the world probably for centuries to come the interest he took in the progress of affairs was intense when genoa declared itself free his hopes were at their highest day after day he read the bulletins of the austrian army and sought eagerly to gather tokens of its defeat he heard of the revolt of genoa with emotions of transport his whole heart and soul were in the triumph of the cause we were living at pisa at that time and several wellinformed italians at the head of whom we may place the celebrated vacca were accustomed to seek for sympathy in their hopes from shelley they did not find such for the despair they too generally experienced founded on contempt for their southern countrymen  while the fate of the progress of the austrian armies then invading naples was yet in suspense the news of another revolution filled him with exultation we had formed the acquaintance at pisa of several constantinopolitan greeks of the family of prince caradja formerly hospodar of wallachia who hearing that the bowstring the accustomed finale of his viceroyalty was on the road to him escaped with his treasures and took up his abode in tuscany among these was the gentleman to whom the drama of hellas is dedicated prince mavrocordato was warmed by those aspirations for the independence of his country which filled the hearts of many of his countrymen he often intimated the possibility of an insurrection in greece but we had no idea of its being so near at hand when on the 1st of april 1821 he called on shelley bringing the proclamation of his cousin prince ypsilanti and radiant with exultation and delight declared that henceforth greece would be free  shelley had hymned the dawn of liberty in spain and naples in two odes dictated by the warmest enthusiasm he felt himself naturally impelled to decorate with poetry the uprise of the descendants of that people whose works he regarded with deep admiration and to adopt the vaticinatory character in prophesying their success hellas was written in a moment of enthusiasm it is curious to remark how well he overcomes the difficulty of forming a drama out of such scant materials his prophecies indeed came true in their general not their particular purport he did not foresee the death of lord londonderry which was to be the epoch of a change in english politics particularly as regarded foreign affairs nor that the navy of his country would fight for instead of against the greeks

auguring ultimate good yet grieving over the vicissitudes to be endured in the interval he composed his drama  hellas was among the last of his compositions and is among the most beautiful the choruses are singularly imaginative and melodious in their versification there are some stanzas that beautifully exemplify shelleys peculiar style as for instance the assertion of the intellectual empire which must be for ever the inheritance of the country of homer sophocles and plato  but greece and her foundations are built below the tide of war based on the crystalline sea of thought and its eternity  and again that philosophical truth felicitously imaged forth  revenge and wrong bring forth their kind the foul cubs like their parents are their den is in the guilty mind and conscience feeds them with despair  the conclusion of the last chorus is among the most beautiful of his lyrics the imagery is distinct and majestic the prophecy such as poets love to dwell upon the regeneration of mankindand that regeneration reflecting back splendour on the foregone time from which it inherits so much of intellectual wealth and memory of past virtuous deeds as must render the possession of happiness and peace of tenfold value     fragments of an unfinished drama  published in part lines 169 100120 by mrs shelley posthumous poems 1824 and again with the notes in poetical works 1839 lines

recalling the memory of her whom he left and who laments his loss he escapes from the enchanted island and returns to his lady his mode of life makes him again go to sea and the enchantress seizes the

outworn with speed or that it loved and passion made the pulse of its bright life throb like an anxious heart till it diffused itself and all the chamber                         135 and walls seemed

tideless sand which the first foam erases half and half leaves legible at length i rose and went visiting my flowers from pot to pot and thought                     155 to set new cuttings in the empty urns and when i came to that beside the lattice i saw two little darkgreen leaves lifting the light mould at their birth and then i halfremembered my forgotten dream                                160 and day by day green as a gourd in june the plant grew fresh and thick yet no one knew what plant it was its stem and tendrils seemed like emerald snakes mottled and diamonded with azure mail and streaks of woven silver                         165 and all the sheaths that folded the dark buds rose like the crest of cobradicapel until the golden eye of the bright flower through the dark lashes of those veined lids disencumbered of their silent sleep                              170 gazed like a star into the morning light its leaves were delicate you almost saw the pulses with which the purple velvet flower was fed to overflow and like a poets heart                                 175 changing bright fancy to sweet sentiment changed half the light to fragrance it soon fell and to a green and dewy embryofruit left all its treasured beauty day by day i nursed the plant and on the double flute                          180 played to it on the sunny winter days soft melodies as sweet as april rain on silent leaves and sang those words in which passion makes echo taunt the sleeping strings and i would send tales of forgotten love                             185 late into the lone night and sing wild songs of maids deserted in the olden time and weep like a soft cloud in aprils bosom upon the sleeping eyelids of the plant so that perhaps it dreamed that spring was come                     190 and crept abroad into the moonlight air and loosened all its limbs as noon by noon the sun averted less his oblique beam  indian and the plant died not in the frost  lady it grew and went out of the lattice which i left                             195 half open for it trailing its quaint spires along the garden and across the lawn and down the slope of moss and through the tufts of wildflower roots and stumps of trees oergrown with simple lichens and old hoary stones                           200 on to the margin of the glassy pool even to a nook of unblown violets and liliesofthevalley yet unborn under a pine with ivy overgrown and theme its fruit lay like a sleeping lizard                       205 under the shadows but when spring indeed came to unswathe her infants and the lilies peeped from their bright green masks to wonder at this shape of autumn couched in their recess then it dilated and it grew until                                   210 one half

south wind in spicy vales might give to some light cloud bound from the golden dawn to fairy isles of evening and it seemed in hue and form that it had been a mirror of all the hues and forms around

pillared stems of the dark sylvan temple and reflections                           225 of every infant flower and star of moss and veined leaf in the azure odorous air and thus it lay in the elysian calm of its own beauty floating on the line which like a film in purest space divided                          230 the heaven beneath the water from the heaven above the clouds and every day i went watching its growth and wondering and as the day grew hot methought i saw a glassy vapour dancing on the pool                                 235 and on it little quaint and filmy shapes with dizzy

a strange trance over my fancy grew which was not slumber for the shade it spread                       30  was so transparent that the scene came through as clear as when a veil of light is drawn oer evening hills they glimmer and i knew  that i had felt the freshness of that dawn bathe in the same cold dew my brow and hair                         35 and sate as thus upon that slope of lawn  under the selfsame bough and heard as there the birds the fountains and the ocean hold sweet talk in music through the enamoured air and then a vision on my train was rolled                            40    as in that trance of wondrous thought i lay this was the tenour of my waking dream methought i sate beside a public way  thick strewn with summer dust and a great stream of people there was hurrying to and fro                             45 numerous as gnats upon the evening gleam  all hastening onward yet none seemed to know whither he went or whence he came or why he made one of the multitude

some flying from the thing they feared and some seeking the object of anothers fear                                55  and others as with steps towards the tomb pored on the trodden worms that crawled beneath and others mournfully within the gloom  of their own shadow walked and called it death and some fled from it as it were a ghost                            60 half fainting in the affliction of vain breath  but more with motions which each other crossed pursued or shunned the shadows the clouds threw or birds within the noonday aether lost  upon that path where flowers never grew and weary with vain toil and faint for thirst heard not the fountains whose melodious dew  out of their mossy cells forever burst nor felt the breeze which from the forest told of grassy paths and woodlawns

moved under the mass                            360  of the deep cavern and with palms so tender their tread broke not the mirror of its billow glided along the river and did bend her  head under the dark boughs till like a willow her fair hair swept the bosom of the stream                          365 that whispered with delight to be its pillow  as one enamoured is upborne in dream oer lilypaven lakes mid silver mist to wondrous music so this shape might seem  partly to tread the waves with feet which kissed                    370 the dancing foam partly to glide along the air which roughened the moist amethyst  or the faint morning beams that fell among the trees or the soft shadows of the trees and her feet ever to the ceaseless song                             375  of leaves and winds and waves and birds and bees and falling drops moved in a measure new yet sweet as on the summer evening breeze  up from the lake a shape of golden dew between two rocks athwart the rising moon                          380 dances i the wind where never eagle flew  and still her feet no less than the sweet tune to which they moved seemed as they moved to blot the thoughts of him who gazed on them and soon  all that was seemed as if it had been not                         385 and all the gazers mind was strewn beneath her feet like embers and she thought by thought  trampled its sparks into the dust of death as day upon the threshold of the east treads out the lamps of night until the breath                      390  of darkness reillumine even the least of heavens living eyeslike day she came making the night a dream and ere she ceased  to move as one between desire and shame suspended i saidif as it doth seem                              395 thou comest from the realm without a name

lily stricken by the wand of dewy mornings vital alchemy  i rose and bending at her sweet command touched with faint lips the cup she raised and suddenly my brain became as sand

chrysolite  of sunrise ere it tinge the mountaintops                         415 and as the presence of that fairest planet although unseen is felt by one who hopes  that his days path may end as he began it in that stars smile whose light is like the scent of a jonquil when evening breezes fan it                            420  or the soft note in which his dear lament the brescian shepherd breathes or the caress that turned his weary slumber to content  so knew i in that lights severe excess the presence of that shape which on the stream                       425 moved as i moved along

the tempest of the splendour which forbade  shadow to fall from leaf and stone the crew                        445 seemed in that light like atomies to dance within a sunbeamsome upon the new

early poems by mrs shelley  the remainder of shelleys poems will be arranged in the order in which they were written of course mistakes will occur in placing some of the shorter ones for as i have said many of these were thrown aside and i never saw them till i had the misery of looking over his writings after the hand that traced them was dust and some were in the hands of others and i never saw them till now the subjects of the poems are often to me an unerring guide but on other occasions i can only guess by finding them in the pages of the same manuscript book that contains poems with the date of whose composition i am fully conversant in the present arrangement all his poetical translations will be placed together at the end  the loss of his early papers prevents my being able to give any of the poetry of his boyhood of the few i give as early poems the greater part were published with alastor some of them were written previously some at the same period the poem beginning oh there are spirits in the air was addressed in idea to coleridge whom he never knew and at whose character he could only guess imperfectly through his writings and accounts he heard of him from some who knew him well he regarded his change of opinions as rather an act of will than conviction and believed that in his inner heart he would be haunted by what shelley considered the better and holier aspirations of his youth the summer evening that suggested to him the poem written in the churchyard of lechlade occurred during his voyage up the thames in 1815 he had been advised by a physician to live as much as possible in the open air and a fortnight of a bright warm july was spent in tracing the thames to its source he never spent a season more tranquilly than the summer of 1815 he had just recovered from a severe pulmonary attack the weather was warm and pleasant he lived near windsor forest and his life was spent under its shades or on the water meditating subjects for verse hitherto he had chiefly aimed at extending his political doctrines and attempted so to do by appeals in prose essays to the people exhorting them to claim their rights but he had now begun to feel that the time for action was not ripe in england and that the pen was the only instrument wherewith to prepare the way for better things  in the scanty journals kept during those years i find a record of the books that shelley read during several years during the years of 1814 and 1815 the list is extensive it includes in greek homer hesiod theocritus the histories of thucydides and herodotus and diogenes laertius in latin petronius suetonius some of the works of cicero a large proportion of those of seneca and livy in english miltons poems wordsworths excursion southeys madoc and thalaba locke on the human understanding bacons novum organum in italian ariosto tasso and alfieri in french the reveries dun solitaire of rousseau to these may be added several modern books of travel he read few novels

respectively of sunset from an unpublished poem and grief a fragment  there late was one within whose subtle being as light and wind within some delicate cloud that fades amid the blue noons burning sky genius and death contended none may know the sweetness of the joy which made his breath                       5 fail like the trances of the summer air when with the lady of his love who then first knew the unreserve of mingled being he walked along the pathway of a field which to the east a hoar wood shadowed oer                         10 but to the west was open to the sky there now the sun had sunk but lines of gold hung on the ashen clouds and on the points of the far level grass and nodding flowers and the old dandelions hoary beard                                 15 and mingled

still residing at bishopsgate he spent the summer on the shores of the lake of geneva the hymn to intellectual beauty was conceived during his voyage round the lake with lord byron he occupied himself during this voyage by reading the nouvelle heloise for the first time the reading it on the very spot where the scenes are laid added to the interest and he was at once surprised and charmed by the passionate eloquence and earnest enthralling interest that pervade this work there was something in the character of saintpreux in his abnegation of self and in the worship he paid to love that coincided with shelleys own disposition and though differing in many of the views and shocked by others yet the effect of the whole was fascinating and delightful  mont blanc was inspired by a view of that mountain and its surrounding peaks and valleys as he lingered on the bridge of arve on his way through the valley of chamouni shelley makes the following mention of this poem in his publication of the history of a six weeks tour and letters from switzerland the poem entitled mont blanc is written by the author of the two letters from chamouni and vevai it was composed under the immediate impression of the deep and powerful feelings excited by the objects which it attempts to describe and as an undisciplined overflowing of the soul rests its claim to approbation on an attempt to imitate the untamable wildness and inaccessible solemnity from which those feelings sprang  this was an eventful year and less time was given to study than usual in the list of his reading i find in greek theocritus the prometheus of aeschylus several of plutarchs lives and the works of lucian in latin lucretius plinys letters the annals and germany of tacitus in french the history of the french revolution by lacretelle he read for the first time this year montaignes essays and regarded them ever after as one of the most delightful and instructive books in the world the list is scanty in

turned she saw aloft in the morning air                                    20 which now with hues of sunrise burned a great black anchor rising there and wherever the lady turned her eyes it hung before her in the skies  5 the sky was blue as the summer sea                                  25 the depths were cloudless overhead the air was calm as it could be there was no sight or sound of dread but that black anchor floating still over the piny eastern hill                                          30  6 the lady grew sick with a weight of fear to see that anchor ever hanging and veiled her eyes she then did hear the sound as of a dim low clanging and looked abroad if she might know                                  35 was it aught else or but the flow of the blood in her own veins to and fro  7 there was a mist in the sunless air which shook as it were with an earthquakes shock but the very weeds that blossomed there                              40 were moveless and each mighty rock stood on its basis steadfastly the anchor was seen no more on high  8 but piled around with summits hid in lines of cloud at intervals                                      45 stood many a mountain pyramid among whose everlasting walls two mighty cities shone and ever through the red mist their domes did quiver  9 on two dread mountains from whose crest                            50 might seem the eagle for her brood would neer have hung her dizzy nest those towerencircled cities stood a vision strange such towers to see sculptured and wrought so gorgeously                                55 where human art could never be  10 and columns framed of marble white and giant fanes dome over dome piled and triumphant gates all bright with workmanship which could not come                               60 from touch of mortal instrument shot oer the vales or lustre lent from its own shapes magnificent  11 but still the lady heard that clang filling the wide air far away                                       65 and still the mist whose light did hang among the mountains shook alway so that the ladys heart beat fast as half in joy and half aghast on those high domes her look she cast                               70  12 sudden from out that city sprung a light that made the earth grow red two flames that each with quivering tongue licked its high domes and overhead among those mighty towers and fanes                                  75 dropped fire as a volcano rains its sulphurous ruin on the plains  13 and hark a rush as if the deep had burst its bonds she looked behind and saw over the western steep                                       80 a raging flood descend and wind through that wide vale she felt no fear but said within herself tis clear these towers are natures own and she to save them has sent forth the sea                                 85  14 and now those raging billows came where that fair lady sate and she was borne towards the showering flame by the wild waves heaped tumultuously and on a little plank the flow                                     90 of the whirlpool bore her to and fro  15 the flames were fiercely vomited from every tower and every dome and dreary light did widely shed oer that vast floods suspended foam                               95 beneath the smoke which hung its night on the stained cope of heavens light  16 the plank whereon that lady sate was driven through the chasms about and about between the peaks so desolate                                        100 of the drowning mountains in and out as the thistlebeard on a whirlwind sails while the flood was filling those hollow vales  17 at last her plank an eddy crossed and bore her to the citys wall                                     105 which now the flood had reached almost it might the stoutest heart appal to hear the fire roar and hiss through the domes of those mighty palaces  18 the eddy whirled her round and round                                 110 before a gorgeous gate which stood piercing the clouds of smoke which bound its aery arch with light like blood she looked on that gate of marble clear with wonder that extinguished fear                                  115  19 for it was filled with sculptures rarest of forms most beautiful and strange like nothing human but the fairest of winged shapes whose legions range throughout the sleep of those that are                              120 like this same lady good and fair  20 and as she looked still lovelier grew those marble formsthe sculptor sure was a strong spirit and the hue of his own mind did there endure                                     125 after the touch whose power had braided such grace was in some sad change faded  21 she looked the flames were dim the flood grew tranquil as a woodland river winding through hills in solitude                                   130 those marble shapes then seemed to quiver and their fair limbs to float in motion like weeds unfolding in the ocean  22 and their lips moved one seemed to speak when suddenly the mountains cracked                                 135 and through the chasm the flood did break with an earthuplifting cataract the statues gave a joyous scream and on its wings the pale thin dream lifted the lady from the stream                                     140  23 the dizzy flight of that phantom pale waked the fair lady from her sleep and she arose while from the veil of her dark eyes the dream did creep and she walked about as one who knew                                 145 that sleep has sights as clear and true as any waking eyes can view  notes 18 golden 1819 gold 1824 1839 28 or 1824 nor 1839 62 ora cj rossetti 63 itstheir cj rossetti 92 flames cj rossetti waves 1819 1824

mighty and despair nothing beside remains round the decay of that colossal wreck boundless and bare the lone and level sands stretch far away  note 9 these words appearthis legend clear b     note on poems of 1817 by mrs shelley  the very illness that oppressed and the aspect of death which had approached so near shelley appear to have kindled to yet keener life the spirit of poetry in his heart the restless thoughts kept awake by pain clothed themselves in verse much was composed during this year the revolt of islam written and printed was a great effortrosalind and helen was begunand the fragments and poems i can trace to the same period show how full of passion and reflection were his solitary hours  in addition to such poems as have an intelligible aim and shape many a stray idea and transitory emotion found imperfect and abrupt expression and then again lost themselves in silence as he never wandered without a book and without implements of writing i find many such in his manuscript books that scarcely bear record while some of them broken and vague as they are will appear valuable to those who love shelleys mind and desire to trace its workings  he projected also translating the hymns of homer his version of several of the shorter ones remains as well as that to mercury already published in the posthumous poems his readings this year were chiefly greek besides the hymns of homer and the iliad he read the dramas of aeschylus and sophocles the symposium of plato and arrians historia indica in latin apuleius alone is named in english the bible was his constant study he read a great portion of it aloud in the evening among these evening readings i find also mentioned the faerie queen and other modern works the production of his contemporaries coleridge wordsworth moore and byron  his life was now spent more in thought than actionhe had lost the eager spirit which believed it could achieve what it projected for the benefit of mankind and yet in the converse of daily life shelley was far from being a melancholy man he was eloquent when philosophy or politics or taste were the subjects of conversation he was playful and indulged in the wild spirit that mocked itself and othersnot in bitterness but in sport the author of nightmare abbey seized on some points of his character and some habits of his life when he painted scythrop he was not addicted to port or madeira but in youth he had read of illuminati and eleutherarchs and believed that he possessed the power of operating an immediate change in the minds of men and the state of society these wild dreams had faded sorrow and adversity had struck home but he struggled with despondency as he did with physical pain there are few who remember him sailing paper boats and watching the navigation of his tiny craft with eagernessor repeating with wild energy the ancient mariner and southeys old woman of berkeley but those who do will recollect that it was in such and in the creations of his own fancy when that was most daring and ideal that he sheltered himself from the storms and disappointments the pain and sorrow that beset his life  no words can express the anguish he felt when his elder children were torn from him in his first resentment against the chancellor on the passing of the decree he had written a curse in which there breathes besides haughty indignation all the tenderness of a fathers love which could imagine and fondly dwell upon its loss and the consequences  at one time while the question was still pending the chancellor had said some words that seemed to intimate that shelley should not be permitted the care of any of his children and for a moment he feared that our infant son would be torn from us he did not hesitate to resolve if such were menaced to abandon country fortune everything and to escape with his child and i find some unfinished stanzas addressed to this son whom afterwards we lost at rome written under the idea that we might suddenly be forced to cross the sea so to preserve him this poem as well as the one previously quoted were not written to exhibit the pangs of distress to the public they were the spontaneous outbursts of a man who brooded over his wrongs and woes and was impelled to shed the grace of his genius over the uncontrollable emotions of his heart i ought to observe that the fourth verse of this effusion is introduced in rosalind and helen when afterwards this child died at rome he wrote a propos of the english buryingground in that city this spot is the repository of a sacred loss of which the yearnings of a parents heart are now prophetic he is rendered immortal by love as his memory is by death my beloved child lies buried here i envy death the body far less than the oppressors the minds of those whom they have torn from me the one can only kill the body the other crushes the affections     poems written in 1818   to the nile  found by mr townshend meyer among the

earth is light                              5 around its unexpanded buds like many a voice of one delight the winds the birds the ocean floods the citys voice itself is soft like solitudes  2 i see the deeps untrampled floor                                    10 with green and purple seaweeds strown i see the waves upon the shore like light dissolved in starshowers thrown i sit upon the sands alone the lightning of the noontide ocean                                  15 is flashing round me and a tone arises from its measured motion how sweet did any heart now share in my emotion  3 alas i have nor hope nor health nor peace within nor calm around                                    20 nor that content surpassing wealth the sage in meditation found and walked with inward glory crowned nor fame nor power nor love nor leisure others i see whom these surround                                   25 smiling they live and call life pleasure to me that cup has been dealt in another measure  4 yet now despair itself is mild even as the winds and waters are i could lie down like a tired child                                 30 and weep away the life of care which i have borne and yet must bear till death like sleep might steal on me and i might feel in the warm air my cheek grow cold and hear the sea                                 35 breathe oer my dying brain its last monotony  5 some might lament that i were cold as i when this sweet day is gone which my lost heart too soon grown old insults with this untimely moan                                     40 they might lamentfor i

stars or moon  one nightingale in an interfluous wood satiate the hungry dark with melody                               5 and as a vale is watered by a flood  or as the moonlight fills the open sky struggling with darknessas a tuberose peoples some indian dell with scents which lie  like clouds above the flower from which they rose                   10 the singing of that happy nightingale in this sweet forest from the golden close  of evening till the star of dawn may fail was interfused upon the silentness the folded roses and the violets pale                                15  heard her

worshipped in the temple of the night  was awed into delight and by the charm girt as with an interminable zone                                   35 whilst that sweet bird whose music was a storm  of sound shook forth the dull oblivion out of their dreams harmony became love in every soul but one    and so this man returned with axe and saw                            40 at evening close from

  70 month after month endured it was a feast wheneer he found those globes of deepred gold which in the woods the strawberrytree doth bear suspended in their emerald atmosphere                               75  14 and in the roofless huts of vast morasses deserted by the feverstricken serf all overgrown with reeds and long rank grasses and hillocks heaped of mossinwoven turf and where the huge and speckled aloe made                           80 rooted in stones a broad and pointed shade  15 he housed himself there is a point of strand near vados tower and town and on one side the treacherous marsh divides it from the land shadowed by pine and ilex forests wide                              85 and on the other creeps eternally through muddy weeds the shallow sullen sea  16 here the earths

which sailed down to drink those freshes ere the deathmist went abroad and each one with peculiar talk and play                           110 wiled not untaught his silent time away  20 and the marshmeteors like tame beasts at night came licking with blue tongues his veined feet and he would watch them as like spirits bright in many entangled figures quaint and sweet                           115 to some enchanted music they would dance until they vanished at the first moonglance  21 he mocked the stars by grouping on each weed the summer dewglobes in the golden dawn and ere the hoarfrost languished he could read                    120 its pictured path as on bare spots of lawn its delicate brief touch in silver weaves the likeness of the woods remembered leaves  22 and many a fresh spring morn would he awaken while yet the unrisen sun made glow like iron                       125 quivering in crimson fire the peaks unshaken of mountains and blue isles which did environ with airclad crags that plain of land and sea and feel  liberty  23 and in the moonless nights when the dun ocean                        130 heaved underneath wide heaven starimpearled starting from dreams communed with the immeasurable world and felt his life beyond his limbs dilated till his mind grew like that it contemplated                        135  24 his food was the wild fig and strawberry the milky pinenuts which the autumnblast shakes into the tall grass or such small fry as from the sea by winterstorms are cast and the coarse bulbs of irisflowers he found                        140 knotted in clumps under the spongy ground  25 and so were kindled powers and thoughts which made his solitude less dark when memory came for years gone by leave each a deepening shade his spirit basked in its internal flame                           145 as when the black storm hurries round at night the fisher basks beside his red firelight  26 yet human hopes and cares and faiths and errors

shroud a ruin and below the rotting bones of dead antiquity     note on poems of 1818 by mrs shelley  we often hear of persons disappointed by a first visit to italy this was not shelleys case the aspect of its nature its sunny sky its majestic storms of the luxuriant vegetation of the country and the noble marblebuilt cities enchanted him the sight of the works of art was full enjoyment and wonder he had not studied pictures or statues before he now did so with the eye of taste that referred not to the rules of schools but to those of nature and truth the first entrance to rome opened to him a scene of remains of antique grandeur that far surpassed his expectations and the unspeakable beauty of naples and its environs added to the impression he received of the transcendent and glorious beauty of italy  our winter was spent at naples here he wrote the fragments of marenghi and the woodman and the nightingale which he afterwards threw aside at this time shelley suffered greatly in health he put himself under the care of a medical man who promised great things and made him endure severe bodily pain without any good results constant and poignant physical suffering exhausted him and though he preserved the appearance of cheerfulness and often greatly enjoyed our wanderings in the environs of naples and our excursions on its sunny sea yet many hours were passed when his thoughts shadowed by illness became gloomyand then he escaped to solitude and in verses which he hid from fear of wounding me poured forth morbid but too natural bursts of discontent and sadness one looks back with unspeakable regret and gnawing remorse to such periods fancying that had one been more alive to the nature of his feelings and more attentive to soothe them such would not have existed and yet enjoying as he appeared to do every sight or influence of earth or sky it was difficult to imagine that any melancholy he showed was aught but the effect of the constant pain to which he was a martyr  we lived in utter solitude and such is often not the nurse of cheerfulness for then at least with those who have been exposed to adversity the mind broods over its sorrows too intently while the society of the enlightened the witty and the wise enables us to forget ourselves by making us the sharers of the thoughts of others which is a portion of the philosophy of happiness shelley never liked society in numbersit harassed and wearied him but neither did he like loneliness and usually when alone sheltered himself against memory and reflection in a book but with one or two whom he loved he gave way to wild and joyous spirits or in more serious conversation expounded his opinions with vivacity and eloquence if an argument arose no man ever argued better he was clear logical and earnest in supporting his own views attentive patient and impartial while listening to those on the adverse side had not a wall of prejudice been raised at this time between him and his countrymen how many would have sought the acquaintance of one whom to know was to love and to revere how many of the more enlightened of his contemporaries have since regretted that they did not seek him how very few knew his worth while he lived and of those few several were withheld by timidity or envy from declaring their sense of it but no man was ever more enthusiastically lovedmore looked up to as one superior to his fellows in intellectual endowments and moral worth by the few who knew him well and had sufficient nobleness of soul to appreciate his superiority his excellence is now acknowledged but even while admitted not duly appreciated for who except those who were acquainted with him can imagine his unwearied benevolence his generosity his systematic forbearance and still less is his vast superiority in intellectual attainments sufficiently understoodhis sagacity his clear understanding his learning his prodigious memory all these as displayed in conversation were known to few while he lived and are now silent in the tomb  ahi orbo mondo ingrato gran cagion hai di dever pianger meco che quel ben ch era in te perdut hai seco     poems written in 1819   lines

by mrs shelley  shelley loved the people and respected them as often more virtuous as always more suffering and therefore more deserving of sympathy than the great he believed that a clash between the two classes of society was inevitable and he eagerly ranged himself on the peoples side he had an idea of publishing a series of poems adapted expressly to commemorate their circumstances and wrongs he wrote a few but in those days of prosecution for libel they could not be printed they are not among the best of his productions a writer being always shackled when he endeavours to write down to the comprehension of those who could not understand or feel a highly imaginative style but they show his earnestness and with what heartfelt compassion he went home to the direct point of injurythat oppression is detestable as being the parent of starvation nakedness and ignorance besides these outpourings of compassion and indignation he had meant to adorn the cause he loved with loftier poetry of glory and triumph such is the scope of the ode to the assertors of liberty he sketched also a new version of our national anthem as addressed to liberty     poems written in 1820   the sensitive

poetical works 1839 both editions  part 1  a sensitive plant in a garden grew and the young winds fed it with silver dew and it opened its fanlike leaves to the light and closed them beneath the kisses of night  and the spring arose on the garden fair                             5 like the spirit of love felt everywhere and each flower and herb on earths dark breast rose from the dreams of its wintry rest  but none ever trembled and panted with bliss in the garden the field or the wilderness                         10 like a doe in the noontide with loves sweet want as the companionless sensitive plant  the snowdrop and then the violet arose from the ground with warm rain wet and their breath was mixed with fresh odour sent                    15 from the turf like the voice and the instrument  then the pied windflowers and the tulip tall and narcissi the fairest among them all who gaze on their eyes in the streams recess till they die of their own dear loveliness                          20  and the naiadlike lily of the vale whom youth makes so fair and passion so pale that the light of its tremulous bells is seen through their pavilions of tender green  and the hyacinth purple and white and blue                        25 which flung from its bells a sweet peal anew of music so delicate soft and intense it was felt like an odour within the sense  and the rose like a nymph to the bath addressed which unveiled the depth of her glowing breast                      30 till fold after fold to the fainting air the soul of her beauty and love lay bare  and the wandlike lily which lifted up as a maenad its moonlightcoloured cup till the fiery star which is its eye gazed through clear dew on the tender sky                           35  and the jessamine faint and the sweet tuberose the sweetest flower for scent that blows and all rare blossoms from every clime grew in that garden in perfect prime                                40  and on the stream whose inconstant bosom was pranked under boughs of embowering blossom with golden and green light slanting through their heaven of many a tangled hue  broad waterlilies lay tremulously                                  45 and starry riverbuds glimmered by and around them the soft stream did glide and dance with a motion of sweet sound and radiance  and the sinuous paths of lawn and of moss which led through the garden along and across                       50 some open at once to the sun and the breeze some lost among bowers of blossoming trees  were all paved with daisies and delicate bells as fair as the fabulous asphodels and flowrets which drooping as day drooped too                    55 fell into pavilions white purple and blue to roof the glowworm from the evening dew  and from this undefiled paradise the flowers as an infants awakening eyes smile on its mother whose singing sweet                             60 can first lull and at last must awaken it  when heavens blithe winds had unfolded them as minelamps enkindle a hidden gem shone smiling to heaven and every one                               65 shared joy in the light of the gentle sun  for each one was interpenetrated with the light and the odour its neighbour shed like young lovers whom youth and love make dear wrapped and filled by their mutual atmosphere  but the sensitive plant which could give small fruit                 70 of the love which it felt from the leaf to the root received more than all it loved more than ever where none wanted but it could belong to the giver  for the sensitive plant has no bright flower radiance and odour are not its dower                                75 it loves even like love its deep heart is full it desires what it has not the beautiful  the light winds which from unsustaining wings shed the music of many murmurings the beams which dart from many a star                                80 of the flowers whose hues they bear afar  the plumed insects swift and free like golden boats on a sunny sea laden with light and odour which pass over the gleam of the living grass                                  85  the unseen clouds of the dew which lie like fire in the flowers till the sun rides high then wander like spirits among the spheres each cloud faint with the fragrance it bears  the quivering vapours of dim noontide                               90 which like a sea oer the warm earth glide in which every sound and odour and beam move as reeds in a single stream  each and all like ministering angels were for the sensitive plant sweet joy to bear                           95 whilst the lagging hours of the day went by like windless clouds oer a tender sky  and when evening descended from heaven above and the earth was all rest and the air was all love and delight though less bright was far more deep                  100 and the days veil fell from the world of sleep  and the beasts and the birds and the insects were drowned in an ocean of dreams without a sound whose waves never mark though they ever impress the light sand which paves it consciousness                        105  only overhead the sweet nightingale ever sang more sweet as the day might fail and snatches of its elysian chant were mixed with the dreams of the sensitive plant  the sensitive plant was the earliest                                 110 upgathered into the bosom of rest a sweet child weary of its delight the feeblest and yet the favourite cradled within the embrace of night  notes 6 like the spirit of love felt 1820    and the spirit of love felt 1839

lovely mind which dilating had moulded her mien and motion like a seaflower unfolded beneath the ocean  tended the garden from morn to even and the meteors of that sublunar heaven                             10 like the lamps of the air when night walks forth laughed round her footsteps up from the earth  she had no companion of mortal race but her tremulous breath and her flushing face told whilst the morn kissed the sleep from her eyes                15 that her dreams were less slumber than paradise  as if some bright spirit for her sweet sake had deserted heaven while the stars were awake as if yet around her he lingering were though the veil of daylight concealed him from her                  20  her step seemed to pity the grass it pressed you might hear by the heaving of her breast that the coming and going of the wind brought pleasure there and left passion behind  and wherever her aery footstep trod                                 25 her trailing hair from the grassy sod erased its light vestige with shadowy sweep like a sunny storm oer the dark green deep  i doubt not the flowers of that garden sweet rejoiced in the sound of her gentle feet                            30 i doubt not they felt the spirit that came from her glowing fingers through all their frame  she sprinkled bright water from the stream on those that were faint with the sunny beam and out of the

flowers had been her own infants she could never have nursed them more tenderly                          40  and all killing insects and gnawing worms and things of obscene and unlovely forms she bore

fair like stars when the moon is awakened were or the waves of baiae ere luminous she floats up through the smoke of vesuvius  and on the fourth the sensitive plant                               5 felt the sound of the funeral chant and the steps of the bearers heavy and slow and the sobs of the mourners deep and low  the weary sound and the heavy breath and the silent motions of passing death                             10 and the smell cold oppressive and dank sent through the pores of the coffinplank  the dark grass and the flowers among the grass were bright with tears as the crowd did pass from their sighs the wind caught a mournful tone                    15 and sate in the pines and gave groan for groan  the garden once fair became cold and foul like the corpse of her who had been its soul which at first was lovely as if in sleep then slowly changed till it grew a heap                             20 to make men tremble who never weep  swift summer into the autumn flowed and frost in the mist of the morning rode though the noonday sun looked clear and bright mocking the spoil of the secret night                               25  the roseleaves like flakes of crimson snow paved the turf and the moss below the lilies were drooping and white and wan like the head and the skin of a dying man  and indian plants of scent and hue                                  30 the sweetest that ever were fed on dew leaf by leaf day after day were massed into the common clay  and the leaves brown yellow and gray and red and white with the whiteness of what is dead                        35 like troops of ghosts on the dry wind passed their whistling noise made the birds aghast  and the gusty winds waked the winged seeds out of their birthplace of ugly weeds till they clung round many a sweet flowers stem                    40 which rotted into the earth with them  the waterblooms under the rivulet fell from the stalks on which they were set and the eddies drove them here and there as the winds did those of the upper air                             45  then the rain came down and the broken stalks were bent and tangled across the walks and the leafless network of parasite bowers massed into ruin and all sweet flowers  between the time of the wind and the snow                            50 all loathliest weeds began to grow whose coarse leaves were splashed with many a speck like the watersnakes belly and the toads back  and thistles and nettles and darnels rank and the dock and henbane and hemlock dank                         55 stretched out its long and hollow shank and stifled the air till the dead wind stank  and plants at whose names the verse feels loath filled the place with a monstrous undergrowth prickly and pulpous and blistering and blue                      60 livid and starred with a lurid dew  and agarics and fungi with mildew and mould started like mist from the wet ground cold pale fleshy as if the decaying dead with a spirit of growth had been animated                           65  spawn weeds and filth a leprous scum made the running rivulet thick and dumb and at its outlet flags huge as stakes dammed it up with roots knotted like watersnakes  and hour by hour when the air was still                            70 the vapours arose which have strength to kill at morn they were seen at noon they were felt at night they were darkness no star could melt  and unctuous meteors from spray to spray crept and flitted in broad noonday                                   75 unseen every branch on which they alit by a venomous blight was burned and bit  the sensitive plant like one forbid wept and the tears within each lid of its folded leaves which together grew                           80 were changed to a blight of frozen glue  for the leaves soon fell and the branches soon by the heavy axe of the blast were hewn the sap shrank to the root through every pore as blood to a heart that will beat no more                          85  for winter came the wind was his whip one choppy finger was on his lip he had torn the cataracts from the hills and they clanked at his girdle like manacles  his breath was a chain which without a sound                         90 the earth and the air and the water bound he came fiercely driven in his chariotthrone by the tenfold blasts of the arctic zone  then the weeds which were forms of living death fled from the frost to the earth beneath                            95 their decay and sudden flight from frost was but like the vanishing of a ghost  and under the roots of the sensitive plant the moles and the dormice died for want the birds dropped stiff from the frozen air                          100 and were caught in the branches naked and bare  first there came down a thawing rain and its dull drops froze on the boughs again then there steamed up a freezing dew which to the drops of the thawrain grew                            105  and a northern whirlwind wandering about like a wolf that had smelt a dead child out shook the boughs thus laden and heavy and stiff and snapped them off with his rigid griff  when winter had gone and spring came back                            110 the sensitive plant was a leafless wreck but the mandrakes and toadstools and docks and darnels rose like the dead from their ruined charnels  conclusion  whether the sensitive plant or that which within its boughs like a spirit sat                           115 ere its outward form had known decay now felt this change i cannot say  whether that ladys gentle mind no longer with the form combined which scattered love as stars do light                             120 found sadness where it left delight  i dare not guess but in this life of error ignorance and strife where nothing is but all things seem and we the shadows of the dream                                     125  it is a modest creed and yet pleasant if one considers it to own that death itself must be like all the rest a mockery  that garden sweet that lady fair                                   130 and all sweet shapes and odours there in truth have never passed away tis we tis ours

like the dead in a breach round the foremast are those twin tigers who burst when the waters arose                       40 in the agony of terror their chains in the hold what now makes them tame is what then made them bold who crouch side by side and have driven like a crank the deep grip of their claws through the vibrating plank are these all nine weeks the tall vessel had lain                   45 on the windless expanse of the watery plain where the deathdarting sun cast no shadow at noon and there seemed to be fire in the beams of the moon till a leadcoloured fog gathered up from the deep whose breath was quick pestilence then the cold sleep              50 crept like blight through the ears of a thick field of corn oer the populous vessel and even and morn with their hammocks for coffins the seamen aghast like dead men the dead limbs of their comrades cast down the deep which closed on them above and around                55 and the sharks and the dogfish their graveclothes unbound and were glutted like jews with this manna rained down from god on their wilderness one after one the mariners died on the eve of this day when the tempest was gathering in cloudy array

sun transversely dividing the stream of the storm as an arrowy serpent pursuing the form of an elephant bursts through the brakes of the waste black as a cormorant the screaming blast                            105 between ocean and heaven like an ocean passed till it came to the clouds on the verge of the world which based on the sea and to heaven upcurled like columns and walls did surround and sustain the dome of the tempest it rent them in twain                      110 as a flood rends its barriers of mountainous crag and the dense clouds in many a ruin and rag like the stones of a temple ere earthquake has passed like the dust of its fall on the whirlwind are cast they are scattered like foam on the torrent and where               115 the wind has burst out through the chasm from the air of clear morning the beams of the sunrise flow in unimpeded keen golden and crystalline banded armies of light and of air at one gate they encounter but interpenetrate                                  120 and that breach in the tempest is widening away and the caverns of cloud are torn up by the day and the fierce winds are sinking with weary wings lulled by the motion and murmurings and the long glassy heave of the rocking sea                        125 and overhead glorious but dreadful to see the wrecks of the tempest like vapours of gold are consuming in sunrise the heaped waves

solid bones crushed by the infinite stress                        140 of the snakes adamantine voluminousness and the hum of the hot blood that spouts and rains where the gripe of the tiger has wounded the veins swollen with rage strength and effort the whirl and the splash as of some hideous engine whose brazen teeth smash                   145 the thin winds and soft waves into thunder the screams and hissings crawl fast oer the smooth oceanstreams each sound like a centipede near this commotion a blue shark is hanging within the blue ocean the finwinged tomb of the victor the other

from which there eddies up a pale mist like aereal gossamer                                   20 whose breath destroys all lifeawhile it veils the rockthen scattered by the wind it flies along the stream or lingers on the clefts killing the sleepy worms if aught bide there upon the beetling edge of that dark rock                             25 there stands a group of cypresses not such as with a graceful spire and stirring life pierce the pure heaven of your native vale whose branches the air plays among but not disturbs fearing to spoil their solemn grace                       30 but blasted and all wearily they stand one to another clinging their weak boughs sigh as the wind buffets them and they shake beneath its blastsa weatherbeaten crew  chorus what wondrous sound is that mournful and faint                     35 but more melodious than the murmuring wind which through the columns of a temple glides  a it is the wandering voice of orpheus lyre borne by the winds who sigh that their rude king hurries them fast from these airfeeding notes                      40 but in their speed they bear along with them the waning sound scattering it like dew upon the startled sense  chorus does he still sing methought he rashly cast away his harp when he had lost eurydice  a ah no                                                              45 awhile he paused as a poor

        50 by the sharp fangs of an insatiate grief maenadlike waved his lyre in the bright air and wildly shrieked where she is it is dark and then he struck from forth the strings a sound of deep and fearful melody alas                                    55 in times long past when fair eurydice with her bright eyes sat listening by his side he gently sang of high and heavenly themes as in a brook fretted with little waves by the light airs of springeach riplet makes                       60 a manysided mirror for the sun while it flows musically through green banks ceaseless and pauseless ever clear and fresh so flowed his song reflecting the deep joy and tender love that fed those sweetest notes                       65 the heavenly offspring of ambrosial food but that is past returning from drear hell he chose a lonely seat of unhewn stone blackened with lichens on a herbless plain then from the deep and overflowing spring                            70 of his eternal evermoving grief there rose to heaven a sound of angry song tis as a mighty cataract that parts two sister rocks with waters swift and strong                       75 and casts itself with horrid roar and din adown a steep from a perennial source it ever flows and falls and breaks the air with loud and fierce but most harmonious roar and as it falls casts up a vaporous spray which the sun clothes in hues of iris light                         80 thus the tempestuous torrent of his grief is clothed in sweetest sounds and varying words of poesy unlike all human works it never slackens and through every change wisdom and beauty and the power divine                               85 of mighty poesy together dwell mingling in sweet accord as i have seen a fierce south blast tear through the darkened sky driving along a rack of winged clouds which may not pause but ever hurry on                              90 as their wild shepherd wills them while the stars twinkling and dim peep from between the plumes anon the sky is cleared and the high dome of serene heaven starred with fiery flowers shuts in the shaken earth or the still moon                         95 swiftly yet gracefully

shelley passed several hours daily in the gallery and made various notes on its ancient works of art his thoughts were a good deal taken up also by the project of a steamboat undertaken by a friend an engineer to ply between leghorn and marseilles for which he supplied a sum of money this was a sort of plan to delight shelley and he was greatly disappointed when it was thrown aside  there was something in florence that disagreed excessively with his health and he suffered far more pain than usual so much so that we left it sooner than we intended and removed to pisa where we had some friends and above all where we could consult the celebrated vacca as to the cause of shelleys sufferings he like every other medical man could only guess at that and gave little hope of immediate relief he enjoined him to abstain from all physicians and medicine and to leave his complaint to nature as he had vainly consulted medical men of the highest repute in england he was easily persuaded to adopt this advice pain and illhealth followed him to the end but the residence at pisa agreed with him better than any other and there in consequence we remained  in the spring we spent a week or two near leghorn borrowing the house of some friends who were absent on a journey to england it was on a beautiful summer evening while wandering among the lanes whose myrtlehedges were the bowers of the fireflies that we heard the carolling of the skylark which inspired one of the most beautiful of his poems he addressed the letter to mrs gisborne from this house which was hers he had made his study of the workshop of her son who was an engineer mrs gisborne had been a friend of my father in her younger days she was a lady of great accomplishments and charming from her frank and affectionate nature she had the most intense love of knowledge a delicate and trembling sensibility and preserved freshness of mind after a life of considerable adversity as a favourite friend of my father we had sought her with eagerness and the most open and cordial friendship was established between us  our stay at the baths of san giuliano was shortened by an accident at the foot of our garden ran the canal that communicated between the serchio and the arno the serchio overflowed its banks and breaking its bounds this canal also overflowed all this part of the country is below the level of its rivers and the consequence was that it was speedily flooded the rising waters filled the square of the baths in the lower part of which our house was situated the canal overflowed in the garden behind the rising waters on either side at last burst open the doors and meeting in the house rose to the height of six feet it was a picturesque sight at night to see the peasants driving the cattle from the plains below to the hills above the baths a fire was kept up to guide them across the ford and the forms of the men and the animals showed in dark relief against the red glare of the flame which was reflected again in the waters that filled the square  we then removed to pisa and took up our abode there for the winter the extreme mildness of the climate suited shelley and his solitude was enlivened by an intercourse with several intimate friends chance cast us strangely enough on this quiet halfunpeopled town but its very peace suited shelley its river the near mountains and not distant sea added to its attractions and were the objects of many delightful excursions we feared the south of italy and a hotter climate on account of our child our former bereavement inspiring us with terror we seemed to take root here and moved little afterwards often indeed entertaining projects for visiting other parts of italy but still delaying but for our fears on account of our child i believe we should have wandered over the world both being passionately fond of travelling but human life besides its great unalterable necessities is ruled by a thousand lilliputian ties

the company and then gherardi entered with an eye of ostentatious trouble and a crowd surrounded him and some were weeping loud  they found ginevra dead if it be death                              145 to lie without motion or pulse or breath with waxen cheeks and limbs cold stiff and white and open eyes whose fixed and glassy light mocked at the speculation they had owned if it be death when there is felt around                            150 a smell of clay a pale and icy glare and silence and a sense that lifts the hair from the scalp to the ankles as it were corruption from the spirit passing forth and giving all it shrouded to the earth                             155 and leaving as swift lightning in its flight ashes and smoke and darkness in our night of thought we know thus

year draws near that which sealed our earthly fate and each poem and each event it records has a real or mysterious connection with the fatal catastrophe i feel that i am incapable of putting on paper the history of those times the heart of the man abhorred of the poet who could      peep and botanize     upon his mothers grave  does not appear to me more inexplicably framed than that of one who can dissect and probe past woes and repeat to the public ear the groans drawn from them in the throes of their agony  the year 1821 was spent in pisa or at the baths of san giuliano we were not as our wont had been alone friends had gathered round us nearly all are dead and when memory recurs to the past she wanders among tombs the genius with all his blighting errors and mighty powers the companion of shelleys oceanwanderings and the sharer of his fate than whom no man ever existed more gentle generous and fearless and others who found in shelleys society and in his great knowledge and warm sympathy delight instruction and solace have joined him beyond the grave a few survive who have felt life a desert since he left it what misfortune can equal death change can convert every other into a blessing or heal its stingdeath alone has no cure it shakes the foundations of the earth on which we tread it destroys its beauty it casts down our shelter it exposes us bare to desolation when those we love have passed into eternity life is the desert and the solitude in which we are forced to lingerbut never find comfort more  there is much in the adonais which seems now more applicable to shelley himself than to the young and gifted poet whom he mourned the poetic view he takes of death and the lofty scorn he displays towards his calumniators are as a prophecy on his own destiny when received among immortal names and the poisonous breath of critics has vanished into emptiness before the fame he inherits  shelleys favourite taste was boating when living near the thames or by the lake of geneva much of his life was spent on the water on the shore of every lake or stream or sea near which he dwelt he had a boat moored he had latterly enjoyed this pleasure again there are no pleasureboats on the arno and the shallowness of its waters except in wintertime when the stream is too turbid and impetuous for boating rendered it difficult to get any skiff light enough to float shelley however overcame the difficulty he together with a friend contrived a boat such as the huntsmen carry about with them in the maremma to cross the sluggish but deep streams that intersect the forestsa boat of laths and pitched canvas it held three persons and he was often seen on the arno in it to the horror of the italians who remonstrated on the danger and could not understand how anyone could take pleasure in an exercise that risked life ma va per la vita they exclaimed i little thought how true their words would prove he once ventured with a friend on the glassy sea of a calm day down the arno and round the coast to leghorn which by keeping close in shore was very practicable they returned to pisa by the canal when missing the direct cut they got entangled among weeds and the boat upset a wetting was all the harm done except that the intense cold of his drenched clothes made shelley faint once i went down with him to the mouth of the arno where the stream then high and swift met the tideless sea and disturbed its sluggish waters it was a waste and dreary scene the desert sand stretched into a point surrounded by waves that broke idly though perpetually around it was a scene very similar to lido of which he had said      i love all waste     and solitary places where we taste     the pleasure of believing what we see     is boundless as we wish our souls to be     and such was this wide ocean and this shore     more barren than its billows  our little boat was of greater use unaccompanied by any danger when we removed to the baths some friends lived at the village of pugnano four miles off and we went to and fro to see them in our boat by the canal which fed by the serchio was though an artificial a full and picturesque stream making its way under verdant banks sheltered by trees that dipped their boughs into the murmuring waters by day multitudes of ephemera darted to and fro on the surface at night the fireflies came out among the shrubs on the banks the cicale at noonday kept up their hum the aziola cooed in the quiet evening it was a pleasant summer bright in all but shelleys health and inconstant spirits yet he enjoyed himself greatly and became more and more attached to the part of the country were chance appeared to cast us sometimes he projected taking a farm situated on the height of one of the near hills surrounded by chestnut and pine woods and overlooking a wide extent of country or settling still farther in the maritime apennines at massa several of his slighter and unfinished poems were inspired by these scenes and by the companions around us it is the nature of that poetry however which overflows from the soul oftener to express sorrow and regret than joy for it is when oppressed by the weight of life and away from those he loves that the poet has recourse to the solace of expression in verse  still shelleys passion was the ocean and he wished that our summers instead of being passed among the hills near pisa should be spent on the shores of the sea it was very difficult to find a spot we shrank from naples from a fear that the heats would disagree with percy leghorn had lost its only attraction since our friends who had resided there were returned to england and monte nero being the resort of many english we did not wish to find ourselves in the midst of a colony of chance travellers no one then thought it possible to reside at via reggio which latterly has become a summer resort the low lands and bad air of maremma stretch the whole length of the western shores of the mediterranean till broken by the rocks and hills of spezia it was a vague idea but shelley suggested an excursion to spezia to see whether it would be feasible to spend a summer there the beauty of the bay enchanted him we saw no house to suit us but the notion took root and many circumstances enchained as by fatality occurred to urge him to execute it  he looked forward this autumn with great pleasure to the prospect of a visit from leigh hunt when shelley visited lord byron at ravenna the latter had suggested his coming out together with the plan of a periodical work in which they should all join shelley saw a prospect of good for the fortunes of his friend and pleasure in his society and instantly exerted himself to have the plan executed he did not intend himself joining in the work partly from pride not wishing to have the air of acquiring readers for his poetry by associating it with the compositions of more popular writers and also because he might feel shackled in the free expression of his opinions if any friends were to be compromised by those opinions carried even to their outermost extent he wished to live and die as being in his conviction not only true but such as alone would conduce to the moral improvement and happiness of mankind the sale of the work might meanwhile either really or supposedly be injured by the free expression of his thoughts and this evil he resolved to avoid     poems written in 1822   the zucca  published by mrs shelley posthumous poems 1824 and dated january 1822 there is a copy amongst the boscombe manuscripts  1 summer was dead and autumn was expiring and infant winter laughed upon the land all cloudlessly and coldwhen i desiring more in this world than any understand wept oer the beauty which like sea retiring                      5 had left the earth bare as the waveworn sand of my lorn heart and oer the grass and flowers pale for the falsehood of the flattering hours  2 summer was dead but i yet lived to weep the instability of all but weeping                                  10 and on the earth lulled in her winter sleep i woke and envied her as she was sleeping too happy earth over thy face shall creep the wakening vernal airs until thou leaping from unremembered dreams shalt  see                              15 no death divide thy immortality  3 i lovedoh no i mean not one of ye or any earthly one though ye are dear as human heart to human heart may be i loved i know not whatbut this low sphere                        20 and all that it contains contains not thee thou whom seen nowhere i feel everywhere from heaven and earth and all that in them are veiled art thou like a  star  4 by heaven and earth from all whose shapes thou flowest             25 neither to be contained delayed nor hidden making divine the loftiest and the lowest when for a moment thou art not forbidden to live within the life which thou bestowest and leaving noblest things vacant and chidden                       30 cold as a corpse after the spirits flight blank as the sun after the birth of night  5 in winds and trees and streams and all things common in music and the sweet unconscious tone of animals and voices which are human

most adore thee present or lament thee lost                              40  6 and thus i went lamenting when i saw a plant upon the rivers margin lie like one who loved beyond his natures law and in despair had cast him down to die its leaves which had outlived the frost the thaw                   45 had blighted like a heart which hatreds eye can blast not but which pity kills the dew lay on its spotted leaves like tears too true  7 the heavens had wept upon it but the earth had crushed it on her maternal breast                                50    8 i bore it to my chamber and i planted it in a vase full of the lightest mould the winter beams which out of heaven slanted fell through the windowpanes disrobed of cold upon its leaves and flowers the stars which panted                  55 in evening for the day whose car has rolled over the horizons wave with looks of light smiled on it from the threshold of the night  9 the mitigated influences of air and light revived the plant and from it grew                        60 strong leaves and tendrils and its flowers fair full as a cup with the vines burning dew oerflowed with golden colours an atmosphere of vital warmth enfolded it anew and every impulse sent to every part the unbeheld pulsations of its heart                                65  10 well might the plant grow beautiful and strong even if the air and sun had smiled not on it for one wept oer it all the winter long tears pure as heavens rain which fell upon it                      70 hour after hour for sounds of softest song mixed with the stringed melodies that won it to leave the gentle lips on which it slept had loosed the heart of him who sat and wept  11 had loosed his heart and shook the leaves and flowers               75 on which he wept the while the savage storm waked by the darkest of decembers hours was raving round the chamber hushed and warm the birds were shivering in their leafless bowers the fish were frozen in the pools the form

                     80  we stood beneath the pools that lie under the forest bough and each seemed like a sky gulfed in a world below  a purple firmament of light                                          85 which in the dark earth lay more boundless than the depth of night and clearer than the day  in which the massy forests grew as in the upper air                                                 90 more perfect both in shape and hue than any waving there  like one beloved the scene had lent to the dark waters breast its every leaf and lineament                                         95 with that clear truth expressed  there lay far glades and neighbouring lawn and through the dark green crowd the white sun twinkling like the dawn under a speckled cloud                                              100  sweet views which in our world above can never well be seen were imaged by the waters love of that fair forest green  and all was interfused beneath                                       105 with an elysian air an atmosphere without a breath a silence sleeping there  until a wandering wind crept by like an unwelcome thought                                           110 which from my minds too faithful eye blots thy bright image out  for thou art good and dear and kind the forest ever green but less of peace in ss mind than calm in waters seen

these notes end they are not what i intended them to be i began with energy and a burning desire to impart to the world in worthy language the sense i have of the virtues and genius of the beloved and the lost my strength has failed under the task recurrence to the past full of its own deep and unforgotten joys and sorrows contrasted with succeeding years of painful and solitary struggle has shaken my health days of great suffering have followed my attempts to write and these again produced a weakness and languor that spread their sinister influence over these notes i dislike speaking of myself but cannot help apologizing to the dead and to the public for not having executed in the manner i desired the history i engaged to give of shelleys writings i at one time feared that the correction of the press might be less exact through my illness but i believe that it is nearly free from error some asterisks occur in a few pages as they did in the volume of posthumous poems either because they refer to private concerns or because the original manuscript was left imperfect did any one see the papers from which i drew that volume the wonder would be how any eyes or patience were capable of extracting it from so confused a mass interlined and broken into fragments so that the sense could only be deciphered and joined by guesses which might seem rather intuitive than founded on reasoning yet i believe no mistake was made  the winter of 1822 was passed in pisa if we might call that season winter in which autumn merged into spring after the interval of but few days of bleaker weather spring sprang up early and with extreme beauty shelley had conceived the idea of writing a tragedy on the subject of charles i it was one that he believed adapted for a drama full of intense interest contrasted character and busy passion he had recommended it long before when he encouraged me to attempt a play whether the subject proved more difficult than he anticipated or whether in fact he could not bend his mind away from the broodings and wanderings of thought divested from human interest which he best loved i cannot tell but he proceeded slowly and threw it aside for one of the most mystical of his poems the triumph of life on which he was employed at the last  his passion for boating was fostered at this time by having among our friends several sailors his favourite companion edward ellerker williams of the 8th light dragoons had begun his life in the navy and had afterwards entered the army he had spent several years in india and his love for adventure and manly exercises accorded with shelleys taste it was their favourite plan to build a boat such as they could manage themselves and living on the seacoast to enjoy at every hour and season the pleasure they loved best captain roberts rn undertook to build the boat at genoa where he was also occupied in building the bolivar for lord byron ours was to be an open boat on a model taken from one of the royal dockyards i have since heard that there was a defect in this model and that it was never seaworthy in the month of february shelley and his friend went to spezia to seek for houses for us only one was to be found at all suitable however a trifle such as not finding a house could not stop shelley the one found was to serve for all it was unfurnished we sent our furniture by sea and with a good deal of precipitation arising from his impatience made our removal we left pisa on the 26th of april  the bay of spezia is of considerable extent and divided by a rocky promontory into a larger and smaller one the town of lerici is situated on the eastern point and in the depth of the smaller bay which bears the name of this town is the village of san terenzo our house casa magni was close to this village the sea came up to the door a steep hill sheltered it behind the proprietor of the estate on which it was situated was insane he had begun to erect a large house at the summit of the hill behind but his malady prevented its being finished and it was falling into ruin he had and this to the italians had seemed a glaring symptom of very decided madness rooted up the olives on the hillside and planted forest trees these were mostly young but the plantation was more in english taste than i ever elsewhere saw in italy some fine walnut and ilex trees intermingled their dark massy foliage and formed groups which still haunt my memory as then they satiated the eye with a sense of loveliness the scene was indeed of unimaginable beauty the blue extent of waters the almost landlocked bay the near castle of lerici shutting it in to the east and distant porto venere to the west the varied forms of the precipitous rocks that bound in the beach over which there was only a winding rugged footpath towards lerici and none on the other side the tideless sea leaving no sands nor shingle formed a picture such as one sees in salvator rosas landscapes only sometimes the sunshine vanished when the sirocco ragedthe ponente the wind was called on that shore the gales and squalls that hailed our first arrival surrounded the bay with foam the howling wind swept round our exposed house and the sea roared unremittingly so that we almost fancied ourselves on board ship at other times sunshine and calm invested sea and sky and the rich tints of italian heaven bathed the scene in bright and evervarying tints  the natives were wilder than the place our near neighbours of san terenzo were more like savages than any people i ever before lived among many a night they passed on the beach singing or rather howling the women dancing about among the waves that broke at their feet the men leaning against the rocks and joining in their loud wild chorus we could get no provisions nearer than sarzana at a distance of three miles and a half off with the torrent of the magra between and even there the supply was very deficient had we been wrecked on an island of the south seas we could scarcely have felt ourselves farther from civilisation and comfort but where the sun shines the latter becomes an unnecessary luxury and we had enough society among ourselves yet i confess housekeeping became rather a toilsome task especially as i was suffering in my health and could not exert myself actively  at first the fatal boat had not arrived and was expected with great impatience on monday 12th may it came williams records the longwishedfor fact in his journal cloudy and threatening weather m maglian called and after dinner and while walking with him on the terrace we discovered a strange sail coming round the point of porto venere which proved at length to be shelleys boat she had left genoa on thursday last but had been driven back by the prevailing bad winds a mr heslop and two english seamen brought her round and they speak most highly of her performances she does indeed excite my surprise and admiration shelley and i walked to lerici and made a stretch off the land to try her and i find she fetches whatever she looks at in short we have now a perfect plaything for the summerit was thus that shortsighted mortals welcomed death he having disguised his grim form in a pleasing mask the time of the friends was now spent on the sea the weather became fine and our whole party often passed the evenings on the water when the wind promised pleasant sailing shelley and williams made longer excursions they sailed several times to massa they had engaged one of the seamen who brought her round a boy by name charles vivian and they had not the slightest apprehension of danger when the weather was unfavourable they employed themselves with alterations in the rigging and by building a boat of canvas and reeds as light as possible to have on board the other for the convenience of landing in waters too shallow for the larger vessel when shelley was on board he had his papers with him and much of the triumph of life was written as he sailed or weltered on that sea which was soon to engulf him  the heats set in in the middle of june the days became excessively hot but the seabreeze cooled the air at noon and extreme heat always put shelley in spirits a long drought had preceded the heat and prayers for rain were being put up in the churches and processions of relics for the same effect took place in every town at this time we received letters announcing the arrival of leigh hunt at genoa shelley was very eager to see him i was confined to my room by severe illness and could not move it was agreed that shelley and williams should go to leghorn in the boat strange that no fear of danger crossed our minds living on the seashore the ocean became as a plaything as a child may sport with a lighted stick till a spark inflames a forest and spreads destruction over all so did we fearlessly and blindly tamper with danger and make a game of the terrors of the ocean our italian neighbours even trusted themselves as far as massa in the skiff and the running down the line of coast to leghorn gave no more notion of peril than a fairweather inland navigation would have done to those who had never seen the sea once some months before trelawny had raised a warning voice as to the difference of our calm bay and the open sea beyond but shelley and his friend with their one sailorboy thought themselves a match for the storms of the mediterranean in a boat which they looked upon as equal to all it was put to do  on the 1st of july they left us if ever shadow of future ill darkened the present hour such was over my mind when they went during the whole of our stay at lerici an intense presentiment of coming evil brooded over my mind and covered this beautiful place and genial summer with the shadow of coming misery i had vainly struggled with these emotionsthey seemed accounted for by my illness but at this hour of separation they recurred with renewed violence i did not anticipate danger for them but a vague expectation of evil shook me to agony and i could scarcely bring myself to let them go the day was calm and clear and a fine breeze rising at twelve they weighed for leghorn they made the run of about fifty miles in seven hours and a half the bolivar was in port and the regulations of the healthoffice not permitting them to go on shore after sunset they borrowed cushions from the larger vessel and slept on board their boat  they spent a week at pisa and leghorn the want of rain was severely felt in the country the weather continued sultry and fine i have heard that shelley all this time was in brilliant spirits not long before talking of presentiment he had said the only one that he ever found infallible was the certain advent of some evil fortune when he felt peculiarly joyous yet if ever fate whispered of coming disaster such inaudible but not unfelt prognostics hovered around us the beauty of the place seemed unearthly in its excess the distance we were at from all signs of civilization the sea at our feet its murmurs or its roaring for ever in our earsall these things led the mind to brood over strange thoughts and lifting it from everyday life caused it to be familiar with the unreal a sort of spell surrounded us and each day as the voyagers did not return we grew restless and disquieted and yet strange to say we were not fearful of the most apparent danger  the spell snapped it was all over an interval of agonizing doubtof days passed in miserable journeys to gain tidings of hopes that took firmer root even as they were more baselesswas changed to the certainty of the death that eclipsed all happiness for the survivors for evermore  there was something in our fate peculiarly harrowing the remains of those we lost were cast on shore but by the quarantinelaws of the coast we were not permitted to have possession of themthe law with respect to everything cast on land by the sea being that such should be burned to prevent the possibility of any remnant bringing the plague into italy and no representation could alter the law at length through the kind and unwearied exertions of mr dawkins our charge daffaires at florence we gained permission to receive the ashes after the bodies were consumed nothing could equal the zeal of trelawny in carrying our wishes into effect he was indefatigable in his exertions and full of forethought and sagacity in his arrangements it was a fearful task he stood before us at last his hands scorched and blistered by the flames of the funeralpyre and by touching the burnt relics as he placed them in the receptacles prepared for the purpose and there in compass of that small case was gathered all that remained on earth of him whose genius and virtue were a crown of glory to the worldwhose love had been the source of happiness peace and goodto be buried with him  the concluding stanzas of the adonais pointed out where the remains ought to be deposited in addition to which our beloved child lay buried in the cemetery at rome thither shelleys ashes were conveyed and they rest beneath one of the antique weedgrown towers that recur at intervals in the circuit of the massy ancient wall of rome he selected the hallowed place himself there is      the sepulchre     oh not of him but of our joy          and gray walls moulder round on which dull time     feeds like slow fire upon a hoary brand     and one keen pyramid with wedge sublime     pavilioning the dust of him who planned     this refuge for his memory doth stand     like flame transformed to marble and beneath     a field is spread on which a newer band     have pitched in heavens smile their camp of death     welcoming him we lose with scarce extinguished breath  could sorrow for the lost and shuddering anguish at the vacancy left behind be soothed by poetic imaginations there was something in shelleys fate to mitigate pangs which yet alas could not be so mitigated for hard reality brings too miserably home to the mourner all that is lost of happiness all of lonely unsolaced struggle that remains still though dreams and hues of poetry cannot blunt grief it invests his fate with a sublime fitness which those less nearly allied may regard with complacency a year before he had poured into verse all such ideas about death as give it a glory of its own he had as it now seems almost anticipated his own destiny and when the mind figures his skiff wrapped from sight by the thunderstorm as it was last seen upon the purple sea and then as the cloud of the tempest passed away no sign remained of where it had been captain roberts watched the vessel with his glass from the top of the lighthouse of leghorn on its homeward track they were off via reggio at some distance from shore when a storm was driven over the sea it enveloped them and several larger vessels in darkness when the cloud passed onwards roberts looked again and saw every other vessel sailing on the ocean except their little schooner which had vanished from that time he could scarcely doubt the fatal truth yet we fancied that they might have been driven towards elba or corsica and so be saved the observation made as to the spot where the boat disappeared caused it to be found through the exertions of trelawny for that effect it had gone down in ten fathom water it had not capsized and except such things as had floated from her everything was found on board exactly as it had been placed when they sailed the boat itself was uninjured roberts possessed himself of her and decked her but she proved not seaworthy and her shattered planks now lie rotting on the shore of one of the ionian islands on which she was wreckedwho but will regard as a prophecy the last stanza of the adonais      the breath whose might i have invoked in song     descends on me

arcadia and all its pastoral hills whom in sweet love having been interwoven modest may bore heavens dread supreme an antique grove                        5 shadowed the cavern where the lovers lay in the deep night unseen by gods or men and whitearmed juno slumbered sweetly then  2 now when the joy of jove had its fulfilling and heavens tenth moon chronicled her relief                       10 she gave to light a babe all babes excelling a schemer subtle beyond all belief a shepherd of thin dreams a cowstealing a nightwatching and doorwaylaying thief who mongst the gods was soon about to thieve                       15 and other glorious actions to achieve  3 the babe was born at the first peep of day he began playing on the lyre at noon and the same evening did he steal away apollos herdsthe fourth day of the moon                          20 on which him bore the venerable may from her immortal limbs he leaped full soon nor long could in the sacred cradle keep but out to seek apollos herds would creep  4 out of the lofty cavern wandering                                    25 he found a tortoise and cried outa treasure for mercury first made the tortoise sing the beast before the portal at his leisure the flowery herbage was depasturing moving his feet in a deliberate measure                              30 over the turf joves profitable son eying him laughed and laughing thus begun  5 a useful godsend are you to me now king of the dance companion of the feast lovely in all your nature welcome you                              35 excellent plaything where sweet mountainbeast got you that speckled shell thus much i know you must come home with me and be my guest you will give joy to me and i will do all that is in my power to honour you                               40  6 better to be at home than out of door so come with me and though it has been said that you alive defend from magic power i know you will sing sweetly when youre dead thus having spoken the quaint infant bore                          45 lifting it from the grass on which it fed and grasping it in his delighted hold his treasured prize into the cavern old  7 then scooping with a chisel of gray steel he bored the life and soul out of the beast                       50 not swifter a swift thought of woe or weal darts through the tumult of a human breast which thronging cares annoynot swifter wheel the flashes of its torture and unrest out of the dizzy eyesthan maias son                               55 all that he did devise hath featly done  8  and through the tortoises hard stony skin at proper distances small holes he made and fastened the cut stems of reeds within and with a piece of leather overlaid                                 60 the open space and fixed the cubits in fitting the bridge to both and stretched oer all symphonious cords of sheepgut rhythmical  9 when he had wrought the lovely instrument he tried the chords and made division meet                         65 preluding with the plectrum and there went up from beneath his hand a tumult sweet of mighty sounds and from his lips he sent a strain of unpremeditated wit joyous and wild and wantonsuch you may                             70 hear among revellers on a holiday  10 he sung how jove and may of the bright sandal dallied in love not quite legitimate and his own birth still scoffing at the scandal and naming his own name did celebrate                              75 his mothers cave and servant maids he planned all in plastic verse her household stuff and state perennial pot trippet and brazen pan but singing he conceived another plan  11  seized with a sudden fancy for fresh meat                           80 he in his sacred crib deposited the hollow lyre and from the cavern sweet rushed with great leaps up to the mountains head revolving in his mind some subtle feat of thievish craft such as a swindler might                          85 devise in the lone season of dun night  12 lo the great sun under the oceans bed has driven steeds and chariotthe child meanwhile strode oer the pierian mountains clothed in shadows where the immortal oxen of the god                                   90 are pastured in the flowering unmown meadows and safely stalled in a remote abode the archer argicide elate and proud drove fifty from the herd lowing aloud  13 he drove them wandering oer the sandy way                          95 but being ever mindful of his craft backward and forward drove he them astray so that the tracks which seemed before were aft his sandals then he threw to the ocean spray and for each foot he wrought a kind of raft                          100 of tamarisk and tamarisklike sprigs and bound them in a lump with withy twigs  14 and on his feet he tied these sandals light the trail of whose wide leaves might not betray his track and then a selfsufficing wight                         105 like a man hastening on some distant way he from pierias mountain bent his flight but an old man perceived the infant pass down green onchestus heaped like beds with grass  15 the old man stood dressing his sunny vine                           110 halloo old fellow with the crooked shoulder you grub those stumps before they will bear wine methinks even you must grow a little older attend i pray to this advice of mine as you would scape what might appal a bolder                      115 seeing see notand hearing hear notand if you have understandingunderstand  16 so saying hermes roused the oxen vast oer shadowy mountain and resounding dell and flowerpaven plains great hermes passed                        120 till the black night divine which favouring fell around his steps grew gray and morning fast wakened the world to work and from her cell seastrewn the pallantean moon sublime into her watchtower just began to climb                            125  17 now to alpheus he had driven all the broadforeheaded oxen of the sun they came unwearied to the lofty stall and to the watertroughs which ever run through the fresh fieldsand when with rushgrass tall              130 lotus and all sweet herbage every one had pastured been the great god made them move towards the stall in a collected drove  18 a mighty pile of wood the god then heaped and having soon conceived the mystery                                135 of fire from two smooth laurel branches stripped the bark and rubbed them in his palmson high suddenly forth the burning vapour leaped and the divine child saw delightedly mercury first found out for human weal                               140 tinderbox matches fireirons flint and steel  19 and fine dry logs and roots innumerous he gathered in a delve upon the ground and kindled themand instantaneous the strength of the fierce flame was breathed around                145 and whilst the might of glorious vulcan thus wrapped the great pile with glare and roaring sound hermes dragged forth two heifers lowing loud close to the firesuch might was in the god  20 and on the earth upon their backs he threw                           150 the panting beasts and rolled them oer and oer and bored their lives out without more ado he cut up fat and flesh and down before the fire on spits of wood he placed the two toasting their flesh and ribs and all the gore                      155 pursed in the bowels and while this was done he stretched their hides over a craggy stone  21 we mortals let an ox grow old and then cut it up after long consideration but joyousminded hermes from the glen                               160 drew the fat spoils to the more open station of a flat smooth space and portioned them and when he had by lot assigned to each a ration of the twelve gods his mind became aware of all the joys which in religion are                               165  22 for the sweet savour of the roasted meat tempted him though immortal natheless he checked his haughty will and did not eat though what it cost him words can scarce express and every wish to put such morsels sweet                             170 down his most sacred throat he did repress but soon within the lofty portalled stall he placed the fat and flesh and bones and all  23 and every trace of the fresh butchery and cooking the god soon made disappear                            175 as if it all had vanished through the sky he burned the hoofs and horns and head and hair the insatiate fire devoured them hungrily and when he saw that everything was clear he quenched the coal and trampled the black dust                   180 and in the stream his bloody sandals tossed  24 all night he worked in the serene moonshine but when the light of day was spread abroad he sought his natal mountainpeaks divine on his long wandering neither man nor god                           185 had met him since he killed apollos kine nor housedog had barked at him on his road now he obliquely through the keyhole passed like a thin mist or an autumnal blast  25 right through the temple of the spacious cave                        190 he went with soft light feetas if his tread fell not on earth no sound their falling gave then to his cradle he crept quick and spread the swaddlingclothes about him and the knave lay playing with the covering of the bed                             195 with his left hand about his kneesthe right held his beloved tortoiselyre tight  26 there he lay innocent as a newborn child as gossips say but though he was a god the goddess his fair mother unbeguiled                            200 knew all that he had done being abroad whence come you and from what adventure wild you cunning rogue and where have you abode all the long night clothed in your impudence what have you done since you departed hence                         205  27 apollo soon will pass within this gate and bind your tender body in a chain inextricably tight and fast as fate unless you can delude the god again even when within his armsah runagate                             210 a pretty torment both for gods and men your father made when he made youdear mother replied sly hermes wherefore scold and bother  28 as if i were like other babes as old and understood nothing of what is what                              215 and cared at all to hear my mother scold i in my subtle brain a scheme have got which whilst the sacred stars round heaven are rolled will profit you and menor shall our lot be as you counsel without gifts or food                            220 to spend our lives in this obscure abode  29 but we will leave this shadowpeopled cave and live among the gods and pass each day in high communion sharing what they have of profuse wealth and unexhausted prey                              225 and from the portion which my father gave to phoebus i will snatch my share away which if my father will notnatheless i who am the king of robbers can but try  30 and if latonas son should find me out                            230 ill countermine him by a deeper plan ill pierce the pythian templewalls though stout and sack the fane of everything i can caldrons and tripods of great worth no doubt each golden cup and polished brazen pan                             235 all the wrought tapestries and garments gay so they together talkedmeanwhile the day  31 aethereal born arose out of the flood of flowing ocean bearing light to men apollo passed toward the sacred wood                                240 which from the inmost depths of its green glen echoes the voice of neptuneand there stood on the same spot in green onchestus then that same old animal the vinedresser who was employed hedging his vineyard there                         245  32 latonas glorious son begani pray tell ancient hedger of onchestus green whether a drove of kine has passed this way all heifers with crooked horns for they have been stolen from the herd in high pieria                                 250 where a black bull was fed apart between two woody mountains in a neighbouring glen and four fierce dogs watched there unanimous as men  33 and what is strange the author of this theft has stolen the fatted heifers every one                             255 but the four dogs and the black bull are left stolen they were last night at set of sun of their soft beds and their sweet food bereft now tell me man born ere the world begun have you seen any one pass with the cows                         260 to whom the man of overhanging brows  34 my friend it would require no common skill justly to speak of everything i see on various purposes of good or ill many pass by my vineyardand to me                                 265 tis difficult to know the invisible thoughts which in all those many minds may be thus much alone i certainly can say i tilled these vines till the decline of day  35 and then i thought i saw but dare not speak                        270 with certainty of such a wondrous thing a child who could not have been born a week those fairhorned cattle closely following and in his hand he held a polished stick and as on purpose he walked wavering                               275 from one side to the other of the road and with his face opposed the steps he trod  36 apollo hearing this passed quickly on no winged omen could have shown more clear that the deceiver was his fathers son                              280 so the god wraps a purple atmosphere around his shoulders and like fire is gone to famous pylos seeking his kine there and found their track and his yet hardly cold and criedwhat wonder do mine eyes behold                         285  37 here are the footsteps of the horned herd turned back towards their fields of asphodel but these are not the tracks of beast or bird gray wolf or bear or lion of the dell or maned centaursand was never stirred                             290 by man or woman thus inexplicable who with unwearied feet could eer impress the sand with such enormous vestiges  38 that was most strangebut this is stranger still thus having said phoebus impetuously                                295 sought high cyllenes forestcinctured hill and the deep cavern where dark shadows lie and where the ambrosial nymph with happy will bore the saturnians lovechild mercury and a delightful odour from the dew                                  300 of the hill pastures at his coming flew  39 and phoebus stooped under the craggy roof arched over the dark cavernmaias child perceived that he came angry far aloof about the cows of which he had been beguiled                        305 and over him the fine and fragrant woof of his ambrosial swaddlingclothes he piled as among firebrands lies a burning spark covered beneath the ashes cold and dark  40 there like an infant who had sucked his fill                        310 and now was newly washed and put to bed awake but courting sleep with weary will and gathered in a lump hands feet and head he lay and his beloved tortoise still he grasped and held under his shoulderblade                        315 phoebus the lovely mountaingoddess knew not less her subtle swindling baby who  41 lay swathed in his sly wiles round every crook of the ample cavern for his kine apollo looked sharp and when he saw them not he took                      320 the glittering key and opened three great hollow recesses in the rockwhere many a nook was filled with the sweet food immortals swallow and mighty heaps of silver and of gold were piled withina wonder to behold                               325  42 and white and silver robes all overwrought with cunning workmanship of tracery sweet except among the gods there can be nought in the wide world to be compared with it latonas offspring after having sought                              330 his herds in every corner thus did greet great hermeslittle cradled rogue declare of my illustrious heifers where they are  43 speak quickly or a quarrel between us must rise and the event will be that i                             335 shall hurl you into dismal tartarus in fiery gloom to dwell eternally nor shall your father nor your mother loose the bars of that black dungeonutterly you shall be cast out from the light of day                         340 to rule the ghosts of men unblessed as they  44 to whom thus hermes slily answeredson of great latona what a speech is this why come you here to ask me what is done with the wild oxen which it seems you miss                          345 i have not seen them nor from any one have heard a word of the whole business if you should promise an immense reward i could not tell more than you now have heard  45 an oxstealer should be both tall and strong                       350 and i am but a little newborn thing who yet at least can think of nothing wrong my business is to suck and sleep and fling the cradleclothes about me all day long or half asleep hear my sweet mother sing                           355 and to be washed in water clean and warm and hushed and kissed and kept secure from harm  46 o let not eer this quarrel be averred the astounded gods would laugh at you if eer you should allege a story so absurd                                  360 as that a newborn infant forth could fare out of his home after a savage herd i was born yesterdaymy small feet are too tender for the roads so hard and rough and if you think that this is not enough                            365  47 i swear a great oath by my fathers head that i stole not your cows and that i know of no one else who might or could or did whatever things cows are i do not know for i have only heard the namethis said                          370 he winked as fast as could be and his brow was wrinkled and a whistle loud gave he like one who hears some strange absurdity  48 apollo gently smiled and saiday ay you cunning little rascal you will bore                             375 many a rich mans house and your array of thieves will lay their siege before his door silent as night in night and many a day in the wild glens rough shepherds will deplore that you or yours having an appetite                               380 met with their cattle comrade of the night  49 and this among the gods shall be your gift to be considered as the lord of those who swindle housebreak sheepsteal and shoplift but now if you would not your last sleep doze                       385 crawl outthus saying phoebus did uplift the subtle infant in his swaddling clothes and in his arms according to his wont a scheme devised the illustrious argiphont  50   and sneezed and shudderedphoebus on the grass                      390 him threw and whilst all that he had designed he did performeager although to pass apollo darted from his mighty mind towards the subtle babe the following scoff do not imagine this will get you off                               395  51 you little swaddled child of jove and may and seized himby this omen i shall trace my noble herds and you shall lead the way cyllenian hermes from the grassy place like one in earnest haste to get away                               400 rose and with hands lifted towards his face round both his ears up from his shoulders drew his swaddling clothes andwhat mean you to do  52 with me you unkind godsaid mercury is it about these cows you tease me so                             405 i wish the race of cows were perishedi stole not your cowsi do not even know what things cows are alas i well may sigh that since i came into this world of woe i should have ever heard the name of one                           410 but i appeal to the saturnians throne  53 thus phoebus and the vagrant mercury talked without coming to an explanation with adverse purpose as for phoebus he sought not revenge but only information                            415 and hermes tried with lies and roguery to cheat apollobut when no evasion servedfor the cunning one his match had found he paced on first over the sandy ground  54  he of the silver bow the child of jove                               420 followed behind till to their heavenly sire came both his children beautiful as love and from his equal balance did require a judgement in the cause wherein they strove oer odorous olympus and its snows                                   425 a murmuring tumult as they came arose  55 and from the folded depths of the great hill while hermes and apollo reverent stood before joves throne the indestructible immortals rushed in mighty multitude                                430 and whilst their seats in order due they fill the lofty thunderer in a careless mood to phoebus saidwhence drive you this sweet prey this heraldbaby born but yesterday  56 a most important subject trifler this                             435 to lay before the godsnay father nay when you have understood the business say not that i alone am fond of prey i found this little boy in a recess under cyllenes mountains far away                                 440 a manifest and most apparent thief a scandalmonger beyond all belief  57 i never saw his like either in heaven or upon earth for

would make you daft to see the double kind of footsteps strange he has impressed wherever he did range                              450  58 the cattles track on the black dust full well is evident as if they went towards the place from which they camethat asphodel meadow in which i feed my many herds his steps were most incomprehensible                               455 i know not how i can describe in words those trackshe could have gone along the sands neither upon his feet nor on his hands  59 he must have had some other stranger mode of moving on those vestiges immense                                460 far as i traced them on the sandy road seemed like the trail of oaktoppingsbut thence no mark nor track denoting where they trod the hard ground gavebut working at his fence a mortal hedger saw him as he passed                                 465 to pylos with the cows in fiery haste  60 i found that in the dark he quietly had sacrificed some cows and before light had thrown the ashes all dispersedly about the roadthen still as gloomy night                         470 had crept into his cradle either eye rubbing and cogitating some new sleight no eagle could have seen him as he lay hid in his cavern from the peering day  61 i taxed him with the fact when he averred                          475 most solemnly that he did neither see nor even had in any manner heard of my lost cows whatever things cows be nor could he tell though offered a reward not even who could tell of them to me                              480 so speaking phoebus sate and hermes then addressed the supreme lord of gods and men  62 great father you know clearly beforehand that all which i shall say to you is sooth i am a most veracious person and                                    485 totally unacquainted with untruth at sunrise phoebus came but with no band of gods to bear him witness in great wrath to my abode seeking his heifers there and saying that i must show him where they are                      490  63 or he would hurl me down the dark abyss i know that every apollonian limb is clothed with speed and might and manliness as a green bank with flowersbut unlike him i was born yesterday and you may guess                              495 he well knew this when he indulged the whim of bullying a poor little newborn thing that slept and never thought of cowdriving  64 am i like a strong fellow who steals kine believe me dearest fathersuch you are                           500 this driving of the herds is none of mine across my threshold did i wander neer so may i thrive i reverence the divine sun and the gods and i love you and care even for this hard accuserwho must know                            505 i am as innocent as they or you  65 i swear by these most gloriouslywrought portals it is you will allow an oath of might through which the multitude of the immortals pass and repass forever day and night                              510 devising schemes for the affairs of mortals i am guiltless and i will requite although mine enemy be great and strong his cruel threatdo thou defend the young  66 so speaking the cyllenian argiphont                                 515 winked as if now his adversary was fitted and jupiter according to his wont laughed heartily to hear the subtlewitted infant give such a plausible account and every word a lie but he remitted                                520 judgement at presentand his exhortation was to compose the affair by arbitration  67 and they by mighty jupiter were bidden to go forth with a single

wide and lofty stalls by the alphean ford where wealth in the mute night is multiplied with silent growth whilst hermes drove the herd                     535 out of the stony cavern phoebus spied the hides of those the little babe had slain stretched on the precipice above the plain  69 how was it possible then phoebus said that you a little child born yesterday                           540 a

loosened by some device of his quick wit                            550 phoebus perceived himself again beguiled and staredwhile hermes sought some hole or pit looking askance and winking fast as thought where he might hide himself and not be caught  71 sudden he changed his plan and with strange skill                   555 subdued the strong latonian by the might of winning music to his mightier will his left hand held the lyre and in his right the plectrum struck the chordsunconquerable up from beneath his hand in circling flight                          560 the gathering music

your own doting ignorance you always take the two sides of one question now go and as i said return for me when night falls veiling in its shadows wide this glorious fabric of the universe

question which has long disturbed my mind with doubt since first i read in plinius the words of mystic import and deep sense in which he defines god my intellect can find no god with whom these marks and signs                      55 fitly agree it is a hidden truth which i must fathom  cyprian reads the daemon dressed in a court dress enters  note 57 stage direction so transcr reads enter the devil as a fine     gentleman 1824  daemon search even as thou wilt but thou shalt never find what i can hide  cyprian what noise is that among the boughs who moves what art thou  daemon tis a foreign gentleman                                            60 even from this morning i have lost my way in this wild place and my poor horse at last quite overcome has stretched himself upon the enamelled tapestry of this mossy mountain and feeds and rests at the same time i was                          65 upon my way to antioch upon business of some importance but wrapped up in cares who is exempt from this inheritance i parted from my company and lost my way and lost my servants and my comrades                        70  cyprian tis singular that even within the sight of the high towers of antioch you could lose your way of all the avenues and green paths of this wild wood there is not one but leads as to its centre to the walls of antioch                           75 take which you will you cannot miss your road  daemon and such is ignorance even in the sight of knowledge it can draw no profit from it but as it still is early and as i have no acquaintances in antioch                                    80 being a stranger there i will even wait the few surviving hours of the day until the night shall conquer it i see both by your dress and by the books in which you find delight and company that you                               85 are a great studentfor my part i feel much sympathy in such pursuits  note 87 in transcr with 1824  cyprian have you studied much  daemon

the attempt was still more glorious than the failure could be dishonourable if you believe not let us refer it to dispute respecting                                105 that which you know the best and although i know not the opinion you maintain and though it be the true one i will take the contrary  note 106 the transcr wanting 1824  cyprian the offer gives me pleasure i am now debating with myself upon a passage                                  110 of plinius and my mind is racked with doubt to understand and know who is the god of whom he speaks  daemon it is a passage if i recollect it right couched in these words god is one supreme goodness one pure essence                      115 one substance and one sense all sight all hands  cyprian tis true  daemon what difficulty find you here  cyprian i do not recognize among the gods the god defined by plinius if he must be supreme goodness even jupiter                                    120 is not supremely good because we see his deeds are evil and his attributes tainted with mortal weakness in what manner can supreme goodness be consistent with the passions of humanity  daemon the wisdom                                                           125 of the old world masked with the names of gods the attributes of nature and of man a sort of popular philosophy  cyprian this reply will not satisfy me for such awe is due to the high name of god                              130 that ill should never be imputed then examining the question with more care it follows that the gods would always will that which is best were they supremely good how then does one will one thing one another                       135 and that you may not say that i allege poetical or philosophic learning consider the ambiguous responses of their oracular statues from two shrines two armies shall obtain the assurance of                             140 one victory is it not indisputable that two contending wills can never lead to the same end and being opposite if one be good is not the other evil evil in god is inconceivable                                        145 but supreme goodness fails among the gods without their union  note

  150 the battles loss may profit those who lose than victory advantage those who win  cyprian that i admit and yet that god should not falsehood is incompatible with deity assure the victory it would be enough                               155 to have permitted the defeat if god be all sightgod who had beheld the truth would not have given assurance of an end never to be accomplished thus although the deity may according to his attributes                            160 be well distinguished into persons yet even in the minutest circumstance his essence must be one  note 157 had transcr wanting 1824  daemon to attain the end the affections of the actors in the scene must have been thus influenced by his voice                         165  cyprian but for a purpose thus subordinate he might have employed genii good or evil a sort of spirits called so by the learned who roam about inspiring good or evil and from whose influence and existence we                            170 may well infer our immortality thus god might easily without descent to a gross falsehood in his proper person have moved the affections by this mediation to the just point  note 172 descent transcr descending 1824  daemon these trifling contradictions                                        175 do not suffice to impugn the unity of the high gods in things of great importance they still appear unanimous

and as the car of magic they ascended again the speechless music swelled again the coursers of the air unfurled their azure pennons and the queen shaking the beamy reins                                              205 bade them pursue their way  the magic car moved on the night was fair and countless stars studded heavens dark blue vault just oer the eastern wave                                           210 peeped the first faint smile of morn the magic car moved on from the celestial hoofs the atmosphere in flaming sparkles flew and where the burning wheels                                         215 eddied above the mountains loftiest peak was traced a line of lightning now it flew far above a rock the utmost verge of earth the rival of the andes whose dark brow                              220 lowered oer the silver sea  far far below the chariots path calm as a slumbering babe tremendous ocean lay the mirror of its stillness showed                                   225 the pale and waning stars the chariots fiery track and the gray light of morn tinging those fleecy clouds that canopied the dawn                                              230 seemed it that the chariots way lay through the midst of an immense concave radiant with million constellations tinged with shades of infinite colour and semicircled with a belt                                          235 flashing incessant meteors  the magic car moved on as they approached their goal the coursers seemed to gather speed the sea no longer was distinguished earth                           240 appeared a vast and shadowy sphere the suns unclouded orb rolled through the black concave its rays of rapid light parted around the chariots swifter course                          245 and fell like oceans feathery spray dashed from the boiling surge before a vessels prow  the magic car moved on earths distant orb appeared                                         250 the smallest light that twinkles in the heaven whilst round the chariots way innumerable systems rolled and countless spheres diffused an evervarying glory                                               255 it was a sight of wonder some were horned like the crescent moon some shed a mild and silver beam like hesperus oer the western sea some dashed athwart with trains of flame                            260 like worlds to death and ruin driven some shone like suns and as the chariot passed eclipsed all other light  spirit of nature here in this interminable wilderness                                      265 of worlds at whose immensity even soaring fancy staggers here is thy fitting temple yet not the lightest leaf that quivers to the passing breeze                                   270 is less instinct with thee yet not the meanest worm that lurks in graves and fattens on the dead less shares thy eternal breath spirit of nature thou                                              275 imperishable as this scene here is thy fitting temple  2  if solitude hath ever led thy steps to the wild oceans echoing shore and thou hast lingered there until the suns broad orb seemed resting on the burnished wave                                5 thou must have marked the lines of purple gold that motionless hung oer the sinking sphere thou must have marked the billowy clouds edged with intolerable radiancy                                      10 towering like rocks of jet crowned with a diamond wreath and yet there is a moment when the suns highest point peeps like a star oer oceans western edge                         15 when those far clouds of feathery gold shaded with deepest purple gleam like islands on a dark blue sea then has thy fancy soared above the earth and furled its wearied wing                                          20 within the fairys fane  yet not the golden islands gleaming in yon flood of light nor the feathery curtains stretching oer the suns bright couch                              25 nor the burnished ocean waves paving that gorgeous dome so fair so wonderful a sight as mabs aethereal palace could afford yet likest evenings vault that faery hall                         30 as heaven low resting on

beamings darted through clouds of circumambient darkness and pearly battlements around looked oer the immense of heaven  the magic car no longer moved                                       40 the fairy and the spirit entered the hall of spells those golden clouds that rolled in glittering billows beneath the azure canopy                                             45 with the aethereal footsteps trembled not the light and crimson mists floating to strains of thrilling melody through that unearthly dwelling yielded to every movement of the will                               50 upon their passive swell the spirit leaned and for the varied bliss that pressed around used not the glorious privilege of virtue and of wisdom  spirit the fairy said                                            55 and pointed to the gorgeous dome this is a wondrous sight and mocks all human grandeur but were it virtues only meed to dwell in a celestial palace all resigned                                  60 to pleasurable impulses immured within the prison of itself the will of changeless nature would be unfulfilled learn to make others happy spirit come this is thine high rewardthe past shall rise

                    70 there far as the remotest line that bounds imaginations flight countless and unending orbs in mazy motion intermingled yet still fulfilled immutably                                        75 eternal natures law above below around the circling systems formed a wilderness of harmony each with undeviating aim                                           80 in eloquent silence through the depths of space pursued its wondrous way  there was a little light that twinkled in the misty distance none but a spirits eye                                              85 might ken that rolling orb none but a spirits eye and in no other place but that celestial dwelling might behold each action of this earths inhabitants                             90 but matter space and time in those aereal mansions cease to act and allprevailing wisdom when it reaps the harvest of its excellence oerbounds those obstacles of which an earthly soul                            95 fears to

stone on stone and poisoning the choicest days of life to soothe a dotards vanity there an inhuman and uncultured race howled hideous praises to their demongod                           150 they

loveliness of gardens long run wild                                            195 seems to the unwilling sojourner whose steps chance in that desert has delayed thus to have stood since earth was

useless and ridiculous art whilst the cultivator of the earth he without whom society must cease to subsist struggles through contempt and penury and perishes by that famine which but for his unceasing exertions would annihilate the rest of mankind  i will not insult common sense by insisting on the doctrine of the natural equality of man the question is not concerning its desirableness but its practicability so far as it is practicable it is desirable that state of human society which approaches nearer to an equal partition of its benefits and evils should caeteris paribus be preferred but so long as we conceive that a wanton expenditure of human labour not for the necessities not even for the luxuries of the mass of society but for the egotism and ostentation of a few of its members is defensible on the ground of public justice so long we neglect to approximate to the redemption of the human race  labour is required for physical and leisure for moral improvement from the former of these advantages the rich and from the latter the poor by the inevitable conditions of their respective situations are precluded a state which should combine the advantages of both would be subjected to the evils of neither he that is deficient in firm health or vigorous intellect is but half a man hence it follows that to subject the labouring classes to unnecessary labour is wantonly depriving them of any opportunities of intellectual improvement and that the rich are heaping up for their own mischief the disease lassitude and ennui by which their existence is rendered an intolerable burthen  english reformers exclaim against sinecuresbut the true pension list is the rentroll of the landed proprietors wealth is a power usurped by the few to compel the many to labour for their benefit the laws which support this system derive their force from the ignorance and credulity of its victims they are the result of a conspiracy of the few against the many who are themselves obliged to purchase this preeminence by the loss of all real comfort  the commodities that substantially contribute to the subsistence of the human species form a very short catalogue they demand from us but a slender portion of industry if these only were produced and sufficiently produced the species of man would be continued if the labour necessarily required to produce them were equitably divided among the poor and still more if it were equitably divided among all each mans share of labour would be light and his portion of leisure would be ample there was a time when this leisure would have been of small comparative value it is to be hoped that the time will come when it will be applied to the most important purposes those hours which are not required for the production of the necessaries of life may be devoted to the cultivation of the understanding the enlarging our stock of knowledge the refining our taste and thus opening to us new and more exquisite sources of enjoyment    it was perhaps necessary that a period of monopoly and oppression should subsist before a period of cultivated equality could subsist savages perhaps would never have been

passion to put fetters on the clearest deductions of reason and by appeals to the will to subdue the involuntary affections of our nature love is inevitably consequent upon the perception of loveliness love withers under constraint its very essence is liberty it is compatible neither with obedience jealousy nor fear it is there most pure perfect and unlimited where its votaries live in confidence equality and unreserve  how long then ought the sexual connection to last what law ought to specify the extent of the grievances which should limit its duration a husband and wife ought to continue so long united as they love each other any law which should bind them to cohabitation for one moment after the decay of their affection would be a most intolerable tyranny and the most unworthy of toleration how odious an usurpation of the right of private judgement should that law be considered which should make the ties of friendship indissoluble in spite of the caprices the inconstancy the fallibility and capacity for improvement of the human mind and by so much would the fetters of love be heavier and more unendurable than those of friendship as love is more vehement and capricious more dependent on those delicate peculiarities of imagination and less capable of reduction to the ostensible merits of the object  the state of society in which we exist is a mixture of feudal savageness and imperfect civilization the narrow and unenlightened morality of the christian religion is an aggravation of these evils it is not even until lately that mankind have admitted that happiness is the sole end of the science of ethics as of all other sciences and that the fanatical idea of mortifying the flesh for the love of god has been discarded i have heard indeed an ignorant collegian adduce in favour of christianity its hostility to every worldly feeling the first christian emperor made a law by which seduction was punished with death if the female pleaded her own consent she also was punished with death if the parents endeavoured to screen the criminals they were banished and their estates were confiscated the slaves who might be accessory were burned

the primitive christians to love and even marriage page 269  but if happiness be the object of morality of all human unions and disunions if the worthiness of every action is to be estimated by the quantity of pleasurable sensation it is calculated to produce then the connection of the sexes is so long sacred as it contributes to the comfort of the parties and is naturally dissolved when its evils are greater than its benefits there is nothing immoral in this separation constancy has nothing virtuous in itself independently of the pleasure it confers and partakes of the temporizing spirit of vice in proportion as it endures tamely moral defects of magnitude in the object of its indiscreet choice love is free to promise for ever to love the same woman is not less absurd than to promise to believe the same creed such a vow in both cases excludes us from all inquiry the language of the votarist is this the woman i now love may be infinitely inferior to many others the creed i now profess may be a mass of errors and absurdities but i exclude myself from all future information as to the amiability of the one and the truth of the other resolving blindly and in spite of conviction to adhere to them is this the language of delicacy and reason is the love of such a frigid heart of more worth than its belief  the present system of constraint does no more in the majority of instances than make hypocrites or open enemies persons of delicacy and virtue unhappily united to one whom they find it impossible to love spend the loveliest season of their life in unproductive efforts to appear otherwise than they are for the sake of the feelings of their partner or the welfare of their mutual offspring those of less generosity and refinement openly avow their disappointment and linger out the remnant of that union which only death can dissolve in a state of incurable bickering and hostility the early education of their children takes its colour from the squabbles of the parents they are nursed in a systematic school of illhumour violence and falsehood had they been suffered to part at the moment when indifference rendered their union irksome they would have been spared many years of misery they would have connected themselves more suitably and would have found that happiness in the society of more congenial partners which is for ever denied them by the despotism of marriage they would have been separately useful and happy members of society who whilst united were miserable and rendered misanthropical by misery the conviction that wedlock is indissoluble holds out the strongest of all temptations to the perverse they indulge without restraint in acrimony and all the little tyrannies of domestic life when they know that their victim is without appeal if this connection were put on a rational basis each would be assured that habitual illtemper would terminate in separation and would check this vicious and dangerous propensity  prostitution is the legitimate offspring of marriage and its accompanying errors women for no other crime than having followed the dictates of a natural appetite are driven with fury from the comforts and sympathies of society it is less venial than murder and the punishment which is inflicted on her who destroys her child to escape reproach is lighter than the life of agony and disease to which the prostitute is irrecoverably doomed has a woman obeyed the impulse of unerring naturesociety declares war against her pitiless and eternal war she must be the tame slave she must make no reprisals theirs is the right of persecution hers the duty of endurance she lives a life of infamy the loud and bitter laugh of scorn scares her from all return she dies of long and lingering disease yet she is in fault she is the criminal she the froward and untamable childand society forsooth the pure and virtuous matron who casts her as an abortion from her undefiled bosom society avenges herself on the

exquisite and delicate sensibilities whose existence coldhearted worldlings have denied annihilating all genuine passion and debasing that to a selfish feeling which is the excess of generosity and devotedness their body and mind alike crumble into a hideous wreck of humanity idiocy and disease become perpetuated in their miserable offspring and distant generations suffer for the bigoted morality of their forefathers chastity is a monkish and evangelical superstition a greater foe to natural temperance even than unintellectual sensuality it strikes at the root of all domestic happiness and consigns more than half of the human race to misery that some few may monopolize according to law a system could not well have been devised more studiously hostile to human happiness than marriage  i conceive that from the abolition of marriage the fit and natural arrangement of sexual connection would result i by no means assert that the intercourse would be promiscuous on the contrary it appears from the relation of parent to child that this union is generally of long duration and marked above all others with generosity and selfdevotion but this is a subject which it is perhaps premature to discuss that which will result from the abolition of marriage will be natural and right because choice and change will be exempted from restraint  in fact religion and morality as they now stand compose a practical code of misery and servitude the genius of human happiness must tear every leaf from the accursed book of god ere man can read the inscription on his heart how would

polar star to which the axis of the earth in its present state of obliquity points it is exceedingly probable from many considerations that this obliquity will gradually diminish until the equator coincides with the ecliptic the nights and days will then become equal on the earth throughout the year and probably the seasons also there is no great extravagance in presuming that the progress of the perpendicularity of the poles may be as rapid as the progress of intellect or that there should be a perfect identity between the moral and physical improvement of the human species it is certain that wisdom is not compatible with disease and that in the present state of the climates of the earth health in the true and comprehensive sense of the word is out of the reach of civilized man astronomy teaches us that the earth is now in its progress and that the poles are every year becoming more and more perpendicular to the ecliptic the strong evidence afforded by the history of mythology and geological researches that some event of this nature has taken place already affords a strong presumption that this progress is not merely an oscillation as has been surmised by some

immense and uninterrupted chain of causes and effects no one of which could occupy any other place than it does occupy or act in any other place than it does act the idea of necessity is obtained by our experience of the connection between objects the uniformity of the operations of nature the constant conjunction of similar events and the consequent inference of one from the other mankind are therefore agreed in the admission of necessity if they admit that these two circumstances take place in voluntary action motive is to voluntary action in the human mind what cause is to effect in the material universe the word liberty as applied to mind is analogous to the word chance as applied to matter they spring from an ignorance of the certainty of the conjunction of antecedents and consequents  every human being is irresistibly impelled to act precisely as he does act in the eternity which preceded his birth a chain of causes was generated which operating under the name of motives make it impossible that any thought of his mind or any action of his life should be otherwise than it is were the doctrine of necessity false the human mind would no longer be a legitimate object of science from like causes it would be in vain that we should expect like effects the strongest motive would no longer be paramount over the conduct all knowledge would be vague and undeterminate we could not predict with any certainty that we might not meet as an enemy tomorrow him with whom we have parted in friendship tonight the most probable inducements and the clearest reasonings would lose the invariable influence they possess the contrary of this is demonstrably the fact similar circumstances produce the same unvariable effects the precise character and motives of any man on any occasion being given the moral philosopher could predict his actions with as much certainty as the natural philosopher could predict the effects of the mixture of any particular chemical substances why is the aged husbandman more experienced than the young beginner because there is a uniform undeniable necessity in the operations of the material universe why is the old statesman more skilful than the raw politician because relying on the necessary conjunction of motive and action he proceeds to produce moral effects by the application of those moral causes which experience has shown to be effectual some actions may be found to which we can attach no motives but these are the effects of causes with which we are unacquainted hence the relation which motive bears to voluntary action is that of cause to effect nor placed in this point of view is it or ever has it been the subject of popular or philosophical dispute none but the few fanatics who are engaged in the herculean task of reconciling the justice of their god with the misery of man will longer outrage common sense by the supposition of an event without a cause a voluntary action without a motive history politics morals criticism all grounds of reasonings all principles of science alike assume the truth of the doctrine of necessity no farmer carrying his corn to market doubts the sale of it at the market price the master of a manufactory no more doubts that he can purchase the human labour necessary for his purposes than that his machinery will act as they have been accustomed to act  but whilst none have scrupled to admit necessity as influencing matter many have disputed its dominion over mind independently of its militating with the received ideas of the justice of god it is by no means obvious to a superficial inquiry when the mind observes its own operations it feels no connection of motive and action but as we know nothing more of causation than the constant conjunction of objects and the consequent inference of one from the other as we find that these two circumstances are universally allowed to have place in voluntary action we may be easily led to own that they are subjected to the necessity common to all causes the actions of the will have a regular conjunction with circumstances and characters motive is to voluntary action what cause is to effect but the only idea we can form of causation is a constant conjunction of similar objects and the consequent inference of one from the other wherever this is the case necessity is clearly established  the idea of liberty applied metaphorically to the will has sprung from a misconception of the meaning of the word power what is powerid quod potest that which can produce any given effect to deny power is to say that nothing can or has the power to be or act in the only true sense of the word power it applies with equal force to the lodestone as to the human will do you think these motives which i shall present are powerful enough to rouse him is a question just as common as do you think this lever has the power of raising this weight the advocates of freewill assert that the will has the power of refusing to be determined by the strongest motive but the strongest motive is that which overcoming all others ultimately prevails this assertion therefore amounts to a denial of the will being ultimately determined by that motive which does determine it which is absurd but it is equally certain that a man cannot resist the strongest motive as that he cannot overcome a physical impossibility  the doctrine of necessity tends to introduce a great change into the established notions of morality and utterly to destroy religion reward and punishment must be considered by the necessarian merely as motives which he would employ in order to procure the adoption or abandonment of any given line of conduct desert in the present sense of the word would no longer have any meaning and he who should inflict pain upon another for no better reason than that he deserved it would only gratify his revenge under pretence of satisfying justice it is not enough says the advocate of freewill that a criminal should be prevented from a repetition of his crime he should feel pain and his torments when justly inflicted ought precisely to be proportioned to his fault but utility is morality that which is incapable of producing happiness is useless and though the crime of damiens must be condemned yet the frightful torments which revenge under the name of justice inflicted on this unhappy man cannot be supposed to have augmented even at the long run the stock of pleasurable sensation in the world at the same time the doctrine of necessity does not in the least diminish our disapprobation of vice the conviction which all feel that a viper is a poisonous animal and that a tiger is constrained by the inevitable condition of his existence to devour men does not induce us to avoid them lass sedulously or even more to hesitate in destroying them but he would surely be of a hard heart who meeting with a serpent on a desert island or in a situation where it was incapable of injury should wantonly deprive it of existence a necessarian is inconsequent to his own principles if he indulges in hatred or contempt the compassion which he feels for the criminal is unmixed with a desire of injuring him he looks with an elevated and dreadless composure upon the links of the universal chain as they pass before his eyes whilst cowardice curiosity and inconsistency only assail him in proportion to the feebleness and indistinctness with which he has perceived and rejected the delusions of freewill  religion is the perception of the relation in which we stand to the principle of the universe but if the principle of the universe be not an organic being the model and prototype of man the relation between it and human beings is absolutely none without some insight into its will respecting our actions religion is nugatory and vain but will is only a mode of animal mind moral qualities also are such as only a human being can possess to attribute them to the principle of the universe is to annex to it properties incompatible with any possible definition of its nature it is probable that the word god was originally only an expression denoting the unknown cause of the known events which men perceived in the universe by the vulgar mistake of a metaphor for a real being of a word for a thing it became a man endowed with human qualities and governing the universe as an earthly monarch governs his kingdom their addresses to this imaginary being indeed are much in the same style as those of subjects to a king they acknowledge his benevolence deprecate his anger and supplicate his favour  but the doctrine of necessity teaches us that in no case could any event have happened otherwise than it did happen and that if god is the author of good he is also the author of evil that if he is entitled to our gratitude for the one he is entitled to our hatred for the other that admitting the existence of this hypothetic being he is also subjected to the dominion of an immutable necessity it is plain that the same arguments which prove that god is the author of food light and life prove him also to be the author of poison darkness and death the widewasting earthquake the storm the battle and the tyranny are attributable to this hypothetic being in the same degree as the fairest forms of nature sunshine liberty and peace  but we are taught by the doctrine of necessity that there is neither good nor evil in the universe otherwise than as the events to which we apply these epithets have relation to our own peculiar mode of being still less than with the hypothesis of a god will the doctrine of necessity accord with the belief of a future state of punishment god made man such as he is and than damned him for being so for to say that god was the author of all good and man the author of all evil is to say that one man made a straight line and a crooked one and another man made the incongruity  a mahometan story much to the present purpose is recorded wherein adam and moses are introduced disputing before god in the following manner thou says moses art adam whom god created and animated with the breath of life and caused to be worshipped by the angels and placed in paradise from whence mankind have been expelled for thy fault whereto adam answered thou art moses whom god chose for his apostle and entrusted with his word by giving thee the tables of the law and whom he vouchsafed to admit to discourse with himself how many years dost thou find the law was written before i was created says moses forty and dost thou not find replied adam these words therein and adam rebelled against his lord and transgressed which moses confessing dost thou therefore blame me continued he for doing that which god wrote of me that i should do forty years before i was created nay for what was decreed concerning me fifty thousand years before the creation of heaven and earthsales prelim disc to the koran page 164  7 13  there is no god  this negation must be understood solely to affect a creative deity the hypothesis of a pervading spirit coeternal with the universe remains unshaken  a close examination of the validity of the proofs adduced to support any proposition is the only secure way of attaining truth on the advantages of which it is unnecessary to descant our knowledge of the existence of a deity is a subject of such importance that it cannot be too minutely investigated in consequence of this conviction we proceed briefly and impartially to examine the proofs which have been adduced it is necessary first to consider the nature of belief  when a proposition is offered to the mind it perceives the agreement or disagreement of the ideas of which it is composed a perception of their agreement is termed belief many obstacles frequently prevent this perception from being immediate these the mind attempts to remove in order that the perception may be distinct the mind is active in the investigation in order to perfect the state of perception of the relation which the component ideas of the proposition bear to each which is passive the investigation being confused with the perception has induced many falsely to imagine that the mind is active in beliefthat belief is an act of volitionin consequence of which it may be regulated by the mind pursuing continuing this mistake they have attached a degree of criminality to disbelief of which in its nature it is incapable it is equally incapable of merit  belief then is a passion the strength of which like every other passion is in precise proportion to the degrees of excitement  the degrees of excitement are three  the senses are the sources of all knowledge to the mind consequently their evidence claims the strongest assent  the decision of the mind founded upon our own experience derived from these sources claims the next degree  the experience of others which addresses itself to the former one occupies the lowest degree  a graduated scale on which should be marked the capabilities of propositions to approach to the test of the senses would be a just barometer of the belief which ought to be attached to them  consequently no testimony can be admitted which is contrary to reason reason is founded on the evidence of our senses  every proof may be referred to one of these three divisions it is to be considered what arguments we receive from each of them which should convince us of the existence of a deity  1st the evidence of the senses if the deity should appear to us if he should convince our senses of his existence this revelation would necessarily command belief those to whom the deity has thus appeared have the strongest possible conviction of his existence but the god of theologians is incapable of local visibility  2d reason it is urged that man knows that whatever is must either have had a beginning or have existed from all eternity he also knows that whatever is not eternal must have had a cause when this reasoning is applied to the universe it is necessary to prove that it was created until that is clearly demonstrated we may reasonably suppose that it has endured from all eternity we must prove design before we can infer a designer the only idea which we can form of causation is derivable from the constant conjunction of objects and the consequent inference of one from the other in a case where two propositions are diametrically opposite the mind believes that which is least incomprehensibleit is easier to suppose that the universe has existed from all eternity than to conceive a being beyond its limits capable of creating it if the mind sinks beneath the weight of one is it an alleviation to increase the intolerability of the burthen  the other argument which is founded on a mans knowledge of his own existence stands thus a man knows not only that he now is but that once he was not consequently there must have been a cause but our idea of causation is alone derivable from the constant conjunction of objects and the consequent inference of one from the other and reasoning experimentally we can only infer from effects causes exactly adequate to those effects but there certainly is a generative power which is effected by certain instruments we cannot prove that it is inherent in these instruments nor is the contrary hypothesis capable of demonstration we admit that the generative power is incomprehensible but to suppose that the same effect is produced by an eternal omniscient omnipotent being leaves the cause in the same obscurity but renders it more incomprehensible  3d testimony it is required that testimony should not be contrary to reason the testimony that the deity convinces the senses of men of his existence can only be admitted by us if our mind considers it less probable that these men should have been deceived than that the deity should have appeared to them our reason can never admit the testimony of men who not only declare that they were eyewitnesses of miracles but that the deity was irrational for he commanded that he should be believed he proposed the highest rewards for faith eternal punishments for disbelief we can only command voluntary actions belief is not an act of volition the mind is even passive or involuntarily active from this it is evident that we have no sufficient testimony or rather that testimony is insufficient to prove the being of a god it has been before shown that it cannot be deduced from reason they alone then who have been convinced by the evidence of the senses can believe it  hence it is evident that having no proofs from either of the three sources of conviction the mind cannot believe the existence of a creative god it is also evident that as belief is a passion of the mind no degree of criminality is attachable to disbelief and that they only are reprehensible who neglect to remove the false medium through which their mind views any subject of discussion every reflecting mind must acknowledge that there is no proof of the existence of a deity  god is an hypothesis and as such stands in need of proof the onus probandi rests on the theist sir isaac newton says hypotheses non fingo quicquid enim ex phaenomenis non deducitur hypothesis vocanda est et hypothesis vel metaphysicae vel physicae vel qualitatum occultarum seu mechanicae in philosophia locum non habent to all proofs of the existence of a creative god apply this valuable rule we see a variety of bodies possessing a variety of powers we merely know their effects we are in a state of ignorance with respect to their essences and causes these newton calls the phenomena of things but the pride of philosophy is unwilling to admit its ignorance of their causes from the phenomena which are the objects of our senses we attempt to infer a cause which we call god and gratuitously endow it with all negative and contradictory qualities from this hypothesis we invent this general name to conceal our ignorance of causes and essences the being called god by no means answers with the conditions prescribed by newton it bears every mark of a veil woven by philosophical conceit to hide the ignorance of philosophers even from themselves they borrow the threads of its texture from the anthropomorphism of the vulgar words have been used by sophists for the same purposes from the occult qualities of the peripatetics to the effluvium of boyle and the crinities or nebulae of herschel god is represented as infinite eternal incomprehensible he is contained under every predicate in non that the logic of ignorance could fabricate even his worshippers allow that it is impossible to form any idea of him they exclaim with the french poet  pour dire ce quil est il faut etre luimeme  lord bacon says that atheism leaves to man reason philosophy natural piety laws reputation and everything that can serve to conduct him to virtue but superstition destroys all these and erects itself into a tyranny over the understandings of men hence atheism never disturbs the government but renders man more clearsighted since he seas nothing beyond the boundaries of the present

will beget a son and he shall bear the sins of all the world  a book is put into our hands when children called the bible the purport of whose history is briefly this that god made the earth in six days and there planted a delightful garden in which he placed the first pair of human beings in the midst of the garden he planted a tree whose fruit although within their reach they were forbidden to touch that the devil in the shape of a snake persuaded them to eat of this fruit in consequence of which god condemned both them and their posterity yet unborn to satisfy his justice by their eternal misery that four thousand years after these events the human race in the meanwhile having gone unredeemed to perdition god engendered with the betrothed wife of a carpenter in judea whose virginity was nevertheless uninjured and begat a son whose name was jesus christ and who was crucified and died in order that no more men might be devoted to hellfire he bearing the burthen of his fathers displeasure by proxy the book states in addition that the soul of whoever disbelieves this sacrifice will be burned with everlasting fire  during many ages of misery and darkness this story gained implicit belief but at length men arose who suspected that it was a fable and imposture and that jesus christ so far from being a god was only a man like themselves but a numerous set of men who derived and still derive immense emoluments from this opinion in the shape of a popular belief told the vulgar that if they did not believe in the bible they would be damned to all eternity and burned imprisoned and poisoned all the unbiassed and unconnected inquirers who occasionally arose they still oppress them so far as the people now become more enlightened will allow  the belief in all that the bible contains is called christianity a roman governor of judea at the instance of a priestled mob crucified a man called jesus eighteen centuries ago he was a man of pure life who desired to rescue his countrymen from the tyranny of their barbarous and degrading superstitions the common fate of all who desire to benefit mankind awaited him the rabble at the instigation of the priests demanded his death although his very judge made public acknowledgement of his innocence jesus was sacrificed to the honour of that god with whom he was afterwards confounded it is of importance therefore to distinguish between the pretended character of this being as the son of god and the saviour of the world and his real character as a man who for a vain attempt to reform the world paid the forfeit of his life to that overbearing tyranny which has since so long desolated the universe in his name whilst the one is a hypocritical daemon who announces himself as the god of compassion and peace even whilst he stretches forth his bloodred hand with the sword of discord to waste the earth having confessedly devised this scheme of desolation from eternity the other stands in the foremost list of those true heroes who have died in the glorious martyrdom of liberty and have braved torture contempt and poverty in the cause of suffering humanity since writing this note i have some reason to suspect that jesus was an ambitious man who aspired to the throne of judea  the vulgar ever in extremes became persuaded that the crucifixion of jesus was a supernatural event testimonies of miracles so frequent in unenlightened ages were not wanting to prove that he was something divine this belief rolling through the lapse of ages met with the reveries of plato and the reasonings of aristotle and acquired force and extent until the divinity of jesus became a dogma which to dispute was death which to doubt was infamy  christianity is now the established religion he who attempts to impugn it must be contented to behold murderers and traitors take precedence of him in public opinion though if his genius be equal to his courage and assisted by a peculiar coalition of circumstances future ages may exalt him to a divinity and persecute others in his name as he was persecuted in the name of his predecessor in the homage of the world  the same means that have supported every other popular belief have supported christianity war imprisonment assassination and falsehood deeds of unexampled and incomparable atrocity have made it what it is the blood shed by the votaries of the god of mercy and peace since the establishment of his religion would probably suffice to drown all other sectaries now on the habitable globe we derive from our ancestors a faith thus fostered and supported we quarrel persecute and hate for its maintenance even under a government which whilst it infringes the very right of thought and speech boasts of permitting the liberty of the press a man is pilloried and imprisoned because he is a deist and no one raises his voice in the indignation of outraged humanity but it is ever a proof that the falsehood of a proposition is felt by those who use coercion not reasoning to procure its admission and a dispassionate observer would feel himself more powerfully interested in favour of a man who depending on the truth of his opinions simply stated his reasons for entertaining them than in that of his aggressor who daringly avowing his unwillingness or incapacity to answer them by argument proceeded to repress the energies and break the spirit of their promulgator by that torture and imprisonment whose infliction he could command  analogy seems to favour the opinion that as like other systems christianity has arisen and augmented so like them it will decay and perish that as violence darkness and deceit not reasoning and persuasion have procured its admission among mankind so when enthusiasm has subsided and time that infallible controverter of false opinions has involved its pretended evidences in the darkness of antiquity it will become obsolete that miltons poem alone will give permanency to the remembrance of its absurdities and that men will laugh as heartily at grace faith redemption and original sin as they now do at the metamorphoses of jupiter the miracles of romish saints the efficacy of witchcraft and the appearance of departed spirits  had the christian religion commenced and continued by the mere force of reasoning and persuasion the preceding analogy would be inadmissible we should never speculate on the future obsoleteness of a system perfectly conformable to nature and reason it would endure so long as they endured it would be a truth as indisputable as the light of the sun the criminality of murder and other facts whose evidence depending on our organization and relative situations must remain acknowledged as satisfactory so long as man is man it is an incontrovertible fact the consideration of which ought to repress the hasty conclusions of credulity or moderate its obstinacy in maintaining them that had the jews not been a fanatical race of men had even the resolution of pontius pilate been equal to his candour the christian religion never could have prevailed it could not even have existed on so feeble a thread hangs the most cherished opinion of a sixth of the human race when will the vulgar learn humility when will the pride of ignorance blush at having believed before it could comprehend  either the christian religion is true or it is false if true it comes from god and its authenticity can admit of doubt and dispute no further than its omnipotent author is willing to allow either the power or the goodness of god is called in question if he leaves those doctrines most essential to the wellbeing of man in doubt and dispute the only ones which since their promulgation have been the subject of unceasing cavil the cause of irreconcilable hatred if god has spoken why is the universe not convinced  there is this passage in the christian scriptures those who obey not god and believe not the gospel of his son shall be punished with everlasting destruction this is the pivot upon which all religions turnthey all assume that it is in our power to believe or not to believe whereas the mind can only believe that which it thinks true a human being can only be supposed accountable for those actions which are influenced by his will but belief is utterly distinct from and unconnected with volition it is the apprehension of the agreement or disagreement of the ideas that compose any preposition belief is a passion or involuntary operation of the mind and like other passions its intensity is precisely proportionate to the degrees of excitement volition is essential to merit or demerit but the christian religion attaches the highest possible degrees of merit and demerit to that which is worthy of neither and which is totally unconnected with the peculiar faculty of the mind whose presence is essential to their being  christianity was intended to reform the world had an allwise being planned it nothing is more improbable than that it should have failed omniscience would infallibly have foreseen the inutility of a scheme which experience demonstrates to this age to have been utterly unsuccessful  christianity inculcates the necessity of supplicating the deity prayer may be considered under two points of viewas an endeavour to change the intentions of god or as a formal testimony of our obedience but the former case supposes that the caprices of a limited intelligence can occasionally instruct the creator of the world how to regulate the universe and the latter a certain degree of servility analogous to the loyalty demanded by earthly tyrants obedience indeed is only the pitiful and cowardly egotism of him who thinks that he can do something better than reason  christianity like all other religions rests upon miracles prophecies and martyrdoms no religion ever existed which had not its prophets its attested miracles and above all crowds of devotees who would bear patiently the most horrible tortures to prove its authenticity it should appear that in no case can a discriminating mind subscribe to the genuineness of a miracle a miracle is an infraction of natures law by a supernatural cause by a cause acting beyond that eternal circle within which all things are included god breaks through the law of nature that he may convince mankind of the truth of that revelation which in spite of his precautions has been since its introduction the subject of unceasing schism and cavil  miracles resolve themselves into the following question see humes essay volume 2 page 121whether it is more probable the laws of nature hitherto so immutably harmonious should have undergone violation or that a man should have told a lie whether it is more probable that we are ignorant of the natural cause of an event or that we know the supernatural one that in old times when the powers of nature were less known than at present a certain set of men were themselves deceived or had some hidden motive for deceiving others or that god begat a son who in his legislation measuring merit by belief evidenced himself to be totally ignorant of the powers of the human mindof what is voluntary and what is the contrary  we have many instances of men telling liesnone of an infraction of natures laws those laws of whose government alone we have any knowledge or experience the records of all nations afford innumerable instances of men deceiving others either from vanity or interest or themselves being deceived by the limitedness of their views and their ignorance of natural causes but where is the accredited case of god having come upon earth to give the lie to his own creations there would be something truly wonderful in the appearance of a ghost but the assertion of a child that he saw one as he passed through the churchyard is universally admitted to be less miraculous  but even supposing that a man should raise a dead body to life before our eyes and on this fact rest his claim to being considered the son of godthe humane society restores drowned persons and because it makes no mystery of the method it employs its members are not mistaken for the sons of god all that we have a right to infer from our ignorance of the cause of any event is that we do not know it had the mexicans attended to this simple rule when they heard the cannon of the spaniards they would not have considered them as gods the experiments of modern chemistry would have defied the wisest philosophers of ancient greece and rome to have accounted for them on natural principles an author of strong common sense has observed that a miracle is no miracle at secondhand he might have added that a miracle is no miracle in any case for until we are acquainted with all natural causes we have no reason to imagine others  there remains to be considered another proof of christianityprophecy a book is written before a certain event in which this event is foretold how could the prophet have foreknown it without inspiration how could he have been inspired without god the greatest stress is laid on the prophecies of moses and hosea on the dispersion of the jews and that of isaiah concerning the coming of the messiah the prophecy of moses is a collection of every possible cursing and blessing and it is so far from being marvellous that the one of dispersion should have been fulfilled that it would have been more surprising if out of all these none should have taken effect in deuteronomy chapter 28 verse 64 where moses explicitly foretells the dispersion he states that they shall there serve gods of wood and stone and the lord shall scatter thee among all people from the one end of the earth even to the other and there thou shalt serve other gods which neither thou nor thy fathers have known even gods of wood and stone the jews are at this day remarkably tenacious of their religion moses also declares that they shall be subjected to these curses for disobedience to his ritual and it shall come to pass if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god to observe to do all the commandments and statutes which i command thee this day that all these curses shall come upon thee and overtake thee is this the real reason the third fourth and fifth chapters of hosea are a piece of immodest confession the indelicate type might apply in a hundred senses to a hundred things the fiftythird chapter of isaiah is more explicit yet it does not exceed in clearness the oracles of delphos the historical proof that moses isaiah and hosea did write when they are said to have written is far from being clear and circumstantial  but prophecy requires proof in its character as a miracle we have no right to suppose that a man foreknew future events from god until it is demonstrated that he neither could know them by his own exertions nor that the writings which contain the prediction could possibly have been fabricated after the event pretended to be foretold it is more probable that writings pretending to divine inspiration should have been fabricated after the fulfilment of their pretended prediction than that they should have really been divinely inspired when we consider that the latter supposition makes god at once the creator of the human mind and ignorant of its primary powers particularly as we have numberless instances of false religions and forged prophecies of things long past and no accredited case of god having conversed with men directly or indirectly it is also possible that the description of an event might have foregone its occurrence but this is far from being a legitimate proof of a divine revelation as many men not pretending to the character of a prophet have nevertheless in this sense prophesied  lord chesterfield was never yet taken for a prophet even by a bishop yet he uttered this remarkable prediction the despotic government of france is screwed up to the highest pitch a revolution is fast approaching that revolution i am convinced will be radical and sanguinary this appeared in the letters of the prophet long before the accomplishment of this wonderful prediction now have these particulars come to pass or have they not if they have how could the earl have foreknown them without inspiration if we admit the truth of the christian religion on testimony such as this we must admit on the same strength of evidence that god has affixed the highest rewards to belief and the eternal tortures of the neverdying worm to disbelief both of which have been demonstrated to be involuntary  the last proof of the christian religion depends on the influence of the holy ghost theologians divide the influence of the holy ghost into its ordinary and extraordinary modes of operation the latter is supposed to be that which inspired the prophets and apostles and the former to be the grace of god which summarily makes known the truth of his revelation to those whose mind is fitted for its reception by a submissive perusal of his word persons convinced in this manner can do anything but account for their conviction describe the time at which it happened or the manner in which it came upon them it is supposed to enter the mind by other channels than those of the senses and therefore professes to be superior to reason founded on their experience  admitting however the usefulness or possibility of a divine revelation unless we demolish the foundations of all human knowledge it is requisite that our reason should previously demonstrate its genuineness for before we extinguish the steady ray of reason and common sense it is fit that we should discover whether we cannot do without their assistance whether or no there be any other which may suffice to guide us through the labyrinth of life see lockes essay on the human understanding book 4 chapter 19 on enthusiasm for if a man is to be inspired upon all occasions if he is to be sure of a thing because he is sure if the ordinary operations of the spirit are not to be considered very extraordinary modes of demonstration if enthusiasm is to usurp the place of proof and madness that of sanity all reasoning is superfluous the mahometan dies fighting for his prophet the indian immolates himself at the chariotwheels of brahma the hottentot worships an insect the negro a bunch of feathers the mexican sacrifices human victims their degree of conviction must certainly be very strong it cannot arise from reasoning it must from feelings the reward of their prayers if each of these should affirm in opposition to the strongest possible arguments that inspiration carried internal evidence i fear their inspired brethren the orthodox missionaries would be so uncharitable as to pronounce them obstinate  miracles cannot be received as testimonies of a disputed fact because all human testimony has ever been insufficient to establish the possibility of miracles that which is incapable of proof itself is no proof of anything else prophecy has also been rejected by the test of reason those then who have been actually inspired are the only true believers in the christian religion  mox numine viso virgineei tumuere sinus innuptaque mater arcano stupuit compleri viscera partu auctorem paritura suum mortalia corda artificem texere poli

still from hope to hope the bliss pursuing which from the exhaustless lore of human weal draws on the virtuous mind the thoughts that rise in timedestroying infiniteness gift with selfenshrined eternity etc  time is our consciousness of the succession of ideas in our mind vivid sensation of either pain or pleasure makes the time seem long as the common phrase is because it renders us more acutely conscious of our ideas if a mind be conscious of an hundred ideas during one minute by the clock and of two hundred during another the latter of these spaces would actually occupy so much greater extent in the mind as two exceed one in quantity if therefore the human mind by any future improvement of its sensibility should become conscious of an infinite number of ideas in a minute that minute would be eternity i do not hence infer that the actual space between the birth and death of a man will ever be prolonged but that his sensibility is perfectible and that the number of ideas which his mind is capable of receiving is indefinite one man is stretched on the rack during twelve hours another sleeps soundly in his bed the difference of time perceived by these two persons is immense one hardly will believe that half an hour has elapsed the other could credit that centuries had flown during his agony thus the life of a man of virtue and talent who should die in his thirtieth year is with regard to his own feelings longer than that of a miserable priestridden slave who dreams out a century of dulness the one has perpetually cultivated his mental faculties has

of the physical and moral nature of man originated in his unnatural habits of life the origin of man like that of the universe of which he is a part is enveloped in impenetrable mystery his generations either had a beginning or they had not the weight of evidence in favour of each of these suppositions seems tolerably equal and it is perfectly unimportant to the present argument which is assumed the language spoken however by the mythology of nearly all religions seems to prove that at some distant period man forsook the path of nature and sacrificed the purity and happiness of his being to unnatural appetites the date of this event seems to have also been that of some great change in the climates of the earth with which it has an obvious correspondence the allegory of adam and eve eating of the tree of evil and entailing upon their posterity the wrath of god and the loss of everlasting life admits of no other explanation than the disease and crime that have flowed from unnatural diet milton was so well aware of this that he makes raphael thus exhibit to adam the consequence of his disobedience  immediately a place before his eyes appeared sad noisome dark a lazarhouse it seemed wherein were laid numbers of all diseasedall maladies of ghastly spasm or racking torture qualms of heartsick agony all feverous kinds convulsions epilepsies fierce catarrhs intestine stone and ulcer colic pangs demoniac frenzy moping melancholy and moonstruck madness pining atrophy marasmus and widewasting pestilence dropsies and asthmas and jointracking rheums  and how many thousands more might not be added to this frightful catalogue  the story of prometheus is one likewise which although universally admitted to be allegorical has never been satisfactorily explained prometheus stole fire from heaven and was chained for this crime to mount caucasus where a vulture continually devoured his liver that grew to meet its hunger hesiod says that before the time of prometheus mankind were exempt from suffering that they enjoyed a vigorous youth and that death when at length it came approached like sleep and gently closed their eyes again so general was this opinion that horace a poet of the augustan age writes  audax omnia perpeti gens humana ruit per vetitum nefas audax iapeti genus ignem fraude mala gentibus intulit post ignem aetheria domo subductum macies et nova febrium terris incubuit cohors semotique prius tarda necessitas lethi corripuit gradum  how plain a language is spoken by all this prometheus who represents the human race effected some great change in the condition of his nature and applied fire to culinary purposes thus inventing an expedient for screening from his disgust the horrors of the shambles from this moment his vitals were devoured by the vulture of disease it consumed his being in every shape of its loathsome and infinite variety inducing the soulquelling sinkings of premature and violent death all vice rose from the ruin of healthful innocence tyranny superstition commerce and inequality were then first known when reason vainly attempted to guide the wanderings of exacerbated passion i conclude this part of the subject with an extract from mr newtons defence of vegetable regimen from whom i have borrowed this interpretation of the fable of prometheus  making allowance for such transposition of the events of the allegory as time might produce after the important truths were forgotten which this portion of the ancient mythology was intended to transmit the drift of the fable seems to be thisman at his creation was endowed with the gift of perpetual youth that is he was not formed to be a sickly suffering creature as we now see him but to enjoy health and to sink by slow degrees into the bosom of his parent earth without disease or pain prometheus first taught the use of animal food primus bovem occidit prometheus plin nat hist lib 7 sect 57 and of fire with which to render it more digestible and pleasing to the taste jupiter and the rest of the gods foreseeing the consequences of these inventions were amused or irritated at the shortsighted devices of the newlyformed creature and left him to experience the sad effects of them thirst the necessary concomitant of a flesh diet perhaps of all diet vitiated by culinary preparation ensued water was resorted to and man forfeited the inestimable gift of health which he had received from heaven he became diseased the partaker of a precarious existence and no longer descended slowly to his grave return to nature cadell 1811  but just disease to luxury succeeds and every death its own avenger breeds the fury passions from that blood began and turned on man a fiercer savageman  man and the animals whom he has infected with his society or depraved by his dominion are alone diseased the wild hog the mouflon the bison and the wolf are perfectly exempt from malady and invariably die either from external violence or natural old age but the domestic hog the sheep the cow and the dog are subject to an incredible variety of distempers and like the corruptors of their nature have physicians who thrive upon their miseries the supereminence of man is like satans a supereminence of pain and the majority of his species doomed to penury disease and crime have reason to curse the untoward event that by enabling him to communicate his sensations raised him above the level of his fellowanimals but the steps that have been taken are irrevocable the whole of human science is comprised in one questionhow can the advantages of intellect and civilization be reconciled with the liberty and pure pleasures of natural life how can we take the benefits and reject the evils of the system which is now interwoven with all the fibres of our beingi believe that abstinence from animal food and spirituous liquors would in a great measure capacitate us for the solution of this important question  it is true that mental and bodily derangement is attributable in part to other deviations from rectitude and nature than those which concern diet the mistakes cherished by society respecting the connection of the sexes whence the misery and diseases of unsatisfied celibacy unenjoying prostitution and the premature arrival of puberty necessarily spring the putrid atmosphere of crowded cities the exhalations of chemical processes the muffling of our bodies in superfluous apparel the absurd treatment of infantsall these and innumerable other causes contribute their mite to the mass of human evil  comparative anatomy teaches us that man resembles frugivorous animals in everything and carnivorous in nothing he has neither claws wherewith to seize his prey nor distinct and pointed teeth to tear the living fibre a mandarin of the first class with nails two inches long would probably find them alone inefficient to hold even a hare after every subterfuge of gluttony the bull must be degraded into the ox and the ram into the wether by an unnatural and inhuman operation that the flaccid fibre may offer a fainter resistance to rebellious nature it is only by softening and disguising dead flesh by culinary preparation that it is rendered susceptible of mastication or digestion and that the sight of its bloody juices and raw horror does not excite intolerable loathing and disgust let the advocate of animal food force himself to a decisive experiment on its fitness and as plutarch recommends tear a living lamb with his teeth and plunging his head into its vitals slake his thirst with the steaming blood when fresh from the deed of horror let him revert to the irresistible instincts of nature that would rise in judgement against it and say nature formed me for such work as this then and then only would he be consistent  man resembles no carnivorous animal there is no exception unless man be one to the rule of herbivorous animals having cellulated colons  the orangoutang perfectly resembles man both in the order and number of his teeth the orangoutang is the most anthropomorphous of the ape tribe all of which are strictly frugivorous there is no other species of animals which live on different food in which this analogy exists cuvier lecons danat comp tom 3 pages 169 373 448 465 480 reess cyclopaedia article man in many frugivorous animals the canine teeth are more pointed and distinct than those of man the resemblance also of the human stomach to that of the orangoutang is greater than to that of any other animal  the intestines are also identical with those of herbivorous animals which present a larger surface for absorption and have ample and cellulated colons the caecum also though short is larger than that of carnivorous animals and even here the orangoutang retains its accustomed similarity  the structure of the human frame then is that of one fitted to a pure vegetable diet in every essential particular it is true that the reluctance to abstain from animal food in those who have been long accustomed to its stimulus is so great in some persons of weak minds as to be scarcely overcome but this is far from bringing any argument in its favour a lamb which was fed for some time on flesh by a ships crew refused its natural diet at the end of the voyage there are numerous instances of horses sheep oxen and even woodpigeons having been taught to live upon flesh until they have loathed their natural aliment young children evidently prefer pastry oranges apples and other fruit to the flesh of animals until by the gradual depravation of the digestive organs the free use of vegetables has for a time produced serious inconveniences for a time i say since there never was an instance wherein a change from spirituous liquors and animal food to vegetables and pure water has failed ultimately to invigorate the body by rendering its juices bland and consentaneous and to restore to the mind that cheerfulness and elasticity which not one in fifty possesses on the present system a love of strong liquors is also with difficulty taught to infants almost every one remembers the wry faces which the first glass of port produced unsophisticated instinct is invariably unerring but to decide on the fitness of animal food from the perverted appetites which its constrained adoption produces is to make the criminal a judge in his own cause it is even worse it is appealing to the infatuated drunkard in a question of the salubrity of brandy  what is the cause of morbid action in the animal system not the air we breathe for our fellowdenizens of nature breathe the same uninjured not the water we drink if remote from the pollutions of man and his inventions the necessity of resorting to some means of purifying water and the disease which arises from its adulteration in civilized countries is sufficiently apparent see dr lambes reports on cancer i do not assert that the use of water is in itself unnatural but that the unperverted palate would swallow no liquid capable of occasioning disease for the animals drink it too not the earth we tread upon not the unobscured sight of glorious nature in the wood the field or the expanse of sky and ocean nothing that we are or do in common with the undiseased inhabitants of the forest something then wherein we differ from them our habit of altering our food by fire so that our appetite is no longer a just criterion for the fitness of its gratification except in children there remain no traces of that instinct which determines in all other animals what aliment is natural or otherwise and so perfectly obliterated are they in the reasoning adults of our species that it has become necessary to urge considerations drawn from comparative anatomy to prove that we are naturally frugivorous  crime is madness madness is disease whenever the cause of disease shall be discovered the root from which all vice and misery have so long overshadowed the globe will lie bare to the axe all the exertions of man from that moment may be considered as tending to the clear profit of his species no sane mind in a sane body resolves upon a real crime it is a man of violent passions bloodshot eyes and swollen veins that alone can grasp the knife of murder the system of a simple diet promises no utopian advantages it is no mere reform of legislation whilst the furious passions and evil propensities of the human heart in which it had its origin are still unassuaged it strikes at the root of all evil and is an experiment which may be tried with success not alone by nations but by small societies families and even individuals in no cases has a return to vegetable diet produced the slightest injury in most it has been attended with changes undeniably beneficial should ever a physician be born with the genius of locke i am persuaded that he might trace all bodily and mental derangements to our unnatural habits as clearly as that philosopher has traced all knowledge to sensation what prolific sources of disease are not those mineral and vegetable poisons that have been introduced for its extirpation how many thousands have become murderers and robbers bigots and domestic tyrants dissolute and abandoned adventurers from the use of fermented liquors who had they slaked their thirst only with pure water would have lived but to diffuse the happiness of their own unperverted feelings how many groundless opinions and absurd institutions have not received a general sanction from the sottishness and intemperance of individuals who will assert that had the populace of paris satisfied their hunger at the everfurnished table of vegetable nature they would have lent their brutal suffrage to the proscriptionlist of robespierre could a set of men whose passions were not perverted by unnatural stimuli look with coolness on an auto da fe is it to be believed that a being of gentle feelings rising from his meal of roots would take delight in sports of blood was nero a man of temperate life could you read calm health in his cheek flushed with ungovernable propensities of hatred for the human race did muley ismaels pulse beat evenly was his skin transparent did his eyes beam with healthfulness and its invariable concomitants cheerfulness and benignity though history has decided none of these questions a child could not hesitate to answer in the negative surely the bilesuffused cheek of buonaparte his wrinkled brow and yellow eye the ceaseless inquietude of his nervous system speak no less plainly the character of his unresting ambition than his murders and his victories it is impossible had buonaparte descended from a race of vegetable feeders that he could have had either the inclination or the power to ascend the throne of the bourbons the desire of tyranny could scarcely be excited in the individual the power to tyrannize would certainly not be delegated by a society neither frenzied by inebriation nor rendered impotent and irrational by disease pregnant indeed with inexhaustible calamity is the renunciation of instinct as it concerns our physical nature arithmetic cannot enumerate nor reason perhaps suspect the multitudinous sources of disease in civilized life even common water that apparently innoxious pabulum when corrupted by the filth of populous cities is a deadly and insidious destroyer lambes reports on cancer who can wonder that all the inducements held out by god himself in the bible to virtue should have been vainer than a nurses tale and that those dogmas by which he has there excited and justified the most ferocious propensities should have alone been deemed essential whilst christians are in the daily practice of all those habits which have infected with disease and crime not only the reprobate sons but those favoured children of the common fathers love omnipotence itself could not save them from the consequences of this original and universal sin  there is no disease bodily or mental which adoption of vegetable diet and pure water has not infallibly mitigated wherever the experiment has been fairly tried debility is gradually converted into strength disease into healthfulness madness in all its hideous variety from the ravings of the fettered maniac to the unaccountable irrationalities of illtemper that make a hell of domestic life into a calm and considerate evenness of temper that alone might offer a certain pledge of the future moral reformation of society on a natural system of diet old age would be our last and our only malady the term of our existence would be protracted we should enjoy life and no longer preclude others from the enjoyment of it all sensational delights would be infinitely more exquisite and perfect the very sense of being would then be a continued pleasure such as we now feel it in some few and favoured moments of our youth by all that is sacred in our hopes for the human race i conjure those who love happiness and truth to give a fair trial to the vegetable system reasoning is surely superfluous on a subject whose merits an experience of six months would set for ever at rest but it is only among the enlightened and benevolent that so great a sacrifice of appetite and prejudice can be expected even though its ultimate excellence should not admit of dispute it is found easier by the shortsighted victims of disease to palliate their torments by medicine than to prevent them by regimen the vulgar of all ranks are invariably sensual and indocile yet i cannot but feel myself persuaded that when the benefits of vegetable diet are mathematically proved when it is as clear that those who live naturally are exempt from premature death as that nine is not one the most sottish of mankind will feel a preference towards a long and tranquil contrasted with a short and painful life on the average out of sixty persons four die in three years hopes are entertained that in april 1814 a statement will be given that sixty persons all having lived more than three years on vegetables and pure water are then in perfect health more than two years have now elapsed not one of them has died no such example will be found in any sixty persons taken at random seventeen persons of all ages the families of dr lambe and mr newton have lived for seven years on this diet without a death and almost without the slightest illness surely when we consider that some of those were infants and one a martyr to asthma now nearly subdued we may challenge any seventeen persons taken at random in this city to exhibit a parallel case those who may have been excited to question the rectitude of established habits of diet by these loose remarks should consult mr newtons luminous and eloquent essay return to nature or defence of vegetable regimen cadell 1811  when these proofs come fairly before the world and are clearly seen by all who understand arithmetic it is scarcely possible that abstinence from aliments demonstrably pernicious should not become universal in proportion to the number of proselytes so will be the weight of evidence and when a thousand persons can be produced living on vegetables and distilled water who have to dread no disease but old age the world will be compelled to regard animal flesh and fermented liquors as slow but certain poisons the change which would be produced by simpler habits on political economy is sufficiently remarkable the monopolizing eater of animal flesh would no longer destroy his constitution by devouring an acre at a meal and many loaves of bread would cease to contribute to gout madness and apoplexy in the shape of a pint of porter or a dram of gin when appeasing the longprotracted famine of the hardworking peasants hungry babes the quantity of nutritious vegetable matter consumed in fattening the carcase of an ox would afford ten times the sustenance undepraving indeed and incapable of generating disease if gathered immediately from the bosom of the earth the most fertile districts of the habitable globe are now actually cultivated by men for animals at a delay and waste of aliment absolutely incapable of calculation it is only the wealthy that can to any great degree even now indulge the unnatural craving for dead flesh and they pay for the greater licence of the privilege by subjection to supernumerary diseases again the spirit of the nation that should take the lead in this great reform would insensibly become agricultural commerce with all its vice selfishness and corruption would gradually decline more natural habits would produce gentler manners and the excessive complication of political relations would be so far simplified that every individual might feel and understand why he loved his country and took a personal interest in its welfare how would england for example depend on the caprices of foreign rulers if she contained within herself all the necessaries and despised whatever they possessed of the luxuries of life how could they starve her into compliance with their views of what consequence would it be that they refused to take her woollen manufactures when large and fertile tracts of the island ceased to be allotted to the waste of pasturage on a natural system of diet we should require no spices from india no wines from portugal spain france or madeira none of those multitudinous articles of luxury for which every corner of the globe is rifled and which are the causes of so much individual rivalship such calamitous and sanguinary national disputes in the history of modern times the avarice of commercial monopoly no less than the ambition of weak and wicked chiefs seems to have fomented the universal discord to have added stubbornness to the mistakes of cabinets and indocility to the infatuation of the people let it ever be remembered that it is the direct influence of commerce to make the interval between the richest and the poorest man wider and more unconquerable let it be remembered that it is a foe to everything of real worth and excellence in the human character the odious and disgusting aristocracy of wealth is built upon the ruins of all that is good in chivalry or republicanism and luxury is the forerunner of a barbarism scarce capable of cure is it impossible to realize a state of society where all the energies of man shall be directed to the production of his solid happiness certainly if this advantage the object of all political speculation be in any degree attainable it is attainable only by a community which holds out no factitious incentives to the avarice and ambition of the few and which is internally organized for the liberty security and comfort of the many none must be entrusted with power and money is the completest species of power who do not stand pledged to use it exclusively for the general benefit but the use of animal flesh and fermented liquors directly militates with this equality of the rights of man the peasant cannot gratify these fashionable cravings without leaving his family to starve without disease and war those sweeping curtailers of population pasturage would include a waste too great to be afforded the labour requisite to support a family is far lighter than is usually supposed it has come under the authors experience that some of the workmen on an embankment in north wales who in consequence of the inability of the proprietor to pay them seldom received their wages have supported large families by cultivating small spots of sterile ground by moonlight in the notes to pratts poem bread or the poor is an account of an industrious labourer who by working in a small garden before and after his days task attained to an enviable state of independence the peasantry work not only for themselves but for the aristocracy the army and the manufacturers  the advantage of a reform in diet is obviously greater than that of any other it strikes at the root of the evil to remedy the abuses of legislation before we annihilate the propensities by which they are produced is to suppose that by taking away the effect the cause will cease to operate but the efficacy of this system depends entirely on the proselytism of individuals and grounds its merits as a benefit to the community upon the total change of the dietetic habits in its members it proceeds securely from a number of particular cases to one that is universal and has this advantage over the contrary mode that one error does not invalidate all that has gone before  let not too much however be expected from this system the healthiest among us is not exempt from hereditary disease the most symmetrical athletic and longlived is a being inexpressibly inferior to what he would have been had not the unnatural habits of his ancestors accumulated for him a certain portion of malady and deformity in the most perfect specimen of civilized man something is still found wanting by the physiological critic can a return to nature then instantaneously eradicate predispositions that have been slowly taking root in the silence of innumerable agesindubitably not all that i contend for is that from the moment of the relinquishing all unnatural habits no new disease is generated and that the predisposition to hereditary maladies gradually perishes for want of its accustomed supply in cases of consumption cancer gout asthma and scrofula such is the invariable tendency of a diet of vegetables and pure water  those who may be induced by these remarks to give the vegetable system a fair trial should in the first place date the commencement of their practice from the moment of their conviction all depends upon breaking through a pernicious habit resolutely and at once dr trotter asserts that no drunkard was ever reformed by gradually relinquishing his dram see trotter on the nervous temperament animal flesh in its effects on the human stomach is analogous to a dram it is similar in the kind though differing in the degree of its operation the proselyte to a pure diet must be warned to expect a temporary diminution of muscular strength the subtraction of a powerful stimulus will suffice to account for this event but it is only temporary and is succeeded by an equable capability for exertion far surpassing his former various and fluctuating strength above all he will acquire an easiness of breathing by which such exertion is performed with a remarkable exemption from that painful and difficult panting now felt by almost every one after hastily climbing an ordinary mountain he will be equally capable of bodily exertion or mental application after as before his simple meal he will feel none of the narcotic effects of ordinary diet irritability the direct consequence of exhausting stimuli would yield to the power of natural and tranquil impulses he will no longer pine under the lethargy of ennui that unconquerable weariness of life more to be dreaded than death itself he will escape the epidemic madness which broods over its own injurious notions of the deity and realizes the hell that priests and beldams feign every man forms as it were his god from his own character to the divinity of one of simple habits no offering would be more acceptable than the happiness of his creatures he would be incapable of hating or persecuting others for the love of god he will find moreover a system of simple diet to be a system of perfect epicurism he will no longer be incessantly occupied in blunting and destroying those organs from which he expects his gratification the pleasures of taste to be derived from a dinner of potatoes beans peas turnips lettuces with a dessert of apples gooseberries strawberries currants raspberries and in winter oranges apples and pears is far greater than is supposed these who wait until they can eat this plain fare with the sauce of appetite will scarcely join with the hypocritical sensualist at a lordmayors feast who declaims against the pleasures of the table solomon kept a thousand concubines and owned in despair that all was vanity the man whose happiness is constituted by the society of one amiable woman would find some difficulty in sympathizing with the disappointment of this venerable debauchee  i address myself not only to the young enthusiast the ardent devotee of truth and virtue the pure and passionate moralist yet unvitiated by the contagion of the world he will embrace a pure system from its abstract truth its beauty its simplicity and its promise of wideextended benefit unless custom has turned poison into food he will hate the brutal pleasures of the chase by instinct it will be a contemplation full of horror and disappointment to his mind that beings capable of the gentlest and most admirable sympathies should take delight in the deathpangs and last convulsions of dying animals the elderly man whose youth has been poisoned by intemperance or who has lived with apparent moderation and is afflicted with a wide variety of painful maladies would find his account in a beneficial change produced without the risk of poisonous medicines the mother to whom the perpetual restlessness of disease and unaccountable deaths incident to her children are the causes of incurable unhappiness would on this diet experience the satisfaction of beholding their perpetual healths and natural playfulness see mr newtons book his children are the most beautiful and healthy creatures it is possible to conceive the girls are perfect models for a sculptor their dispositions are also the most

published it when it was written he had come to the decision that he was too young to be a judge of controversies and he was desirous of acquiring that sobriety of spirit which is the characteristic of true heroism but he never doubted the truth or utility of his opinions and in printing and privately distributing queen mab he believed that he should further their dissemination without occasioning the mischief either to others or himself that might arise from publication it is doubtful whether he would himself have admitted it into a collection of his works his severe classical taste refined by the constant study of the greek poets might have discovered defects that escape the ordinary reader and the change his opinions underwent in many points would have prevented him from putting forth the speculations of his boyish days but the poem is too beautiful in itself and far too remarkable as the production of a boy of eighteen to allow of its being passed over besides that having been frequently reprinted the omission would be vain in the former edition certain portions were left out as shocking the general reader from the violence of their attack on religion i myself had a painful feeling that such erasures might be looked upon as a mark of disrespect towards the author and am glad to have the opportunity of restoring them the notes also are reprinted entirenot because they are models of reasoning or lessons of truth but because shelley wrote them and that all that a man at once so distinguished and so excellent ever did deserves to be preserved the alterations his opinions underwent ought to be recorded for they form his history  a series of articles was published in the new monthly magazine during the autumn of the year 1832 written by a man of great talent a fellowcollegian and warm friend of shelley they describe admirably the state of his mind during his collegiate life inspired with ardour for the acquisition of knowledge endowed with the keenest sensibility and with the fortitude of a martyr shelley came among his fellowcreatures congregated for the purposes of education like a spirit from another sphere too delicately organized for the rough treatment man uses towards man especially in the season of youth and too resolute in carrying out his own sense of good and justice not to become a victim to a devoted attachment to those he loved he added a determined resistance to oppression refusing to fag at eton he was treated with revolting cruelty by masters and boys this roused instead of taming his spirit and he rejected the duty of obedience when it was enforced by menaces and punishment to aversion to the society of his fellowcreatures such as he found them when collected together in societies where one egged on the other to acts of tyranny was joined the deepest sympathy and compassion while the attachment he felt for individuals and the admiration with which he regarded their powers and their virtues led him to entertain a high opinion of the perfectibility of human nature and he believed that all could reach the highest grade of moral improvement did not the customs and prejudices of society foster evil passions and excuse evil actions  the oppression which trembling at every nerve yet resolute to heroism it was his illfortune to encounter at school and at college led him to dissent in all things from those whose arguments were blows whose faith appeared to engender blame and hatred during my existence he wrote to a friend in 1812 i have incessantly speculated thought and read his readings were not always well chosen among them were the works of the french philosophers as far as metaphysical argument went he temporarily became a convert at the same time it was the cardinal article of his faith that if men were but taught and induced to treat their fellows with love charity and equal rights this earth would realize paradise he looked upon religion as it is professed and above all practised as hostile instead of friendly to the cultivation of those virtues which would make men brothers  can this be wondered at at the age of seventeen fragile in health and frame of the purest habits in morals full of devoted generosity and universal kindness glowing with ardour to attain wisdom resolved at every personal sacrifice to do right burning with a desire for affection and sympathyhe was treated as a reprobate cast forth as a criminal  the cause was that he was sincere that he believed the opinions which he entertained to be true and he loved truth with a martyrs love he was ready to sacrifice station and fortune and his dearest affections at its shrine the sacrifice was demanded from and made by a youth of seventeen it is a singular fact in the history of society in the civilized nations of modern times that no false step is so irretrievable as one made in early youth older men it is true when they oppose their fellows and transgress ordinary rules carry a certain prudence or hypocrisy as a shield along with them but youth is rash nor can it imagine while asserting what it believes to be true and doing what it believes to be right that it should be denounced as vicious and pursued as a criminal  shelley possessed a quality of mind which experience has shown me to be of the rarest occurrence among human beings this was his unworldliness the usual motives that rule men prospects of present or future advantage the rank and fortune of those around the taunts and censures or the praise of those who were hostile to him had no influence whatever over his actions and apparently none over his thoughts it is difficult even to express the simplicity and directness of purpose that adorned him some few might be found in the history of mankind and some one at least among his own friends equally disinterested and scornful even to severe personal sacrifices of every baser motive but no one i believe ever joined this noble but passive virtue to equal active endeavours for the benefit of his friends and mankind in general and to equal power to produce the advantages he desired the worlds brightest gauds and its most solid advantages were of no worth in his eyes when compared to the cause of what he considered truth and the good of his fellowcreatures born in a position which to his inexperienced mind afforded the greatest facilities to practise the tenets he espoused he boldly declared the use he would make of fortune and station and enjoyed the belief that he should materially benefit his fellowcreatures by his actions while conscious of surpassing powers of reason and imagination it is not strange that he should even while so young have believed that his written thoughts would tend to disseminate opinions which he believed conducive to the happiness of the human race  if man were a creature devoid of passion he might have said and done all this with quietness but he was too enthusiastic and too full of hatred of all the ills he witnessed not to scorn danger various disappointments tortured but could not tame his soul the more enmity he met the more earnestly he became attached to his peculiar views and hostile to those of the men who persecuted him  he was animated to greater zeal by compassion for his fellowcreatures his sympathy was excited by the misery with which the world is burning he witnessed the sufferings of the poor and was aware of the evils of ignorance he desired to induce every rich man to despoil himself of superfluity and to create a brotherhood of property and service and was ready to be the first to lay down the advantages of his birth he was of too uncompromising a disposition to join any party he did not in his youth look forward to gradual improvement nay in those days of intolerance now almost forgotten it seemed as easy to look forward to the sort of millennium of freedom and brotherhood which he thought the proper state of mankind as to the present reign of moderation and improvement illhealth made him believe that his race would soon be run that a year or two was all he had of life he desired that these years should be useful and illustrious he saw in a fervent call on his fellowcreatures to share alike the blessings of the creation to love and serve each other the noblest work that life and time permitted him in this spirit he composed queen mab  he was a lover of the wonderful and wild in literature but had not fostered these tastes at their genuine sourcesthe romances and chivalry of the middle agesbut in the perusal of such german works as were current in those days under the influence of these he at the age of fifteen wrote two short prose romances of slender merit the sentiments and language were exaggerated the composition imitative and poor he wrote also a poem on the subject of ahasuerusbeing led to it by a german fragment he picked up dirty and torn in lincolns inn fields this fell afterwards into other hands and was considerably altered before it was printed our earlier english poetry was almost unknown to him the love and knowledge of nature developed by wordsworththe lofty melody and mysterious beauty of coleridges poetryand the wild fantastic machinery and gorgeous scenery adopted by southeycomposed his favourite reading the rhythm of queen mab was founded on that of thalaba and the first few lines bear a striking resemblance in spirit though not in idea to the opening of that poem his fertile imagination and ear tuned to the finest sense of harmony preserved him from imitation another of his favourite books was the poem of gebir by walter savage landor from his boyhood he had a wonderful facility of versification which he carried into another language and his latin schoolverses were composed with an ease and correctness that procured for him prizes and caused him to be resorted to by all his friends for help he was at the period of writing queen mab a great traveller within the limits of england scotland and ireland his time was spent among the loveliest scenes of these countries mountain and lake and forest were his home the phenomena of nature were his favourite study he loved to inquire into their causes and was addicted to pursuits of natural philosophy and chemistry as far as they could be carried on as an amusement these tastes gave truth and vivacity to his descriptions and warmed his soul with that deep admiration for the wonders of nature which constant association with her inspired  he never intended to publish queen mab as it stands but a few years after when printing alastor he extracted a small portion which he entitled the daemon of the world in this he changed somewhat the versification and made other alterations scarcely to be called improvements  some years after when in italy a bookseller published an edition of queen mab as it originally stood shelley was hastily written to by his friends under the idea that deeply injurious as the mere distribution of the poem had proved the publication might awaken fresh persecutions at the suggestion of these friends he wrote a letter on the subject printed in the examiner newspaperwith which i close this history of his earliest work  to the editor of the examiner  sir  having heard that a poem entitled queen mab has been surreptitiously published in london and that legal proceedings have been instituted against the publisher i request the favour of your insertion of the following explanation of the affair as it relates to me  a poem entitled queen mab was written by me at the age of eighteen i daresay in a sufficiently intemperate spiritbut even then was not intended for publication and a few copies only were struck off to be distributed among my personal friends i have not seen this production for several years i doubt not but that it is perfectly worthless in point of literary composition and that in all that concerns moral and political speculation as well as in the subtler discriminations of metaphysical and religious doctrine it is still more crude and immature i am a devoted enemy to religious political and domestic oppression and i regret this publication not so much from literary vanity as because i fear it is better fitted to injure than to serve the sacred cause of freedom i have directed my solicitor to apply to chancery for an injunction to restrain the sale but after the precedent of mr southeys wat tyler a poem written i believe at the same age and with the same unreflecting enthusiasm with little hope of success  whilst i exonerate myself from all share in having divulged opinions hostile to existing sanctions under the form whatever it may be which they assume in this poem it is scarcely necessary for me to protest against the system of inculcating the truth of christianity or the excellence of monarchy however true or however excellent they may be by such equivocal arguments as confiscation and imprisonment and invective and slander and the insolent violation of the most sacred ties of nature and society  sir  i am your obliged and obedient servant  percy b shelley  pisa june 22 1821     of the following pieces the original

wandering sprite whose shadowy restless form doth haunt the abbeys drear aisle this night  it saith it will not its wailing cease till that holy man come near                                       10 till he pour oer its grave the prayer of peace and sprinkle the hallowed tear  the canons horse is stout and strong the road is plain and fair but the canon slowly wends along                                    15 and his brow is gloomed with care  who is it thus late at the abbeygate sullen echoes the portal bell it sounds like the whispering voice of fate it sounds like a funeral knell                                      20  the canon his faltering knee thrice bowed and his frame was convulsed with fear when a voice was heard distinct and loud prepare for thy hour is near  he crosses his breast he mutters a prayer                          25 to heaven he lifts his eye he heeds not the abbots gazing stare nor the dark monks who murmured by  bareheaded he worships the sculptured saints that frown on the sacred walls                                      30 his face it grows palehe trembles he faints at the abbots feet he falls  and straight the fathers robe he kissed who cried grace dwells with thee the spirit will fade like the morning mist                          35 at your benedicite  now haste within the board is spread keen blows the air and cold the spectre sleeps in its earthy bed till st edmonds bell hath tolled                               40  yet rest your wearied limbs tonight youve journeyed many a mile tomorrow lay the wailing sprite that shrieks in the moonlight aisle  oh faint are my limbs and my bosom is cold                        45 yet tonight must the sprite be laid yet tonight when the hour of horrors told must i meet the wandering shade  nor food nor rest may now delay for hark the echoing pile                                          50 a bell loud shakesoh haste away o lead to the haunted aisle  the torches slowly move before the cross is raised on high a smile of peace the canon wore                                     55 but horror dimmed his eye  and now they climb the footworn stair the chapel gates unclose now each breathed low a fervent prayer and fear each bosom froze                                          60  now paused awhile the doubtful band and viewed the solemn scene full dark the clustered columns stand the moon gleams pale between  say father say what cloisters gloom                              65 conceals the unquiet shade within what dark unhallowed tomb the corse unblessed was laid  through yonder drear aisle alone it walks and murmurs a mournful plaint                                       70 of thee black canon it wildly talks and call on thy patron saint  the pilgrim this night with wondering eyes as he prayed at st edmonds shrine from a black marble tomb hath seen it rise                          75 and under yon arch recline  oh say upon that black marble tomb what memorial sad appears undistinguished it lies in the chancels gloom no memorial sad it bears                                          80  the canon his paternoster reads his rosary hung by his side now swift to the chancel doors he leads and untouched they open wide  resistless strange sounds his steps impel                          85 to approach to the black marble tomb oh enter black canon a whisper fell oh enter thy hour is come  he paused told his beads and the threshold passed oh horror the chancel doors close                                 90 a loud yell was borne on the rising blast and a deep dying groan arose  the monks in amazement shuddering stand they burst through the chancels gloom from st edmonds shrine lo a skeletons hand                     95 points to the black marble tomb  lo deeply engraved an inscription blood red in characters fresh and clear the guilty black canon of elmhams dead and his wife lies buried here                                      100  in elmhams tower he wedded a nun to st edmonds his bride he bore on this eve her noviciate here was begun and a monks gray weeds she wore  o deep was her conscience dyed with guilt                          105 remorse she full oft revealed her blood by the ruthless black canon was spilt and in death her lips he sealed  her spirit to penance this night was doomed till the canon atoned the deed                                     110 here together they now shall rest entombed till their bodies from dust are freed  hark a loud peal of thunder shakes the roof round the altar bright lightnings play speechless with horror the monks stand aloof                        115 and the storm dies sudden away  the inscription was gone a cross on the ground and a rosary shone through the gloom but never again was the canon there found or the ghost on the black marble tomb                               120   15 revenge  ah quit me not yet for the wind whistles shrill its blast wanders mournfully over the hill the

flashed on the ground               30 strange forms seemed to flitand howl tidings of fate as agnes advanced to the sepulchre gate  the youth struck the portalthe echoing sound was fearfully rolled midst the tombstones around the blue lightning gleamed oer the dark chapel spire               35 and tinged were the storm clouds with sulphurous fire  still they gazed on the tombstone where conrad reclined yet they shrank at the cold chilling blast of the wind when a strange silver brilliance pervaded the scene and a figure advancedtall in formfierce in mien                 40  a mantle encircled his shadowy form as light as a gossamer borne on the storm celestial terror sat throned in his gaze like the midnight pestiferous meteors blaze  spirit thy father adolphus was false false as

heath it is not the shade of a murdered man who has rushed uncalled to the throne of his god                    20 and howls in the pause of the eddying storm this voice is low cold hollow and chill

fierce bolts of avenging heaven pause as in fear to strike his head                               40 the meteors of midnight recoil from his figure yet the wildered peasant that oft passes by with wonder beholds the blue flash through his form and his voice though faint as the sighs of the dead the startled passenger shudders to hear                             45 more distinct than the thunders wildest roar then does the dragon who chained in the caverns to eternity curses the champion of erin moan and yell loud at the lone hour of midnight and twine his vast wreaths round the forms of the daemons           50 then in agony roll his deathswimming eyeballs though wildered by death yet never to die then he shakes from his skeleton folds the nightmares who shrieking in agony seek the couch of some fevered wretch who courts sleep in vain                     55 then the tombless ghosts of the guilty dead in horror pause on the fitful gale they float on the swell of the eddying tempest and scared seek the caves of gigantic where their thin forms pour unearthly sounds                         60 on the blast that sweets the breast of the lake and mingles its swell with the moonlight air     melody to a scene of former times  art thou indeed forever gone forever ever lost to me must this poor bosom beat alone or beat at all if not for thee ah why was love to mortals

judgement vainly strove                                15 to blot thee from my memory but which might never never be oh i appeal to that blest day when passions wildest ecstasy was coldness to the joys i knew                                     20 when every sorrow sunk away oh i had never lived before but now those blisses are no more and now i cease to live again i do not blame thee love ah

adorning he put on his sunday clothes  2 he drew on a boot to hide his hoof                                  5 he drew on a glove to hide his claw his horns were concealed by a bras chapeau and the devil went forth as natty a beau as bondstreet ever saw  3 he sate him down in london town                                    10 before earths morning ray with a favourite imp he began to chat on religion and scandal this and that until the dawn of day  4 and then to st jamess court he went                               15 and st pauls church he took on his way he was mighty thick with every saint though they were formal and he was gay  5 the devil was an agriculturist and as bad weeds quickly grow                                       20 in looking over his farm i wist he wouldnt find cause for woe  6 he peeped in each hole to each chamber stole his promising livestock to view grinning applause he just showed them his claws                    25 and they shrunk with affright from his ugly sight whose work they delighted to do  7 satan poked his red nose into crannies so small one would think that the innocents fair poor lambkins were just doing nothing at all                        30 but settling some dress or arranging some ball but the devil saw deeper there  8 a priest at whose elbow the devil during prayer sate familiarly side by side declared that if the tempter were there                            35 his presence he would not abide ah ah thought old nick thats a very stale trick for without the devil o favourite of evil in your carriage you would not ride  9 satan next saw a brainless king                                     40 whose house was as hot as his own many imps in attendance were there on the wing they flapped the pennon and twisted the sting close by the very throne  10 ah ah thought satan the pasture is good                          45 my cattle will here thrive better than others they dine on news of human blood they sup on the groans of the dying and dead and supperless never will go to bed which will make them fat as their brothers                          50  11 fat as the fiends that feed on blood fresh and warm from the fields of spain where ruin ploughs her gory way where the shoots of earth are nipped in the bud where hell is the victors prey                                     55 its glory the meed of the slain  12 fatas the deathbirds on erins shore that glutted themselves in her dearest gore and flitted round castlereagh when they snatched the patriots heart that his grasp               60 had torn from its widows maniac clasp and fled at the dawn of day  13 fatas the reptiles of the tomb that riot in corruptions spoil that fret their little hour in gloom                                65 and creep and live the while  14 fat as that princes maudlin brain which addled by some gilded toy tired gives his sweetmeat and again cries for it like a humoured boy                                   70  15 for he is fathis waistcoat gay when strained upon a levee day scarce meets across his princely paunch and pantaloons are like halfmoons upon each brawny haunch                                             75  16 how vast his stock of calf when plenty had filled his empty head and heart enough to satiate foplings twenty could make his pantaloon seams start  17 the devil who sometimes is called nature                          80 for men of power provides thus well whilst every change and every feature their great original can tell  18 satan saw a lawyer a viper slay that crawled up the leg of his table                                85 it reminded him most marvellously of the story of cain and abel  19 the wealthy yeoman as he wanders his fertile fields among and on his thriving cattle ponders                                  90 counts his sure gains and hums a song thus did the devil through earth walking hum low a hellish song  20 for they thrive well whose garb of gore is satans choicest livery                                          95 and they thrive well who from the poor have snatched the bread of penury and heap the houseless wanderers store on the rank pile of luxury  21 the bishops thrive though they are big                             100 the lawyers thrive though they are thin for every gown and every wig hides the safe thrift of hell within  22 thus pigs were never counted clean although they dine on finest corn                                   105 and cormorants are sinlike lean although they eat from night to morn  23 oh why is the father of hell in such glee as he grins from ear to ear why does he doff his clothes joyfully                               110 as he skips and prances and flaps his wing as he sidles leers and twirls his sting and dares as he is to appear  24 a statesman passedalone to him the devil dare his whole shape uncover                              115 to show each feature every limb secure of an unchanging lover  25 at this known sign a welcome sight the watchful demons sought their king and every fiend of the stygian night                                120 was in an instant on the wing  26 pale loyalty his guiltsteeled brow with wreaths of gory laurel crowned the hellhounds murder want and woe forever hungering flocked around                                   125 from spain had satan sought their food twas human woe and human blood  27 hark the earthquakes crash i hear kings turn pale and conquerors start ruffians tremble in their fear                                      130 for their satan doth depart  28 this day fiends give to revelry to celebrate their kings return and with delight its sire to see hells adamantine limits burn                                       135  29 but were the devils sight as keen as reasons penetrating eye his sulphurous majesty i ween would find but little cause for joy  30 for the sons of reason see                                           140 that ere fate consume the pole the false

is based upon that of the editio princeps or earliest issue wherever our text deviates verbally from this exemplar the word or words of the editio princeps will be found recorded in a footnote in like manner wherever the text of the poems first printed by mrs shelley in the posthumous poems of 1824 or the poetical works of 1839 is modified by manuscript authority or otherwise the reading of the earliest printed text has been subjoined in a footnote shelleys punctuationor what may be presumed to be hishas been retained save in the case of errors whether of the transcriber or the printer overlooked in the revision of the proofsheets and of a few places where the pointing though certainly or seemingly shelleys tends to obscure the sense or grammatical construction in the following notes the more important textual difficulties are briefly discussed and the readings embodied in the text of this edition it is hoped sufficiently justified an attempt has also been made to record the original punctuation where it is here departed from  1 the daemon of the world part 1  the following paragraph relating to this poem closes shelleys preface to alastor etc 1816the fragment entitled the daemon of the world is a detached part of a poem which the author does not intend for publication the metre in which it is composed is that of samson agonistes and the italian pastoral drama and may be considered as the natural measure into which poetical conceptions expressed in harmonious language necessarily fall  2 lines 56 112 184 288 the editor has added a comma at the end of these lines and a period for the comma of 1816 after by line 279  3 lines 167 168 the editio princeps has a comma after and line 167 and heaven line 168  1 the daemon of the world part 2  printed by mr

1816 1824 1839 have conduct here which forman and dowden retain the suggestion that shelley may have written deaths blue vaults line 216 need not in the face of the dark gate of death line 211 be seriously considered conduct must therefore be regarded as a fault in grammar that shelley actually wrote conduct is not impossible for his grammar is not seldom faulty see for instance revolt of islam dedication line 60 but it is most improbable that he would have committed a solecism so striking both to eye and ear rossetti and woodberry print conducts etc the final s is often a vanishing quantity in shelleys manuscripts or perhaps the compositors hand was misled by his eye which may have dropped on the words conduct to thy etc seven lines above  3 of wave ruining on wave etc line 327 for ruining the text of poetical works 1839 both editions has runningan overlooked misprint surely rather than a conjectural emendation for an example of ruining as an intransitive  falling in ruins

volume 1 page 413  1 the revolt of islam  the revised text 1818 of this poem is given here as being that which shelley actually published in order to reconvert the text of the revolt of islam into that of laon and cythna the reader must make the following alterations in the text at the end of the preface add  in the personal conduct of my hero and heroine there is one circumstance which was intended to startle the reader from the trance of ordinary life it was my object to break through the crust of those outworn opinions on which established institutions depend i have appealed therefore to the most universal of all feelings and have endeavoured to strengthen the moral sense by forbidding it to waste its energies in seeking to avoid actions which are only crimes of convention it is because there is so great a multitude of artificial vices that there are so few real virtues those feelings alone which are benevolent or malevolent are essentially good or bad the circumstance of which i speak was introduced however merely to accustom men to that charity and toleration which the exhibition of a practice widely differing from their own has a tendency to promote the sentiments connected with and characteristic of this circumstance have no personal reference to the writershelleys note nothing indeed can be more mischievous than many actions innocent in themselves which might bring down upon individuals the bigoted contempt and rage of the multitude  2 21 1 i had a little sister whose fair eyes  2 25 2 to love in human life this sister sweet  3 1 1 what thoughts had sway over my sisters slumber  3 1 3 as if they did ten thousand years outnumber  4 30 6 and left it vacanttwas her brothers face  5 47 5 i had a brother once but he is dead  6 24 8 my own sweet sister looked with joy did quail  6 31 6 the common blood which ran within our frames  6 39 69 with such close sympathies for to each other had high and solemn hopes the gentle might of earliest love and all the thoughts which smother cold evils power now linked a sister and a brother  6 40 1 and such is natures modesty that those  8 4 9 dream ye that god thus builds for man in solitude  8 5 1 what then is god ye mock yourselves and give  8 6 1 what then is god some moonstruck sophist stood  8 6 8 9 and that men say god has appointed death on all who scorn his will to wreak immortal wrath  8 7 14 men say they have seen god and heard from god or known from others who have known such things and that his will is all our law a rod to scourge us into slavesthat priests and kings  8 8 1 and it is said that god will punish wrong  8 8 3 4 and his red hells undying snakes among will bind the wretch on whom he fixed a stain  8 13 3 4 for it is said god rules both high and low and man is made the captive of his brother  9 13 8 to curse the rebels to their god did they  9 14 6 by god and nature and necessity  9 15 the stanza contains ten lineslines 47 as follows there was one teacher and must ever be they said even god who the necessity of rule and wrong had armed against mankind his slave and his avenger there to be  9 18 36 and hell and awe which in the heart of man is god itself the priests its downfall knew as day by day their altars lovelier grew till they were left alone within the fane  10 22 9 on fire almighty god his hell on earth has spread  10 26 7 8 of their almighty god

god god thine hour is near  10 45 8 men brought their atheist kindred to appease  10 47 6 the threshold of gods throne and it was she  11 16 1 ye turn to god for aid in your distress  11 25 7 swear by

throne and cry o lord to thee did i betray an atheist but for me she would have known  12 29 4 in torment and in fire have atheists gone  12 30 4 how atheists and republicans can die  2 aught but a lifeless clod until revived by thee dedic 6 9  so rossetti the shelley editions 1818 and 1839 read clog which is retained by forman dowden and woodberry rossettis happy conjecture clod seems to forman a doubtful emendation as shelley may have used clog in its figurative sense of weight encumbrancehardly as here in a poetical figure that would be to use a metaphor within a metaphor shelley compares his heart to a concrete object if clog is right the word must be taken in one or other of its two recognized literal sensesa wooden shoe or a block of wood tied round the neck or to the leg of a horse or a dog again it is of others hearts not of his own that shelley here deplores the icy coldness and weight besides how could he appropriately describe his heart as a weight or encumbrance upon the free play of impulse and emotion seeing that for shelley above all men the heart was itself the main source and spring of all feeling and action that source he complains has been dried upits emotions desiccatedby the crushing impact of other hearts heavy hard and cold as stone his heart has become withered and barren like a lump of earth parched with frosta lifeless clod compare summer and winter lines 1115  it was a winter such as when birds die  in the deep forests and the fishes lie  stiffened in the translucent ice which makes  even the mud and slime of the warm lakes  a wrinkled clod as hard as brick etc etc  the word revived suits well with clod but what is a revived clog finally the first two lines of the following stanza 7 seem decisive in favour of roseettis word  if any one wonders how a misprint overlooked in 1818 could after twentyone years still remain undiscovered in 1839 let him consider the case of clog in lambs parody on southeys and coleridges dactyls lamb letter to coleridge july 1 1796  sorely your dactyls do drag along limpfooted  sad is the measure that hangs a clog round em so etc etc  here the misprint clod which in 1868 appeared in moxons edition of the letters of charles lamb has through five successive editions and under many editorsincluding fitzgerald ainger and macdonaldheld its ground even to the present day and this notwithstanding the preservation of the true reading clog in the texts of talfourd and carew hazlitt here then is the case of a palpable misprint surviving despite positive external evidence of its falsity over a period of thirtysix years  3 and walked as free etc ded 7 6  walked is one of shelleys occasional grammatical laxities forman well observes that walkedst the right word here would naturally seem to shelley more heinous than a breach of syntactic rule rossetti and after him dowden print walk forman and woodberry follow the early texts  4 1 9 17 here the text follows the punctuation of the editio princeps 1818 with two exceptions a comma is inserted 1 after scale line 201 on the authority of the bodleian manuscript locock and 2 after neck line 205 to indicate the true construction mrs shelleys text 1839 has a semicolon after plumes line 203 which rossetti adopts forman 1892 departs from the pointing of shelleys edition here placing a period at the close of line 199 and a dash after blended line 200  5 what life what power was etc 1 11 1 the editio princeps 1818 wants the commas here  6 and now we are embarkedthe mountains hang and frown over the starry deep that gleams below a vast and dim expanse as oer the waves we go 1 23 69 with woodberry i substitute after embarked 7 a dash for the comma of the editio princeps with rossetti i restore to below 8 a comma which i believe to have been overlooked by the printer of that edition shelleys meaning i take to be that a vast and dim expanse of mountain hangs frowning over the starry deep that gleams below it as we pass over the waves  7 as king and lord and god the conquering fiend did own1 28 9 so forman 1892 dowden the editio princeps has a full stop at the close of the linewhere according to mr locock no point appears in the bodleian manuscript  8 blackwinged demon forms etc 1 30 7 the bodleian manuscript exhibits the requisite hyphen here and in goldenpinioned 32 2  9 1 31 2 6 the threedots point employed by shelley to indicate a pause longer than that of a full stop is introduced into these two lines on the authority of the bodleian manuscript in both cases it replaces a dash in the editio princeps see list of punctual variations below mr locock reports the presence in the manuscript of what he justly terms a characteristic comma after soon 31 2  10 mine shook beneath the wide emotion 1 38 9 for emotion the bodleian manuscript has commotion locockperhaps the fitter word here  11 deep slumber fell on memy dreams were fire 1 40 1 the dash after fire is from the bodleian manuscriptwhere moreover the somewhat misleading but indubitably shelleyan comma after passion editio princeps 40 4 is wanting locock i have added a dash to the comma after cover 40 5 in order to clarify the sense  12 and shared in fearless deeds with evil men 1 44 4 with forman and dowden i substitute here a comma for the full stop of the editio princeps see also list of punctual variations below stanza 44  13 the spirit whom i loved in solitude sustained his child 1 45 4 5 the comma here important as marking the sense as well as the rhythm of the passage is derived from the bodleian manuscript locock  14 i looked and we were sailing pleasantly swift as a cloud between the sea and sky beneath the rising moon seen far away mountains of ice etc 1 47 47 the editio princeps has a comma after sky 5 and a semicolon after away 6a pointing followed by forman dowden and woodberry by transposing these points as in our text however a much better sense is obtained and luckily this better sense proves to be that yielded by the bodleian manuscript where mr locock reports there is a semicolon after sky 5 a comma after moon 6 and no point whatsoever after away 6  15 girt by the deserts of the universe 1 50 4 so the bodleian manuscript anticipated by woodberry 1893 rossetti 1870 had substituted a comma for the period of editio princeps  16 hymns which my soul had woven to freedom strong the source of passion whence they rose to be triumphant strains which etc 2 28 68 the editio princeps followed by forman has passion whence 7 mrs shelley poetical works 1839 both editions prints strong the source of passion whence they rose to be triumphant strains which etc  17 but pale were calm with passionthus subdued etc 2 49 6 with rossetti dowden woodberry i add a comma after but to the pointing of the editio princeps mrs shelley poetical works 1839 both editions prints but pale were calmwith passion thus subdued etc  18 methought that grate was lifted etc 3 25 1 shelleys and mrs shelleys editions have gate which is retained by forman but cf 3 14 2 7 dowden and woodberry follow rossetti in printing grate  19 where her own standard etc 4 24 5 so mrs shelley poetical works 1839 both editions  20 beneath whose spires which swayed in the red flame 5 54 6 shelleys and mrs shelleys editions 1818 1839 give red light herean oversight perpetuated by forman the rhymewords name 8 and frame 9 notwithstanding with rossetti dowden woodberry i print red flamean obvious emendation proposed by fleay  21 when the waves smile as sudden earthquakes light many a volcanoisle thus sudden unexpected feast was spread etc 6 7 8 9 8 1 with forman dowden woodberry i substitute after isle 7 9 a comma for the full stop of editions 1818 1839 retained by rossetti the passage is obscure perhaps shelley wrote lift many a volcanoisle the plain becomes studded in an instant with piles of corpses even as the smiling surface of the sea will sometimes become studded in an instant with many islands uplifted by a sudden shock of earthquake  22 7 7 26 the editio princeps punctuates thus and words it gave gestures and looks such as in whirlwinds bore which might not be withstood whence none could save all who approached their sphere like some calm wave vexed into whirlpools by the chasms beneath this punctuation is retained by forman rossetti dowden woodberry place a comma after gave 2 and gestures 3 andadopting the suggestion of mr ac bradleyenclose line 4 which mightcould save in parentheses thus construing which might not be withstood and whence none could save as adjectival clauses qualifying whirlwinds 3 and taking bore 3 as a transitive verb governing all who approached their sphere 5 this which i believe to be the true construction is perhaps indicated quite as clearly by the pointing adopted in the texta pointing moreover which on metrical grounds is i think preferable to that proposed by mr bradley i have added a dash to the comma after sphere 5 to indicate that it is cythna herself and not all who approached etc that resembles some calm wave etc  23 which dwell in lakes when the red moon on high pause ere it wakens tempest 7 22 6 7 here when the moon pause is clearly irregular but it appears in editions 1818 1839 and is undoubtedly shelleys phrase rossetti cites a conjectural emendation by a certain cd campbell mauritiuswhich the red moon on high pours eve it wakens tempest but cf julian and maddalo lines 53 54 meanwhile the sun paused ere it should alight over the horizon of the mountains and prince athanase lines 220 221 when the curved moon then lingering in the west paused in yon waves her mighty horns to wet etc  24 time imparted such power to mei became fearlesshearted etc 7 30 4 5 with woodberry i replace with a dash the comma editio princeps after me 5retained by forman deleted by rossetti and dowden shelleys and formans punctuation leaves the construction ambiguous with woodberrys the two clauses are seen to be parallelthe latter being appositive to and explanatory of the former while with dowdens the clauses are placed in correlation time imparted such power to me that i became fearlesshearted  25 of love in that lorn solitude etc 7 32 7 all editions prior to 1876 have lone solitude etc the important emendation lorn was first introduced into the text by forman from shelleys revised copy of laon and cythna where lone is found to be turned into lorn by the poets own hand  26 and hate is throned on high with fear her mother etc 8 13 5 so the editio princeps forman dowden woodberry following the text of laon and cythna 1818 read fear his mother forman refers to 10 42 4 5 where fear figures as a female and hate as her mate and foe but consistency in such matters was not one of shelleys characteristics and there seems to be no need for alteration here mrs shelley 1839 and rossetti follow the editio princeps  27 the ship fled fast till the stars gan to fail and round me gathered etc 8 26 5 6 the editio princeps has no comma after and 6 mrs shelley 1839 places a full stop at fail 5 and reads all round me gathered etc  28 words which the lore of truth in hues of flame etc 9 12 6 the editio princeps

the close of the line  rosalind and helen  1 a sound from there etc line 63 rossettis cj there for thee is adopted by all modern editors  2 and down my cheeks the quick tears fell etc line 366 the word fell is rossettis cj to rhyme with tell line 369 for ran 1819 1839  3 lines 405409 the syntax here does not hang together and shelley may have been thinking of this passage amongst others when on september 6 1819 he wrote to ollierin the rosalind and helen i see there are some few errors which are so much the worse because they are errors in the sense the obscurity however may have been in part at least designed rosalind grows incoherent before breaking off abruptly no satisfactory emendation has been proposed  4 where weary meteor lamps repose etc line 551 with woodberry i regard where his cj for when 1819 1839 as necessary for the sense  5 with which they drag from mines of gore etc line 711 rossetti proposes yore for gore here or as an alternative rivers of gore etc if yore be

does not print it  7 lines 10931096 the editio princeps 1819 punctuates hung in dense flocks beneath the dome that ivory dome whose azure night with golden stars like heaven was bright oer the split cedars pointed flame  8 lines 11681170 sunk line 1170 must be taken as a transitive in this passage the grammar of which is defended by mr swinburne  9 whilst animal life many long years had rescue from a chasm of tears lines 12089 forman substitutes rescue for rescued 1819 1839a highly probable cj adopted by dowden but rejected by woodberry the sense is whilst my life surviving by the physical

with sunlike lightenings 4 276 the editio princeps 1820 reads lightnings for which rossetti substitutes lighteningsa conjecture described by forman as an example of how a very slight change may

line 1093 is wanting in the editio princeps 1822 its place being supplied by asterisks the lacuna in the text is due no doubt to the timidity of ollier the publisher whom shelley had authorised to

by himself the bracketed words are presumably supplied by mr rossetti to fill actual lacunae in the manuscript those queried represent indistinct writing mr rossettis additions to the text are indicated in the footnotes in one or two instances mr forman and dr garnett have restored the true reading the list of dramatis personae is mr formans  the triumph of life  1 lines 131135 this grammatically incoherent passage is thus conjecturally emended by rossetti fled back like eagles to their native noon for those who put aside the diadem of earthly thrones or gems whether of athens or jerusalem were neither mid the mighty captives seen etc in the case of an incomplete poem lacking the authors final corrections however restoration by conjecture is to say the least of it gratuitous  2 line 282 the words even as the deeds of others not as theirs and thenare wanting in editions 1824 1839 and were recovered by dr garnett from the boscombe manuscript mrs shelleys note here runsthere is a chasm here in the manuscript which it is impossible to fill it appears from the context that other shapes pass and that rousseau still stood beside the dreamer mr forman thinks that the chasm is filled up by the words restored from the manuscript by dr garnett mr ac bradley writes it seems likely that after writing i have sufferedpain shelley meant to strike out the words between known 276 and i 278 and to fill up the gap in such a way that i would be the last word of the line beginning may well be known  miscellaneous poems  1 to  mrs shelley tentatively assigned this fragment to 1817 it seems not improbable that it was addressed at this time june 1814 to mary godwin dowden life 1 422 woodberry suggests that harriet answers as well or better to the situation described  2 on death these stanzas occur in the esdaile manuscript along with others which shelley intended to print with queen mab in 1813 but the text was revised before publication in 1816  3 to  the poem beginning oh there are spirits in the air was addressed in idea to coleridge whom he never knewwrites mrs shelley mr bertram dobell mr rossetti and professor dowden however incline to think that we have here an address by shelley in a despondent mood to his own spirit  4 lines these appear to be antedated by a year as they evidently allude to the death of harriet shelley in november 1816  5 another fragment to music to mr forman we owe the restoration of the true text herefood of love mrs shelley printed god of love  6 marenghi lines 92 93 the 1870 rossetti version of these lines is white bones and locks of dun and yellow hair and ringed horns which buffaloes did wear the words locks of dun line 92 are cancelled in the manuscript shelleys failure to cancel the whole line was due mr locock rightly argues to inadvertence merely instead of buffaloes the manuscript gives the buffalo and it supplies the wonderful line locock which closes the stanza in our text and with which mr locock aptly compares mont blanc line 69 save when the eagle brings some hunters bone and the wolf tracks her there  7 ode to liberty lines 1 2 on the suggestion of his brother mr alfred forman the editor of the library edition of shelleys poems 1876 mr buxton forman printed these lines as follows a glorious people vibrated again the lightning of the nations liberty from heart to heart etc the testimony of shelleys autograph in the harvard college manuscript however is final against such a punctuation  8 lines 41 42 we follow mrs shelleys punctuation 1839 in shelleys edition 1820 there is no stop at the end of line 41 and a semicolon closes line 42  9 ode to naples in mrs shelleys editions the various sections of this ode are severally headed as followsepode 1 alpha epode 2 alpha strophe alpha 1 strophe beta 2 antistrophe alpha gamma antistrophe beta gamma antistrophe beta gamma antistrophe alpha gamma epode 1 gamma epode 2 gamma in the manuscript mr locock tells us the headings are very doubtful many of them being vaguely altered with pen and pencil shelley evidently hesitated between two or three alternative ways of indicating the structure and corresponding parts of his elaborate song hence the chaotic jumble of headings printed in editions 1824 1839 so far as the epodes are concerned the headings in this edition are those of editions 1824 1839 which may be taken as supported by the manuscript locock as to the remaining sections mr lococks examination of the manuscript leads him to conclude that shelleys final choice wasstrophe 1 strophe 2 antistrophe 1 antistrophe 2 antistrophe 1 alpha antistrophe 2 alpha this in itself would be perfectly appropriate but it would be inconsistent with the method employed in designating the epodes i have therefore adopted in preference a scheme which if it lacks manuscript authority in some particulars has at least the merit of being absolutely logical and consistent throughout  mr locock has some interesting remarks on the metrical features of this complex ode on the 10th line of antistrophe 1a line 86 of the odeaghast she pass from the earths diskwhich exceeds by one foot the 10th lines of the two corresponding divisions strophe 1 and antistrophe 1b he observes happily enough that aghast may well have been intended to disappear mr locock does not seem to notice that the closing lines of these three answering sections1 hail hail all hail2 thou shalt be greatall hail3 art thou of all these hopeso hail increase by regular lengthstwo three four iambi nor does he seem quite to grasp shelleys intention with regard to the rhyme scheme of the other triple group strophe 2 antistrophe 2a antistrophe 2b that of strophe 2 may be thus expressedaabc ddbc acd bc between this and antistrophe 2a the second member of the group there is a general correspondence with in one particular a subtle modification the scheme now becomes aabc ddbc acb dc ie the rhymes of lines 9 and 10 are transposedgod line 9 answering to the halfway rhymes of lines 3 and 6 gawd and unawed instead of as in strophe 2 to the rhymeendings of lines 4 and 5 and vice versa fate line 10 answering to desolate and state lines 4 and 5 instead of to the halfway rhymes aforesaid as to antistrophe 2b that follows antistrophe 2a so far as it goes but after line 9 it breaks off suddenly and closes with two lines corresponding in length and rhyme to the closing couplet of antistrophe 1b the section immediately preceding which however belongs not to this group but to the other mr locock speaks of line 124 as a rhymeless line rhymeless it is not for shore its rhymetermination answers to bower and power the halfway rhymes of lines 118 and 121 respectively why mr locock should call line 12 an unmetrical line i cannot see it is a decasyllabic line with a trochee substituted for an iambus in the third footaround  me gleamed  many a  bright se  pulchre  10 the tower of famineit is doubtful whether the following note is shelleys

rose that drinks the fountain dew  the rude wind is singing  the season was the childhood of sweet june  the serpent is shut out from paradise  the sleepless hours who watch me as i lie  the spider spreads her webs whether she be  the starlight smile of children the sweet looks  the stars may dissolve and the fountain of light  the sun is set the swallows are asleep  the sun is warm the sky is clear  the sun makes music as of old  the transport of a fierce and monstrous gladness  the viewless and invisible consequence  the voice of the spirits of air and of earth  the warm sun is failing
