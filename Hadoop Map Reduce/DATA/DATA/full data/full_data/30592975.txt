loughshane   dr finn of killaloe in county clare was as well known in those partsthe confines that is of the counties clare limerick tipperary and galwayas was the bishop himself who lived in the same town and was as much respected many said that the doctor was the richer man of the two and the practice of his profession was extended over almost as wide a district indeed the bishop whom he was privileged to attend although a roman catholic always spoke of their dioceses being conterminate it will therefore be understood that dr finnmalachi finn was his full namehad obtained a wide reputation as a country practitioner in the west of ireland and he was a man sufficiently well to do though that boast made by his friends that he was as warm a man as the bishop had but little truth to support it bishops in ireland if they live at home even in these days are very warm men and dr finn had not a penny in the world for which he had not worked hard he had moreover a costly family five daughters and one son and at the time of which we are speaking no provision in the way of marriage or profession had been made for any of them of the one son phineas the hero of the following pages the mother and five sisters were very proud the doctor was accustomed to say that his goose was as good as any other mans goose as far as he could see as yet but that he should like some very strong evidence before he allowed himself to express an opinion that the young bird partook in any degree of the qualities of a swan from which it may be gathered that dr finn was a man of commonsense  phineas had come to be a swan in the estimation of his mother and sisters by reason of certain early successes at college his father whose religion was not of that bitter kind in which we in england are apt to suppose that all the irish roman catholics indulge had sent his son to trinity and there were some in the neighbourhood of killaloepatients probably of dr duggin of castle connell a learned physician who had spent a fruitless life in endeavouring to make head against dr finnwho declared that old finn would not be sorry if his son were to turn protestant and go in for a fellowship mrs finn was a protestant and the five miss finns were protestants and the doctor himself was very much given to dining out among his protestant friends on a friday our phineas however did not turn protestant up in dublin whatever his fathers secret wishes on that subject may have been he did join a debating society to success in which his religion was no bar and he there achieved a sort of distinction which was both easy and pleasant and which making its way down to killaloe assisted in engendering those ideas as to swanhood of which maternal and sisterly minds are so sweetly susceptible i know half a dozen old windbags at the present moment said the doctor who were great fellows at debating clubs when they were boys phineas is not a boy any longer said mrs finn and windbags dont get college scholarships said matilda finn the second daughter but papa always snubs phinny said barbara the youngest ill snub you if you dont take care said the doctor taking barbara tenderly by the earfor his youngest daughter was the doctors pet  the doctor certainly did not snub his son for he allowed him to go over to london when he was twentytwo years of age in order that he might read with an english barrister it was the doctors wish that his son might be called to the irish bar and the young mans desire that he might go to the english bar the doctor so far gave way under the influence of phineas himself and of all the young women of the family as to pay the usual fee to a very competent and learned gentleman in the middle temple and to allow his son one hundred and fifty pounds per annum for three years dr finn however was still firm in his intention that his son should settle in dublin and take the munster circuitbelieving that phineas might come to want home influences and home connections in spite of the swanhood which was attributed to him  phineas sat his terms for three years and was duly called to the bar but no evidence came home as to the acquirement of any considerable amount of law lore or even as to much law study on the part of the young aspirant the learned pundit at whose feet he had been sitting was not especially loud in praise of his pupils industry though he did say a pleasant word or two as to his pupils intelligence phineas himself did not boast much of his own hard work when at home during the long vacation no rumours of expected successesof expected professional successesreached the ears of any of the finn family at killaloe but nevertheless there came tidings which maintained those high ideas in the maternal bosom of which mention has been made and which were of sufficient strength to induce the doctor in opposition to his own judgment to consent to the continued residence of his son in london phineas belonged to an excellent clubthe reform cluband went into very good society he was hand in glove with the hon laurence fitzgibbon the youngest son of lord claddagh he was intimate with barrington erle who had been private secretaryone of the private secretariesto the great whig prime minister who was lately in but was now out he had dined three or four times with that great whig nobleman the earl of brentford and he had been assured that if he stuck to the english bar he would certainly do well though he might fail to succeed in court or in chambers he would doubtless have given to him some one of those numerous appointments for which none but clever young barristers are supposed to be fitting candidates the old doctor yielded for another year although at the end of the second year he was called upon to pay a sum of three hundred pounds which was then due by phineas to creditors in london when the doctors male friends in and about killaloe heard that he had done so they said that he was doting not one of the miss finns was as yet married and after all that had been said about the doctors wealth it was supposed that there would not be above five hundred pounds a year among them all were he to give up his profession but the doctor when he paid that three hundred pounds for his son buckled to his work again though he had for twelve months talked of giving up the midwifery he buckled to again to the great disgust of dr duggin who at this time said very illnatured things about young phineas  at the end of the three years phineas was called to the bar and immediately received a letter from his father asking minutely as to his professional intentions his father recommended him to settle in dublin and promised the one hundred and fifty pounds for three more years on condition that this advice was followed he did not absolutely say that the allowance would be stopped if the advice were not followed but that was plainly to be implied that letter came at the moment of a dissolution of parliament lord de terrier the conservative prime minister who had now been in office for the almost unprecedentedly long period of fifteen months had found that he could not face continued majorities against him in the house of commons and had dissolved the house rumour declared that he would have much preferred to resign and betake himself once again to the easy glories of opposition but his party had naturally been obdurate with him and he had resolved to appeal to the country when phineas received his fathers letter it had just been suggested to him at the reform club that he should stand for the irish borough of loughshane  this proposition had taken phineas finn so much by surprise that when first made to him by barrington erle it took his breath away what he stand for parliament twentyfour years old with no vestige of property belonging to him without a penny in his purse as completely dependent on his father as he was when he first went to school at eleven years of age and for loughshane a little borough in the county galway for which a brother of that fine old irish peer the earl of tulla had been sitting for the last twenty yearsa fine highminded representative of the thoroughgoing orange protestant feeling of ireland and the earl of tulla to whom almost all loughshane belongedor at any rate the land about loughshanewas one of his fathers staunchest friends loughshane is in county galway but the earl of tulla usually lived at his seat in county clare not more than ten miles from killaloe and always confided his gouty feet and the weak nerves of the old countess and the stomachs of all his domestics to the care of dr finn how was it possible that phineas should stand for loughshane from whence was the money to come for such a contest it was a beautiful dream a grand idea lifting phineas almost off the earth by its glory when the proposition was first made to him in the smokingroom at the reform club by his friend erle he was aware that he blushed like a girl and that he was unable at the moment to express himself plainlyso great was his astonishment and so great his gratification but before ten minutes had passed by while barrington erle was still sitting over his shoulder on the club sofa and before the blushes had altogether vanished he had seen the improbability of the scheme and had explained to his friend that the thing could not be done but to his increased astonishment his friend made nothing of the difficulties loughshane according to barrington erle was so small a place that the expense would be very little there were altogether no more than 307 registered electors the inhabitants were so far removed from the world and were so ignorant of the worlds good things that they knew nothing about bribery the hon george morris who had sat for the last twenty years was very unpopular he had not been near the borough since the last election he had hardly done more than show himself in parliament and had neither given a shilling in the town nor got a place under government for a single son of loughshane and he has quarrelled with his brother said barrington erle the devil he has said phineas i thought they always swore by each other its at each other they swear now said barrington george has asked the earl for more money and the earl has cut up rusty then the negotiator went on to explain that the expenses of the election would be defrayed out of a certain fund collected for such purposes that loughshane had been chosen as a cheap place and that phineas finn had been chosen as a safe and promising young man as for qualification if any question were raised that should be made all right an irish candidate was wanted and a roman catholic so much the loughshaners would require on their own account when instigated to dismiss from their service that thoroughgoing protestant the hon george morris then the partyby which barrington erle probably meant the great man in whose service he himself had become a politicianrequired that the candidate should be a safe man one who would support the partynot a cantankerous redhot semifenian running about to meetings at the rotunda and suchlike with views of his own about tenantright and the irish church but i have views of my own said phineas blushing again of course you have my dear boy said barrington clapping him on the back i shouldnt come to you unless you had views but your views and ours are the same and youre just the lad for galway you mightnt have such an opening again in your life and of course youll stand for loughshane then the conversation was over the private secretary went away to arrange some other little matter of the kind and phineas finn was left alone to consider the proposition that had been made to him  to become a member of the british parliament in all those hot contests at the two debating clubs to which he had belonged this had been the ambition which had moved him for after all to what purpose of their own had those empty debates ever tended he and three or four others who had called themselves liberals had been pitted against four or five who had called themselves conservatives and night after night they had discussed some ponderous subject without any idea that one would ever persuade another or that their talking would ever conduce to any action or to any result but each of these combatants had feltwithout daring to announce a hope on the subject among themselvesthat the present arena was only a trialground for some possible greater amphitheatre for some future debating club in which debates would lead to action and in which eloquence would have power even though persuasion might be out of the question  phineas certainly had never dared to speak even to himself of such a hope the labours of the bar had to be encountered before the dawn of such a hope could come to him and he had gradually learned to feel that his prospects at the bar were not as yet very promising as regarded professional work he had been idle and how then could he have a hope  and now this thing which he regarded as being of all things in the world the most honourable had come to him all at once and was possibly within his reach if he could believe barrington erle he had only to lift up his hand and he might be in parliament within two months and who was to be believed on such a subject if not barrington erle this was erles special business and such a man would not have come to him on such a subject had he not been in earnest and had he not himself believed in success there was an opening ready an opening to this great gloryif only it might be possible for him to fill it  what would his father say his father would of course oppose the plan and if he opposed his father his father would of course stop his income and such an income as it was could it be that a man should sit in parliament and live upon a hundred and fifty pounds a year since that payment of his debts he had become again embarrassedto a slight amount he owed a tailor a trifle and a bootmaker a trifleand something to the man who sold gloves and shirts and yet he had done his best to keep out of debt with more than irish pertinacity living very closely breakfasting upon tea and a roll and dining frequently for a shilling at a luncheonhouse up a court near lincolns inn where should he dine if the loughshaners elected him to parliament and then he painted to himself a not untrue picture of the probable miseries of a man who begins life too high up on the ladderwho succeeds in mounting before he has learned how to hold on when he is aloft for our phineas finn was a young man not without sensenot entirely a windbag if he did this thing the probability was that he might become utterly a castaway and go entirely to the dogs before he was thirty he had heard of penniless men who had got into parliament and to whom had come such a fate he was able to name to himself a man or two whose barks carrying more sail than they could bear had gone to pieces among early breakers in this way but then would it not be better to go to pieces early than never to carry any sail at all and there was at any rate the chance of success he was already a barrister and there were so many things open to a barrister with a seat in parliament and as he knew of men who had been utterly ruined by such early mounting so also did he know of others whose fortunes had been made by happy audacity when they were young he almost thought that he could die happy if he had once taken his seat in parliamentif he had received one letter with those grand initials written after his name on the address young men in battle are called upon to lead forlorn hopes three fall perhaps to one who gets through but the one who gets through will have the victoria cross to carry for the rest of his life this was his forlorn hope and as he had been invited to undertake the work he would not turn from the danger on the following morning he again saw barrington erle by appointment and then wrote the following letter to his father      reform club feb 186     my dear father     i am afraid that the purport of this letter will startle    you but i hope that when you have finished it you will    think that i am right in my decision as to what i am going    to do you are no doubt aware that the dissolution of    parliament will take place at once and that we shall be    in all the turmoil of a general election by the middle of    march i have been invited to stand for loughshane and    have consented the proposition has been made to me by my    friend barrington erle mr mildmays private secretary    and has been made on behalf of the political committee of    the reform club i need hardly say that i should not have    thought of such a thing with a less thorough promise of    support than this gives me nor should i think of it now    had i not been assured that none of the expense of the    election would fall upon me of course i could not have    asked you to pay for it     but to such a proposition so made i have felt that it    would be cowardly to give a refusal i cannot but regard    such a selection as a great honour i own that i am fond    of politics and have taken great delight in their study    stupid young fool his father said to himself as he    read thisand it has been my dream for years past to    have a seat in parliament at some future time dream    yes i wonder whether he has ever dreamed what he is to    live upon the chance has now come to me much earlier    than i have looked for it but i do not think that it    should on that account be thrown away looking to my    profession i find that many things are open to a    barrister with a seat in parliament and that the house    need not interfere much with a mans practice not if    he has got to the top of his tree said the doctor     my chief doubt arose from the fact of your old friendship    with lord tulla whose brother has filled the seat for i    dont know how many years but it seems that george morris    must go or at least that he must be opposed by a    liberal candidate if i do not stand some one else will    and i should think that lord tulla will be too much of a    man to make any personal quarrel on such a subject if he    is to lose the borough why should not i have it as well    as another     i can fancy my dear father all that you will say as to    my imprudence and i quite confess that i have not a word    to answer i have told myself more than once since last    night that i shall probably ruin myself i wonder    whether he has ever told himself that he will probably    ruin me also said the doctor but i am prepared to ruin    myself in such a cause i have no one dependent on me    and as long as i do nothing to disgrace my name i may    dispose of myself as i please if you decide on stopping    my allowance i shall have no feeling of anger against    you how very considerate said the doctor and in    that case i shall endeavour to support myself by my pen    i have already done a little for the magazines     give my best love to my mother and sisters if you will    receive me during the time of the election i shall see    them soon perhaps it will be best for me to say that i    have positively decided on making the attempt that is to    say if the club committee is as good as its promise i    have weighed the matter all round and i regard the prize    as being so great that i am prepared to run any risk to    obtain it indeed to me with my views about politics    the running of such a risk is no more than a duty i    cannot keep my hand from the work now that the work has    come in the way of my hand i shall be most anxious to get    a line from you in answer to this     your most affectionate son     phineas finn   i question whether dr finn when he read this letter did not feel more of pride than of angerwhether he was not rather gratified than displeased in spite of all that his commonsense told him on the subject his wife and daughters when they heard the news were clearly on the side of the young man mrs finn immediately expressed an opinion that parliament would be the making of her son and that everybody would be sure to employ so distinguished a barrister the girls declared that phineas ought at any rate to have his chance and almost asserted that it would be brutal in their father to stand in their brothers way it was in vain that the doctor tried to explain that going into parliament could not help a young barrister whatever it might do for one thoroughly established in his profession that phineas if successful at loughshane would at once abandon all idea of earning any incomethat the proposition coming from so poor a man was a monstrositythat such an opposition to the morris family coming from a son of his would be gross ingratitude to lord tulla mrs finn and the girls talked him down and the doctor himself was almost carried away by something like vanity in regard to his sons future position  nevertheless he wrote a letter strongly advising phineas to abandon the project but he himself was aware that the letter which he wrote was not one from which any success could be expected he advised his son but did not command him he made no threats as to stopping his income he did not tell phineas in so many words that he was proposing to make an ass of himself he argued very prudently against the plan and phineas when he received his fathers letter of course felt that it was tantamount to a paternal permission to proceed with the matter on the next day he got a letter from his mother full of affection full of pridenot exactly telling him to stand for loughshane by all means for mrs finn was not the woman to run openly counter to her husband in any advice given by her to their sonbut giving him every encouragement which motherly affection and motherly pride could bestow of course you will come to us she said if you do make up your mind to be member for loughshane we shall all of us be so delighted to have you phineas who had fallen into a sea of doubt after writing to his father and who had demanded a week from barrington erle to consider the matter was elated to positive certainty by the joint effect of the two letters from home he understood it all his mother and sisters were altogether in favour of his audacity and even his father was not disposed to quarrel with him on the subject  i shall take you at your word he said to barrington erle at the club that evening  what word said erle who had too many irons in the fire to be thinking always of loughshane and phineas finnor who at any rate did not choose to let his anxiety on the subject be seen  about loughshane  all right old fellow we shall be sure to carry you through the irish writs will be out on the third of march and the sooner youre there the better     chapter ii  phineas finn is elected for loughshane   one great difficulty about the borough vanished in a very wonderful way at the first touch dr finn who was a man stout at heart and by no means afraid of his great friends drove himself over to castlemorris to tell his news to the earl as soon as he got a second letter from his son declaring his intention of proceeding with the business let the results be what they might lord tulla was a passionate old man and the doctor expected that there would be a quarrelbut he was prepared to face that he was under no special debt of gratitude to the lord having given as much as he had taken in the long intercourse which had existed between themand he agreed with his son in thinking that if there was to be a liberal candidate at loughshane no consideration of old pillboxes and gallipots should deter his son phineas from standing other considerations might very probably deter him but not that the earl probably would be of a different opinion and the doctor felt it to be incumbent on him to break the news to lord tulla  the devil he is said the earl when the doctor had told his story then ill tell you what finn ill support him  you support him lord tulla  yeswhy shouldnt i support him i suppose its not so bad with me in the country that my support will rob him of his chance ill tell you one thing for certain i wont support george morris  but my lord  well go on  ive never taken much part in politics myself as you know but my boy phineas is on the other side  i dont care a  for sides what has my party done for me look at my cousin dick morris theres not a clergyman in ireland stauncher to them than he has been and now theyve given the deanery of kilfenora to a man that never had a father though i condescended to ask for it for my cousin let them wait till i ask for anything again dr finn who knew all about dick morriss debts and who had heard of his modes of preaching was not surprised at the decision of the conservative bestower of irish church patronage but on this subject he said nothing and as for george continued the earl i will never lift my hand again for him his standing for loughshane would be quite out of the question my own tenants wouldnt vote for him if i were to ask them myself peter blakemr peter blake was the lords agenttold me only a week ago that it would be useless the whole thing is gone and for my part i wish theyd disenfranchise the borough i wish theyd disenfranchise the whole country and send us a military governor whats the use of such members as we send there isnt one gentleman among ten of them your son is welcome for me what support i can give him he shall have but it isnt much i suppose he had better come and see me  the doctor promised that his son should ride over to castlemorris and then took his leavenot specially flattered as he felt that were his son to be returned the earl would not regard him as the one gentleman among ten whom the county might send to leaven the remainder of its membersbut aware that the greatest impediment in his sons way was already removed he certainly had not gone to castlemorris with any idea of canvassing for his son and yet he had canvassed for him most satisfactorily when he got home he did not know how to speak of the matter otherwise than triumphantly to his wife and daughters though he desired to curse his mouth would speak blessings before that evening was over the prospects of phineas at loughshane were spoken of with open enthusiasm before the doctor and by the next days post a letter was written to him by matilda informing him that the earl was prepared to receive him with open arms papa has been over there and managed it all said matilda  im told george morris isnt going to stand said barrington erle to phineas the night before his departure  his brother wont support him his brother means to support me said phineas  that can hardly be so  but i tell you it is my father has known the earl these twenty years and has managed it  i say finn youre not going to play us a trick are you said mr erle with something like dismay in his voice  what sort of trick  youre not coming out on the other side  not if i know it said phineas proudly let me assure you i wouldnt change my views in politics either for you or for the earl though each of you carried seats in your breeches pockets if i go into parliament i shall go there as a sound liberalnot to support a party but to do the best i can for the country i tell you so and i shall tell the earl the same  barrington erle turned away in disgust such language was to him simply disgusting it fell upon his ears as false maudlin sentiment falls on the ears of the ordinary honest man of the world barrington erle was a man ordinarily honest he would not have been untrue to his mothers brother william mildmay the great whig minister of the day for any earthly consideration he was ready to work with wages or without wages he was really zealous in the cause not asking very much for himself he had some undefined belief that it was much better for the country that mr mildmay should be in power than that lord de terrier should be there he was convinced that liberal politics were good for englishmen and that liberal politics and the mildmay party were one and the same thing it would be unfair to barrington erle to deny to him some praise for patriotism but he hated the very name of independence in parliament and when he was told of any man that that man intended to look to measures and not to men he regarded that man as being both unstable as water and dishonest as the wind no good could possibly come from such a one and much evil might and probably would come such a politician was a greek to barrington erle from whose hands he feared to accept even the gift of a vote parliamentary hermits were distasteful to him and dwellers in political caves were regarded by him with aversion as being either knavish or impractical with a good conservative opponent he could shake hands almost as readily as with a good whig ally but the man who was neither flesh nor fowl was odious to him according to his theory of parliamentary government the house of commons should be divided by a marked line and every member should be required to stand on one side of it or on the other if not with me at any rate be against me he would have said to every representative of the people in the name of the great leader whom he followed he thought that debates were good because of the people outsidebecause they served to create that public opinion which was hereafter to be used in creating some future house of commons but he did not think it possible that any vote should be given on a great question either this way or that as the result of a debate and he was certainly assured in his own opinion that any such changing of votes would be dangerous revolutionary and almost unparliamentary a members voteexcept on some small crotchety open question thrown out for the amusement of crotchety memberswas due to the leader of that members party such was mr erles idea of the english system of parliament and lending semiofficial assistance as he did frequently to the introduction of candidates into the house he was naturally anxious that his candidates should be candidates after his own heart when therefore phineas finn talked of measures and not men barrington erle turned away in open disgust but he remembered the youth and extreme rawness of the lad and he remembered also the careers of other men  barrington erle was forty and experience had taught him something after a few seconds he brought himself to think mildly of the young mans vanityas of the vanity of a plunging colt who resents the liberty even of a touch by the end of the first session the thong will be cracked over his head as he patiently assists in pulling the coach up hill without producing from him even a flick of his tail said barrington erle to an old parliamentary friend  if he were to come out after all on the wrong side said the parliamentary friend  erle admitted that such a trick as that would be unpleasant but he thought that old lord tulia was hardly equal to so clever a stratagem  phineas went to ireland and walked over the course at loughshane he called upon lord tulla and heard that venerable nobleman talk a great deal of nonsense to tell the truth of phineas i must confess that he wished to talk the nonsense himself but the earl would not hear him and put him down very quickly we wont discuss politics if you please mr finn because as i have already said i am throwing aside all political considerations phineas therefore was not allowed to express his views on the government of the country in the earls sittingroom at castlemorris there was however a good time coming and so for the present he allowed the earl to ramble on about the sins of his brother george and the want of all proper pedigree on the part of the new dean of kilfenora the conference ended with an assurance on the part of lord tulla that if the loughshaners chose to elect mr phineas finn he would not be in the least offended the electors did elect mr phineas finnperhaps for the reason given by one of the dublin conservative papers which declared that it was all the fault of the carlton club in not sending a proper candidate there was a great deal said about the matter both in london and dublin and the blame was supposed to fall on the joint shoulders of george morris and his elder brother in the meantime our hero phineas finn had been duly elected member of parliament for the borough of loughshane  the finn family could not restrain their triumphings at killaloe and i do not know that it would have been natural had they done so a gosling from such a flock does become something of a real swan by getting into parliament the doctor had his misgivingshad great misgivings fearful forebodings but there was the young man elected and he could not help it he could not refuse his right hand to his son or withdraw his paternal assistance because that son had been specially honoured among the young men of his country so he pulled out of his hoard what sufficed to pay off outstanding debtsthey were not heavyand undertook to allow phineas two hundred and fifty pounds a year as long as the session should last  there was a widow lady living at killaloe who was named mrs flood jones and she had a daughter she had a son also born to inherit the property of the late floscabel flood jones of floodborough as soon as that property should have disembarrassed itself but with him now serving with his regiment in india we shall have no concern mrs flood jones was living modestly at killaloe on her widows jointurefloodborough having to tell the truth pretty nearly fallen into absolute ruinand with her one daughter mary now on the evening before the return of phineas finn esq mp to london mrs and miss flood jones drank tea at the doctors house  it wont make a bit of change in him barbara finn said to her friend mary up in some bedroom privacy before the teadrinking ceremonies had altogether commenced  oh it must said mary  i tell you it wont my dear he is so good and so true  i know he is good barbara and as for truth there is no question about it because he has never said a word to me that he might not say to any girl  thats nonsense mary  he never has then as sure as the blessed virgin watches over usonly you dont believe she does  never mind about the virgin now mary  but he never has your brother is nothing to me barbara  then i hope he will be before the evening is over he was walking with you all yesterday and the day before  why shouldnt heand we that have known each other all our lives but barbara pray pray never say a word of this to any one  is it i wouldnt i cut out my tongue first  i dont know why i let you talk to me in this way there has never been anything between me and phineasyour brother i mean  i know whom you mean very well  and i feel quite sure that there never will be why should there hell go out among great people and be a great man and ive already found out that theres a certain lady laura standish whom he admires very much  lady laura fiddlestick  a man in parliament you know may look up to anybody said miss mary flood jones  i want phin to look up to you my dear  that wouldnt be looking up placed as he is now that would be looking down and he is so proud that hell never do that but come down dear else theyll wonder where we are  mary flood jones was a little girl about twenty years of age with the softest hair in the world of a colour varying between brown and auburnfor sometimes you would swear it was the one and sometimes the other and she was as pretty as ever she could be she was one of those girls so common in ireland whom men with tastes that way given feel inclined to take up and devour on the spur of the moment and when she liked her lion she had a look about her which seemed to ask to be devoured there are girls so coldlookingpretty girls too ladylike discreet and armed with all accomplishmentswhom to attack seems to require the same sort of courage and the same sort of preparation as a journey in quest of the northwest passage one thinks of a pedestal near the athenaeum as the most appropriate and most honourable reward of such courage but again there are other girls to abstain from attacking whom is to a man of any warmth of temperament quite impossible they are like water when one is athirst like plovers eggs in march like cigars when one is out in the autumn no one ever dreams of denying himself when such temptation comes in the way it often happens however that in spite of appearances the water will not come from the well nor the egg from its shell nor will the cigar allow itself to be lit a girl of such appearance so charming was mary flood jones of killaloe and our hero phineas was not allowed to thirst in vain for a drop from the cool spring  when the girls went down into the drawingroom mary was careful to go to a part of the room quite remote from phineas so as to seat herself between mrs finn and dr finns young partner mr elias bodkin from ballinasloe but mrs finn and the miss finns and all killaloe knew that mary had no love for mr bodkin and when mr bodkin handed her the hot cake she hardly so much as smiled at him but in two minutes phineas was behind her chair and then she smiled and in five minutes more she had got herself so twisted round that she was sitting in a corner with phineas and his sister barbara and in two more minutes barbara had returned to mr elias bodkin so that phineas and mary were uninterrupted they manage these things very quickly and very cleverly in killaloe  i shall be off tomorrow morning by the early train said phineas  so soonand when will you have to beginin parliament i mean  i shall have to take my seat on friday im going back just in time  but when shall we hear of your saying something  never probably not one in ten who go into parliament ever do say anything  but you will wont you i hope you will i do so hope you will distinguish yourselfbecause of your sister and for the sake of the town you know  and is that all mary  isnt that enough  you dont care a bit about myself then  you know that i do havent we been friends ever since we were children of course it will be a great pride to me that a person whom i have known so intimately should come to be talked about as a great man  i shall never be talked about as a great man  youre a great man to me already being in parliament only thinki never saw a member of parliament in my life before  youve seen the bishop scores of times  is he in parliament ah but not like you he couldnt come to be a cabinet minister and one never reads anything about him in the newspapers i shall expect to see your name very often and i shall always look for it mr phineas finn paired off with mr mildmay what is the meaning of pairing off  ill explain it all to you when i come back after learning my lesson  mind you do come back but i dont suppose you ever will you will be going somewhere to see lady laura standish when you are not wanted in parliament  lady laura standish  and why shouldnt you of course with your prospects you should go as much as possible among people of that sort is lady laura very pretty  shes about six feet high  nonsense i dont believe that  she would look as though she were standing by you  because i am so insignificant and small  because your figure is perfect and because she is straggling she is as unlike you as possible in everything she has thick lumpy red hair while yours is all silk and softness she has large hands and feet and  why phineas you are making her out to be an ogress and yet i know that you admire her  so i do because she possesses such an appearance of power and after all in spite of the lumpy hair and in spite of large hands and straggling figure she is handsome one cant tell what it is one can see that she is quite contented with herself and intends to make others contented with her and so she does  i see you are in love with her phineas  no not in lovenot with her at least of all men in the world i suppose that i am the last that has a right to be in love i daresay i shall marry some day  im sure i hope you will  but not till im forty or perhaps fifty years old if i was not fool enough to have what men call a high ambition i might venture to be in love now  im sure im very glad that youve got a high ambition it is what every man ought to have and ive no doubt that we shall hear of your marriage soonvery soon and thenif she can help you in your ambition weshallallbe soglad  phineas did not say a word further then perhaps some commotion among the party broke up the little private conversation in the corner and he was not alone with mary again till there came a moment for him to put her cloak over her shoulders in the back parlour while mrs flood jones was finishing some important narrative to his mother it was barbara i think who stood in some doorway and prevented people from passing and so gave him the opportunity which he abused  mary said he taking her in his arms without a single word of lovemaking beyond what the reader has heardone kiss before we part  no phineas no but the kiss had been taken and given before she had even answered him oh phineas you shouldnt  i should why shouldnt i and mary i will have one morsel of your hair  you shall not indeed you shall not but the scissors were at hand and the ringlet was cut and in his pocket before she was ready with her resistance there was nothing furthernot a word more and mary went away with her veil down under her mothers wing weeping sweet silent tears which no one saw  you do love her dont you phineas asked barbara  bother do you go to bed and dont trouble yourself about such trifles but mind youre up old girl to see me off in the morning  everybody was up to see him off in the morning to give him coffee and good advice and kisses and to throw all manner of old shoes after him as he started on his great expedition to parliament his father gave him an extra twentypound note and begged him for gods sake to be careful about his money his mother told him always to have an orange in his pocket when he intended to speak longer than usual and barbara in a last whisper begged him never to forget dear mary flood jones     chapter iii  phineas finn takes his seat   phineas had many serious almost solemn thoughts on his journey towards london i am sorry i must assure my female readers that very few of them had reference to mary flood jones he had however very carefully packed up the tress and could bring that out for proper acts of erotic worship at seasons in which his mind might be less engaged with affairs of state than it was at present would he make a failure of this great matter which he had taken in hand he could not but tell himself that the chances were twenty to one against him now that he looked nearer at it all the difficulties loomed larger than ever and the rewards seemed to be less more difficult of approach and more evanescent how many members were there who could never get a hearing how many who only spoke to fail how many who spoke well who could speak to no effect as far as their own worldly prospects were concerned he had already known many members of parliament to whom no outward respect or sign of honour was ever given by any one and it seemed to him as he thought over it that irish members of parliament were generally treated with more indifference than any others there were ob and oc and od for whom no one cared a straw who could hardly get men to dine with them at the club and yet they were genuine members of parliament why should he ever be better than ob or oc or od and in what way should he begin to be better he had an idea of the fashion after which it would be his duty to strive that he might excel those gentlemen he did not give any of them credit for much earnestness in their countrys behalf and he was minded to be very earnest he would go to his work honestly and conscientiously determined to do his duty as best he might let the results to himself be what they would this was a noble resolution and might have been pleasant to himhad he not remembered that smile of derision which had come over his friend erles face when he declared his intention of doing his duty to his country as a liberal and not of supporting a party ob and oc and od were keen enough to support their party only they were sometimes a little astray at knowing which was their party for the nonce he knew that erle and such men would despise him if he did not fall into the regular grooveand if the barrington erles despised him what would then be left for him  his moody thoughts were somewhat dissipated when he found one laurence fitzgibbonthe honourable laurence fitzgibbona special friend of his own and a very clever fellow on board the boat as it steamed out of kingston harbour laurence fitzgibbon had also just been over about his election and had been returned as a matter of course for his fathers county laurence fitzgibbon had sat in the house for the last fifteen years and was yet wellnigh as young a man as any in it and he was a man altogether different from the obs ocs and ods laurence fitzgibbon could always get the ear of the house if he chose to speak and his friends declared that he might have been high up in office long since if he would have taken the trouble to work he was a welcome guest at the houses of the very best people and was a friend of whom any one might be proud it had for two years been a feather in the cap of phineas that he knew laurence fitzgibbon and yet people said that laurence fitzgibbon had nothing of his own and men wondered how he lived he was the youngest son of lord claddagh an irish peer with a large family who could do nothing for laurence his favourite child beyond finding him a seat in parliament  well finn my boy said laurence shaking hands with the young member on board the steamer so youve made it all right at loughshane then phineas was beginning to tell all the story the wonderful story of george morris and the earl of tullahow the men of loughshane had elected him without opposition how he had been supported by conservatives as well as liberalshow unanimous loughshane had been in electing him phineas finn as its representative but mr fitzgibbon seemed to care very little about all this and went so far as to declare that those things were accidents which fell out sometimes one way and sometimes another and were altogether independent of any merit or demerit on the part of the candidate himself and it was marvellous and almost painful to phineas that his friend fitzgibbon should accept the fact of his membership with so little of congratulationwith absolutely no blowing of trumpets whatever had he been elected a member of the municipal corporation of loughshane instead of its representative in the british parliament laurence fitzgibbon could not have made less fuss about it phineas was disappointed but he took the cue from his friend too quickly to show his disappointment and when half an hour after their meeting fitzgibbon had to be reminded that his companion was not in the house during the last session phineas was able to make the remark as though he thought as little about the house as did the oldaccustomed member himself  as far as i can see as yet said fitzgibbon we are sure to have seventeen  seventeen said phineas not quite understanding the meaning of the number quoted  a majority of seventeen there are four irish counties and three scotch which havent returned as yet but we know pretty well what theyll do theres a doubt about tipperary of course but whichever gets in of the seven who are standing it will be a vote on our side now the government cant live against that the uphill strain is too much for them  according to my idea nothing can justify them in trying to live against a majority  thats gammon when the thing is so equal anything is fair but you see they dont like it of course there are some among them as hungry as we are and dubby would give his toes and fingers to remain in dubby was the ordinary name by which among friends and foes mr daubeny was known mr daubeny who at that time was the leader of the conservative party in the house of commons but most of them continued mr fitzgibbon prefer the other game and if you dont care about money upon my word its the pleasanter game of the two  but the country gets nothing done by a tory government  as to that its six of one and half a dozen of the other i never knew a government yet that wanted to do anything give a government a real strong majority as the tories used to have half a century since and as a matter of course it will do nothing why should it doing things as you call it is only bidding for powerfor patronage and pay  and is the country to have no service done  the country gets quite as much service as it pays forand perhaps a little more the clerks in the offices work for the country and the ministers work too if theyve got anything to manage there is plenty of work donebut of work in parliament the less the better according to my ideas its very little that ever is done and that little is generally too much  but the people  come down and have a glass of brandyandwater and leave the people alone for the present the people can take care of themselves a great deal better than we can take care of them mr fitzgibbons doctrine as to the commonwealth was very different from that of barrington erle and was still less to the taste of the new member barrington erle considered that his leader mr mildmay should be intrusted to make all necessary changes in the laws and that an obedient house of commons should implicitly obey that leader in authorising all changes proposed by himbut according to barrington erle such changes should be numerous and of great importance and would if duly passed into law at his lords behest gradually produce such a whig utopia in england as has never yet been seen on the face of the earth now according to mr fitzgibbon the present utopia would be good enoughif only he himself might be once more put into possession of a certain semipolitical place about the court from which he had heretofore drawn ¬£1000 per annum without any work much to his comfort he made no secret of his ambition and was chagrined simply at the prospect of having to return to his electors before he could enjoy those good things which he expected to receive from the undoubted majority of seventeen which had been or would be achieved  i hate all change as a rule said fitzgibbon but upon my word we ought to alter that when a fellow has got a crumb of comfort after waiting for it years and years and perhaps spending thousands in elections he has to go back and try his hand again at the last moment merely in obedience to some antiquated prejudice look at poor jack bondthe best friend i ever had in the world he was wrecked upon that rock for ever he spent every shilling he had in contesting romford three times runningand three times running he got in then they made him vicecomptroller of the granaries and im shot if he didnt get spilt at romford on standing for his reelection  and what became of him  god knows i think i heard that he married an old woman and settled down somewhere i know he never came up again now i call that a confounded shame i suppose im safe down in mayo but theres no knowing what may happen in these days  as they parted at euston square phineas asked his friend some little nervous question as to the best mode of making a first entrance into the house would laurence fitzgibbon see him through the difficulties of the oathtaking but laurence fitzgibbon made very little of the difficulty ohyou just come down and therell be a rush of fellows and youll know everybody youll have to hang about for an hour or so and then youll get pushed through there isnt time for much ceremony after a general election  phineas reached london early in the morning and went home to bed for an hour or so the house was to meet on that very day and he intended to begin his parliamentary duties at once if he should find it possible to get some one to accompany him he felt that he should lack courage to go down to westminster hall alone and explain to the policeman and doorkeepers that he was the man who had just been elected member for loughshane so about noon he went into the reform club and there he found a great crowd of men among whom there was a plentiful sprinkling of members erle saw him in a moment and came to him with congratulations  so youre all right finn said he  yes im all righti didnt have much doubt about it when i went over  i never heard of a fellow with such a run of luck said erle its just one of those flukes that occur once in a dozen elections any one on earth might have got in without spending a shilling  phineas didnt at all like this i dont think any one could have got in said he without knowing lord tulla  lord tulla was nowhere my dear boy and could have nothing to say to it but never mind that you meet me in the lobby at two therell be a lot of us there and well go in together have you seen fitzgibbon then barrington erle went off to other business and finn was congratulated by other men but it seemed to him that the congratulations of his friends were not hearty he spoke to some men of whom he thought that he knew they would have given their eyes to be in parliamentand yet they spoke of his success as being a very ordinary thing well my boy i hope you like it said one middleaged gentleman whom he had known ever since he came up to london the difference is between working for nothing and working for money youll have to work for nothing now  thats about it i suppose said phineas  they say the house is a comfortable club said the middleaged friend but i confess that i shouldnt like being rung away from my dinner myself  at two punctually phineas was in the lobby at westminster and then he found himself taken into the house with a crowd of other men the old and young and they who were neither old nor young were mingled together and there seemed to be very little respect of persons on three or four occasions there was some cheering when a popular man or a great leader came in but the work of the day left but little clear impression on the mind of the young member he was confused half elated half disappointed and had not his wits about him he found himself constantly regretting that he was there and as constantly telling himself that he hardly yet twentyfive without a shilling of his own had achieved an entrance into that assembly which by the consent of all men is the greatest in the world and which many of the rich magnates of the country had in vain spent heaps of treasure in their endeavours to open to their own footsteps he tried hard to realise what he had gained but the dust and the noise and the crowds and the want of something august to the eye were almost too strong for him he managed however to take the oath early among those who took it and heard the queen s speech read and the address moved and seconded he was seated very uncomfortably high up on a back seat between two men whom he did not know and he found the speeches to be very long he had been in the habit of seeing such speeches reported in about a column and he thought that these speeches must take at least four columns each he sat out the debate on the address till the house was adjourned and then he went away to dine at his club he did go into the diningroom of the house but there was a crowd there and he found himself aloneand to tell the truth he was afraid to order his dinner  the nearest approach to a triumph which he had in london came to him from the glory which his election reflected upon his landlady she was a kindly good motherly soul whose husband was a journeyman lawstationer and who kept a very decent house in great marlborough street here phineas had lodged since he had been in london and was a great favourite god bless my soul mr phineas said she only think of your being a member of parliament  yes im a member of parliament mrs bunce  and youll go on with the rooms the same as ever well i never thought to have a member of parliament in em  mrs bunce really had realised the magnitude of the step which her lodger had taken and phineas was grateful to her     chapter iv  lady laura standish   phineas in describing lady laura standish to mary flood jones at killaloe had not painted her in very glowing colours nevertheless he admired lady laura very much and she was worthy of admiration it was probably the greatest pride of our heros life that lady laura standish was his friend and that she had instigated him to undertake the risk of parliamentary life lady laura was intimate also with barrington erle who was in some distant degree her cousin and phineas was not without a suspicion that his selection for loughshane from out of all the young liberal candidates may have been in some degree owing to lady lauras influence with barrington erle he was not unwilling that it should be so for though as he had repeatedly told himself he was by no means in love with lady laurawho was as he imagined somewhat older than himselfnevertheless he would feel gratified at accepting anything from her hands and he felt a keen desire for some increase to those ties of friendship which bound them together nohe was not in love with lady laura standish he had not the remotest idea of asking her to be his wife so he told himself both before he went over for his election and after his return when he had found himself in a corner with poor little mary flood jones he had kissed her as a matter of course but he did not think that he could in any circumstances be tempted to kiss lady laura he supposed that he was in love with his darling little maryafter a fashion of course it could never come to anything because of the circumstances of his life which were so imperious to him he was not in love with lady laura and yet he hoped that his intimacy with her might come to much he had more than once asked himself how he would feel when somebody else came to be really in love with lady laurafor she was by no means a woman to lack loverswhen some one else should be in love with her and be received by her as a lover but this question he had never been able to answer there were many questions about himself which he usually answered by telling himself that it was his fate to walk over volcanoes of course i shall be blown into atoms some fine day he would say but after all that is better than being slowly boiled down into pulp  the house had met on a friday again on the saturday morning and the debate on the address had been adjourned till the monday on the sunday phineas determined that he would see lady laura she professed to be always at home on sunday and from three to four in the afternoon her drawingroom would probably be half full of people there would at any rate be comers and goers who would prevent anything like real conversation between himself and her but for a few minutes before that he might probably find her alone and he was most anxious to see whether her reception of him as a member of parliament would be in any degree warmer than that of his other friends hitherto he had found no such warmth since he came to london excepting that which had glowed in the bosom of mrs bunce  lady laura standish was the daughter of the earl of brentford and was the only remaining lady of the earls family the countess had been long dead and lady emily the younger daughter who had been the great beauty of her day was now the wife of a russian nobleman whom she had persisted in preferring to any of her english suitors and lived at st petersburg there was an aunt old lady laura who came up to town about the middle of may but she was always in the country except for some six weeks in the season there was a certain lord chiltern the earls son and heir who did indeed live at the family town house in portman square but lord chiltern was a man of whom lady lauras set did not often speak and phineas frequently as he had been at the house had never seen lord chiltern there he was a young nobleman of whom various accounts were given by various people but i fear that the account most readily accepted in london attributed to him a great intimacy with the affairs at newmarket and a partiality for convivial pleasures respecting lord chiltern phineas had never as yet exchanged a word with lady laura with her father he was acquainted as he had dined perhaps half a dozen times at the house the point in lord brentfords character which had more than any other struck our hero was the unlimited confidence which he seemed to place in his daughter lady laura seemed to have perfect power of doing what she pleased she was much more mistress of herself than if she had been the wife instead of the daughter of the earl of brentfordand she seemed to be quite as much mistress of the house  phineas had declared at killaloe that lady laura was six feet high that she had red hair that her figure was straggling and that her hands and feet were large she was in fact about five feet seven in height and she carried her height well there was something of nobility in her gait and she seemed thus to be taller than her inches her hair was in truth redof a deep thorough redness her brothers hair was the same and so had been that of her father before it had become sandy with age her sisters had been of a soft auburn hue and hers had been said to be the prettiest head of hair in europe at the time of her marriage but in these days we have got to like red hair and lady lauras was not supposed to stand in the way of her being considered a beauty her face was very fair though it lacked that softness which we all love in women her eyes which were large and bright and very clear never seemed to quail never rose and sunk or showed themselves to be afraid of their own power indeed lady laura standish had nothing of fear about her her nose was perfectly cut but was rather large having the slightest possible tendency to be aquiline her mouth also was large but was full of expression and her teeth were perfect her complexion was very bright but in spite of its brightness she never blushed the shades of her complexion were set and steady those who knew her said that her heart was so fully under command that nothing could stir her blood to any sudden motion as to that accusation of straggling which had been made against her it had sprung from illnatured observation of her modes of sitting she never straggled when she stood or walked but she would lean forward when sitting as a man does and would use her arms in talking and would put her hand over her face and pass her fingers through her hairafter the fashion of men rather than of womenand she seemed to despise that soft quiescence of her sex in which are generally found so many charms her hands and feet were largeas was her whole frame such was lady laura standish and phineas finn had been untrue to himself and to his own appreciation of the lady when he had described her in disparaging terms to mary flood jones but though he had spoken of lady laura in disparaging terms he had so spoken of her as to make miss flood jones quite understand that he thought a great deal about lady laura  and now early on the sunday he made his way to portman square in order that he might learn whether there might be any sympathy for him there hitherto he had found none everything had been terribly dry and hard and he had gathered as yet none of the fruit which he had expected that his good fortune would bear for him it is true that he had not as yet gone among any friends except those of his club and men who were in the house along with himand at the club it might be that there were some who envied him his good fortune and others who thought nothing of it because it had been theirs for years now he would try a friend who he hoped could sympathise and therefore he called in portman square at about halfpast two on the sunday morning yeslady laura was in the drawingroom the hallporter admitted as much but evidently seemed to think that he had been disturbed from his dinner before his time phineas did not care a straw for the hallporter if lady laura were not kind to him he would never trouble that hallporter again he was especially sore at this moment because a valued friend the barrister with whom he had been reading for the last three years had spent the best part of an hour that sunday morning in proving to him that he had as good as ruined himself when i first heard it of course i thought you had inherited a fortune said mr low i have inherited nothing phineas repliednot a penny and i never shall then mr low had opened his eyes very wide and shaken his head very sadly and had whistled  i am so glad you have come mr finn said lady laura meeting phineas halfway across the large room  thanks said he as he took her hand  i thought that perhaps you would manage to see me before any one else was here  wellto tell the truth i have wished it though i can hardly tell why  i can tell you why mr finn but never mindcome and sit down i am so very glad that you have been successfulso very glad you know i told you that i should never think much of you if you did not at least try it  and therefore i did try  and have succeeded faint heart you know never did any good i think it is a mans duty to make his way into the housethat is if he ever means to be anybody of course it is not every man who can get there by the time that he is fiveandtwenty  every friend that i have in the world says that i have ruined myself  noi dont say so said lady laura  and you are worth all the others put together it is such a comfort to have some one to say a cheery word to one  you shall hear nothing but cheery words here papa shall say cheery words to you that shall be better than mine because they shall be weighted with the wisdom of age i have heard him say twenty times that the earlier a man goes into the house the better there is much to learn  but your father was thinking of men of fortune  not at allof younger brothers and barristers and of men who have their way to make as you have let me seecan you dine here on wednesday there will be no party of course but papa will want to shake hands with you and you legislators of the lower house are more easily reached on wednesdays than on any other day  i shall be delighted said phineas feeling however that he did not expect much sympathy from lord brentford  mr kennedy dines hereyou know mr kennedy of loughlinter and we will ask your friend mr fitzgibbon there will be nobody else as for catching barrington erle that is out of the question at such a time as this  but going back to my being ruined said phineas after a pause  dont think of anything so disagreeable  you must not suppose that i am afraid of it i was going to say that there are worse things than ruinor at any rate than the chance of ruin supposing that i have to emigrate and skin sheep what does it matter i myself being unencumbered have myself as my own property to do what i like with with nelson it was westminster abbey or a peerage with me it is parliamentary success or sheepskinning  there shall be no sheepskinning mr finn i will guarantee you  then i shall be safe  at that moment the door of the room was opened and a man entered with quick steps came a few yards in and then retreated slamming the door after him he was a man with thick short red hair and an abundance of very red beard and his face was redand as it seemed to phineas his very eyes there was something in the countenance of the man which struck him almost with dreadsomething approaching to ferocity  there was a pause a moment after the door was closed and then lady laura spoke it was my brother chiltern i do not think that you have ever met him     chapter v  mr and mrs low   that terrible apparition of the red lord chiltern had disturbed phineas in the moment of his happiness as he sat listening to the kind flatteries of lady laura and though lord chiltern had vanished as quickly as he had appeared there had come no return of his joy lady laura had said some word about her brother and phineas had replied that he had never chanced to see lord chiltern then there had been an awkward silence and almost immediately other persons had come in after greeting one or two old acquaintances among whom an elder sister of laurence fitzgibbon was one he took his leave and escaped out into the square miss fitzgibbon is going to dine with us on wednesday said lady laura she says she wont answer for her brother but she will bring him if she can  and youre a member of parliament now too they tell me said miss fitzgibbon holding up her hands i think everybody will be in parliament before long i wish i knew some man who wasnt that i might think of changing my condition  but phineas cared very little what miss fitzgibbon said to him everybody knew aspasia fitzgibbon and all who knew her were accustomed to put up with the violence of her jokes and the bitterness of her remarks she was an old maid over forty very plain who having reconciled herself to the fact that she was an old maid chose to take advantage of such poor privileges as the position gave her within the last few years a considerable fortune had fallen into her hands some twentyfive thousand pounds which had come to her unexpectedlya wonderful windfall and now she was the only one of her family who had money at command she lived in a small house by herself in one of the smallest streets of may fair and walked about sturdily by herself and spoke her mind about everything she was greatly devoted to her brother laurenceso devoted that there was nothing she would not do for him short of lending him money  but phineas when he found himself out in the square thought nothing of aspasia fitzgibbon he had gone to lady laura standish for sympathy and she had given it to him in full measure she understood him and his aspirations if no one else did so on the face of the earth she rejoiced in his triumph and was not too hard to tell him that she looked forward to his success and in what delightful language she had done so faint heart never won fair lady it was thus or almost thus that she had encouraged him he knew well that she had in truth meant nothing more than her words had seemed to signify he did not for a moment attribute to her aught else but might not he get another lesson from them he had often told himself that he was not in love with laura standishbut why should he not how tell himself that he was in love with her of course there would be difficulty but was it not the business of his life to overcome difficulties had he not already overcome one difficulty almost as great and why should he be afraid of this other faint heart never won fair lady and this fair ladyfor at this moment he was ready to swear that she was very fairwas already half won she could not have taken him by the hand so warmly and looked into his face so keenly had she not felt for him something stronger than common friendship  he had turned down baker street from the square and was now walking towards the regents park he would go and see the beasts in the zoological gardens and make up his mind as to his future mode of life in that delightful sunday solitude there was very much as to which it was necessary that he should make up his mind if he resolved that he would ask lady laura standish to be his wife when should he ask her and in what manner might he propose to her that they should live it would hardly suit him to postpone his courtship indefinitely knowing as he did know that he would be one among many suitors he could not expect her to wait for him if he did not declare himself and yet he could hardly ask her to come and share with him the allowance made to him by his father whether she had much fortune of her own or little or none at all he did not in the least know he did know that the earl had been distressed by his sons extravagance and that there had been some money difficulties arising from this source  but his great desire would be to support his own wife by his own labour at present he was hardly in a fair way to do that unless he could get paid for his parliamentary work those fortunate gentlemen who form the government are so paid yesthere was the treasury bench open to him and he must resolve that he would seat himself there he would make lady laura understand this and then he would ask his question it was true that at present his political opponents had possession of the treasury benchbut all governments are mortal and conservative governments in this country are especially prone to die it was true that he could not hold even a treasury lordship with a poor thousand a year for his salary without having to face the electors of loughshane again before he entered upon the enjoyment of his placebut if he could only do something to give a grace to his name to show that he was a rising man the electors of loughshane who had once been so easy with him would surely not be cruel to him when he showed himself a second time among them lord tulla was his friend and he had those points of law in his favour which possession bestows and then he remembered that lady laura was related to almost everybody who was anybody among the high whigs she was he knew second cousin to mr mildmay who for years had been the leader of the whigs and was third cousin to barrington erle the late president of the council the duke of st bungay and lord brentford had married sisters and the st bungay people and the mildmay people and the brentford people had all some sort of connection with the palliser people of whom the heir and coming chief plantagenet palliser would certainly be chancellor of the exchequer in the next government simply as an introduction into official life nothing could be more conducive to chances of success than a matrimonial alliance with lady laura not that he would have thought of such a thing on that account nohe thought of it because he loved her honestly because he loved her he swore to that half a dozen times for his own satisfaction but loving her as he did and resolving that in spite of all difficulties she should become his wife there could be no reason why he should noton her account as well as on his owntake advantage of any circumstances that there might be in his favour  as he wandered among the unsavoury beasts elbowed on every side by the sunday visitors to the garden he made up his mind that he would first let lady laura understand what were his intentions with regard to his future career and then he would ask her to join her lot to his at every turn the chances would of course be very much against himten to one against him perhaps on every point but it was his lot in life to have to face such odds twelve months since it had been much more than ten to one against his getting into parliament and yet he was there he expected to be blown into fragmentsto sheepskinning in australia or packing preserved meats on the plains of paraguay but when the blowing into atoms should come he was resolved that courage to bear the ruin should not be wanting then he quoted a line or two of a latin poet and felt himself to be comfortable  so here you are again mr finn said a voice in his ear  yes miss fitzgibbon here i am again  i fancied you members of parliament had something else to do besides looking at wild beasts i thought you always spent sunday in arranging how you might most effectually badger each other on monday  we got through all that early this morning miss fitzgibbon while you were saying your prayers  here is mr kennedy tooyou know him i daresay he also is a member but then he can afford to be idle but it so happened that phineas did not know mr kennedy and consequently there was some slight form of introduction  i believe i am to meet you at dinner on wednesdaysaid phineasat lord brentfords  and me too said miss fitzgibbon  which will be the greatest possible addition to our pleasure said phineas  mr kennedy who seemed to be afflicted with some difficulty in speaking and whose bow to our hero had hardly done more than produce the slightest possible motion to the top of his hat hereupon muttered something which was taken to mean an assent to the proposition as to wednesdays dinner then he stood perfectly still with his two hands fixed on the top of his umbrella and gazed at the great monkeys cage but it was clear that he was not looking at any special monkey for his eyes never wandered  did you ever see such a contrast in your life said miss fitzgibbon to phineashardly in a whisper  between what said phineas  between mr kennedy and a monkey the monkey has so much to say for himself and is so delightfully wicked i dont suppose that mr kennedy ever did anything wrong in his life  mr kennedy was a man who had very little temptation to do anything wrong he was possessed of over a million and a half of money which he was mistaken enough to suppose he had made himself whereas it may be doubted whether he had ever earned a penny his father and his uncle had created a business in glasgow and that business now belonged to him but his father and his uncle who had toiled through their long lives had left behind them servants who understood the work and the business now went on prospering almost by its own momentum the mr kennedy of the present day the sole owner of the business though he did occasionally go to glasgow certainly did nothing towards maintaining it he had a magnificent place in perthshire called loughlinter and he sat for a scotch group of boroughs and he had a house in london and a stud of horses in leicestershire which he rarely visited and was unmarried he never spoke much to any one although he was constantly in society he rarely did anything although he had the means of doing everything he had very seldom been on his legs in the house of commons though he had sat there for ten years he was seen about everywhere sometimes with one acquaintance and sometimes with anotherbut it may be doubted whether he had any friend it may be doubted whether he had ever talked enough to any man to make that man his friend laurence fitzgibbon tried him for one season and after a month or two asked for a loan of a few hundred pounds i never lend money to any one under any circumstances said mr kennedy and it was the longest speech which had ever fallen from his mouth in the hearing of laurence fitzgibbon but though he would not lend money he gave a great dealand he would give it for almost every object mr robert kennedy mp loughlinter ¬£105 appeared on almost every charitable list that was advertised no one ever spoke to him as to this expenditure nor did he ever speak to any one circulars came to him and the cheques were returned the duty was a very easy one to him and he performed it willingly had any amount of inquiry been necessary it is possible that the labour would have been too much for him such was mr robert kennedy as to whom phineas had heard that he had during the last winter entertained lord brentford and lady laura with very many other people of note at his place in perthshire  i very much prefer the monkey said phineas to miss fitzgibbon  i thought you would said she like to like you know you have both of you the same aptitude for climbing but the monkeys never fall they tell me  phineas knowing that he could gain nothing by sparring with miss fitzgibbon raised his hat and took his leave going out of a narrow gate he found himself again brought into contact with mr kennedy what a crowd there is here he said finding himself bound to say something mr kennedy who was behind him answered him not a word then phineas made up his mind that mr kennedy was insolent with the insolence of riches and that he would hate mr kennedy  he was engaged to dine on this sunday with mr low the barrister with whom he had been reading for the last three years mr low had taken a strong liking to phineas as had also mrs low and the tutor had more than once told his pupil that success in his profession was certainly open to him if he would only stick to his work mr low was himself an ambitious man looking forward to entering parliament at some future time when the exigencies of his life of labour might enable him to do so but he was prudent given to close calculation and resolved to make the ground sure beneath his feet in every step that he took forward when he first heard that finn intended to stand for loughshane he was stricken with dismay and strongly dissuaded him the electors may probably reject him thats his only chance now mr low had said to his wife when he found that phineas was as he thought foolhardy but the electors of loughshane had not rejected mr lows pupil and mr low was now called upon to advise what phineas should do in his present circumstances there is nothing to prevent the work of a chancery barrister being done by a member of parliament indeed the most successful barristers are members of parliament but phineas finn was beginning at the wrong end and mr low knew that no good would come of it  only think of your being in parliament mr finn said mrs low  it is wonderful isnt it said phineas  it took us so much by surprise said mrs low as a rule one never hears of a barrister going into parliament till after hes forty  and im only twentyfive i do feel that ive disgraced myself i do indeed mrs low  noyouve not disgraced yourself mr finn the only question is whether its prudent i hope it will all turn out for the best most heartily mrs low was a very matteroffact lady four or five years older than her husband who had had a little money of her own and was possessed of every virtue under the sun nevertheless she did not quite like the idea of her husbands pupil having got into parliament if her husband and phineas finn were dining anywhere together phineas who had come to them quite a boy would walk out of the room before her husband this could hardly be right nevertheless she helped phineas to the nicest bit of fish she could find and had he been ill would have nursed him with the greatest care  after dinner when mrs low had gone upstairs there came the great discussion between the tutor and the pupil for the sake of which this little dinner had been given when phineas had last been with mr lowon the occasion of his showing himself at his tutors chambers after his return from irelandhe had not made up his mind so thoroughly on certain points as he had done since he had seen lady laura the discussion could hardly be of any avail nowbut it could not be avoided  well phineas and what do you mean to do said mr low everybody who knew our hero or nearly everybody called him by his christian name there are men who seem to be so treated by general consent in all societies even mrs low who was very prosaic and unlikely to be familiar in her mode of address had fallen into the way of doing it before the election but she had dropped it when the phineas whom she used to know became a member of parliament  thats the questionisnt it said phineas  of course youll stick to your work  whatto the bar  yesto the bar  i am not thinking of giving it up permanently  giving it up said mr low raising his hands in surprise if you give it up how do you intend to live men are not paid for being members of parliament  not exactly but as i said before i am not thinking of giving it uppermanently  you mustnt give it up at allnot for a day that is if you ever mean to do any good  there i think that perhaps you may be wrong low  how can i be wrong did a period of idleness ever help a man in any profession and is it not acknowledged by all who know anything about it that continuous labour is more necessary in our profession than in any other  i do not mean to be idle  what is it you do mean phineas  why simply this here i am in parliament we must take that as a fact  i dont doubt the fact  and if it be a misfortune we must make the best of it even you wouldnt advise me to apply for the chiltern hundreds at once  i wouldtomorrow my dear fellow though i do not like to give you pain if you come to me i can only tell you what i think my advice to you is to give it up tomorrow men would laugh at you for a few weeks but that is better than being ruined for life  i cant do that said phineas sadly  very wellthen let us go on said mr low if you wont give up your seat the next best thing will be to take care that it shall interfere as little as possible with your work i suppose you must sit upon some committees  my idea is thisthat i will give up one year to learning the practices of the house  and do nothing  nothing but that why the thing is a study in itself as for learning it in a year that is out of the question but i am convinced that if a man intends to be a useful member of parliament he should make a study of it  and how do you mean to live in the meantime mr low who was an energetic man had assumed almost an angry tone of voice phineas for awhile sat silentnot that he felt himself to be without words for a reply but that he was thinking in what fewest words he might best convey his ideas you have a very modest allowance from your father on which you have never been able to keep yourself free from debt continued mr low  he has increased it  and will it satisfy you to live here in what will turn out to be parliamentary club idleness on the savings of his industrious life i think you will find yourself unhappy if you do that phineas my dear fellow as far as i have as yet been able to see the world men dont begin either very good or very bad they have generally good aspirations with infirm purposesor as we may say strong bodies with weak legs to carry them then because their legs are weak they drift into idleness and ruin during all this drifting they are wretched and when they have thoroughly drifted they are still wretched the agony of their old disappointment still clings to them in nine cases out of ten it is some one small unfortunate event that puts a man astray at first he sees some woman and loses himself with heror he is taken to a racecourse and unluckily wins moneyor some devil in the shape of a friend lures him to tobacco and brandy your temptation has come in the shape of this accursed seat in parliament mr low had never said a soft word in his life to any woman but the wife of his bosom had never seen a racehorse always confined himself to two glasses of port after dinner and looked upon smoking as the darkest of all the vices  you have made up your mind then that i mean to be idle  i have made up my mind that your time will be wholly unprofitableif you do as you say you intend to do  but you do not know my planjust listen to me then mr low did listen and phineas explained his plansaying of course nothing of his love for lady laura but giving mr low to understand that he intended to assist in turning out the existing government and to mount up to some seata humble seat at firston the treasury bench by the help of his exalted friends and by the use of his own gifts of eloquence mr low heard him without a word of course said phineas after the first year my time will not be fully employed unless i succeed and if i fail totallyfor of course i may fail altogether  it is possible said mr low  if you are resolved to turn yourself against me i must not say another word said phineas with anger  turn myself against you i would turn myself any way so that i might save you from the sort of life which you are preparing for yourself i see nothing in it that can satisfy any manly heart even if you are successful what are you to become you will be the creature of some minister not his colleague you are to make your way up the ladder by pretending to agree whenever agreement is demanded from you and by voting whether you agree or do not and what is to be your reward some few precarious hundreds a year lasting just so long as a party may remain in power and you can retain a seat in parliament it is at the best slavery and degradationeven if you are lucky enough to achieve the slavery  you yourself hope to go into parliament and join a ministry some day said phineas  mr low was not quick to answer but he did answer at last that is true though i have never told you so indeed it is hardly true to say that i hope it i have my dreams and sometimes dare to tell myself that they may possibly become waking facts but if ever i sit on a treasury bench i shall sit there by special invitation having been summoned to take a high place because of my professional success it is but a dream after all and i would not have you repeat what i have said to any one i had no intention to talk about myself  i am sure that you will succeed said phineas  yesi shall succeed i am succeeding i live upon what i earn like a gentleman and can already afford to be indifferent to work that i dislike after all the other part of itthat of which i dreamis but an unnecessary adjunct the gilding on the gingerbread i am inclined to think that the cake is more wholesome without it  phineas did not go upstairs into mrs lows drawingroom on that evening nor did he stay very late with mr low he had heard enough of counsel to make him very unhappyto shake from him much of the audacity which he had acquired for himself during his mornings walkand to make him almost doubt whether after all the chiltern hundreds would not be for him the safest escape from his difficulties but in that case he must never venture to see lady laura standish again     chapter vi  lord brentfords dinner   noin such case as thatshould he resolve upon taking the advice of his old friend mr low phineas finn must make up his mind never to see lady laura standish again and he was in love with lady laura standishand for aught he knew lady laura standish might be in love with him as he walked home from mr lows house in bedford square he was by no means a triumphant man there had been much more said between him and mr low than could be laid before the reader in the last chapter mr low had urged him again and again and had prevailed so far that phineas before he left the house had promised to consider that suicidal expedient of the chiltern hundreds what a byword he would become if he were to give up parliament having sat there for about a week but such immediate giving up was one of the necessities of mr lows programme according to mr lows teaching a single year passed amidst the miasma of the house of commons would be altogether fatal to any chance of professional success and mr low had at any rate succeeded in making phineas believe that he was right in this lesson there was his profession as to which mr low assured him that success was within his reach and there was parliament on the other side as to which he knew that the chances were all against him in spite of his advantage of a seat that he could not combine the two beginning with parliament he did believe which should it be that was the question which he tried to decide as he walked home from bedford square to great marlborough street he could not answer the question satisfactorily and went to bed an unhappy man  he must at any rate go to lord brentfords dinner on wednesday and to enable him to join in the conversation there must attend the debates on monday and tuesday the reader may perhaps be best made to understand how terrible was our heros state of doubt by being told that for awhile he thought of absenting himself from these debates as being likely to weaken his purpose of withdrawing altogether from the house it is not very often that so strong a fury rages between party and party at the commencement of the session that a division is taken upon the address it is customary for the leader of the opposition on such occasions to express his opinion in the most courteous language that his right honourable friend sitting opposite to him on the treasury bench has been is and will be wrong in everything that he thinks says or does in public life but that as anything like factious opposition is never adopted on that side of the house the address to the queen in answer to that most fatuous speech which has been put into her majestys gracious mouth shall be allowed to pass unquestioned then the leader of the house thanks his adversary for his consideration explains to all men how happy the country ought to be that the government has not fallen into the disgracefully incapable hands of his right honourable friend opposite and after that the address is carried amidst universal serenity but such was not the order of the day on the present occasion mr mildmay the veteran leader of the liberal side of the house had moved an amendment to the address and had urged upon the house in very strong language the expediency of showing at the very commencement of the session that the country had returned to parliament a strong majority determined not to put up with conservative inactivity i conceive it to be my duty mr mildmay had said at once to assume that the country is unwilling that the right honourable gentlemen opposite should keep their seats on the bench upon which they sit and in the performance of that duty i am called upon to divide the house upon the address to her majesty and if mr mildmay used strong language the reader may be sure that mr mildmays followers used language much stronger and mr daubeny who was the present leader of the house and representative there of the ministrylord de terrier the premier sitting in the house of lordswas not the man to allow these amenities to pass by without adequate replies he and his friends were very strong in sarcasm if they failed in argument and lacked nothing for words though it might perhaps be proved that they were short in numbers it was considered that the speech in which mr daubeny reviewed the long political life of mr mildmay and showed that mr mildmay had been at one time a bugbear and then a nightmare and latterly simply a fungus was one of the severest attacks if not the most severe that had been heard in that house since the reform bill mr mildmay the while was sitting with his hat low down over his eyes and many men said that he did not like it but this speech was not made till after that dinner at lord brentfords of which a short account must be given  had it not been for the overwhelming interest of the doings in parliament at the commencement of the session phineas might have perhaps abstained from attending in spite of the charm of novelty for in truth mr lows words had moved him much but if it was to be his fate to be a member of parliament only for ten days surely it would be well that he should take advantage of the time to hear such a debate as this it would be a thing to talk of to his children in twenty years time or to his grandchildren in fiftyand it would be essentially necessary that he should be able to talk of it to lady laura standish he did therefore sit in the house till one on the monday night and till two on the tuesday night and heard the debate adjourned till the thursday on the thursday mr daubeny was to make his great speech and then the division would come  when phineas entered lady lauras drawingroom on the wednesday before dinner he found the other guests all assembled why men should have been earlier in keeping their dinner engagements on that day than on any other he did not understand but it was the fact probably that the great anxiety of the time made those who were at all concerned in the matter very keen to hear and to be heard during these days everybody was in a hurryeverybody was eager and there was a common feeling that not a minute was to be lost there were three ladies in the roomlady laura miss fitzgibbon and mrs bonteen the latter was the wife of a gentleman who had been a junior lord of the admiralty in the late government and who lived in the expectation of filling perhaps some higher office in the government which as he hoped was soon to be called into existence there were five gentlemen besides phineas finn himselfmr bonteen mr kennedy mr fitzgibbon barrington erle who had been caught in spite of all that lady laura had said as to the difficulty of such an operation and lord brentford phineas was quick to observe that every male guest was in parliament and to tell himself that he would not have been there unless he also had had a seat  we are all here now said the earl ringing the bell  i hope ive not kept you waiting said phineas  not at all said lady laura i do not know why we are in such a hurry and how many do you say it will be mr finn  seventeen i suppose said phineas  more likely twentytwo said mr bonteen there is colcleugh so ill they cant possibly bring him up and young rochester is at vienna and gunning is sulking about something and moody has lost his eldest son by george they pressed him to come up although frank moody wont be buried till friday  i dont believe it said lord brentford  you ask some of the carlton fellows and theyll own it  if id lost every relation i had in the world said fitzgibbon id vote on such a question as this staying away wont bring poor frank moody back to life  but theres a decency in these matters is there not mr fitzgibbon said lady laura  i thought they had thrown all that kind of thing overboard long ago said miss fitzgibbon it would be better that they should have no veil than squabble about the thickness of it  then dinner was announced the earl walked off with miss fitzgibbon barrington erle took mrs bonteen and mr fitzgibbon took lady laura  ill bet four pounds to two its over nineteen said mr bonteen as he passed through the drawingroom door the remark seemed to have been addressed to mr kennedy and phineas therefore made no reply  i daresay it will said kennedy but i never bet  but you votesometimes i hope said bonteen  sometimes said mr kennedy  i think he is the most odious man that ever i set my eyes on said phineas to himself as he followed mr kennedy into the diningroom he had observed that mr kennedy had been standing very near to lady laura in the drawingroom and that lady laura had said a few words to him he was more determined than ever that he would hate mr kennedy and would probably have been moody and unhappy throughout the whole dinner had not lady laura called him to a chair at her left hand it was very generous of her and the more so as mr kennedy had in a halfhesitating manner prepared to seat himself in that very place as it was phineas and mr kennedy were neighbours but phineas had the place of honour  i suppose you will not speak during the debate said lady laura  who i certainly not in the first place i could not get a hearing and in the next place i should not think of commencing on such an occasion i do not know that i shall ever speak at all  indeed you will you are just the sort of man who will succeed with the house what i doubt is whether you will do as well in office  i wish i might have the chance  of course you can have the chance if you try for it beginning so early and being on the right sideand if you will allow me to say so among the right setthere can be no doubt that you may take office if you will but i am not sure that you will be tractable you cannot begin you know by being prime minister  i have seen enough to realise that already said phineas  if you will only keep that little fact steadily before your eyes there is nothing you may not reach in official life but pitt was prime minister at fourandtwenty and that precedent has ruined half our young politicians  it has not affected me lady laura  as far as i can see there is no great difficulty in government a man must learn to have words at command when he is on his legs in the house of commons in the same way as he would if he were talking to his own servants he must keep his temper and he must be very patient as far as i have seen cabinet ministers they are not more clever than other people  i think there are generally one or two men of ability in the cabinet  yes of fair ability mr mildmay is a good specimen there is not and never was anything brilliant in him he is not eloquent nor as far as i am aware did he ever create anything but he has always been a steady honest persevering man and circumstances have made politics come easy to him  think of the momentous questions which he has been called upon to decide said phineas  every question so handled by him has been decided rightly according to his own party and wrongly according to the party opposite a political leader is so sure of support and so sure of attack that it is hardly necessary for him to be even anxious to be right for the countrys sake he should have officials under him who know the routine of business  you think very badly then of politics as a profession  no i think of them very highly it must be better to deal with the repeal of laws than the defending of criminals but all this is papas wisdom not mine papa has never been in the cabinet yet and therefore of course he is a little caustic  i think he was quite right said barrington erle stoutly he spoke so stoutly that everybody at the table listened to him  i dont exactly see the necessity for such internecine war just at present said lord brentford  i must say i do said the other lord de terrier took office knowing that he was in a minority we had a fair majority of nearly thirty when he came in  then how very soft you must have been to go out said miss fitzgibbon  not in the least soft continued barrington erle we could not command our men and were bound to go out for aught we knew some score of them might have chosen to support lord de terrier and then we should have owned ourselves beaten for the time  you were beatenhollow said miss fitzgibbon  then why did lord de terrier dissolve  a prime minister is quite right to dissolve in such a position said lord brentford he must do so for the queens sake it is his only chance  just so it is as you say his only chance and it is his right his very possession of power will give him near a score of votes and if he thinks that he has a chance let him try it we maintain that he had no chance and that he must have known that he had nonethat if he could not get on with the late house he certainly could not get on with a new house we let him have his own way as far as we could in february we had failed last summer and if he could get along he was welcome but he could not get along  i must say i think he was right to dissolve said lady laura  and we are right to force the consequences upon him as quickly as we can he practically lost nine seats by his dissolution look at loughshane  yes look at loughshane said miss fitzgibbon the country at any rate has gained something there  its an ill wind that blows nobody any good mr finn said the earl  what on earth is to become of poor george said mr fitzgibbon i wonder whether any one knows where he is george wasnt a bad sort of fellow  roby used to think that he was a very bad fellow said mr bonteen roby used to swear that it was hopeless trying to catch him it may be as well to explain that mr roby was a conservative gentleman of great fame who had for years acted as whip under mr daubeny and who now filled the high office of patronage secretary to the treasury i believe in my heart continued mr bonteen that roby is rejoiced that poor george morris should be out in the cold  if seats were halveable he should share mine for the sake of auld lang syne said laurence fitzgibbon  but not tomorrow night said barrington erle the division tomorrow will be a thing not to be joked with upon my word i think theyre right about old moody all private considerations should give way and as for gunning id have him up or id know the reason why  and shall we have no defaulters barrington asked lady laura  im not going to boast but i dont know of one for whom we need blush sir everard powell is so bad with gout that he cant even bear any one to look at him but ratler says that hell bring him up mr ratler was in those days the whip on the liberal side of the house  unfortunate wretch said miss fitzgibbon  the worst of it is that he screams in his paroxysms said mr bonteen  and you mean to say that youll take him into the lobby said lady laura  undoubtedly said barrington erle why not he has no business with a seat if he cant vote but sir everard is a good man and hell be there if laudanum and bathchair make it possible  the same kind of conversation went on during the whole of dinner and became if anything more animated when the three ladies had left the room mr kennedy made but one remark and then he observed that as far as he could see a majority of nineteen would be as serviceable as a majority of twenty this he said in a very mild voice and in a tone that was intended to be expressive of doubt but in spite of his humility barrington erle flew at him almost savagelyas though a liberal member of the house of commons was disgraced by so mean a spirit and phineas found himself despising the man for his want of zeal  if we are to beat them let us beat them well said phineas  let there be no doubt about it said barrington erle  i should like to see every man with a seat polled said bonteen  poor sir everard said lord brentford it will kill him no doubt but i suppose the seat is safe  oh yes llanwrwsth is quite safe said barrington in his eagerness omitting to catch lord brentfords grim joke  phineas went up into the drawingroom for a few minutes after dinner and was eagerly desirous of saying a few more wordshe knew not what wordsto lady laura mr kennedy and mr bonteen had left the diningroom first and phineas again found mr kennedy standing close to lady lauras shoulder could it be possible that there was anything in it mr kennedy was an unmarried man with an immense fortune a magnificent place a seat in parliament and was not perhaps above forty years of age there could be no reason why he should not ask lady laura to be his wifeexcept indeed that he did not seem to have sufficient words at command to ask anybody for anything but could it be that such a woman as lady laura could accept such a man as mr kennedy because of his wealth and because of his fine placea man who had not a word to throw to a dog who did not seem to be possessed of an idea who hardly looked like a gentlemanso phineas told himself but in truth mr kennedy though he was a plain unattractive man with nothing in his personal appearance to call for remark was not unlike a gentleman in his usual demeanour phineas himself it may be here said was six feet high and very handsome with bright blue eyes and brown wavy hair and light silken beard mrs low had told her husband more than once that he was much too handsome to do any good mr low however had replied that young finn had never shown himself to be conscious of his own personal advantages hell learn it soon enough said mrs low some woman will tell him and then hell be spoilt i do not think that phineas depended much as yet on his own good looks but he felt that mr kennedy ought to be despised by such a one as lady laura standish because his looks were not good and she must despise him it could not be that a woman so full of life should be willing to put up with a man who absolutely seemed to have no life within him and yet why was he there and why was he allowed to hang about just over her shoulders phineas finn began to feel himself to be an injured man  but lady laura had the power of dispelling instantly this sense of injury she had done it effectually in the diningroom by calling him to the seat by her side to the express exclusion of the millionaire and she did it again now by walking away from mr kennedy to the spot on which phineas had placed himself somewhat sulkily  of course youll be at the club on friday morning after the division she said  no doubt  when you leave it come and tell me what are your impressions and what you think of mr daubenys speech therell be nothing done in the house before four and youll be able to run up to me  certainly i will  i have asked mr kennedy to come and mr fitzgibbon i am so anxious about it that i want to hear what different people say you know perhaps that papa is to be in the cabinet if theres a change  is he indeed  oh yesand youll come up  of course i will do you expect to hear much of an opinion from mr kennedy  yes i do you dont quite know mr kennedy yet and you must remember that he will say more to me than he will to you hes not quick you know as you are and he has no enthusiasm on any subjectbut he has opinions and sound opinions too phineas felt that lady laura was in a slight degree scolding him for the disrespectful manner in which he had spoken of mr kennedy and he felt also that he had committed himselfthat he had shown himself to be sore and that she had seen and understood his soreness  the truth is i do not know him said he trying to correct his blunder  nonot as yet but i hope that you may some day as he is one of those men who are both useful and estimable  i do not know that i can use him said phineas but if you wish it i will endeavour to esteem him  i wish you to do bothbut that will all come in due time i think it probable that in the early autumn there will be a great gathering of the real whig liberals at loughlinterof those i mean who have their heart in it and are at the same time gentlemen if it is so i should be sorry that you should not be there you need not mention it but mr kennedy has just said a word about it to papa and a word from him always means so much wellgoodnight and mind you come up on friday you are going to the club now of course i envy you men your clubs more than i do the housethough i feel that a womans life is only half a life as she cannot have a seat in parliament  then phineas went away and walked down to pall mall with laurence fitzgibbon he would have preferred to take his walk alone but he could not get rid of his affectionate countryman he wanted to think over what had taken place during the evening and indeed he did so in spite of his friends conversation lady laura when she first saw him after his return to london had told him how anxious her father was to congratulate him on his seat but the earl had not spoken a word to him on the subject the earl had been courteous as hosts customarily are but had been in no way specially kind to him and then mr kennedy as to going to loughlinter he would not do such a thingnot though the success of the liberal party were to depend on it he declared to himself that there were some things which a man could not do but although he was not altogether satisfied with what had occurred in portman square he felt as he walked down arminarm with fitzgibbon that mr low and mr lows counsels must be scattered to the winds he had thrown the die in consenting to stand for loughshane and must stand the hazard of the cast  bedad phin my boy i dont think youre listening to me at all said laurence fitzgibbon  im listening to every word you say said phineas  and if i have to go down to the ould country again this session youll go with me  if i can i will  thats my boy and its i that hope youll have the chance whats the good of turning these fellows out if one isnt to get something for ones trouble     chapter vii  mr and mrs bunce   it was three oclock on the thursday night before mr daubenys speech was finished i do not think that there was any truth in the allegation made at the time that he continued on his legs an hour longer than the necessities of his speech required in order that five or six very ancient whigs might be wearied out and shrink to their beds let a whig have been ever so ancient and ever so weary he would not have been allowed to depart from westminster hall that night sir everard powell was there in his bathchair at twelve with a doctor on one side of him and a friend on the other in some purlieu of the house and did his duty like a fine old briton as he was that speech of mr daubenys will never be forgotten by any one who heard it its studied bitterness had perhaps never been equalled and yet not a word was uttered for the saying of which he could be accused of going beyond the limits of parliamentary antagonism it is true that personalities could not have been closer that accusations of political dishonesty and of almost worse than political cowardice and falsehood could not have been clearer that no words in the language could have attributed meaner motives or more unscrupulous conduct but nevertheless mr daubeny in all that he said was parliamentary and showed himself to be a gladiator thoroughly well trained for the arena in which he had descended to the combat his arrows were poisoned and his lance was barbed and his shot was heated redbecause such things are allowed he did not poison his enemies wells or use greek fire because those things are not allowed he knew exactly the rules of the combat mr mildmay sat and heard him without once raising his hat from his brow or speaking a word to his neighbour men on both sides of the house said that mr mildmay suffered terribly but as mr mildmay uttered no word of complaint to any one and was quite ready to take mr daubeny by the hand the next time they met in company i do not know that any one was able to form a true idea of mr mildmays feelings mr mildmay was an impassive man who rarely spoke of his own feelings and no doubt sat with his hat low down over his eyes in order that no man might judge of them on that occasion by the impression on his features if he could have left off half an hour earlier it would have been perfect as an attack said barrington erle in criticising mr daubenys speech but he allowed himself to sink into comparative weakness and the glory of it was over before the endthen came the division the liberals had 333 votes to 314 for the conservatives and therefore counted a majority of 19 it was said that so large a number of members had never before voted at any division  i own im disappointed said barrington erle to mr ratler  i thought there would be twenty said mr ratler i never went beyond that i knew they would have old moody up but i thought gunning would have been too hard for them  they say theyve promised them both peerages  yesif they remain in but they know theyre going out  they must go with such a majority against them said barrington erle  of course they must said mr ratler lord de terrier wants nothing better but it is rather hard upon poor daubeny i never saw such an unfortunate old tantalus  he gets a good drop of real water now and again and i dont pity him in the least hes clever of course and has made his own way but ive always a feeling that he has no business where he is i suppose we shall know all about it at brookss by one oclock tomorrow  phineas though it had been past five before he went to bedfor there had been much triumphant talking to be done among liberal members after the divisionwas up at his breakfast at mrs bunces lodgings by nine there was a matter which he was called upon to settle immediately in which mrs bunce herself was much interested and respecting which he had promised to give an answer on this very morning a set of very dingy chambers up two pairs of stairs at no 9 old square lincolns inn to which mr low had recommended him to transfer himself and all his belongings were waiting his occupation should he resolve upon occupying them if he intended to commence operations as a barrister it would be necessary that he should have chambers and a clerk and before he had left mr lows house on sunday evening he had almost given that gentleman authority to secure for him these rooms at no 9 whether you remain in parliament or no you must make a beginning mr low had said and how are you even to pretend to begin if you dont have chambers mr low hoped that he might be able to wean phineas away from his parliament baublethat he might induce the young barrister to give up his madness if not this session or the next at any rate before a third year had commenced mr low was a persistent man liking very much when he did like and loving very strongly when he did love he would have many a tug for phineas finn before he would allow that false westminster satan to carry off the prey as altogether his own if he could only get phineas into the dingy chambers he might do much  but phineas had now become so imbued with the atmosphere of politics had been so breathed upon by lady laura and barrington erle that he could no longer endure the thought of any other life than that of a life spent among the lobbies a desire to help to beat the conservatives had fastened on his very soul and almost made mr low odious in his eyes he was afraid of mr low and for the nonce would not go to him any morebut he must see the porter at lincolns inn he must write a line to mr low and he must tell mrs bunce that for the present he would still keep on her rooms his letter to mr low was as follows      great marlborough street may 186     my dear low     i have made up my mind against taking the chambers and am    now off to the inn to say that i shall not want them of    course i know what you will think of me and it is very    grievous to me to have to bear the hard judgment of a man    whose opinion i value so highly but in the teeth of your    terribly strong arguments i think that there is something    to be said on my side of the question this seat in    parliament has come in my way by chance and i think it    would be pusillanimous in me to reject it feeling as i    do that a seat in parliament confers very great honour i    am too very fond of politics and regard legislation as    the finest profession going had i any one dependent on    me i probably might not be justified in following the    bent of my inclination but i am all alone in the world    and therefore have a right to make the attempt if after    a trial of one or two sessions i should fail in that    which i am attempting it will not even then be too late    to go back to the better way i can assure you that at any    rate it is not my intention to be idle     i know very well how you will fret and fume over what i    say and how utterly i shall fail in bringing you round to    my way of thinking but as i must write to tell you of my    decision i cannot refrain from defending myself to the    best of my ability     yours always faithfully     phineas finn   mr low received this letter at his chambers and when he had read it he simply pressed his lips closely together placed the sheet of paper back in its envelope and put it into a drawer at his left hand having done this he went on with what work he had before him as though his friends decision were a matter of no consequence to him as far as he was concerned the thing was done and there should be an end of it so he told himself but nevertheless his mind was full of it all day and though he wrote not a word of answer to phineas he made a reply within his own mind to every one of the arguments used in the letter great honour how can there be honour in what comes as he says by chance he hasnt sense enough to understand that the honour comes from the mode of winning it and from the mode of wearing it and that the very fact of his being member for loughshane at this instant simply proves that loughshane should have had no privilege to return a member no one dependent on him are not his father and his mother and his sisters dependent on him as long as he must eat their bread till he can earn bread of his own he will never earn bread of his own he will always be eating bread that others have earned in this way before the day was over mr low became very angry and swore to himself that he would have nothing more to say to phineas finn but yet he found himself creating plans for encountering and conquering the parliamentary fiend who was at present so cruelly potent with his pupil it was not till the third evening that he told his wife that finn had made up his mind not to take chambers then i would have nothing more to say to him said mrs low savagely for the present i can have nothing more to say to him but neither now nor ever said mrs low with great emphasis he has been false to you no said mr low who was a man thoroughly and thoughtfully just at all points he has not been false to me he has always meant what he has said when he was saying it but he is weak and blind and flies like a moth to the candle one pities the poor moth and would save him a stump of his wing if it be possible  phineas when he had written his letter to mr low started off for lincolns inn making his way through the wellknown dreary streets of soho and through st giless to long acre he knew every corner well for he had walked the same road almost daily for the last three years he had conceived a liking for the route which he might easily have changed without much addition to the distance by passing through oxford street and holborn but there was an air of business on which he prided himself in going by the most direct passage and he declared to himself very often that things dreary and dingy to the eye might be good in themselves lincolns inn itself is dingy and the law courts therein are perhaps the meanest in which equity ever disclosed herself mr lows three rooms in the old square each of them brown with the binding of law books and with the dust collected on law papers and with furniture that had been brown always and had become browner with years were perhaps as unattractive to the eye of a young pupil as any rooms which were ever entered and the study of the chancery law itself is not an alluring pursuit till the mind has come to have some insight into the beauty of its ultimate object phineas during his three years course of reasoning on these things had taught himself to believe that things ugly on the outside might be very beautiful within and had therefore come to prefer crossing poland street and soho square and so continuing his travels by the seven dials and long acre his morning walk was of a piece with his morning studies and he took pleasure in the gloom of both but now the taste of his palate had been already changed by the glare of the lamps in and about palatial westminster and he found that st giless was disagreeable the ways about pall mall and across the park to parliament street or to the treasury were much pleasanter and the new offices in downing street already half built absorbed all that interest which he had hitherto been able to take in the suggested but uncommenced erection of new law courts in the neighbourhood of lincolns inn as he made his way to the porters lodge under the great gateway of lincolns inn he told himself that he was glad that he had escaped at any rate for a while from a life so dull and dreary if he could only sit in chambers at the treasury instead of chambers in that old court how much pleasanter it would be after all as regarded that question of income it might well be that the treasury chambers should be the more remunerative and the more quickly remunerative of the two and as he thought lady laura might be compatible with the treasury chambers and parliament but could not possibly be made compatible with old square lincolns inn  but nevertheless there came upon him a feeling of sorrow when the old man at the lodge seemed to be rather glad than otherwise that he did not want the chambers then mr green can have them said the porter thatll be good news for mr green i dont know what the genlemen ll do for chambers if things goes on as theyre going mr green was welcome to the chambers as far as phineas was concerned but phineas felt nevertheless a certain amount of regret that he should have been compelled to abandon a thing which was regarded both by the porter and by mr green as being so desirable he had however written his letter to mr low and made his promise to barrington erle and was bound to lady laura standish and he walked out through the old gateway into chancery lane resolving that he would not even visit lincolns inn again for a year there were certain bookslaw bookswhich he would read at such intervals of leisure as politics might give him but within the precincts of the inns of court he would not again put his foot for twelve months let learned pundits of the lawsuch for instance as mr and mrs lowsay what they might  he had told mrs bunce before he left his home after breakfast that he should for the present remain under her roof she had been much gratified not simply because lodgings in great marlborough street are less readily let than chambers in lincolns inn but also because it was a great honour to her to have a member of parliament in her house members of parliament are not so common about oxford street as they are in the neighbourhood of pall mall and st jamess square but mr bunce when he came home to his dinner did not join as heartily as he should have done in his wifes rejoicing mr bunce was in the employment of certain copying lawstationers in carey street and had a strong belief in the law as a professionbut he had none whatever in the house of commons and hes given up going into chambers said mr bunce to his wife  given it up altogether for the present said mrs bunce  and he dont mean to have no clerk said mr bunce  not unless it is for his parliament work  there aint no clerks wanted for that and whats worse there aint no fees to pay em ill tell you what it is janeif you dont look sharp there wont be nothing to pay you before long  and he in parliament jacob  there aint no salary for being in parliament there are scores of them parliament gents aint got so much asll pay their dinners for em and then if anybody does trust em theres no getting at em to make em pay as there is at other folk  i dont know that our mr phineas will ever be like that jacob  thats gammon jane thats the way as women gets themselves took in always our mr phineas why should our mr phineas be better than anybody else  hes always acted handsome jacob  there was one time he could not pay his lodgings for wellnigh nine months till his governor come down with the money i dont know whether that was handsome it knocked me about terrible i know  he always meant honest jacob  i dont know that i care much for a mans meaning when he runs short of money how is he going to see his way with his seat in parliament and this giving up of his profession he owes us near a quarter now  he paid me two months this morning jacob so he dont owe a farthing  very wellso much the better for us i shall just have a few words with mr low and see what he says to it for myself i dont think half so much of parliament folk as some do theyre for promising everything before theys elected but not one in twenty of em is as good as his word when he gets there  mr bunce was a copying journeyman who spent ten hours a day in carey street with a pen between his fingers and after that he would often spend two or three hours of the night with a pen between his fingers in marlborough street he was a thoroughly hardworking man doing pretty well in the world for he had a good house over his head and always could find raiment and bread for his wife and eight children but nevertheless he was an unhappy man because he suffered from political grievances or i should more correctly say that his grievances were semipolitical and semisocial he had no vote not being himself the tenant of the house in great marlborough street the tenant was a tailor who occupied the shop whereas bunce occupied the whole of the remainder of the premises he was a lodger and lodgers were not as yet trusted with the franchise and he had ideas which he himself admitted to be very raw as to the injustice of the manner in which he was paid for his work so much a folio without reference to the way in which his work was done without regard to the success of his work with no questions asked of himself was as he thought no proper way of remunerating a man for his labours he had long since joined a trade union and for two years past had paid a subscription of a shilling a week towards its funds he longed to be doing some battle against his superiors and to be putting himself in opposition to his employersnot that he objected personally to messrs foolscap margin and vellum who always made much of him as a useful manbut because some such antagonism would be manly and the fighting of some battle would be the right thing to do if labour dont mean to go to the wall himself bunce would say to his wife labour must look alive and put somebody else there  mrs bunce was a comfortable motherly woman who loved her husband but hated politics as he had an aversion to his superiors in the world because they were superiors so had she a liking for them for the same reason she despised people poorer than herself and thought it a fair subject for boasting that her children always had meat for dinner if it was ever so small a morsel she took care that they had it in order that the boast might be maintained the world had once or twice been almost too much for herwhen for instance her husband had been ill and again to tell the truth for the last three months of that long period in which phineas had omitted to pay his bills but she had kept a fine brave heart during those troubles and could honestly swear that the children always had a bit of meat though she herself had been occasionally without it for days together at such times she would be more than ordinarily meek to mr margin and especially courteous to the old lady who lodged in her firstfloor drawingroomfor phineas lived up two pairs of stairsand she would excuse such servility by declaring that there was no knowing how soon she might want assistance but her husband in such emergencies would become furious and quarrelsome and would declare that labour was going to the wall and that something very strong must be done at once that shilling which bunce paid weekly to the union she regarded as being absolutely thrown awayas much so as though he cast it weekly into the thames and she had told him so over and over again making heartpiercing allusions to the eight children and to the bit of meat he would always endeavour to explain to her that there was no other way under the sun for keeping labour from being sent to the wallbut he would do so hopelessly and altogether ineffectually and she had come to regard him as a lunatic to the extent of that one weekly shilling  she had a womans instinctive partiality for comeliness in a man and was very fond of phineas finn because he was handsome and now she was very proud of him because he was a member of parliament she had heardfrom her husband who had told her the fact with much disgustthat the sons of dukes and earls go into parliament and she liked to think that the fine young man to whom she talked more or less every day should sit with the sons of dukes and earls when phineas had really brought distress upon her by owing her some thirty or forty pounds she could never bring herself to be angry with himbecause he was handsome and because he dined out with lords and she had triumphed greatly over her husband who had desired to be severe upon his aristocratic debtor when the money had all been paid in a lump  i dont know that hes any great catch bunce had said when the prospect of their lodgers departure had been debated between them  jacob said his wife i dont think you feel it when youve got people respectable about you  the only respectable man i know said jacob is the man as earns his bread and mr finn as i take it is a long way from that yet  phineas returned to his lodgings before he went down to his club and again told mrs bunce that he had altogether made up his mind about the chambers if youll keep me i shall stay here for the first session i daresay  of course we shall be only too proud mr finn and though it maynt perhaps be quite the place for a member of parliament  but i think it is quite the place  its very good of you to say so mr finn and well do our very best to make you comfortable respectable we are i may say and though bunce is a bit rough sometimes  never to me mrs bunce  but he is roughand silly too with his radical nonsense paying a shilling a week to a nasty union just for nothing still he means well and there aint a man who works harder for his wife and childrenthat i will say of him and if he do talk politics  but i like a man to talk politics mrs bunce  for a gentleman in parliament of course its proper but i never could see what good it could do to a lawstationer and when he talks of labour going to the wall i always ask him whether he didnt get his wages regular last saturday but lord love you mr finn when a man as is a journeyman has took up politics and joined a trade union he aint no better than a milestone for his wife to take and talk to him  after that phineas went down to the reform club and made one of those who were buzzing there in little crowds and uttering their prophecies as to future events lord de terrier was to go out that was certain whether mr mildmay was to come in was uncertain that he would go to windsor tomorrow morning was not to be doubted but it was thought very probable that he might plead his age and decline to undertake the responsibility of forming a ministry  and what then said phineas to his friend fitzgibbon  why then there will be a choice out of three there is the duke who is the most incompetent man in england there is monk who is the most unfit and there is gresham who is the most unpopular i cant conceive it possible to find a worse prime minister than either of the threebut the country affords no other  and which would mildmay name  all of themone after the other so as to make the embarrassment the greater that was mr fitzgibbons description of the crisis but then it was understood that mr fitzgibbon was given to romancing     chapter viii  the news about mr mildmay and sir everard   fitzgibbon and phineas started together from pall mall for portman squareas both of them had promised to call on lady laurabut fitzgibbon turned in at brookss as they walked up st jamess square and phineas went on by himself in a cab you should belong here said fitzgibbon as his friend entered the cab and phineas immediately began to feel that he would have done nothing till he could get into brookss it might be very well to begin by talking politics at the reform club such talking had procured for him his seat at loughshane but that was done now and something more than talking was wanted for any further progress nothing as he told himself of political import was managed at the reform club no influence from thence was ever brought to bear upon the adjustment of places under the government or upon the arrangement of cabinets it might be very well to count votes at the reform club but after the votes had been countedhad been counted successfullybrookss was the place as phineas believed to learn at the earliest moment what would be the exact result of the success he must get into brookss if it might be possible for him fitzgibbon was not exactly the man to propose him perhaps the earl of brentford would do it  lady laura was at home and with her was sittingmr kennedy phineas had intended to be triumphant as he entered lady lauras room he was there with the express purpose of triumphing in the success of their great party and of singing a pleasant paean in conjunction with lady laura but his trumpet was put out of tune at once when he saw mr kennedy he said hardly a word as he gave his hand to lady lauraand then afterwards to mr kennedy who chose to greet him with this show of cordiality  i hope you are satisfied mr finn said lady laura laughing  oh yes  and is that all i thought to have found your joy quite irrepressible  a bottle of sodawater though it is a very lively thing when opened wont maintain its vivacity beyond a certain period lady laura  and you have had your gas let off already  wellyes at any rate the sputtering part of it nineteen is very well but the question is whether we might not have had twentyone  mr kennedy has just been saying that not a single available vote has been missed on our side he has just come from brookss and that seems to be what they say there  so mr kennedy also was a member of brookss at the reform club there certainly had been an idea that the number might have been swelled to twentyone but then as phineas began to understand nothing was correctly known at the reform club for an accurate appreciation of the political balance of the day you must go to brookss  mr kennedy must of course be right said phineas i dont belong to brookss myself but i was only joking lady laura there is i suppose no doubt that lord de terrier is out and that is everything  he has probably tendered his resignation said mr kennedy  that is the same thing said phineas roughly  not exactly said lady laura should there be any difficulty about mr mildmay he might at the queens request make another attempt  with a majority of nineteen against him said phineas surely mr mildmay is not the only man in the country there is the duke and there is mr greshamand there is mr monk phineas had at his tongues end all the lesson that he had been able to learn at the reform club  i should hardly think the duke would venture said mr kennedy  nothing venture nothing have said phineas it is all very well to say that the duke is incompetent but i do not know that anything very wonderful is required in the way of genius the duke has held his own in both houses successfully and he is both honest and popular i quite agree that a prime minister at the present day should be commonly honest and more than commonly popular  so you are all for the duke are you said lady laura again smiling as she spoke to him  certainlyif we are deserted by mr mildmay dont you think so  i dont find it quite so easy to make up my mind as you do i am inclined to think that mr mildmay will form a government and as long as there is that prospect i need hardly commit myself to an opinion as to his probable successor then the objectionable mr kennedy took his leave and phineas was left alone with lady laura  it is gloriousis it not he began as soon as he found the field to be open for himself and his own manoeuvring but he was very young and had not as yet learned the manner in which he might best advance his cause with such a woman as lady laura standish he was telling her too clearly that he could have no gratification in talking with her unless he could be allowed to have her all to himself that might be very well if lady laura were in love with him but would hardly be the way to reduce her to that condition  mr finn said she smiling as she spoke i am sure that you did not mean it but you were uncourteous to my friend mr kennedy  who i was i upon my word i didnt intend to be uncourteous  if i had thought you had intended it of course i could not tell you of it and now i take the libertyfor it is a liberty  oh no  because i feel so anxious that you should do nothing to mar your chances as a rising man  you are only too kind to mealways  i know how clever you are and how excellent are all your instincts but i see that you are a little impetuous i wonder whether you will be angry if i take upon myself the task of mentor  nothing you could say would make me angrythough you might make me very unhappy  i will not do that if i can help it a mentor ought to be very old you know and i am infinitely older than you are  i should have thought it was the reverseindeed i may say that i know that it is said phineas  i am not talking of years years have very little to do with the comparative ages of men and women a woman at forty is quite old whereas a man at forty is young phineas remembering that he had put down mr kennedys age as forty in his own mind frowned when he heard this and walked about the room in displeasure and therefore continued lady laura i talk to you as though i were a kind of grandmother  you shall be my greatgrandmother if you will only be kind enough to me to say what you really think  you must not then be so impetuous and you must be a little more careful to be civil to persons to whom you may not take any particular fancy now mr kennedy is a man who may be very useful to you  i do not want mr kennedy to be of use to me  that is what i call being impetuousbeing youngbeing a boy why should not mr kennedy be of use to you as well as any one else you do not mean to conquer the world all by yourself  nobut there is something mean to me in the expressed idea that i should make use of any manand more especially of a man whom i dont like  and why do you not like him mr finn  because he is one of my dr fells  you dont like him simply because he does not talk much that may be a good reason why you should not make of him an intimate companionbecause you like talkative people but it should be no ground for dislike  phineas paused for a moment before he answered her thinking whether or not it would be well to ask her some question which might produce from her a truth which he would not like to hear then he did ask it and do you like him he said  she too paused but only for a second yesi think i may say that i do like him  no more than that  certainly no more than thatbut that i think is a great deal  i wonder what you would say if any one asked you whether you liked me said phineas looking away from her through the window  just the samebut without the doubt if the person who questioned me had any right to ask the question there are not above one or two who could have such a right  and i was wrong of course to ask it about mr kennedy said phineas looking out into the square  i did not say so  but i see you think it  you see nothing of the kind i was quite willing to be asked the question by you and quite willing to answer it mr kennedy is a man of great wealth  what can that have to do with it  wait a moment you impetuous irish boy and hear me out phineas liked being called an impetuous irish boy and came close to her sitting where he could look up into her face and there came a smile upon his own and he was very handsome i say that he is a man of great wealth continued lady laura and as wealth gives influence he is of great usepoliticallyto the party to which he belongs  oh politically  am i to suppose you care nothing for politics to such men to men who think as you think who are to sit on the same benches with yourself and go into the same lobby and be seen at the same club it is your duty to be civil both for your own sake and for that of the cause it is for the hermits of society to indulge in personal dislikingsfor men who have never been active and never mean to be active i had been telling mr kennedy how much i thought of youas a good liberal  and i came in and spoilt it all  yes you did you knocked down my little house and i must build it all up again  dont trouble yourself lady laura  i shall it will be a great deal of troublea great deal indeed but i shall take it i mean you to be very intimate with mr kennedy and to shoot his grouse and to stalk his deer and to help to keep him in progress as a liberal member of parliament i am quite prepared to admit as a friend that he would go back without some such help  ohi understand  i do not believe that you do understand at all but i must endeavour to make you do so by degrees if you are to be my political pupil you must at any rate be obedient the next time you meet mr kennedy ask him his opinion instead of telling him your own he has been in parliament twelve years and he was a good deal older than you when he began at this moment a side door was opened and the redhaired redbearded man whom phineas had seen before entered the room he hesitated a moment as though he were going to retreat again and then began to pull about the books and toys which lay on one of the distant tables as though he were in quest of some article and he would have retreated had not lady laura called to him  oswald she said let me introduce you to mr finn mr finn i do not think you have ever met my brother lord chiltern then the two young men bowed and each of them muttered something do not be in a hurry oswald you have nothing special to take you away here is mr finn come to tell us who are all the possible new prime ministers he is uncivil enough not to have named papa  my father is out of the question said lord chiltern  of course he is said lady laura but i may be allowed my little joke  i suppose he will at any rate be in the cabinet said phineas  i know nothing whatever about politics said lord chiltern  i wish you did said his sisterwith all my heart  i never didand i never shall for all your wishing its the meanest trade going i think and im sure its the most dishonest they talk of legs on the turf and of course there are legs but what are they to the legs in the house i dont know whether you are in parliament mr finn  yes i am but do not mind me  i beg your pardon of course there are honest men there and no doubt you are one of them  he is indifferent honestas yet said lady laura  i was speaking of men who go into parliament to look after government places said lord chiltern  that is just what im doing said phineas why should not a man serve the crown he has to work very hard for what he earns  i dont believe that the most of them work at all however i beg your pardon i didnt mean you in particular  mr finn is such a thorough politician that he will never forgive you said lady laura  yes i will said phineas and ill convert him some day if he does come into the house lady laura i suppose hell come on the right side  ill never go into the house as you call it said lord chiltern but ill tell you what i shall be very happy if youll dine with me tomorrow at moronis they give you a capital little dinner at moronis and theyve the best ch√¢teau yquem in london  do said lady laura in a whisper oblige me  phineas was engaged to dine with one of the vicechancellors on the day named he had never before dined at the house of this great law luminary whose acquaintance he had made through mr low and he had thought a great deal of the occasion mrs freemantle had sent him the invitation nearly a fortnight ago and he understood there was to be an elaborate dinner party he did not know it for a fact but he was in hopes of meeting the expiring lord chancellor he considered it to be his duty never to throw away such a chance he would in all respects have preferred mr freemantles dinner in eaton place dull and heavy though it might probably be to the chance of lord chilterns companions at moronis whatever might be the faults of our hero he was not given to what is generally called dissipation by the world at largeby which the world means selfindulgence he cared not a brass farthing for moronis ch√¢teau yquem nor for the wondrously studied repast which he would doubtless find prepared for him at that celebrated establishment in st jamess streetnot a farthing as compared with the chance of meeting so great a man as lord moles and lord chilterns friends might probably be just the men whom he would not desire to know but lady lauras request overrode everything with him she had asked him to oblige her and of course he would do so had he been going to dine with the incoming prime minister he would have put off his engagement at her request he was not quick enough to make an answer without hesitation but after a moments pause he said he should be most happy to dine with lord chiltern at moronis  thats right 730 sharponly i can tell you you wont meet any other members then the servant announced more visitors and lord chiltern escaped out of the room before he was seen by the new comers these were mrs bonteen and laurence fitzgibbon and then mr bonteenand after them mr ratler the whip who was in a violent hurry and did not stay there a moment and then barrington erle and young lord james fitzhoward the youngest son of the duke of st bungay in twenty or thirty minutes there was a gathering of liberal political notabilities in lady lauras drawingroom there were two great pieces of news by which they were all enthralled mr mildmay would not be prime minister and sir everard powell wasdead of course nothing quite positive could be known about mr mildmay he was to be with the queen at windsor on the morrow at eleven oclock and it was improbable that he would tell his mind to any one before he told it to her majesty but there was no doubt that he had engaged the dukeso he was called by lord jamesto go down to windsor with him that he might be in readiness if wanted i have learned that at home said lord james who had just heard the news from his sister who had heard it from the duchess lord james was delighted with the importance given to him by his fathers coming journey from this and from other equally wellknown circumstances it was surmised that mr mildmay would decline the task proposed to him this nevertheless was only a surmisewhereas the fact with reference to sir everard was fully substantiated the gout had flown to his stomach and he was dead by  yes as dead as a herring said mr ratler who at that moment however was not within hearing of either of the ladies present and then he rubbed his hands and looked as though he were delighted and he was delightednot because his old friend sir everard was dead but by the excitement of the tragedy having done so good a deed in his last moments said laurence fitzgibbon we may take it for granted that he will go straight to heaven i hope there will be no crowners quest ratler said mr bonteen if there is i dont know how youll get out of it i dont see anything in it so horrible said mr ratler if a fellow dies leading his regiment we dont think anything of it sir everards vote was of more service to his country than anything that a colonel or a captain can do but nevertheless i think that mr ratler was somewhat in dread of future newspaper paragraphs should it be found necessary to summon a coroners inquisition to sit upon poor sir everard  while this was going on lady laura took phineas apart for a moment i am so much obliged to you i am indeed she said  what nonsense  never mind whether its nonsense or notbut i am i cant explain it all now but i do so want you to know my brother you may be of the greatest service to himof the very greatest he is not half so bad as people say he is in many ways he is very goodvery good and he is very clever  at any rate i will think and believe no ill of him  just sodo not believe evil of himnot more evil than you see i am so anxiousso very anxious to try to put him on his legs and i find it so difficult to get any connecting link with him papa will not speak with himbecause of money  but he is friends with you  yes i think he loves me i saw how distasteful it was to you to go to himand probably you were engaged  one can always get off those sort of things if there is an object  yesjust so and the object was to oblige mewas it not  of course it was but i must go now we are to hear daubenys statement at four and i would not miss it for worlds  i wonder whether you would go abroad with my brother in the autumn but i have no right to think of such a thinghave i at any rate i will not think of it yet goodbyei shall see you perhaps on sunday if you are in town  phineas walked down to westminster with his mind very full of lady laura and lord chiltern what did she mean by her affectionate manner to himself and what did she mean by the continual praises which she lavished upon mr kennedy of whom was she thinking most of mr kennedy or of him she had called herself his mentor was the description of her feelings towards himself as conveyed in that name of a kind to be gratifying to him nohe thought not but then might it not be within his power to change the nature of those feelings she was not in love with him at present he could not make any boast to himself on that head but it might be within his power to compel her to love him the female mentor might be softened that she could not love mr kennedy he thought that he was quite sure there was nothing like love in her manner to mr kennedy as to lord chiltern phineas would do whatever might be in his power all that he really knew of lord chiltern was that he had gambled and that he had drunk     chapter ix  the new government   in the house of lords that night and in the house of commons the outgoing ministers made their explanations as our business at the present moment is with the commons we will confine ourselves to their chamber and will do so the more willingly because the upshot of what was said in the two places was the same the outgoing ministers were very grave very selflaudatory and very courteous in regard to courtesy it may be declared that no stranger to the ways of the place could have understood how such soft words could be spoken by mr daubeny beaten so quickly after the very sharp words which he had uttered when he only expected to be beaten he announced to his fellowcommoners that his right honourable friend and colleague lord de terrier had thought it right to retire from the treasury lord de terrier in constitutional obedience to the vote of the lower house had resigned and the queen had been graciously pleased to accept lord de terriers resignation mr daubeny could only inform the house that her majesty had signified her pleasure that mr mildmay should wait upon her tomorrow at eleven oclock mr mildmayso mr daubeny understoodwould be with her majesty tomorrow at that hour lord de terrier had found it to be his duty to recommend her majesty to send for mr mildmay such was the real import of mr daubenys speech that further portion of it in which he explained with blandest most beneficent honeyflowing words that his party would have done everything that the country could require of any party had the house allowed it to remain on the treasury benches for a month or twoand explained also that his party would never recriminate would never return evil for evil would in no wise copy the factious opposition of their adversaries that his party would now as it ever had done carry itself with the meekness of the dove and the wisdom of the serpentall this i say was so generally felt by gentlemen on both sides of the house to be leather and prunella that very little attention was paid to it the great point was that lord de terrier had resigned and that mr mildmay had been summoned to windsor  the queen had sent for mr mildmay in compliance with advice given to her by lord de terrier and yet lord de terrier and his first lieutenant had used all the most practised efforts of their eloquence for the last three days in endeavouring to make their countrymen believe that no more unfitting minister than mr mildmay ever attempted to hold the reins of office nothing had been too bad for them to say of mr mildmayand yet in the very first moment in which they found themselves unable to carry on the government themselves they advised the queen to send for that most incompetent and baneful statesman we who are conversant with our own methods of politics see nothing odd in this because we are used to it but surely in the eyes of strangers our practice must be very singular there is nothing like it in any other countrynothing as yet nowhere else is there the same goodhumoured affectionate prizefighting ferocity in politics the leaders of our two great parties are to each other exactly as are the two champions of the ring who knock each other about for the belt and for five hundred pounds a side once in every two years how they fly at each other striking as though each blow should carry death if it were but possible and yet there is no one whom the birmingham bantam respects so highly as he does bill burns the brighton bully or with whom he has so much delight in discussing the merits of a pot of halfandhalf and so it was with mr daubeny and mr mildmay in private life mr daubeny almost adulated his elder rivaland mr mildmay never omitted an opportunity of taking mr daubeny warmly by the hand it is not so in the united states there the same political enmity exists but the political enmity produces private hatred the leaders of parties there really mean what they say when they abuse each other and are in earnest when they talk as though they were about to tear each other limb from limb i doubt whether mr daubeny would have injured a hair of mr mildmays venerable head even for an assurance of six continued months in office  when mr daubeny had completed his statement mr mildmay simply told the house that he had received and would obey her majestys commands the house would of course understand that he by no means meant to aver that the queen would even commission him to form a ministry but if he took no such command from her majesty it would become his duty to recommend her majesty to impose the task upon some other person then everything was said that had to be said and members returned to their clubs a certain damp was thrown over the joy of some excitable liberals by tidings which reached the house during mr daubenys speech sir everard powell was no more dead than was mr daubeny himself now it is very unpleasant to find that your news is untrue when you have been at great pains to disseminate it oh but he is dead said mr ratler lady powell assured me half an hour ago said mr ratlers opponent that he was at that moment a great deal better than he had been for the last three months the journey down to the house did him a world of good then well have him down for every division said mr ratler  the political portion of london was in a ferment for the next five days on the sunday morning it was known that mr mildmay had declined to put himself at the head of a liberal government he and the duke of st bungay and mr plantagenet palliser had been in conference so often and so long that it may almost be said they lived together in conference then mr gresham had been with mr mildmayand mr monk also at the clubs it was said by many that mr monk had been with mr mildmay but it was also said very vehemently by others that no such interview had taken place mr monk was a radical much admired by the people sitting in parliament for that most radical of all constituencies the pottery hamlets who had never as yet been in power it was the great question of the day whether mr mildmay would or would not ask mr monk to join him and it was said by those who habitually think at every period of change that the time has now come in which the difficulties to forming a government will at last be found to be insuperable that mr mildmay could not succeed either with mr monk or without him there were at the present moment two sections of these gentlementhe section which declared that mr mildmay had sent for mr monk and the section which declared that he had not but there were others who perhaps knew better what they were saying by whom it was asserted that the whole difficulty lay with mr gresham mr gresham was willing to serve with mr mildmaywith certain stipulations as to the special seat in the cabinet which he himself was to occupy and as to the introduction of certain friends of his own butso said these gentlemen who were supposed really to understand the mattermr gresham was not willing to serve with the duke and with mr palliser now everybody who knew anything knew that the duke and mr palliser were indispensable to mr mildmay and a liberal government with mr gresham in the opposition could not live half through a session all sunday and monday these things were discussed and on the monday lord de terrier absolutely stated to the upper house that he had received her majestys commands to form another government mr daubeny in half a dozen most modest wordsin words hardly audible and most unlike himselfmade his statement in the lower house to the same effect then mr ratler and mr bonteen and mr barrington erle and mr laurence fitzgibbon aroused themselves and swore that such things could not be should the prey which they had won for themselves the spoil of their bows and arrows be snatched from out of their very mouths by treachery lord de terrier and mr daubeny could not venture even to make another attempt unless they did so in combination with mr gresham such a combination said mr barrington erle would be disgraceful to both parties but would prove mr gresham to be as false as satan himself early on the tuesday morning when it was known that mr gresham had been at lord de terriers house barrington erle was free to confess that he had always been afraid of mr gresham i have felt for years said he that if anybody could break up the party it would be mr gresham  on that tuesday morning mr gresham certainly was with lord de terrier but nothing came of it mr gresham was either not enough like satan for the occasion or else he was too closely like him lord de terrier did not bid high enough or else mr gresham did not like biddings from that quarter nothing then came from this attempt and on the tuesday afternoon the queen again sent for mr mildmay on the wednesday morning the gentlemen who thought that the insuperable difficulties had at length arrived began to wear their longest faces and to be triumphant with melancholy forebodings now at last there was a dead lock nobody could form a government it was asserted that mr mildmay had fallen at her majestys feet dissolved in tears and had implored to be relieved from further responsibility it was well known to many at the clubs that the queen had on that morning telegraphed to germany for advice there were men so gloomy as to declare that the queen must throw herself into the arms of mr monk unless mr mildmay would consent to rise from his knees and once more buckle on his ancient armour even that would be better than gresham said barrington erle in his anger ill tell you what it is said ratler we shall have gresham and monk together and you and i shall have to do their biddings mr barrington erles reply to that suggestion i may not dare to insert in these pages  on the wednesday night however it was known that everything had been arranged and before the houses met on the thursday every place had been bestowed either in reality or in imagination the times in its second edition on the thursday gave a list of the cabinet in which four places out of fourteen were rightly filled on the friday it named ten places aright and indicated the law officers with only one mistake in reference to ireland and on the saturday it gave a list of the under secretaries of state and secretaries and vicepresidents generally with wonderful correctness as to the individuals though the offices were a little jumbled the government was at last formed in a manner which everybody had seen to be the only possible way in which a government could be formed nobody was surprised and the weeks work was regarded as though the regular routine of government making had simply been followed mr mildmay was prime minister mr gresham was at the foreign office mr monk was at the board of trade the duke was president of the council the earl of brentford was privy seal and mr palliser was chancellor of the exchequer barrington erle made a step up in the world and went to the admiralty as secretary mr bonteen was sent again to the admiralty and laurence fitzgibbon became a junior lord of the treasury mr ratler was of course installed as patronage secretary to the same board mr ratler was perhaps the only man in the party as to whose destination there could not possibly be a doubt mr ratler had really qualified himself for a position in such a way as to make all men feel that he would as a matter of course be called upon to fill it i do not know whether as much could be said on behalf of any other man in the new government  during all this excitement and through all these movements phineas finn felt himself to be left more and more out in the cold he had not been such a fool as to suppose that any office would be offered to him he had never hinted at such a thing to his one dearly intimate friend lady laura he had not hitherto opened his mouth in parliament indeed when the new government was formed he had not been sitting for above a fortnight of course nothing could be done for him as yet but nevertheless he felt himself to be out in the cold the very men who had discussed with him the question of the divisionwho had discussed it with him because his vote was then as good as that of any other memberdid not care to talk to him about the distribution of places he at any rate could not be one of them he at any rate could not be a rival he could neither mar nor assist he could not be either a successful or a disappointed sympathiserbecause he could not himself be a candidate the affair which perhaps disgusted him more than anything else was the offer of an officenot in the cabinet indeed but one supposed to confer high dignityto mr kennedy mr kennedy refused the offer and this somewhat lessened finns disgust but the offer itself made him unhappy  i suppose it was made simply because of his money he said to fitzgibbon  i dont believe that said fitzgibbon people seem to think that he has got a head on his shoulders though he has got no tongue in it i wonder at his refusing it because of the right honourable  i am so glad that mr kennedy refused said lady laura to him  and why he would have been the right hon robert kennedy for ever and ever phineas when he said this did not as yet know exactly how it would have come to pass that such honourthe honour of the enduring prefix to his namewould have come in the way of mr kennedy had mr kennedy accepted the office in question but he was very quick to learn all these things and in the meantime he rarely made any mistake about them  what would that have been to himwith his wealth said lady laura he has a position of his own and need not care for such things there are men who should not attempt what is called independence in parliament by doing so they simply decline to make themselves useful but there are a few whose special walk in life it is to be independent and as it were unmoved by parties  great akinetoses you know orion said phineas  mr kennedy is not an akinetos said lady laura  he holds a very proud position said phineas ironically  a very proud position indeed said lady laura in sober earnest  the dinner at moronis had been eaten and phineas had given an account of the entertainment to lord chilterns sister there had been only two other guests and both of them had been men on the turf i was the first there said phineas and he surprised me ever so much by telling me that you had spoken to him of me before  yes i did so i wish him to know you i want him to know some men who think of something besides horses he is very well educated you know and would certainly have taken honours if he had not quarrelled with the people at christ church  did he take a degree  nothey sent him down it is best always to have the truth among friends of course you will hear it some day they expelled him because he was drunk then lady laura burst out into tears and phineas sat near her and consoled her and swore that if in any way he could befriend her brother he would do so  mr fitzgibbon at this time claimed a promise which he said that phineas had made to himthat phineas would go over with him to mayo to assist at his reelection and phineas did go the whole affair occupied but a week and was chiefly memorable as being the means of cementing the friendship which existed between the two irish members  a thousand a year said laurence fitzgibbon speaking of the salary of his office it isnt much is it and every fellow to whom i owe a shilling will be down upon me if i had studied my own comfort i should have done the same as kennedy     chapter x  violet effingham   it was now the middle of may and a month had elapsed since the terrible difficulty about the queens government had been solved a month had elapsed and things had shaken themselves into their places with more of ease and apparent fitness than men had given them credit for possessing mr mildmay mr gresham and mr monk were the best friends in the world swearing by each other in their own house and supported in the other by as gallant a phalanx of whig peers as ever were got together to fight against the instincts of their own order in compliance with the instincts of those below them lady lauras father was in the cabinet to lady lauras infinite delight it was her ambition to be brought as near to political action as was possible for a woman without surrendering any of the privileges of feminine inaction that women should even wish to have votes at parliamentary elections was to her abominable and the cause of the rights of women generally was odious to her but nevertheless for herself she delighted in hoping that she too might be usefulin thinking that she too was perhaps in some degree politically powerful and she had received considerable increase to such hopes when her father accepted the privy seal the earl himself was not an ambitious man and but for his daughter would have severed himself altogether from political life before this time he was an unhappy manbeing an obstinate man and having in his obstinacy quarrelled with his only son in his unhappiness he would have kept himself alone living in the country brooding over his wretchedness were it not for his daughter on her behalf and in obedience to her requirements he came yearly up to london and perhaps in compliance with her persuasion had taken some part in the debates of the house of lords it is easy for a peer to be a statesman if the trouble of the life be not too much for him lord brentford was now a statesman if a seat in the cabinet be proof of statesmanship  at this time in may there was staying with lady laura in portman square a very dear friend of hers by name violet effingham violet effingham was an orphan an heiress and a beauty with a terrible aunt one lady baldock who was supposed to be the dragon who had violet as a captive maiden in charge but as miss effingham was of age and was mistress of her own fortune lady baldock was in truth not omnipotent as a dragon should be the dragon at any rate was not now staying in portman square and the captivity of the maiden was therefore not severe at the present moment violet effingham was very pretty but could hardly be said to be beautiful she was small with light crispy hair which seemed to be ever on the flutter round her brows and which yet was never a hair astray she had sweet soft grey eyes which never looked at you long hardly for a momentbut which yet in that half moment nearly killed you by the power of their sweetness her cheek was the softest thing in nature and the colour of it when its colour was fixed enough to be told was a shade of pink so faint and creamy that you would hardly dare to call it by its name her mouth was perfect not small enough to give that expression of silliness which is so common but almost divine with the temptation of its full rich ruby lips her teeth which she but seldom showed were very even and very white and there rested on her chin the dearest dimple that ever acted as a loadstar to menss eyes the fault of her face if it had a fault was in her nosewhich was a little too sharp and perhaps too small a woman who wanted to depreciate violet effingham had once called her a pugnosed puppet but i as her chronicler deny that she was pugnosedand all the world who knew her soon came to understand that she was no puppet in figure she was small but not so small as she looked to be her feet and hands were delicately fine and there was a softness about her whole person an apparent compressibility which seemed to indicate that she might go into very small compass into what compass and how compressed there were very many men who held very different opinions violet effingham was certainly no puppet she was great at dancingas perhaps might be a puppetbut she was great also at archery great at skatingand great too at hunting with reference to that last accomplishment she and lady baldock had had more than one terrible tussle not always with advantage to the dragon my dear aunt she had said once during the last winter i am going to the meet with georgegeorge was her cousin lord baldock and was the dragons sonand there let there be an end of it and you will promise me that you will not go further said the dragon i will promise nothing today to any man or to any woman said violet what was to be said to a young lady who spoke in this way and who had become of age only a fortnight since she rode that day the famous run from bagnalls gorse to foulsham common and was in at the death  violet effingham was now sitting in conference with her friend lady laura and they were discussing matters of high importof very high import indeedto the interests of both of them i do not ask you to accept him said lady laura  that is lucky said the other as he has never asked me  he has done much the same you know that he loves you  i knowor fancy that i knowthat so many men love me but after all what sort of love is it it is just as when you and i when we see something nice in a shop call it a dear duck of a thing and tell somebody to go and buy it let the price be ever so extravagant i know my own position laura im a dear duck of a thing  you are a very dear thing to oswald  but you laura will some day inspire a grand passionor i daresay have already for you are a great deal too close to telland then there will be cutting of throats and a mighty hubbub and a real tragedy i shall never go beyond genteel comedyunless i run away with somebody beneath me or do something awfully improper  dont do that dear  i should like to because of my aunt i should indeed if it were possible without compromising myself i should like her to be told some morning that i had gone off with the curate  how can you be so wicked violet  it would serve her right and her countenance would be so awfully comic mind if it is ever to come off i must be there to see it i know what she would say as well as possible she would turn to poor gussy augusta she would say i always expected it i always did then i should come out and curtsey to her and say so prettily dear aunt it was only our little joke thats my line but for youyou if you planned it would go off tomorrow with lucifer himself if you liked him  but failing lucifer i shall probably be very humdrum  you dont mean that there is anything settled laura  there is nothing settledor any beginning of anything that ever can be settled but i am not talking about myself he has told me that if you will accept him he will do anything that you and i may ask him  yeshe will promise  did you ever know him to break his word  i know nothing about him my dear how should i  do not pretend to be ignorant and meek violet you do know himmuch better than most girls know the men they marry you have known him more or less intimately all your life  but am i bound to marry him because of that accident  no you are not bound to marry himunless you love him  i do not love him said violet with slow emphatic words and a little forward motion of her face as though she were specially eager to convince her friend that she was quite in earnest in what she said  i fancy violet that you are nearer to loving him than any other man  i am not at all near to loving any man i doubt whether i ever shall be it does not seem to me to be possible to myself to be what girls call in love i can like a man i do like perhaps half a dozen i like them so much that if i go to a house or to a party it is quite a matter of importance to me whether this man or that will or will not be there and then i suppose i flirt with them at least augusta tells me that my aunt says that i do but as for caring about any one of them in the way of loving himwanting to marry him and have him all to myself and that sort of thingi dont know what it means  but you intend to be married some day said lady laura  certainly i do and i dont intend to wait very much longer i am heartily tired of lady baldock and though i can generally escape among my friends that is not sufficient i am beginning to think that it would be pleasant to have a house of my own a girl becomes such a bohemian when she is always going about and doesnt quite know where any of her things are  then there was a silence between them for a few minutes violet effingham was doubled up in a corner of a sofa with her feet tucked under her and her face reclining upon one of her shoulders and as she talked she was playing with a little toy which was constructed to take various shapes as it was flung this way or that a bystander looking at her would have thought that the toy was much more to her than the conversation lady laura was sitting upright in a common chair at a table not far from her companion and was manifestly devoting herself altogether to the subject that was being discussed between them she had taken no lounging easy attitude she had found no employment for her fingers and she looked steadily at violet as she talkedwhereas violet was looking only at the little manikin which she tossed and now laura got up and came to the sofa and sat close to her friend violet though she somewhat moved one foot so as to seem to make room for the other still went on with her play  if you do marry violet you must choose some one man out of the lot  thats quite true my dear i certainly cant marry them all  and how do you mean to make the choice  i dont know i suppose i shall toss up  i wish you would be in earnest with me  welli will be in earnest i shall take the first that comes after i have quite made up my mind youll think it very horrible but that is really what i shall do after all a husband is very much like a house or a horse you dont take your house because its the best house in the world but because just then you want a house you go and see a house and if its very nasty you dont take it but if you think it will suit pretty well and if you are tired of looking about for houses you do take it thats the way one buys ones horsesand ones husbands  and you have not made up your mind yet  not quite lady baldock was a little more decent than usual just before i left baddingham when i told her that i meant to have a pair of ponies she merely threw up her hands and grunted she didnt gnash her teeth and curse and swear and declare to me that i was a child of perdition  what do you mean by cursing and swearing  she told me once that if i bought a certain little dog it would lead to my being everlastinglyyou know what she isnt so squeamish as i am and said it out  what did you do  i bought the little dog and it bit my aunts heel i was very sorry then and gave the creature to mary rivers he was such a beauty i hope the perdition has gone with him for i dont like mary rivers at all i had to give the poor beasty to somebody and mary rivers happened to be there i told her that puck was connected with apollyon but she didnt mind that puck was worth twenty guineas and i daresay she has sold him  oswald may have an equal chance then among the other favourites said lady laura after another pause  there are no favourites and i will not say that any man may have a chance why do you press me about your brother in this way  because i am so anxious because it would save him because you are the only woman for whom he has ever cared and because he loves you with all his heart and because his father would be reconciled to him tomorrow if he heard that you and he were engaged  laura my dear  well  you wont be angry if i speak out  certainly not after what i have said you have a right to speak out  it seems to me that all your reasons are reasons why he should marry menot reasons why i should marry him  is not his love for you a reason  no said violet pausingand speaking the word in the lowest possible whisper if he did not love me that if known to me should be a reason why i should not marry him ten men may love mei dont say that any man does  he does  but i cant marry all the ten and as for that business of saving him  you know what i mean  i dont know that i have any special mission for saving young men i sometimes think that i shall have quite enough to do to save myself it is strange what a propensity i feel for the wrong side of the post  i feel the strongest assurance that you will always keep on the right side  thank you my dear i mean to try but im quite sure that the jockey who takes me in hand ought to be very steady himself now lord chiltern  wellout with it what have you to say  he does not bear the best reputation in this world as a steady man is he altogether the sort of man that mammas of the best kind are seeking for their daughters i like a rou√© myselfand a prig who sits all night in the house and talks about nothing but churchrates and suffrage is to me intolerable i prefer men who are improper and all that sort of thing if i were a man myself i should go in for everything i ought to leave alone i know i should but you seeim not a man and i must take care of myself the wrong side of a post for a woman is so very much the wrong side i like a fast man but i know that i must not dare to marry the sort of man that i like  to be one of us thenthe very first among uswould that be the wrong side  you mean that to be lady chiltern in the present tense and lady brentford in the future would be promotion for violet effingham in the past  how hard you are violet  fancythat it should come to thisthat you should call me hard laura i should like to be your sister i should like well enough to be your fathers daughter i should like well enough to be chilterns friend i am his friend nothing that any one has ever said of him has estranged me from him i have fought for him till i have been black in the face yes i havewith my aunt but i am afraid to be his wife the risk would be so great suppose that i did not save him but that he brought me to shipwreck instead  that could not be  could it not i think it might be so very well when i was a child they used to be always telling me to mind myself it seems to me that a child and a man need not mind themselves let them do what they may they can be set right again let them fall as they will you can put them on their feet but a woman has to mind herselfand very hard work it is when she has a dragon of her own driving her ever the wrong way  i want to take you from the dragon  yesand to hand me over to a griffin  the truth is violet that you do not know oswald he is not a griffin  i did not mean to be uncomplimentary take any of the dangerous wild beasts you please i merely intend to point out that he is a dangerous wild beast i daresay he is nobleminded and i will call him a lion if you like it better but even with a lion there is risk  of course there will be risk there is risk with every manunless you will be contented with the prig you described of course there would be risk with my brother he has been a gambler  they say he is one still  he has given it up in part and would entirely at your instance  and they say other things of him laura  it is true he has had paroxysms of evil life which have wellnigh ruined him  and these paroxysms are so dangerous is he not in debt  he isbut not deeply every shilling that he owes would be paidevery shilling mind i know all his circumstances and i give you my word that every shilling should be paid he has never liedand he has told me everything his father could not leave an acre away from him if he would and would not if he could  i did not ask as fearing that i spoke only of a dangerous habit a paroxysm of spending money is apt to make one so uncomfortable and then  well  i dont know why i should make a catalogue of your brothers weaknesses  you mean to say that he drinks too much  i do not say so people say so the dragon says so and as i always find her sayings to be untrue i suppose this is like the rest of them  it is untrue if it be said of him as a habit  it is another paroxysmjust now and then  do not laugh at me violet when i am taking his part or i shall be offended  but you see if i am to be his wife it israther important  still you need not ridicule me  dear laura you know i do not ridicule you you know i love you for what you are doing would not i do the same and fight for him down to my nails if i had a brother  and therefore i want you to be oswalds wifebecause i know that you would fight for him it is not true that he is adrunkard look at his hand which is as steady as yours look at his eye is there a sign of it he has been drunk once or twice perhapsand has done fearful things  it might be that he would do fearful things to me  you never knew a man with a softer heart or with a finer spirit i believe as i sit here that if he were married tomorrow his vices would fall from him like old clothes  you will admit laura that there will be some risk for the wife  of course there will be a risk is there not always a risk  the men in the city would call this doubledangerous i think said violet then the door was opened and the man of whom they were speaking entered the room     chapter xi  lord chiltern   the reader has been told that lord chiltern was a red man and that peculiarity of his personal appearance was certainly the first to strike a stranger it imparted a certain look of ferocity to him which was apt to make men afraid of him at first sight women are not actuated in the same way and are accustomed to look deeper into men at the first sight than other men will trouble themselves to do his beard was red and was clipped so as to have none of the softness of waving hair the hair on his head also was kept short and was very redand the colour of his face was red nevertheless he was a handsome man with wellcut features not tall but very strongly built and with a certain curl in the corner of his eyelids which gave to him a look of resolutionwhich perhaps he did not possess he was known to be a clever man and when very young had had the reputation of being a scholar when he was threeandtwenty greyhaired votaries of the turf declared that he would make his fortune on the racecourseso clearheaded was he as to odds so excellent a judge of a horses performances and so gifted with a memory of events when he was fiveandtwenty he had lost every shilling of a fortune of his own had squeezed from his father more than his father ever chose to name in speaking of his affairs to any one and was known to be in debt but he had sacrificed himself on one or two memorable occasions in conformity with turf laws of honour and men said of him either that he was very honest or very chivalricin accordance with the special views on the subject of the man who was speaking it was reported now that he no longer owned horses on the turfbut this was doubted by some who could name the animals which they said that he owned and which he ran in the name of mr macnabsaid some of mr pardoesaid others of mr chickerwicksaid a third set of informants the fact was that lord chiltern at this moment had no interest of his own in any horse upon the turf  but all the world knew that he drank he had taken by the throat a proctors bulldog when he had been drunk at oxford had nearly strangled the man and had been expelled he had fallen through his violence into some terrible misfortune at paris had been brought before a public judge and his name and his infamy had been made notorious in every newspaper in the two capitals after that he had fought a ruffian at newmarket and had really killed him with his fists in reference to this latter affray it had been proved that the attack had been made on him that he had not been to blame and that he had not been drunk after a prolonged investigation he had come forth from that affair without disgrace he would have done so at least if he had not been heretofore disgraced but we all know how the man well spoken of may steal a horse while he who is of evil repute may not look over a hedge it was asserted widely by many who were supposed to know all about everything that lord chiltern was in a fit of delirium tremens when he killed the ruffian at newmarket the worst of that latter affair was that it produced the total estrangement which now existed between lord brentford and his son lord brentford would not believe that his son was in that matter more sinned against than sinning such things do not happen to other mens sons he said when lady laura pleaded for her brother lady laura could not induce her father to see his son but so far prevailed that no sentence of banishment was pronounced against lord chiltern there was nothing to prevent the son sitting at his fathers table if he so pleased he never did so pleasebut nevertheless he continued to live in the house in portman square and when he met the earl in the hall perhaps or on the staircase would simply bow to him then the earl would bow again and shuffle onand look very wretched as no doubt he was a grownup son must be the greatest comfort a man can haveif he be his fathers best friend but otherwise he can hardly be a comfort as it was in this house the son was a constant thorn in his fathers side  what does he do when we leave london lord brentford once said to his daughter  he stays here papa  but he hunts still  yes he huntsand he has a room somewhere at an inndown in northamptonshire but he is mostly in london they have trains on purpose  what a life for my son said the earl what a life of course no decent person will let him into his house lady laura did not know what to say to this for in truth lord chiltern was not fond of staying at the houses of persons whom the earl would have called decent  general effingham the father of violet and lord brentford had been the closest and dearest of friends they had been young men in the same regiment and through life each had confided in the other when the generals only son then a youth of seventeen was killed in one of our grand new zealand wars the bereaved father and the earl had been together for a month in their sorrow at that time lord chilterns career had still been open to hopeand the one man had contrasted his lot with the other general effingham lived long enough to hear the earl declare that his lot was the happier of the two now the general was dead and violet the daughter of a second wife was all that was left of the effinghams this second wife had been a miss plummer a lady from the city with much money whose sister had married lord baldock violet in this way had fallen to the care of the baldock people and not into the hands of her fathers friends but as the reader will have surmised she had ideas of her own of emancipating herself from baldock thraldom  twice before that last terrible affair at newmarket before the quarrel between the father and the son had been complete lord brentford had said a word to his daughtermerely a wordof his son in connection with miss effingham  if he thinks of it i shall be glad to see him on the subject you may tell him so that had been the first word he had just then resolved that the affair in paris should be regarded as condonedas among the things to be forgotten she is too good for him but if he asks her let him tell her everything that had been the second word and had been spoken immediately subsequent to a payment of twelve thousand pounds made by the earl towards the settlement of certain doncaster accounts lady laura in negotiating for the money had been very eloquent in describing some honestor shall we say chivalricsacrifice which had brought her brother into this special difficulty since that the earl had declined to interest himself in his sons matrimonial affairs and when lady laura had once again mentioned the matter declaring her belief that it would be the means of saving her brother oswald the earl had desired her to be silent would you wish to destroy the poor child he had said nevertheless lady laura felt sure that if she were to go to her father with a positive statement that oswald and violet were engaged he would relent and would accept violet as his daughter as for the payment of lord chilterns present debtsshe had a little scheme of her own about that  miss effingham who had been already two days in portman square had not as yet seen lord chiltern she knew that he lived in the house that is that he slept there and probably eat his breakfast in some apartment of his ownbut she knew also that the habits of the house would not by any means make it necessary that they should meet laura and her brother probably saw each other dailybut they never went into society together and did not know the same sets of people when she had announced to lady baldock her intention of spending the first fortnight of her london season with her friend lady laura lady baldock had as a matter of coursejumped upon her as miss effingham would herself call it  you are going to the house of the worst reprobate in all england said lady baldock  whatdear old lord brentford whom papa loved so well  i mean lord chiltern who only last yearmurdered a man  that is not true aunt  there is worse than thatmuch worse he is alwaystipsy and always gambling and always but it is quite unfit that i should speak a word more to you about such a man as lord chiltern his name ought never to be mentioned  then why did you mention it aunt  lady baldocks process of jumping upon her niecein which i think the aunt had generally the worst of the exercisewent on for some time but violet of course carried her point  if she marries him there will be an end of everything said lady baldock to her daughter augusta  she has more sense than that mamma said augusta  i dont think she has any sense at all said lady baldocknot in the least i do wish my poor sister had livedi do indeed  lord chiltern was now in the room with violetimmediately upon that conversation between violet and his sister as to the expediency of violet becoming his wife indeed his entrance had interrupted the conversation before it was over i am so glad to see you miss effingham he said i came in thinking that i might find you  here i am as large as life she said getting up from her corner on the sofa and giving him her hand laura and i have been discussing the affairs of the nation for the last two days and have nearly brought our discussion to an end she could not help looking first at his eye and then at his hand not as wanting evidence to the truth of the statement which his sister had made but because the idea of a drunkards eye and a drunkards hand had been brought before her mind lord chilterns hand was like the hand of any other man but there was something in his eye that almost frightened her it looked as though he would not hesitate to wring his wifes neck round if ever he should be brought to threaten to do so and then his eye like the rest of him was red noshe did not think that she could ever bring herself to marry him why take a venture that was doubledangerous when there were so many ventures open to her apparently with very little of danger attached to them if it should ever be said that i loved him i would do it all the same she said to herself  if i did not come and see you here i suppose that i should never see you said he seating himself i do not often go to parties and when i do you are not likely to be there  we might make our little arrangements for meeting said she laughing my aunt lady baldock is going to have an evening next week  the servants would be ordered to put me out of the house  oh no you can tell her that i invited you  i dont think that oswald and lady baldock are great friends said lady laura  or he might come and take you and me to the zoo on sunday thats the proper sort of thing for a brother and a friend to do  i hate that place in the regents park said lord chiltern  when were you there last demanded miss effingham  when i came home once from eton but i wont go again till i can come home from eton again then he altered his tone as he continued to speak people would look at me as if i were the wildest beast in the whole collection  then said violet if you wont go to lady baldocks or to the zoo we must confine ourselves to lauras drawingroomunless indeed you like to take me to the top of the monument  ill take you to the top of the monument with pleasure  what do you say laura  i say that you are a foolish girl said lady laura and that i will have nothing to do with such a scheme  then there is nothing for it but that you should come here and as you live in the house and as i am sure to be here every morning and as you have no possible occupation for your time and as we have nothing particular to do with oursi daresay i shant see you again before i go to my aunts in berkeley square  very likely not he said  and why not oswald asked his sister  he passed his hand over his face before he answered her because she and i run in different grooves now and are not such meet playfellows as we used to be once do you remember my taking you away right through saulsby wood once on the old pony and not bringing you back till teatime and miss blink going and telling my father  do i remember it i think it was the happiest day in my life his pockets were crammed full of gingerbread and everton toffy and we had three bottles of lemonade slung on to the ponys saddlebows i thought it was a pity that we should ever come back  it was a pity said lord chiltern  but nevertheless substantially necessary said lady laura  failing our power of reproducing the toffy i suppose it was said violet  you were not miss effingham then said lord chiltern  nonot as yet these disagreeable realities of life grow upon one do they not you took off my shoes and dried them for me at a woodmans cottage i am obliged to put up with my maids doing those things now and miss blink the mild is changed for lady baldock the martinet and if i rode about with you in a wood all day i should be sent to coventry instead of to bed and so you see everything is changed as well as my name  everything is not changed said lord chiltern getting up from his seat i am not changedat least not in this that as i loved you better than any being in the worldbetter even than laura thereso do i love you now infinitely the best of all do not look so surprised at me you knew it before as well as you do nowand laura knows it there is no secret to be kept in the matter among us three  but lord chiltern said miss effingham rising also to her feet and then pausing not knowing how to answer him there had been a suddenness in his mode of addressing her which had so to say almost taken away her breath and then to be told by a man of his love before his sister was in itself to her a matter so surprising that none of those words came at her command which will come as though by instinct to young ladies on such occasions  you have known it always said he as though he were angry with her  lord chiltern she replied you must excuse me if i say that you are at the least very abrupt i did not think when i was going back so joyfully to our childish days that you would turn the tables on me in this way  he has said nothing that ought to make you angry said lady laura  only because he has driven me to say that which will make me appear to be uncivil to himself lord chiltern i do not love you with that love of which you are speaking now as an old friend i have always regarded you and i hope that i may always do so then she got up and left the room  why were you so sudden with herso abruptso loud said his sister coming up to him and taking him by the arm almost in anger  it would make no difference said he she does not care for me  it makes all the difference in the world said lady laura such a woman as violet cannot be had after that fashion you must begin again  i have begun and ended he said  that is nonsense of course you will persist it was madness to speak in that way today you may be sure of this however that there is no one she likes better than you you must remember that you have done much to make any girl afraid of you  i do remember it  do something now to make her fear you no longer speak to her softly tell her of the sort of life which you would live with her tell her that all is changed as she comes to love you she will believe you when she would believe no one else on that matter  am i to tell her a lie said lord chiltern looking his sister full in the face then he turned upon his heel and left her     chapter xii  autumnal prospects   the session went on very calmly after the opening battle which ousted lord de terrier and sent mr mildmay back to the treasuryso calmly that phineas finn was unconsciously disappointed as lacking that excitement of contest to which he had been introduced in the first days of his parliamentary career from time to time certain waspish attacks were made by mr daubeny now on this secretary of state and now on that but they were felt by both parties to mean nothing and as no great measure was brought forward nothing which would serve by the magnitude of its interests to divide the liberal side of the house into fractions mr mildmays cabinet was allowed to hold its own in comparative peace and quiet it was now julythe middle of julyand the member for loughshane had not yet addressed the house how often had he meditated doing so how he had composed his speeches walking round the park on his way down to the house how he got his subjects uponly to find on hearing them discussed that he really knew little or nothing about them how he had his arguments and almost his very words taken out of his mouth by some other member and lastly how he had actually been deterred from getting upon his legs by a certain tremor of blood round his heart when the moment for rising had comeof all this he never said a word to any man since that last journey to county mayo laurence fitzgibbon had been his most intimate friend but he said nothing of all this even to laurence fitzgibbon to his other friend lady laura standish he did explain something of his feelings not absolutely describing to her the extent of hindrance to which his modesty had subjected him but letting her know that he had his qualms as well as his aspirations but as lady laura always recommended patience and more than once expressed her opinion that a young member would be better to sit in silence at least for one session he was not driven to the mortification of feeling that he was incurring her contempt by his bashfulness as regarded the men among whom he lived i think he was almost annoyed at finding that no one seemed to expect that he should speak barrington erle when he had first talked of sending phineas down to loughshane had predicted for him all manner of parliamentary successes and had expressed the warmest admiration of the manner in which phineas had discussed this or that subject at the union we have not above one or two men in the house who can do that kind of thing barrington erle had once said but now no allusions whatever were made to his powers of speech and phineas in his modest moments began to be more amazed than ever that he should find himself seated in that chamber  to the forms and technicalities of parliamentary business he did give close attention and was unremitting in his attendance on one or two occasions he ventured to ask a question of the speaker and as the words of experience fell into his ears he would tell himself that he was going through his educationthat he was learning to be a working member and perhaps to be a statesman but his regrets with reference to mr low and the dingy chambers in old square were very frequent and had it been possible for him to undo all that he had done he would often have abandoned to some one else the honour of representing the electors of loughshane  but he was supported in all his difficulties by the kindness of his friend lady laura standish he was often in the house in portman square and was always received with cordiality and as he thought almost with affection she would sit and talk to him sometimes saying a word about her brother and sometimes about her father as though there were more between them than the casual intimacy of london acquaintance and in portman square he had been introduced to miss effingham and had found miss effingham to bevery nice miss effingham had quite taken to him and he had danced with her at two or three parties talking always as he did so about lady laura standish  i declare laura i think your friend mr finn is in love with you said violet to lady laura one night  i dont think that he is fond of me and so am i of him he is so honest and so na√Øve without being awkward and then he is undoubtedly clever  and so uncommonly handsome said violet  i dont know that that makes much difference said lady laura  i think it does if a man looks like a gentleman as well  mr finn certainly looks like a gentleman said lady laura  and no doubt is one said violet i wonder whether he has got any money  not a penny i should say  how does such a man manage to live there are so many men like that and they are always mysteries to me i suppose hell have to marry an heiress  whoever gets him will not have a bad husband said lady laura standish  phineas during the summer had very often met mr kennedy they sat on the same side of the house they belonged to the same club they dined together more than once in portman square and on one occasion phineas had accepted an invitation to dinner sent to him by mr kennedy himself a slower affair i never saw in my life he said afterwards to laurence fitzgibbon though there were two or three men there who talk everywhere else they could not talk at his table he gave you good wine i should say said fitzgibbon and let me tell you that that covers a multitude of sins in spite however of all these opportunities for intimacy now nearly at the end of the session phineas had hardly spoken a dozen words to mr kennedy and really knew nothing whatsoever of the man as one friendor even as one acquaintance knows another lady laura had desired him to be on good terms with mr kennedy and for that reason he had dined with him nevertheless he disliked mr kennedy and felt quite sure that mr kennedy disliked him he was therefore rather surprised when he received the following note      albany z 3 july 17 186     my dear mr finn     i shall have some friends at loughlinter next month and    should be very glad if you will join us i will name the    16th august i dont know whether you shoot but there are    grouse and deer     yours truly     robert kennedy   what was he to do he had already begun to feel rather uncomfortable at the prospect of being separated from all his new friends as soon as the session should be over laurence fitzgibhon had asked him to make another visit to county mayo but that he had declined lady laura had said something to him about going abroad with her brother and since that there had sprung up a sort of intimacy between him and lord chiltern but nothing had been fixed about this foreign trip and there were pecuniary objections to it which put it almost out of his power the christmas holidays he would of course pass with his family at killaloe but he hardly liked the idea of hurrying off to killaloe immediately the session should be over everybody around him seemed to be looking forward to pleasant leisure doings in the country men talked about grouse and of the ladies at the houses to which they were going and of the people whom they were to meet lady laura had said nothing of her own movements for the early autumn and no invitation had come to him to go to the earls country house he had already felt that every one would depart and that he would be leftand this had made him uncomfortable what was he to do with the invitation from mr kennedy he disliked the man and had told himself half a dozen times that he despised him of course he must refuse it even for the sake of the scenery and the grouse and the pleasant party and the feeling that going to loughlinter in august would be the proper sort of thing to do he must refuse it but it occurred to him at last that he would call in portman square before he wrote his note  of course you will go said lady laura in her most decided tone  and why  in the first place it is civil in him to ask you and why should you be uncivil in return  there is nothing uncivil in not accepting a mans invitation said phineas  we are going said lady laura and i can only say that i shall be disappointed if you do not go too both mr gresham and mr monk will be there and i believe they have never stayed together in the same house before i have no doubt there are a dozen men on your side of the house who would give their eyes to be there of course you will go  of course he did go the note accepting mr kennedys invitation was written at the reform club within a quarter of an hour of his leaving portman square he was very careful in writing to be not more familiar or more civil than mr kennedy had been to himself and then he signed himself yours truly phineas finn but another proposition was made to him and a most charming proposition during the few minutes that he remained in portman square i am so glad said lady laura because i can now ask you to run down to us at saulsby for a couple of days on your way to loughlinter till this was fixed i couldnt ask you to come all the way to saulsby for two days and there wont be room for more between our leaving london and starting to loughlinter phineas swore that he would have gone if it had been but for one hour and if saulsby had been twice the distance very well come on the 13th and go on the 15th you must go on the 15th unless you choose to stay with the housekeeper and remember mr finn we have got no grouse at saulsby phineas declared that he did not care a straw for grouse  there was another little occurrence which happened before phineas left london and which was not altogether so charming as his prospects at saulsby and loughlinter early in august when the session was still incomplete he dined with laurence fitzgibbon at the reform club laurence had specially invited him to do so and made very much of him on the occasion by george my dear fellow laurence said to him that morning nothing has happened to me this session that has given me so much pleasure as your being in the house of course there are fellows with whom one is very intimate and of whom one is very fondand all that sort of thing but most of these englishmen on our side are such cold fellows or else they are like ratler and barrington erle thinking of nothing but politics and then as to our own men there are so many of them one can hardly trust thats the truth of it your being in the house has been such a comfort to me phineas who really liked his friend laurence expressed himself very warmly in answer to this and became affectionate and made sundry protestations of friendship which were perfectly sincere their sincerity was tested after dinner when fitzgibbon as they two were seated on a sofa in the corner of the smokingroom asked phineas to put his name to the back of a bill for two hundred and fifty pounds at six months date  but my dear laurence said phineas two hundred and fifty pounds is a sum of money utterly beyond my reach  exactly my dear boy and thats why ive come to you dye think id have asked anybody who by any impossibility might have been made to pay anything for me  but whats the use of it then  all the use in the world its for me to judge of the use you know why dye think id ask it if it wasnt any use ill make it of use my boy and take my word youll never hear about it again its just a forestalling of my salary thats all i wouldnt do it till i saw that we were at least safe for six months to come then phineas finn with many misgivings with much inward hatred of himself for his own weakness did put his name on the back of the bill which laurence fitzgibbon had prepared for his signature     chapter xiii  saulsby wood   so you wont come to moydrum again said laurence fitzgibbon to his friend  not this autumn laurence your father would think that i want to live there  bedad its my father would be glad to see youand the oftener the better  the fact is my time is filled up  youre not going to be one of the party at loughlinter  i believe i am kennedy asked me and people seem to think that everybody is to do what he bids them  i should think so too i wish he had asked me i should have thought it as good as a promise of an undersecretaryship all the cabinet are to be there i dont suppose he ever had an irishman in his house before when do you start  wellon the 12th or 13th i believe i shall go to saulsby on my way  the devil you will upon my word phineas my boy youre the luckiest fellow i know this is your first year and youre asked to the two most difficult houses in england you have only to look out for an heiress now there is little vi effinghamshe is sure to be at saulsby goodbye old fellow dont you be in the least unhappy about the bill ill see to making that all right  phineas was rather unhappy about the bill but there was so much that was pleasant in his cup at the present moment that he resolved as far as possible to ignore the bitter of that one ingredient he was a little in the dark as to two or three matters respecting these coming visits he would have liked to have taken a servant with him but he had no servant and felt ashamed to hire one for the occasion and then he was in trouble about a gun and the paraphernalia of shooting he was not a bad shot at snipe in the bogs of county clare but he had never even seen a gun used in england however he bought himself a gunwith other paraphernalia and took a license for himself and then groaned over the expense to which he found that his journey would subject him and at last he hired a servant for the occasion he was intensely ashamed of himself when he had done so hating himself and telling himself that he was going to the devil headlong and why had he done it not that lady laura would like him the better or that she would care whether he had a servant or not she probably would know nothing of his servant but the people about her would know and he was foolishly anxious that the people about her should think that he was worthy of her  then he called on mr low before he started i did not like to leave london without seeing you he said but i know you will have nothing pleasant to say to me  i shall say nothing unpleasant certainly i see your name in the divisions and i feel a sort of envy myself  any fool could go into a lobby said phineas  to tell you the truth i have been gratified to see that you have had the patience to abstain from speaking till you had looked about you it was more than i expected from your hot irish blood going to meet mr gresham and mr monkare you well i hope you may meet them in the cabinet some day mind you come and see me when parliament meets in february  mrs bunce was delighted when she found that phineas had hired a servant but mr bunce predicted nothing but evil from so vain an expense dont tell me where is it to come from he aint no richer because hes in parliament there aint no wages mp and mtwhereby mr bunce i fear meant emptyare pretty much alike when a man hasnt a fortune at his back but hes going to stay with all the lords in the cabinet said mrs bunce to whom phineas in his pride had confided perhaps more than was necessary cabinet indeed said bunce if hed stick to chambers and let alone cabinets hed do a deal better given up his rooms has hetill february he dont expect were going to keep them empty for him  phineas found that the house was full at saulsby although the sojourn of the visitors would necessarily be so short there were three or four there on their way on to loughlinter like himselfmr bonteen and mr ratler with mr palliser the chancellor of the exchequer and his wifeand there was violet effingham who however was not going to loughlinter no indeed she said to our hero who on the first evening had the pleasure of taking her in to dinner unfortunately i havent a seat in parliament and therefore i am not asked  lady laura is going  yesbut lady laura has a cabinet minister in her keeping ive only one comfortyoull be awfully dull  i daresay it would be very much nicer to stay here said phineas  if you want to know my real mind said violet i would give one of my little fingers to go there will be four cabinet ministers in the house and four uncabinet ministers and half a dozen other members of parliament and there will be lady glencora palliser who is the best fun in the world and in point of fact its the thing of the year but i am not asked you see i belong to the baldock faction and we dont sit on your side of the house mr kennedy thinks that i should tell secrets  why on earth had mr kennedy invited him phineas finn to meet four cabinet ministers and lady glencora palliser he could only have done so at the instance of lady laura standish it was delightful for phineas to think that lady laura cared for him so deeply but it was not equally delightful when he remembered how very close must be the alliance between mr kennedy and lady laura when she was thus powerful with him  at saulsby phineas did not see much of his hostess when they were making their plans for the one entire day of this visit she said a soft word of apology to him i am so busy with all these people that i hardly know what i am doing but we shall be able to find a quiet minute or two at loughlinterunless indeed you intend to be on the mountains all day i suppose you have brought a gun like everybody else  yesi have brought a gun i do shoot but i am not an inveterate sportsman  on that one day there was a great riding party made up and phineas found himself mounted after luncheon with some dozen other equestrians among them were miss effingham and lady glencora mr ratler and the earl of brentford himself lady glencora whose husband was as has been said chancellor of the exchequer and who was still a young woman and a very pretty woman had taken lately very strongly to politics which she discussed among men and women of both parties with something more than ordinary audacity what a nice happy lazy time youve had of it since youve been in said she to the earl  i hope we have been more happy than lazy said the earl  but youve done nothing mr palliser has twenty schemes of reform all mature but among you youve not let him bring in one of them the duke and mr mildmay and you will break his heart among you  poor mr palliser  the truth is if you dont take care he and mr monk and mr gresham will arise and shake themselves and turn you all out  we must look to ourselves lady glencora  indeed yesor you will be known to all posterity as the fain√©ant government  let me tell you lady glencora that a fain√©ant government is not the worst government that england can have it has been the great fault of our politicians that they have all wanted to do something  mr mildmay is at any rate innocent of that charge said lady glencora  they were now riding through a vast wood and phineas found himself delightfully established by the side of violet effingham mr ratler has been explaining to me that he must have nineteen next session now if i were you mr finn i would decline to be counted up in that way as one of mr ratlers sheep  but what am i to do  do something on your own hook you men in parliament are so much like sheep if one jumps at a gap all go after himand then you are penned into lobbies and then you are fed and then you are fleeced i wish i were in parliament id get up in the middle and make such a speech you all seem to me to be so much afraid of one another that you dont quite dare to speak out do you see that cottage there  what a pretty cottage it is  yesis it not twelve years ago i took off my shoes and stockings and had them dried in that cottage and when i got back to the house i was put to bed for having been out all day in the wood  were you wandering about alone  no i wasnt alone oswald standish was with me we were children then do you know him  lord chilternyes i know him he and i have been rather friends this year  he is very goodis he not  goodin what way  honest and generous  i know no man whom i believe to be more so  and he is clever asked miss effingham  very clever that is he talks very well if you will let him talk after his own fashion you would always fancy that he was going to eat youbut that is his way  and you like him  very much  i am so glad to hear you say so  is he a favourite of yours miss effingham  not nownot particularly i hardly ever see him but his sister is the best friend i have and i used to like him so much when he was a boy i have not seen that cottage since that day and i remember it as though it were yesterday lord chiltern is quite changed is he not  changedin what way  they used to say that he wasunsteady you know  i think he is changed but chiltern is at heart a bohemian it is impossible not to see that at once he hates the decencies of life  i suppose he does said violet he ought to marry if he were married that would all be cureddont you think so  i cannot fancy him with a wife said phineas there is a savagery about him which would make him an uncomfortable companion for a woman  but he would love his wife  yes as he does his horses and he would treat her wellas he does his horses but he expects every horse he has to do anything that any horse can do and he would expect the same of his wife  phineas had no idea how deep an injury he might be doing his friend by this description nor did it once occur to him that his companion was thinking of herself as the possible wife of this red indian miss effingham rode on in silence for some distance and then she said but one word more about lord chiltern he was so good to me in that cottage  on the following day the party at saulsby was broken up and there was a regular pilgrimage towards loughlinter phineas resolved upon sleeping a night at edinburgh on his way and he found himself joined in the bands of close companionship with mr ratler for the occasion the evening was by no means thrown away for he learned much of his trade from mr ratler and mr ratler was heard to declare afterwards at loughlinter that mr finn was a pleasant young man  it soon came to be admitted by all who knew phineas finn that he had a peculiar power of making himself agreeable which no one knew how to analyse or define i think it is because he listens so well said one man but the women would not like him for that said another he has studied when to listen and when to talk said a third the truth however was that phineas finn had made no study in the matter at all it was simply his nature to be pleasant     chapter xiv  loughlinter   phineas finn reached loughlinter together with mr ratler in a postchaise from the neighbouring town mr ratler who had done this kind of thing very often before travelled without impediments but the new servant of our heros was stuck outside with the driver and was in the way i never bring a man with me said mr ratler to his young friend the servants of the house like it much better because they get feed you are just as well waited on and it dont cost half as much phineas blushed as he heard all this but there was the impediment not to be got rid of for the nonce and phineas made the best of his attendant its one of those points said he as to which a man never quite makes up his mind if you bring a fellow you wish you hadnt brought him and if you dont you wish you had im a great deal more decided in my ways that that said mr ratler  loughlinter as they approached it seemed to phineas to be a much finer place than saulsby and so it was except that loughlinter wanted that graceful beauty of age which saulsby possessed loughlinter was all of cut stone but the stones had been cut only yesterday it stood on a gentle slope with a greensward falling from the front entrance down to a mountain lake and on the other side of the lough there rose a mighty mountain to the skies ben linter at the foot of it and all round to the left there ran the woods of linter stretching for miles through crags and bogs and mountain lands no better ground for deer than the side of ben linter was there in all those highlands and the linter rushing down into the lough through rocks which in some places almost met together above its waters ran so near to the house that the pleasant noise of its cataracts could be heard from the hall door behind the house the expanse of drained park land seemed to be interminable and then again came the mountains there were ben linn and ben lodyand the whole territory belonging to mr kennedy he was laird of linn and laird of linter as his people used to say and yet his father had walked into glasgow as a little boyno doubt with the normal halfcrown in his breeches pocket  magnificentis it not said phineas to the treasury secretary as they were being driven up to the door  very grandbut the young trees show the new man a new man may buy a forest but he cant get park trees  phineas at the moment was thinking how far all these things which he saw the mountains stretching everywhere around him the castle the lake the river the wealth of it all and more than the wealth the nobility of the beauty might act as temptations to lady laura standish if a woman were asked to have the half of all this would it be possible that she should prefer to take the half of his nothing he thought it might be possible for a girl who would confess or seem to confess that love should be everything but it could hardly be possible for a woman who looked at the world almost as a man looked at itas an oyster to be opened with such weapon as she could find ready to her hand lady laura professed to have a care for all the affairs of the world she loved politics and could talk of social science and had broad ideas about religion and was devoted to certain educational views such a woman would feel that wealth was necessary to her and would be willing for the sake of wealth to put up with a husband without romance nay might it not be that she would prefer a husband without romance thus phineas was arguing to himself as he was driven up to the door of loughlinter castle while mr ratler was eloquent on the beauty of old park trees after all a scotch forest is a very scrubby sort of thing said mr ratler  there was nobody in the houseat least they found nobody and within half an hour phineas was walking about the grounds by himself mr ratler had declared himself to be delighted at having an opportunity of writing lettersand no doubt was writing them by the dozen all dated from loughlinter and all detailing the facts that mr gresham and mr monk and plantagenet palliser and lord brentford were in the same house with him phineas had no letters to write and therefore rushed down across the broad lawn to the river of which he heard the noisy tumbling waters there was something in the air which immediately filled him with high spirits and in his desire to investigate the glories of the place he forgot that he was going to dine with four cabinet ministers in a row he soon reached the stream and began to make his way up it through the ravine there was waterfall over waterfall and there were little bridges here and there which looked to be half natural and half artificial and a path which required that you should climb but which was yet a path and all was so arranged that not a pleasant splashing rush of the waters was lost to the visitor he went on and on up the stream till there was a sharp turn in the ravine and then looking upwards he saw above his head a man and a woman standing together on one of the little halfmade wooden bridges his eyes were sharp and he saw at a glance that the woman was lady laura standish he had not recognised the man but he had very little doubt that it was mr kennedy of course it was mr kennedy because he would prefer that it should be any other man under the sun he would have turned back at once if he had thought that he could have done so without being observed but he felt sure that standing as they were they must have observed him he did not like to join them he would not intrude himself so he remained still and began to throw stones into the river but he had not thrown above a stone or two when he was called from above he looked up and then he perceived that the man who called him was his host of course it was mr kennedy thereupon he ceased to throw stones and went up the path and joined them upon the bridge mr kennedy stepped forward and bade him welcome to loughlinter his manner was less cold and he seemed to have more words at command than was usual with him you have not been long he said in finding out the most beautiful spot about the place  is it not lovely said laura we have not been here an hour yet and mr kennedy insisted on bringing me here  it is wonderfully beautiful said phineas  it is this very spot where we now stand that made me build the house where it is said mr kennedy and i was only eighteen when i stood here and made up my mind that is just twentyfive years ago so he is fortythree said phineas to himself thinking how glorious it was to be only twentyfive and within twelve months continued mr kennedy the foundations were being dug and the stonecutters were at work  what a goodnatured man your father must have been said lady laura  he had nothing else to do with his money but to pour it over my head as it were i dont think he had any other enjoyment of it himself will you go a little higher lady laura we shall get a fine view over to ben linn just now lady laura declared that she would go as much higher as he chose to take her and phineas was rather in doubt as to what it would become him to do he would stay where he was or go down or make himself to vanish after any most acceptable fashion but if he were to do so abruptly it would seem as though he were attributing something special to the companionship of the other two mr kennedy saw his doubt and asked him to join them you may as well come on mr finn we dont dine till eight and it is not much past six yet the men of business are all writing letters and the ladies who have been travelling are in bed i believe  not all of them mr kennedy said lady laura then they went on with their walk very pleasantly and the lord of all that they surveyed took them from one point of vantage to another till they both swore that of all spots upon the earth loughlinter was surely the most lovely i do delight in it i own said the lord when i come up here alone and feel that in the midst of this little bit of a crowded island i have all this to myselfall this with which no other mans wealth can interferei grow proud of my own till i become thoroughly ashamed of myself after all i believe it is better to dwell in cities than in the countrybetter at any rate for a rich man mr kennedy had now spoken more words than phineas had heard to fall from his lips during the whole time that they had been acquainted with each other  i believe so too said laura if one were obliged to choose between the two for myself i think that a little of both is good for man and woman  there is no doubt about that said phineas  no doubt as far as enjoyment goes said mr kennedy  he took them up out of the ravine on to the side of the mountain and then down by another path through the woods to the back of the house as they went he relapsed into his usual silence and the conversation was kept up between the other two at a point not very far from the castlejust so far that one could see by the break of the ground where the castle stood kennedy left them mr finn will take you back in safety i am sure said he and as i am here ill go up to the farm for a moment if i dont show myself now and again when i am here they think im indifferent about the bestials  now mr kennedy said lady laura you are going to pretend to understand all about sheep and oxen mr kennedy owning that it was so went away to his farm and phineas with lady laura returned towards the house i think upon the whole said lady laura that that is as good a man as i know  i should think he is an idle one said phineas  i doubt that he is perhaps neither zealous nor active but he is thoughtful and highprincipled and has a method and a purpose in the use which he makes of his money and you see that he has poetry in his nature too if you get him upon the right string how fond he is of the scenery of this place  any man would be fond of that im ashamed to say that it almost makes me envy him i certainly never have wished to be mr robert kennedy in london but i should like to be the laird of loughlinter  laird of linn and laird of linterhere in summer gone in winter there is some ballad about the old lairds but that belongs to a time when mr kennedy had not been heard of when some branch of the mackenzies lived down at that wretched old tower which you see as you first come upon the lake when old mr kennedy bought it there were hardly a hundred acres on the property under cultivation  and it belonged to the mackenzies  yesto the mackenzie of linn as he was called it was mr kennedy the old man who was first called loughlinter that is linn castle and they lived there for hundreds of years but these highlanders with all that is said of their family pride have forgotten the mackenzies already and are quite proud of their rich landlord  that is unpoetical said phineas  yesbut then poetry is so usually false i doubt whether scotland would not have been as prosaic a country as any under the sun but for walter scottand i have no doubt that henry v owes the romance of his character altogether to shakspeare  i sometimes think you despise poetry said phineas  when it is false i do the difficulty is to know when it is false and when it is true tom moore was always false  not so false as byron said phineas with energy  much more so my friend but we will not discuss that now have you seen mr monk since you have been here  i have seen no one i came with mr ratler  why with mr ratler you cannot find mr ratler a companion much to your taste  chance brought us together but mr ratler is a man of sense lady laura and is not to be despised  it always seems to me said lady laura that nothing is to be gained in politics by sitting at the feet of the little gamaliels  but the great gamaliels will not have a novice on their footstools  then sit at no mans feet is it not astonishing that the price generally put upon any article by the world is that which the owner puts on itand that this is specially true of a mans own self if you herd with ratler men will take it for granted that you are a ratlerite and no more if you consort with greshams and pallisers you will equally be supposed to know your own place  i never knew a mentor said phineas so apt as you are to fill his telemachus with pride  it is because i do not think your fault lies that way if it did or if i thought so my telemachus you may be sure that i should resign my position as mentor here are mr kennedy and lady glencora and mrs gresham on the steps then they went up through the ionic columns on to the broad stone terrace before the door and there they found a crowd of men and women for the legislators and statesmen had written their letters and the ladies had taken their necessary rest  phineas as he was dressing considered deeply all that lady laura had said to himnot so much with reference to the advice which she had given him though that also was of importance as to the fact that it had been given by her she had first called herself his mentor but he had accepted the name and had addressed her as her telemachus and yet he believed himself to be older than sheif indeed there was any difference in their ages and was it possible that a female mentor should love her telemachusshould love him as phineas desired to be loved by lady laura he would not say that it was impossible perhaps there had been mistakes between thema mistake in his manner of addressing her and another in hers of addressing him perhaps the old bachelor of fortythree was not thinking of a wife had this old bachelor of fortythree been really in love with lady laura would he have allowed her to walk home alone with phineas leaving her with some flimsy pretext of having to look at his sheep phineas resolved that he must at any rate play out his gamewhether he were to lose it or to win it and in playing it he must if possible drop something of that mentor and telemachus style of conversation as to the advice given him of herding with greshams and pallisers instead of with ratlers and fitzgibbonshe must use that as circumstances might direct to him himself as he thought of it all it was sufficiently astonishing that even the ratlers and fitzgibbons should admit him among them as one of themselves when i think of my father and of the old house at killaloe and remember that hitherto i have done nothing myself i cannot understand how it is that i should be at loughlinter there was only one way of understanding it if lady laura really loved him the riddle might be read  the rooms at loughlinter were splendid much larger and very much more richly furnished than those at saulsby but there was a certain stiffness in the movement of things and perhaps in the manner of some of those present which was not felt at saulsby phineas at once missed the grace and prettiness and cheery audacity of violet effingham and felt at the same time that violet effingham would be out of her element at loughlinter at loughlinter they were met for business it was at least a semipolitical or perhaps rather a semiofficial gathering and he became aware that he ought not to look simply for amusement when he entered the drawingroom before dinner mr monk and mr palliser and mr kennedy and mr gresham with sundry others were standing in a wide group before the fireplace and among them were lady glencora palliser and lady laura and mrs bonteen as he approached them it seemed as though a sort of opening was made for himself but he could see though others did not that the movement came from lady laura  i believe mr monk said lady glencora that you and i are the only two in the whole party who really know what we would be at  if i must be divided from so many of my friends said mr monk i am happy to go astray in the company of lady glencora palliser  and might i ask said mr gresham with a peculiar smile for which he was famous what it is that you and mr monk are really at  making men and women all equal said lady glencora that i take to be the gist of our political theory  lady glencora i must cry off said mr monk  yesno doubt if i were in the cabinet myself i should not admit so much there are reticencesof course and there is an official discretion  but you dont mean to say lady glencora that you would really advocate equality said mrs bonteen  i do mean to say so mrs bonteen and i mean to go further and to tell you that you are no liberal at heart unless you do so likewise unless that is the basis of your political aspirations  pray let me speak for myself lady glencora  by no meansnot when you are criticising me and my politics do you not wish to make the lower orders comfortable  certainly said mrs bonteen  and educated and happy and good  undoubtedly  to make them as comfortable and as good as yourself  better if possible  and im sure you wish to make yourself as good and as comfortable as anybody elseas those above you if anybody is above you you will admit that  yesif i understand you  then you have admitted everything and are an advocate for general equalityjust as mr monk is and as i am there is no getting out of itis there mr kennedy then dinner was announced and mr kennedy walked off with the french republican on his arm as she went she whispered into mr kennedys ear you will understand me i am not saying that people are equal but that the tendency of all lawmaking and of all governing should be to reduce the inequalities in answer to which mr kennedy said not a word lady glencoras politics were too fast and furious for his nature  a week passed by at loughlinter at the end of which phineas found himself on terms of friendly intercourse with all the political magnates assembled in the house but especially with mr monk he had determined that he would not follow lady lauras advice as to his selection of companions if in doing so he should be driven even to a seeming of intrusion he made no attempt to sit at the feet of anybody and would stand aloof when bigger men than himself were talking and was content to be lessas indeed he was lessthan mr bonteen or mr ratler but at the end of a week he found that without any effort on his partalmost in opposition to efforts on his parthe had fallen into an easy pleasant way with these men which was very delightful to him he had killed a stag in company with mr palliser and had stopped beneath a crag to discuss with him a question as to the duty on irish malt he had played chess with mr gresham and had been told that gentlemans opinion on the trial of mr jefferson davis lord brentford hadat lastcalled him finn and had proved to him that nothing was known in ireland about sheep but with mr monk he had had long discussions on abstract questions in politicsand before the week was over was almost disposed to call himself a disciple or at least a follower of mr monk why not of mr monk as well as of any one else mr monk was in the cabinet and of all the members of the cabinet was the most advanced liberal lady glencora was not so far wrong the other night mr monk said to him equality is an ugly word and shouldnt be used it misleads and frightens and is a bugbear and she in using it had not perhaps a clearly defined meaning for it in her own mind but the wish of every honest man should be to assist in lifting up those below him till they be something nearer his own level than he finds them to this phineas assentedand by degrees he found himself assenting to a great many things that mr monk said to him  mr monk was a thin tall gaunt man who had devoted his whole life to politics hitherto without any personal reward beyond that which came to him from the reputation of his name and from the honour of a seat in parliament he was one of four or five brothersand all besides him were in trade they had prospered in trade whereas he had prospered solely in politics and men said that he was dependent altogether on what his relatives supplied for his support he had now been in parliament for more than twenty years and had been known not only as a radical but as a democrat ten years since when he had risen to fame but not to repute among the men who then governed england nobody dreamed that joshua monk would ever be a paid servant of the crown he had inveighed against one minister after another as though they all deserved impeachment he had advocated political doctrines which at that time seemed to be altogether at variance with any possibility of governing according to english rules of government he had been regarded as a pestilent thorn in the sides of all ministers but now he was a member of the cabinet and those whom he had terrified in the old days began to find that he was not so much unlike other men there are but few horses which you cannot put into harness and those of the highest spirit will generally do your work the best  phineas who had his eyes about him thought that he could perceive that mr palliser did not shoot a deer with mr ratler and that mr gresham played no chess with mr bonteen bonteen indeed was a noisy pushing man whom nobody seemed to like and phineas wondered why he should be at loughlinter and why he should be in office his friend laurence fitzgibbon had indeed once endeavoured to explain this a man who can vote hard as i call it and who will speak a few words now and then as theyre wanted without any ambition that way may always have his price and if he has a pretty wife into the bargain he ought to have a pleasant time of it mr ratler no doubt was a very useful man who thoroughly knew his business but yet as it seemed to phineas no very great distinction was shown to mr ratler at loughlinter if i got as high as that he said to himself i should think myself a miracle of luck and yet nobody seems to think anything of ratler it is all nothing unless one can go to the very top  i believe i did right to accept office mr monk said to him one day as they sat together on a rock close by one of the little bridges over the linter indeed unless a man does so when the bonds of the office tendered to him are made compatible with his own views he declines to proceed on the open path towards the prosecution of those views a man who is combating one ministry after another and striving to imbue those ministers with his convictions can hardly decline to become a minister himself when he finds that those convictions of his own are henceforthor at least for some time to cometo be the ministerial convictions of the day do you follow me  very clearly said phineas you would have denied your own children had you refused  unless indeed a man were to feel that he was in some way unfitted for office work i very nearly provided for myself an escape on that pleabut when i came to sift it i thought that it would be false but let me tell you that the delight of political life is altogether in opposition why it is freedom against slavery fire against clay movement against stagnation the very inaccuracy which is permitted to opposition is in itself a charm worth more than all the patronage and all the prestige of ministerial power youll try them both and then say if you do not agree with me give me the full swing of the benches below the gangway where i needed to care for no one and could always enjoy myself on my legs as long as i felt that i was true to those who sent me there that is all over now they have got me into harness and my shoulders are sore the oats however are of the best and the hay is unexceptionable     chapter xv  donald beans pony   phineas liked being told that the pleasures of opposition and the pleasures of office were both open to himand he liked also to be the chosen receptacle of mr monks confidence he had come to understand that he was expected to remain ten days at loughlinter and that then there was to be a general movement since the first day he had seen but little of mr kennedy but he had found himself very frequently with lady laura and then had come up the question of his projected trip to paris with lord chiltern he had received a letter from lord chiltern      dear finn     are you going to paris with me     yours c   there had been not a word beyond this and before he answered it he made up his mind to tell lady laura the truth he could not go to paris because he had no money  ive just got that from your brother said he  how like oswald he writes to me perhaps three times in the year and his letters are just the same you will go i hope  wellno  i am sorry for that  i wonder whether i may tell you the real reason lady laura  nayi cannot answer that but unless it be some political secret between you and mr monk i should think you might  i cannot afford to go to paris this autumn it seems to be a shocking admission to makethough i dont know why it should be  nor ibut mr finn i like you all the better for making it i am very sorry for oswalds sake its so hard to find any companion for him whom he would like and whom wethat is ishould think altogether you know what i mean mr finn  your wish that i should go with him is a great compliment and i thoroughly wish that i could do it as it is i must go to killaloe and retrieve my finances i daresay lady laura you can hardly conceive how very poor a man i am there was a melancholy tone about his voice as he said this which made her think for the moment whether or no he had been right in going into parliament and whether she had been right in instigating him to do so but it was too late to recur to that question now  you must climb into office early and forego those pleasures of opposition which are so dear to mr monk she said smiling after all money is an accident which does not count nearly so high as do some other things you and mr kennedy have the same enjoyment of everything around you here  yes while it lasts  and lady glencora and i stand pretty much on the same footing in spite of all her wealthexcept that she is a married woman i do not know what she is worthsomething not to be counted and i am worthjust what papa chooses to give me a tenpound note at the present moment i should look upon as great riches this was the first time she had ever spoken to him of her own position as regards money but he had heard or thought that he had heard that she had been left a fortune altogether independent of her father  the last of the ten days had now come and phineas was discontented and almost unhappy the more he saw of lady laura the more he feared that it was impossible that she should become his wife and yet from day to day his intimacy with her became more close he had never made love to her nor could he discover that it was possible for him to do so she seemed to be a woman for whom all the ordinary stages of lovemaking were quite unsuitable of course he could declare his love and ask her to be his wife on any occasion on which he might find himself to be alone with her and on this morning he had made up his mind that he would do so before the day was over it might be possible that she would never speak to him againthat all the pleasures and ambitious hopes to which she had introduced him might be over as soon as that rash word should have been spoken but nevertheless he would speak it  on this day there was to be a grouseshooting party and the shooters were to be out early it had been talked of for some day or two past and phineas knew that he could not escape it there had been some rivalry between him and mr bonteen and there was to be a sort of match as to which of the two would kill most birds before lunch but there had also been some half promise on lady lauras part that she would walk with him up the linter and come down upon the lake taking an opposite direction from that by which they had returned with mr kennedy  but you will be shooting all day she said when he proposed it to her as they were starting for the moor the waggonet that was to take them was at the door and she was there to see them start her father was one of the shooting party and mr kennedy was another  i will undertake to be back in time if you will not think it too hot i shall not see you again till we meet in town next year  then i certainly will go with youthat is to say if you are here but you cannot return without the rest of the party as you are going so far  ill get back somehow said phineas who was resolved that a few miles more or less of mountain should not detain him from the prosecution of a task so vitally important to him if we start at five that will be early enough  quite early enough said lady laura  phineas went off to the mountains and shot his grouse and won his match and eat his luncheon mr bonteen however was not beaten by much and was in consequence somewhat illhumoured  ill tell you what ill do said mr bonteen ill back myself for the rest of the day for a tenpound note  now there had been no money staked on the match at allbut it had been simply a trial of skill as to which would kill the most birds in a given time and the proposition for that trial had come from mr bonteen himself i should not think of shooting for money said phineas  and why not a bet is the only way to decide these things  partly because im sure i shouldnt hit a bird said phineas and partly because i havent got any money to lose  i hate bets said mr kennedy to him afterwards i was annoyed when bonteen offered the wager i felt sure however you would not accept it  i suppose such bets are very common  i dont think men ought to propose them unless they are quite sure of their company maybe im wrong and i often feel that i am straitlaced about such things it is so odd to me that men cannot amuse themselves without pitting themselves against each other when a man tells me that he can shoot better than i i tell him that my keeper can shoot better than he  all the same its a good thing to excel said phineas  im not so sure of that said mr kennedy a man who can kill more salmon than anybody else can rarely do anything else are you going on with your match  no im going to make my way to loughlinter  not alone  yes alone  its over nine miles you cant walk it  phineas looked at his watch and found that it was now two oclock it was a broiling day in august and the way back to loughlinter for six or seven out of the nine miles would be along a high road i must do it all the same said he preparing for a start i have an engagement with lady laura standish and as this is the last day that i shall see her i certainly do not mean to break it  an engagement with lady laura said mr kennedy why did you not tell me that i might have a pony ready but come along donald bean has a pony hes not much bigger than a dog but hell carry you to loughlinter  i can walk it mr kennedy  yes and think of the state in which youd reach loughlinter come along with me  but i cant take you off the mountain said phineas  then you must allow me to take you off  so mr kennedy led the way down to donald beans cottage and before three oclock phineas found himself mounted on a shaggy steed which in sober truth was not much bigger than a large dog if mr kennedy is really my rival said phineas to himself as he trotted along i almost think that i am doing an unhandsome thing in taking the pony  at five oclock he was under the portico before the front door and there he found lady laura waiting for himwaiting for him or at least ready for him she had on her hat and gloves and light shawl and her parasol was in her hand he thought that he had never seen her look so young so pretty and so fit to receive a lovers vows but at the same moment it occurred to him that she was lady laura standish the daughter of an earl the descendant of a line of earlsand that he was the son of a simple country doctor in ireland was it fitting that he should ask such a woman to be his wife but then mr kennedy was the son of a man who had walked into glasgow with halfacrown in his pocket mr kennedys grandfather had beenphineas thought that he had heard that mr kennedys grandfather had been a scotch drover whereas his own grandfather had been a little squire near ennistimon in county clare and his own first cousin once removed still held the paternal acres at finn grove his family was supposed to be descended from kings in that part of ireland it certainly did not become him to fear lady laura on the score of rank if it was to be allowed to mr kennedy to proceed without fear on that head as to wealth lady laura had already told him that her fortune was no greater than his her statement to himself on that head made him feel that he should not hesitate on the score of money they neither had any and he was willing to work for both if she feared the risk let her say so  it was thus that he argued with himself but yet he knewknew as well as the reader will knowthat he was going to do that which he had no right to do it might be very well for him to waitpresuming him to be successful in his lovefor the opening of that oyster with his political sword that oyster on which he proposed that they should both live but such waiting could not well be to the taste of lady laura standish it could hardly be pleasant to her to look forward to his being made a junior lord or an assistant secretary before she could establish herself in her home so he told himself and yet he told himself at the same time that it was incumbent on him to persevere  i did not expect you in the least said lady laura  and yet i spoke very positively  but there are things as to which a man may be very positive and yet may be allowed to fail in the first place how on earth did you get home  mr kennedy got me a ponydonald beans pony  you told him then  yes i told him why i was coming and that i must be here then he took the trouble to come all the way off the mountain to persuade donald to lend me his pony i must acknowledge that mr kennedy has conquered me at last  i am so glad of that said lady laura i knew he wouldunless it were your own fault  they went up the path by the brook from bridge to bridge till they found themselves out upon the open mountain at the top phineas had resolved that he would not speak out his mind till he found himself on that spot that then he would ask her to sit down and that while she was so seated he would tell her everything at the present moment he had on his head a scotch cap with a grouses feather in it and he was dressed in a velvet shootingjacket and dark knickerbockers and was certainly in this costume as handsome a man as any woman would wish to see and there was too a look of breeding about him which had come to him no doubt from the royal finns of old which ever served him in great stead he was indeed only phineas finn and was known by the world to be no more but he looked as though he might have been anybodya royal finn himself and then he had that special grace of appearing to be altogether unconscious of his own personal advantages and i think that in truth he was barely conscious of them that he depended on them very little if at all that there was nothing of personal vanity in his composition he had never indulged in any hope that lady laura would accept him because he was a handsome man  after all that climbing he said will you not sit down for a moment as he spoke to her she looked at him and told herself that he was as handsome as a god do sit down for one moment he said i have something that i desire to say to you and to say it here  i will she said but i also have something to tell you and will say it while i am yet standing yesterday i accepted an offer of marriage from mr kennedy  then i am too late said phineas and putting his hands into the pockets of his coat he turned his back upon her and walked away across the mountain  what a fool he had been to let her know his secret when her knowledge of it could be of no service to himwhen her knowledge of it could only make him appear foolish in her eyes but for his life he could not have kept his secret to himself nor now could he bring himself to utter a word of even decent civility but he went on walking as though he could thus leave her there and never see her again what an ass he had been in supposing that she cared for him what a fool to imagine that his poverty could stand a chance against the wealth of loughlinter but why had she lured him on how he wished that he were now grinding hard at work in mr lows chambers or sitting at home at killaloe with the hand of that pretty little irish girl within his own  presently he heard a voice behind himcalling him gently then he turned and found that she was very near him he himself had then been standing still for some moments and she had followed him mr finn she said  wellyes what is it and turning round he made an attempt to smile  will you not wish me joy or say a word of congratulation had i not thought much of your friendship i should not have been so quick to tell you of my destiny no one else has been told except papa  of course i hope you will be happy of course i do no wonder he lent me the pony  you must forget all that  forget what  wellnothing you need forget nothing said lady laura for nothing has been said that need be regretted only wish me joy and all will be pleasant  lady laura i do wish you joy with all my heartbut that will not make all things pleasant i came up here to ask you to be my wife  nono no do not say it  but i have said it and will say it again i poor penniless plain simple fool that i am have been ass enough to love you lady laura standish and i brought you up here today to ask you to share with memy nothingness and this i have done on soil that is to be all your own tell me that you regard me as a conceited foolas a bewildered idiot  i wish to regard you as a dear friendboth of my own and of my husband said she offering him her hand  should i have had a chance i wonder if i had spoken a week since  how can i answer such a question mr finn or rather i will answer it fully it is not a week since we told each other you to me and i to you that we were both poorboth without other means than those which come to us from our fathers you will make your waywill make it surely but how at present could you marry any woman unless she had money of her own for melike so many other girls it was necessary that i should stay at home or marry some one rich enough to dispense with fortune in a wife the man whom in all the world i think the best has asked me to share everything with himand i have thought it wise to accept his offer  and i was fool enough to think that you loved me said phineas to this she made no immediate answer yes i was i feel that i owe it you to tell you what a fool i have been i did i thought you loved me at least i thought that perhaps you loved me it was like a child wanting the moonwas it not  and why should i not have loved you she said slowly laying her hand gently upon his arm  why not because loughlinter  stop mr finn stop do not say to me any unkind word that i have not deserved and that would make a breach between us i have accepted the owner of loughlinter as my husband because i verily believe that i shall thus do my duty in that sphere of life to which it has pleased god to call me i have always liked him and i will love him for youmay i trust myself to speak openly to you  you may trust me as against all others except us two ourselves  for you then i will say also that i have always liked you since i knew you that i have loved you as a friendand could have loved you otherwise had not circumstances showed me so plainly that it would be unwise  oh lady laura  listen a moment and pray remember that what i say to you now must never be repeated to any ears no one knows it but my father my brother and mr kennedy early in the spring i paid my brothers debts his affection to me is more than a return for what i have done for him but when i did thiswhen i made up my mind to do it i made up my mind also that i could not allow myself the same freedom of choice which would otherwise have belonged to me will that be sufficient mr finn  how can i answer you lady laura sufficient and you are not angry with me for what i have said  no i am not angry but it is understood of course that nothing of this shall ever be repeatedeven among ourselves is that a bargain  oh yes i shall never speak of it again  and now you will wish me joy  i have wished you joy lady laura and i will do so again may you have every blessing which the world can give you you cannot expect me to be very jovial for awhile myself but there will be nobody to see my melancholy moods i shall be hiding myself away in ireland when is the marriage to be  nothing has been said of that i shall be guided by himbut there must of course be delay there will be settlements and i know not what it may probably be in the springor perhaps the summer i shall do just what my betters tell me to do  phineas had now seated himself on the exact stone on which he had wished her to sit when he proposed to tell his own story and was looking forth upon the lake it seemed to him that everything had been changed for him while he had been up there upon the mountain and that the change had been marvellous in its nature when he had been coming up there had been apparently two alternatives before him the glory of successful lovewhich indeed had seemed to him to be a most improbable result of the coming interviewand the despair and utter banishment attendant on disdainful rejection but his position was far removed from either of these alternatives she had almost told him that she would have loved him had she not been poorthat she was beginning to love him and had quenched her love because it had become impossible to her to marry a poor man in such circumstances he could not be angry with herhe could not quarrel with her he could not do other than swear to himself that he would be her friend and yet he loved her better than everand she was the promised wife of his rival why had not donald beans pony broken his neck  shall we go down now she said  oh yes  you will not go on by the lake  what is the use it is all the same now you will want to be back to receive him in from shooting  not that i think he is above those little cares but it will be as well we should go the nearest way as we have spent so much of our time here i shall tell mr kennedy that i have told youif you do not mind  tell him what you please said phineas  but i wont have it taken in that way mr finn your brusque want of courtesy to me i have forgiven but i shall expect you to make up for it by the alacrity of your congratulations to him i will not have you uncourteous to mr kennedy  if i have been uncourteous i beg your pardon  you need not do that we are old friends and may take the liberty of speaking plainly to each otherbut you will owe it to mr kennedy to be gracious think of the pony  they walked back to the house together and as they went down the path very little was said just as they were about to come out upon the open lawn while they were still under cover of the rocks and shrubs phineas stopped his companion by standing before her and then he made his farewell speech to her  i must say goodbye to you i shall be away early in the morning  goodbye and god bless you said lady laura  give me your hand said he and she gave him her hand i dont suppose you know what it is to love dearly  i hope i do  but to be in love i believe you do not and to miss your love i thinki am bound to think that you have never been so tormented it is very sorebut i will do my best like a man to get over it  do my friend do so small a trouble will never weigh heavily on shoulders such as yours  it will weigh very heavily but i will struggle hard that it may not crush me i have loved you so dearly as we are parting give me one kiss that i may think of it and treasure it in my memory what murmuring words she spoke to express her refusal of such a request i will not quote but the kiss had been taken before the denial was completed and then they walked on in silence togetherand in peace towards the house  on the next morning six or seven men were going away and there was an early breakfast there were none of the ladies there but mr kennedy the host was among his friends a large drag with four horses was there to take the travellers and their luggage to the station and there was naturally a good deal of noise at the front door as the preparations for the departure were made in the middle of them mr kennedy took our hero aside laura has told me said mr kennedy that she has acquainted you with my good fortune  and i congratulate you most heartily said phineas grasping the others hand you are indeed a lucky fellow  i feel myself to be so said mr kennedy such a wife was all that was wanting to me and such a wife is very hard to find will you remember finn that loughlinter will never be so full but what there will be a room for you or so empty but what you will be made welcome i say this on lady lauras part and on my own  phineas as he was being carried away to the railway station could not keep himself from speculating as to how much kennedy knew of what had taken place during the walk up the linter of one small circumstance that had occurred he felt quite sure that mr kennedy knew nothing     chapter xvi  phineas finn returns to killaloe   phineas finns first session of parliament was overhis first session with all its adventures when he got back to mrs bunces housefor mrs bunce received him for a night in spite of her husbands advice to the contraryi am afraid he almost felt that mrs bunce and her rooms were beneath him of course he was very unhappyas wretched as a man can be there were moments in which he thought that it would hardly become him to live unless he could do something to prevent the marriage of lady laura and mr kennedy but nevertheless he had his consolations these were reflections which had in them much of melancholy satisfaction he had not been despised by the woman to whom he had told his love she had not shown him that she thought him to be unworthy of her she had not regarded his love as an offence indeed she had almost told him that prudence alone had forbidden her to return his passion and he had kissed her and had afterwards parted from her as a dear friend i do not know why there should have been a flavour of exquisite joy in the midst of his agony as he thought of thisbut it was so he would never kiss her again all future delights of that kind would belong to mr kennedy and he had no real idea of interfering with that gentleman in the fruition of his privileges but still there was the kissan eternal fact and then in all respects except that of his love his visit to loughlinter had been preeminently successful mr monk had become his friend and had encouraged him to speak during the next sessionsetting before him various models and prescribing for him a course of reading lord brentford had become intimate with him he was on pleasant terms with mr palliser and mr gresham and as for mr kennedyhe and mr kennedy were almost bosom friends it seemed to him that he had quite surpassed the ratlers fitzgibbons and bonteens in that politicosocial success which goes so far towards downright political success and which in itself is so pleasant he had surpassed these men in spite of their offices and their acquired positions and could not but think that even mr low if he knew it all would confess that he had been right  as to his bosom friendship with mr kennedy that of course troubled him ought he not to be driving a poniard into mr kennedys heart the conventions of life forbade that and therefore the bosom friendship was to be excused if not an enemy to the death then there could be no reason why he should not be a bosom friend  he went over to ireland staying but one night with mrs bunce and came down upon them at killaloe like a god out of the heavens even his father was wellnigh overwhelmed by admiration and his mother and sisters thought themselves only fit to minister to his pleasures he had learned if he had learned nothing else to look as though he were master of the circumstances around him and was entirely free from internal embarrassment when his father spoke to him about his legal studies he did not exactly laugh at his fathers ignorance but he recapitulated to his father so much of mr monks wisdom at second handshowing plainly that it was his business to study the arts of speech and the technicalities of the house and not to study lawthat his father had nothing further to say he had become a man of such dimensions that an ordinary father could hardly dare to inquire into his proceedings and as for an ordinary mothersuch as mrs finn certainly wasshe could do no more than look after her sons linen with awe  mary flood jonesthe reader i hope will not quite have forgotten mary flood joneswas in a great tremor when first she met the hero of loughshane after returning from the honours of his first session she had been somewhat disappointed because the newspapers had not been full of the speeches he had made in parliament and indeed the ladies of the finn household had all been ill at ease on this head they could not imagine why phineas had restrained himself with so much philosophy but miss flood jones in discussing the matter with the miss finns had never expressed the slightest doubt of his capacity or his judgment and when tidings camethe tidings came in a letter from phineas to his fatherthat he did not intend to speak that session because speeches from a young member on his first session were thought to be inexpedient miss flood jones and the miss finns were quite willing to accept the wisdom of this decision much as they might regret the effect of it mary when she met her hero hardly dared to look him in the face but she remembered accurately all the circumstances of her last interview with him could it be that he wore that ringlet near his heart mary had received from barbara finn certain hairs supposed to have come from the head of phineas and these she always wore near her own and moreover since she had seen phineas she had refused an offer of marriage from mr elias bodkinhad refused it almost ignominiouslyand when doing so had told herself that she would never be false to phineas finn  we think it so good of you to come to see us again she said  good to come home to my own people  of course you might be staying with plenty of grandees if you liked it  no indeed mary it did happen by accident that i had to go to the house of a man whom perhaps you would call a grandee and to meet grandees there but it was only for a few days and i am very glad to be taken in again here i can assure you  you know how very glad we all are to have you  are you glad to see me mary  very glad why should i not be glad and barbara the dearest friend i have in the world of course she talks about youand that makes me think of you  if you knew mary how often i think about you then mary who was very happy at hearing such words and who was walking in to dinner with him at the moment could not refrain herself from pressing his arm with her little fingers she knew that phineas in his position could not marry at once but she would wait for himoh for ever if he would only ask her he of course was a wicked traitor to tell her that he was wont to think of her but jove smiles at lovers perjuriesand it is well that he should do so as such perjuries can hardly be avoided altogether in the difficult circumstances of a successful gentlemans life phineas was a traitor of course but he was almost forced to be a traitor by the simple fact that lady laura standish was in london and mary flood jones in killaloe  he remained for nearly five months at killaloe and i doubt whether his time was altogether well spent some of the books recommended to him by mr monk he probably did read and was often to be found encompassed by blue books i fear that there was a grain of pretence about his blue books and parliamentary papers and that in these days he was in a gentle way something of an impostor you must not be angry with me for not going to you he said once to marys mother when he had declined an invitation to drink tea but the fact is that my time is not my own pray dont make any apologies we are quite aware that we have very little to offer said mrs flood jones who was not altogether happy about mary and who perhaps knew more about members of parliament and blue books than phineas finn had supposed mary you are a fool to think of that man the mother said to her daughter the next morning i dont think of him mamma not particularly he is no better than anybody else that i can see and he is beginning to give himself airs said mrs flood jones mary made no answer but she went up into her room and swore before a figure of the virgin that she would be true to phineas for ever and ever in spite of her mother in spite of all the worldin spite should it be necessary even of himself  about christmas time there came a discussion between phineas and his father about money i hope you find you get on pretty well said the doctor who thought that he had been liberal  its a tight fit said phineaswho was less afraid of his father than he had been when he last discussed these things  i had hoped it would have been ample said the doctor  dont think for a moment sir that i am complaining said phineas i know it is much more than i have a right to expect  the doctor began to make an inquiry within his own breast as to whether his son had a right to expect anythingwhether the time had not come in which his son should be earning his own bread i suppose he said after a pause there is no chance of your doing anything at the bar now  not immediately it is almost impossible to combine the two studies together mr low himself was aware of that but you are not to suppose that i have given the profession up  i hope notafter all the money it has cost us  by no means sir and all that i am doing now will i trust be of assistance to me when i shall come back to work at the law of course it is on the cards that i may go into officeand if so public business will become my profession  and be turned out with the ministry  yes that is true sir i must run my chance if the worst comes to the worst i hope i might be able to secure some permanent place i should think that i can hardly fail to do so but i trust i may never be driven to want it i thought however that we had settled all this before then phineas assumed a look of injured innocence as though his father was driving him too hard  and in the mean time your money has been enough said the doctor after a pause  i had intended to ask you to advance me a hundred pounds said phineas there were expenses to which i was driven on first entering parliament  a hundred pounds  if it be inconvenient sir i can do without it he had not as yet paid for his gun or for that velvet coat in which he had been shooting or most probably for the knickerbockers he knew he wanted the hundred pounds badly but he felt ashamed of himself in asking for it if he were once in officethough the office were but a sorry junior lordshiphe would repay his father instantly  you shall have it of course said the doctor but do not let the necessity for asking for more hundreds come oftener than you can help phineas said that he would not and then there was no further discourse about money it need hardly be said that he told his father nothing of that bill which he had endorsed for laurence fitzgibbon  at last came the time which called him again to london and the glories of london lifeto lobbies and the clubs and the gossip of men in office and the chance of promotion for himself to the glare of the gaslamps the mock anger of rival debaters and the prospect of the speakers wig during the idleness of the recess he had resolved at any rate upon thisthat a month of the session should not have passed by before he had been seen upon his legs in the househad been seen and heard and many a time as he had wandered alone with his gun across the bogs which lie on the other side of the shannon from killaloe he had practised the sort of address which he would make to the house he would be shortalways short and he would eschew all action and gesticulation mr monk had been very urgent in his instructions to him on that head but he would be especially careful that no words should escape him which had not in them some purpose he might be wrong in his purpose but purpose there should be he had been twitted more than once at killaloe with his silencefor it had been conceived by his fellowtownsmen that he had been sent to parliament on the special ground of his eloquence they should twit him no more on his next return he would speak and would carry the house with him if a human effort might prevail  so he packed up his things and started again for london in the beginning of february goodbye mary he said with his sweetest smile but on this occasion there was no kiss and no culling of locks i know he cannot help it said mary to herself it is his position but whether it be for good or evil i will be true to him  i am afraid you are unhappy babara finn said to her on the next morning  no i am not unhappynot at all i have a deal to make me happy and proud i dont mean to be a bit unhappy then she turned away and cried heartily and barbara finn cried with her for company     chapter xvii  phineas finn returns to london   phineas had received two letters during his recess at killaloe from two women who admired him much which as they were both short shall be submitted to the reader the first was as follows      saulsby october 20 186     my dear mr finn     i write a line to tell you that our marriage is to be    hurried on as quickly as possible mr kennedy does not    like to be absent from parliament nor will he be content    to postpone the ceremony till the session be over the day    fixed is the 3rd of december and we then go at once to    rome and intend to be back in london by the opening of    parliament     yours most sincerely     laura standish     our london address will be no 52 grosvenor place   to this he wrote an answer as short expressing his ardent wishes that those winter hymeneals might produce nothing but happiness and saying that he would not be in town many days before he knocked at the door of no 52 grosvenor place  and the second letter was as follows      great marlborough street december 186     dear and honoured sir     bunce is getting ever so anxious about the rooms and    says as how he has a young equity draftsman and wife and    baby as would take the whole house and all because miss    pouncefoot said a word about her port wine which any lady    of her age might say in her tantrums and mean nothing    after all me and miss pouncefoots knowed each other for    seven years and whats a word or two as isnt meant after    that but honoured sir its not about that as i write    to trouble you but to ask if i may say for certain that    youll take the rooms again in february its easy to    let them for the month after christmas because of the    pantomimes only say at once because bunce is nagging    me day after day i dont want nobodys wife and baby to    have to do for and d sooner have a parliament gent like    yourself than any one else     yours umbly and respectful     jane bunce   to this he replied that he would certainly come back to the rooms in great marlborough street should he be lucky enough to find them vacant and he expressed his willingness to take them on and from the 1st of february and on the 3rd of february he found himself in the old quarters mrs bunce having contrived with much conjugal adroitness both to keep miss pouncefoot and to stave off the equity draftsmans wife and baby bunce however received phineas very coldly and told his wife the same evening that as far as he could see their lodger would never turn up to be a trump in the matter of the ballot if he means well why did he go and stay with them lords down in scotland i knows all about it i knows a man when i sees him mr low whos looking out to be a tory judge some of these days is a deal betterbecause he knows what hes after  immediately on his return to town phineas found himself summoned to a political meeting at mr mildmays house in st jamess square were going to begin in earnest this time barrington erle said to him at the club  i am glad of that said phineas  i suppose you heard all about it down at loughlinter  now in truth phineas had heard very little of any settled plan down at loughlinter he had played a game of chess with mr gresham and had shot a stag with mr palliser and had discussed sheep with lord brentford but had hardly heard a word about politics from any one of those influential gentlemen from mr monk he had heard much of a coming reform bill but his communications with mr monk had rather been private discussionsin which he had learned mr monks own views on certain pointsthan revelations on the intention of the party to which mr monk belonged i heard of nothing settled said phineas but i suppose we are to have a reform bill  that is a matter of course  and i suppose we are not to touch the question of ballot  thats the difficulty said barrington erle but of course we shant touch it as long as mr mildmay is in the cabinet he will never consent to the ballot as first minister of the crown  nor would gresham or palliser said phineas who did not choose to bring forward his greatest gun at first  i dont know about gresham it is impossible to say what gresham might bring himself to do gresham is a man who may go any lengths before he has done planty pallfor such was the name by which mr plantagenet palliser was ordinarily known among his friendswould of course go with mr mildmay and the duke  and monk is opposed to the ballot said phineas  ah thats the question no doubt he has assented to the proposition of a measure without the ballot but if there should come a row and men like turnbull demand it and the london mob kick up a shindy i dont know how far monk would be steady  whatever he says hell stick to  he is your leader then asked barrington  i dont know that i have a leader mr mildmay leads our side and if anybody leads me he does but i have great faith in mr monk  theres one who would go for the ballot tomorrow if it were brought forward stoutly said barrington erle to mr ratler a few minutes afterwards pointing to phineas as he spoke  i dont think much of that young man said ratler  mr bonteen and mr ratler had put their heads together during that last evening at loughlinter and had agreed that they did not think much of phineas finn why did mr kennedy go down off the mountain to get him a pony and why did mr gresham play chess with him mr ratler and mr bonteen may have been right in making up their minds to think but little of phineas finn but barrington erle had been quite wrong when he had said that phineas would go for the ballot tomorrow phineas had made up his mind very strongly that he would always oppose the ballot that he would hold the same opinion throughout his life no one should pretend to say but in his present mood and under the tuition which he had received from mr monk he was prepared to demonstrate out of the house and in it that the ballot was as a political measure unmanly ineffective and enervating enervating had been a great word with mr monk and phineas had clung to it with admiration  the meeting took place at mr mildmays on the third day of the session phineas had of course heard of such meetings before but had never attended one indeed there had been no such gathering when mr mildmays party came into power early in the last session mr mildmay and his men had then made their effort in turning out their opponents and had been well pleased to rest awhile upon their oars now however they must go again to work and therefore the liberal party was collected at mr mildmays house in order that the liberal party might be told what it was that mr mildmay and his cabinet intended to do  phineas finn was quite in the dark as to what would be the nature of the performance on this occasion and entertained some idea that every gentleman present would be called upon to express individually his assent or dissent in regard to the measure proposed he walked to st jamess square with laurence fitzgibbon but even with fitzgibbon was ashamed to show his ignorance by asking questions after all said fitzgibbon this kind of thing means nothing i know as well as possible and so do you what mr mildmay will sayand then gresham will say a few words and then turnbull will make a murmur and then we shall all assentto anything or to nothingand then it will be over still phineas did not understand whether the assent required would or would not be an individual personal assent when the affair was over he found that he was disappointed and that he might almost as well have stayed away from the meetingexcept that he had attended at mr mildmays bidding and had given a silent adhesion to mr mildmays plan of reform for that session laurence fitzgibbon had been very nearly correct in his description of what would occur mr mildmay made a long speech mr turnbull the great radical of the daythe man who was supposed to represent what many called the manchester school of politicsasked half a dozen questions in answer to these mr gresham made a short speech then mr mildmay made another speech and then all was over the gist of the whole thing was that there should be a reform billvery generous in its enlargement of the franchisebut no ballot mr turnbull expressed his doubt whether this would be satisfactory to the country but even mr turnbull was soft in his tone and complaisant in his manner as there was no reporter presentthat plan of turning private meetings at gentlemens houses into public assemblies not having been as yet adoptedthere could be no need for energy or violence they went to mr mildmays house to hear mr mildmays planand they heard it  two days after this phineas was to dine with mr monk mr monk had asked him in the lobby of the house i dont give dinner parties he said but i should like you to come and meet mr turnbull phineas accepted the invitation as a matter of course there were many who said that mr turnbull was the greatest man in the nation and that the nation could be saved only by a direct obedience to mr turnbulls instructions others said that mr turnbull was a demagogue and at heart a rebel that he was unenglish false and very dangerous phineas was rather inclined to believe the latter statement and as danger and dangerous men are always more attractive than safety and safe men he was glad to have an opportunity of meeting mr turnbull at dinner  in the meantime he went to call on lady laura whom he had not seen since the last evening which he spent in her company at loughlinterwhom when he was last speaking to her he had kissed close beneath the falls of the linter he found her at home and with her was her husband here is a darby and joan meeting is it not she said getting up to welcome him he had seen mr kennedy before and had been standing close to him during the meeting at mr mildmays  i am very glad to find you both together  but robert is going away this instant said lady laura has he told you of our adventures at rome  not a word  then i must tell youbut not now the dear old pope was so civil to us i came to think it quite a pity that he should be in trouble  i must be off said the husband getting up but i shall meet you at dinner i believe  do you dine at mr monks  yes and am asked expressly to hear turnbull make a convert of you there are only to be us four au revoir then mr kennedy went and phineas found himself alone with lady laura he hardly knew how to address her and remained silent he had not prepared himself for the interview as he ought to have done and felt himself to be awkward she evidently expected him to speak and for a few seconds sat waiting for what he might say  at last she found that it was incumbent on her to begin were you surprised at our suddenness when you got my note  a little you had spoken of waiting  i had never imagined that he would have been impetuous and he seems to think that even the business of getting himself married would not justify him staying away from parliament he is a rigid martinet in all matters of duty  i did not wonder that he should be in a hurry but that you should submit  i told you that i should do just what the wise people told me i asked papa and he said that it would be better so the lawyers were driven out of their minds and the milliners out of their bodies and the thing was done  who was there at the marriage  oswald was not there that i know is what you mean to ask papa said that he might come if he pleased oswald stipulated that he should be received as a son then my father spoke the hardest word that ever fell from his mouth  what did he say  i will not repeat itnot altogether but he said that oswald was not entitled to a sons treatment he was very sore about my money because robert was so generous as to his settlement so the breach between them is as wide as ever  and where is chiltern now said phineas  down in northamptonshire staying at some inn from whence he hunts he tells me that he is quite alonethat he never dines out never has any one to dine with him that he hunts five or six days a weekand reads at night  that is not a bad sort of life  not if the reading is any good but i cannot bear that he should be so solitary and if he breaks down in it then his companions will not be fit for him do you ever hunt  oh yesat home in county clare all irishmen hunt  i wish you would go down to him and see him he would be delighted to have you  phineas thought over the proposition before he answered it and then made the reply that he had made once before i would do so lady laurabut that i have no money for hunting in england  alas alas said she smiling how that hits one on every side  i might manage itfor a couple of daysin march  do not do what you think you ought not to do said lady laura  no certainly but i should like it and if i can i will  he could mount you i have no doubt he has no other expense now and keeps a stable full of horses i think he has seven or eight and now tell me mr finn when are you going to charm the house or is it your first intention to strike terror  he blushedhe knew that he blushed as he answered oh i suppose i shall make some sort of attempt before long i cant bear the idea of being a bore  i think you ought to speak mr finn  i do not know about that but i certainly mean to try there will be lots of opportunities about the new reform bill of course you know that mr mildmay is going to bring it in at once you hear all that from mr kennedy  and papa has told me i still see papa almost every day you must call upon him mind you do phineas said that he certainly would papa is very lonely now and i sometimes feel that i have been almost cruel in deserting him and i think that he has a horror of the houseespecially later in the yearalways fancying that he will meet oswald i am so unhappy about it all mr finn  why doesnt your brother marry said phineas knowing nothing as yet of lord chiltern and violet effingham if he were to marry well that would bring your father round  yesit would  and why should he not  lady laura paused before she answered and then she told the whole story he is violently in love and the girl he loves has refused him twice  is it with miss effingham asked phineas guessing the truth at once and remembering what miss effingham had said to him when riding in the wood  yeswith violet effingham my fathers pet his favourite whom he loves next to myselfalmost as well as myself whom he would really welcome as a daughter he would gladly make her mistress of his house and of saulsby everything would then go smoothly  but she does not like lord chiltern  i believe she loves him in her heart but she is afraid of him as she says herself a girl is bound to be so careful of herself with all her seeming frolic violet effingham is very wise  phineas though not conscious of anything akin to jealousy was annoyed at the revelation made to him since he had heard that lord chiltern was in love with miss effingham he did not like lord chiltern quite as well as he had done before he himself had simply admired miss effingham and had taken pleasure in her society but though this had been all he did not like to hear of another man wanting to marry her and he was almost angry with lady laura for saying that she believed miss effingham loved her brother if miss effingham had twice refused lord chiltern that ought to have been sufficient it was not that phineas was in love with miss effingham himself as he was still violently in love with lady laura any other love was of course impossible but nevertheless there was something offensive to him in the story as it had been told if it be wisdom on her part said he answering lady lauras last words you cannot find fault with her for her decision  i find no faultbut i think my brother would make her happy  lady laura when she was left alone at once reverted to the tone in which phineas finn had answered her remarks about miss effingham phineas was very ill able to conceal his thoughts and wore his heart almost upon his sleeve can it be possible that he cares for her himself that was the nature of lady lauras first question to herself upon the matter and in asking herself that question she thought nothing of the disparity in rank or fortune between phineas finn and violet effingham nor did it occur to her as at all improbable that violet might accept the love of him who had so lately been her own lover but the idea grated against her wishes on two sides she was most anxious that violet should ultimately become her brothers wifeand she could not be pleased that phineas should be able to love any woman  i must beg my readers not to be carried away by those last words into any erroneous conclusion they must not suppose that lady laura kennedy the lately married bride indulged a guilty passion for the young man who had loved her though she had probably thought often of phineas finn since her marriage her thoughts had never been of a nature to disturb her rest it had never occurred to her even to think that she regarded him with any feeling that was an offence to her husband she would have hated herself had any such idea presented itself to her mind she prided herself on being a pure highprincipled woman who had kept so strong a guard upon herself as to be nearly free from the dangers of those rocks upon which other women made shipwreck of their happiness she took pride in this and would then blame herself for her own pride but though she so blamed herself it never occurred to her to think that to her there might be danger of such shipwreck she had put away from herself the idea of love when she had first perceived that phineas had regarded her with more than friendship and had accepted mr kennedys offer with an assured conviction that by doing so she was acting best for her own happiness and for that of all those concerned she had felt the romance of the position to be sweet when phineas had stood with her at the top of the falls of the linter and had told her of the hopes which he had dared to indulge and when at the bottom of the falls he had presumed to take her in his arms she had forgiven him without difficulty to herself telling herself that that would be the alpha and the omega of the romance of her life she had not felt herself bound to tell mr kennedy of what had occurredbut she had felt that he could hardly have been angry even had he been told and she had often thought of her lover since and of his lovetelling herself that she too had once had a lover never regarding her husband in that light but her thoughts had not frightened her as guilty thoughts will do there had come a romance which had been pleasant and it was gone it had been soon banishedbut it had left to her a sweet flavour of which she loved to taste the sweetness though she knew that it was gone and the man should be her friend but especially her husbands friend it should be her care to see that his life was successfuland especially her husbands care it was a great delight to her to know that her husband liked the man and the man would marry and the mans wife should be her friend all this had been very pure and very pleasant now an idea had flitted across her brain that the man was in love with some one elseand she did not like it  but she did not therefore become afraid of herself or in the least realise at once the danger of her own position her immediate glance at the matter did not go beyond the falseness of men if it were so as she suspectedif phineas had in truth transferred his affections to violet effingham of how little value was the love of such a man it did not occur to her at this moment that she also had transferred hers to robert kennedy or that if not she had done worse but she did remember that in the autumn this young phoebus among men had turned his back upon her out upon the mountain that he might hide from her the agony of his heart when he learned that she was to be the wife of another man and that now before the winter was over he could not hide from her the fact that his heart was elsewhere and then she speculated and counted up facts and satisfied herself that phineas could not even have seen violet effingham since they two had stood together upon the mountain how false are menhow false and how weak of heart  chiltern and violet effingham said phineas to himself as he walked away from grosvenor place is it fair that she should be sacrificed because she is rich and because she is so winning and so fascinating that lord brentford would receive even his son for the sake of receiving also such a daughterinlaw phineas also liked lord chiltern had seen or fancied that he had seen fine things in him had looked forward to his regeneration hoping perhaps that he might have some hand in the good work but he did not recognise the propriety of sacrificing violet effingham even for work so good as this if miss effingham had refused lord chiltern twice surely that ought to be sufficient it did not occur to him that the love of such a girl as violet would be a great treasureto himself as regarded himself he was still in lovehopelessly in love with lady laura kennedy     chapter xviii  mr turnbull   it was a wednesday evening and there was no houseand at seven oclock phineas was at mr monks hall door he was the first of the guests and he found mr monk alone in the diningroom i am doing butler said mr monk who had a brace of decanters in his hands which he proceeded to put down in the neighbourhood of the fire but i have finished and now we will go upstairs to receive the two great men properly  i beg your pardon for coming too early said finn  not a minute too early seven is seven and it is i who am too late but lord bless you you dont think im ashamed of being found in the act of decanting my own wine i remember lord palmerston saying before some committee about salaries five or six years ago now i daresay that it wouldnt do for an english minister to have his hall door opened by a maidservant now im an english minister and ive got nobody but a maidservant to open my hall door and im obliged to look after my own wine i wonder whether its improper i shouldnt like to be the means of injuring the british constitution  perhaps if you resign soon and if nobody follows your example grave evil results may be avoided  i sincerely hope so for i do love the british constitution and i love also the respect in which members of the english cabinet are held now turnbull who will be here in a moment hates it all but he is a rich man and has more powdered footmen hanging about his house than ever lord palmerston had himself  he is still in business  oh yesand makes his thirty thousand a year here he is how are you turnbull we were talking about my maidservant i hope she opened the door for you properly  certainlyas far as i perceived said mr turnbull who was better at a speech than a joke a very respectable young woman i should say  there is not one more so in all london said mr monk but finn seems to think that i ought to have a man in livery  it is a matter of perfect indifference to me said mr turnbull i am one of those who never think of such things  nor i either said mr monk then the laird of loughlinter was announced and they all went down to dinner  mr turnbull was a goodlooking robust man about sixty with long grey hair and a red complexion with hard eyes a wellcut nose and full lips he was nearly six feet high stood quite upright and always wore a black swallowtail coat black trousers and a black silk waistcoat in the house at least he was always so dressed and at dinner tables what difference there might be in his costume when at home at staleybridge few of those who saw him in london had the means of knowing there was nothing in his face to indicate special talent no one looking at him would take him to be a fool but there was none of the fire of genius in his eye nor was there in the lines of his mouth any of that play of thought or fancy which is generally to be found in the faces of men and women who have made themselves great mr turnbull had certainly made himself great and could hardly have done so without force of intellect he was one of the most popular if not the most popular politician in the country poor men believed in him thinking that he was their most honest public friend and men who were not poor believed in his power thinking that his counsels must surely prevail he had obtained the ear of the house and the favour of the reporters and opened his voice at no public dinner on no public platform without a conviction that the words spoken by him would be read by thousands the first necessity for good speaking is a large audience and of this advantage mr turnbull had made himself sure and yet it could hardly be said that he was a great orator he was gifted with a powerful voice with strong and i may perhaps call them broad convictions with perfect selfreliance with almost unlimited powers of endurance with hot ambition with no keen scruples and with a moral skin of great thickness nothing said against him pained him no attacks wounded him no raillery touched him in the least there was not a sore spot about him and probably his first thoughts on waking every morning told him that he at least was totus teres atque rotundus he was of course a thorough radicaland so was mr monk but mr monks first waking thoughts were probably exactly the reverse of those of his friend mr monk was a much hotter man in debate than mr turnbullbut mr monk was ever doubting of himself and never doubted of himself so much as when he had been most violent and also most effective in debate when mr monk jeered at himself for being a cabinet minister and keeping no attendant grander than a parlourmaid there was a substratum of selfdoubt under the joke  mr turnbull was certainly a great radical and as such enjoyed a great reputation i do not think that high office in the state had ever been offered to him but things had been said which justified him or seemed to himself to justify him in declaring that in no possible circumstances would he serve the crown i serve the people he had said and much as i respect the servants of the crown i think that my own office is the higher he had been greatly called to task for this speech and mr mildmay the present premier had asked him whether he did not recognise the socalled servants of the crown as the most hardworked and truest servants of the people the house and the press had supported mr mildmay but to all that mr turnbull was quite indifferent and when an assertion made by him before three or four thousand persons at manchester to the effect that hehe speciallywas the friend and servant of the people was received with acclamation he felt quite satisfied that he had gained his point progressive reform in the franchise of which manhood suffrage should be the acknowledged and not far distant end equal electoral districts ballot tenant right for england as well as ireland reduction of the standing army till there should be no standing army to reduce utter disregard of all political movements in europe an almost idolatrous admiration for all political movements in america free trade in everything except malt and an absolute extinction of a state churchthese were among the principal articles in mr turnbulls political catalogue and i think that when once he had learned the art of arranging his words as he stood upon his legs and had so mastered his voice as to have obtained the ear of the house the work of his life was not difficult having nothing to construct he could always deal with generalities being free from responsibility he was not called upon either to study details or to master even great facts it was his business to inveigh against existing evils and perhaps there is no easier business when once the privilege of an audience has been attained it was his work to cut down foresttrees and he had nothing to do with the subsequent cultivation of the land mr monk had once told phineas finn how great were the charms of that inaccuracy which was permitted to the opposition mr turnbull no doubt enjoyed these charms to the full though he would sooner have put a padlock on his mouth for a month than have owned as much upon the whole mr turnbull was no doubt right in resolving that he would not take office though some reticence on that subject might have been more becoming to him  the conversation at dinner though it was altogether on political subjects had in it nothing of special interest as long as the girl was there to change the plates but when she was gone and the door was closed it gradually opened out and there came on to be a pleasant sparring match between the two great radicalsthe radical who had joined himself to the governing powers and the radical who stood aloof mr kennedy barely said a word now and then and phineas was almost as silent as mr kennedy he had come there to hear some such discussion and was quite willing to listen while guns of such great calibre were being fired off for his amusement  i think mr mildmay is making a great step forward said mr turnbull  i think he is said mr monk  i did not believe that he would ever live to go so far it will hardly suffice even for this year but still coming from him it is a great deal it only shows how far a man may be made to go if only the proper force be applied after all it matters very little who are the ministers  that is what i have always declared said mr monk  very little indeed we dont mind whether it be lord de terrier or mr mildmay or mr gresham or you yourself if you choose to get yourself made first lord of the treasury  i have no such ambition turnbull  i should have thought you had if i went in for that kind of thing myself i should like to go to the top of the ladder i should feel that if i could do any good at all by becoming a minister i could only do it by becoming first minister  you wouldnt doubt your own fitness for such a position  i doubt my fitness for the position of any minister said mr turnbull  you mean that on other grounds said mr kennedy  i mean it on every ground said mr turnbull rising on his legs and standing with his back to the fire of course i am not fit to have diplomatic intercourse with men who would come to me simply with the desire of deceiving me of course i am unfit to deal with members of parliament who would flock around me because they wanted places of course i am unfit to answer every mans question so as to give no information to any one  could you not answer them so as to give information said mr kennedy  but mr turnbull was so intent on his speech that it may be doubted whether he heard this interruption he took no notice of it as he went on of course i am unfit to maintain the proprieties of a seeming confidence between a crown allpowerless and a people allpowerful no man recognises his own unfitness for such work more clearly than i do mr monk but if i took in hand such work at all i should like to be the leader and not the led tell us fairly now what are your convictions worth in mr mildmays cabinet  that is a question which a man may hardly answer himself said mr monk  it is a question which a man should at least answer for himself before he consents to sit there said mr turnbull in a tone of voice which was almost angry  and what reason have you for supposing that i have omitted that duty said mr monk  simply thisthat i cannot reconcile your known opinions with the practices of your colleagues  i will not tell you what my convictions may be worth in mr mildmays cabinet i will not take upon myself to say that they are worth the chair on which i sit when i am there but i will tell you what my aspirations were when i consented to fill that chair and you shall judge of their worth i thought that they might possibly leaven the batch of bread which we have to bakegiving to the whole batch more of the flavour of reform than it would have possessed had i absented myself i thought that when i was asked to join mr mildmay and mr gresham the very fact of that request indicated liberal progress and that if i refused the request i should be declining to assist in good work  you could have supported them if anything were proposed worthy of support said mr turnbull  yes but i could not have been so effective in taking care that some measure be proposed worthy of support as i may possibly be now i thought a good deal about it and i believe that my decision was right  i am sure you were right said mr kennedy  there can be no juster object of ambition than a seat in the cabinet said phineas  sir i must dispute that said mr turnbull turning round upon our hero i regard the position of our high ministers as most respectable  thank you for so much said mr monk but the orator went on again regardless of the interruption  the position of gentlemen in inferior officesof gentlemen who attend rather to the nods and winks of their superiors in downing street than to the interest of their constituentsi do not regard as being highly respectable  a man cannot begin at the top said phineas  our friend mr monk has begun at what you are pleased to call the top said mr turnbull but i will not profess to think that even he has raised himself by going into office to be an independent representative of a really popular commercial constituency is in my estimation the highest object of an englishmans ambition  but why commercial mr turnbull said mr kennedy  because the commercial constituencies really do elect their own members in accordance with their own judgments whereas the counties and the small towns are coerced either by individuals or by a combination of aristocratic influences  and yet said mr kennedy there are not half a dozen conservatives returned by all the counties in scotland  scotland is very much to be honoured said mr turnbull  mr kennedy was the first to take his departure and mr turnbull followed him very quickly phineas got up to go at the same time but stayed at his hosts request and sat for awhile smoking a cigar  turnbull is a wonderful man said mr monk  does he not domineer too much  his fault is not arrogance so much as ignorance that there is or should be a difference between public and private life in the house of commons a man in mr turnbulls position must speak with dictatorial assurance he is always addressing not the house only but the country at large and the country will not believe in him unless he believe in himself but he forgets that he is not always addressing the country at large i wonder what sort of a time mrs turnbull and the little turnbulls have of it  phineas as he went home made up his mind that mrs turnbull and the little turnbulls must probably have a bad time of it     chapter xix  lord chiltern rides his horse bonebreaker   it was known that whatever might be the details of mr mildmays bill the ballot would not form a part of it and as there was a strong party in the house of commons and a very numerous party out of it who were desirous that voting by ballot should be made a part of the electoral law it was decided that an independent motion should be brought on in anticipation of mr mildmays bill the arrangement was probably one of mr mildmays own making so that he might be hampered by no opposition on that subject by his own followers ifas he did not doubtthe motion should be lost it was expected that the debate would not last over one night and phineas resolved that he would make his maiden speech on this occasion he had very strong opinions as to the inefficacy of the ballot for any good purposes and thought that he might be able to strike out from his convictions some sparks of that fire which used to be so plentiful with him at the old debating clubs but even at breakfast that morning his heart began to beat quickly at the idea of having to stand on his legs before so critical an audience  he knew that it would be well that he should if possible get the subject off his mind during the day and therefore went out among the people who certainly would not talk to him about the ballot he sat for nearly an hour in the morning with mr low and did not even tell mr low that it was his intention to speak on that day then he made one or two other calls and at about three went up to portman square to look for lord chiltern it was now nearly the end of february and phineas had often seen lady laura he had not seen her brother but had learned from his sister that he had been driven up to london by the frost he was told by the porter at lord brentfords that lord chiltern was in the house and as he was passing through the hall he met lord brentford himself he was thus driven to speak and felt himself called upon to explain why he was there i am come to see lord chiltern he said  is lord chiltern in the house said the earl turning to the servant  yes my lord his lordship arrived last night  you will find him upstairs i suppose said the earl for myself i know nothing of him he spoke in an angry tone as though he resented the fact that any one should come to his house to call upon his son and turned his back quickly upon phineas but he thought better of it before he reached the front door and turned again bythebye said he what majority shall we have tonight finn  pretty nearly as many as you please to name my lord said phineas  wellyes i suppose we are tolerably safe you ought to speak upon it  perhaps i may said phineas feeling that he blushed as he spoke  do said the earl do if you see lord chiltern will you tell him from me that i should be glad to see him before he leaves london i shall be at home till noon tomorrow phineas much astonished at the commission given to him of course said that he would do as he was desired and then passed on to lord chilterns apartments  he found his friend standing in the middle of the room without coat and waistcoat with a pair of dumbbells in his hands when theres no hunting im driven to this kind of thing said lord chiltern  i suppose its good exercise said phineas  and it gives me something to do when im in london i feel like a gipsy in church till the time comes for prowling out at night ive no occupation for my days whatever and no place to which i can take myself i cant stand in a club window as some men do and i should disgrace any decent club if i did stand there i belong to the travellers but i doubt whether the porter would let me go in  i think you pique yourself on being more of an outer bohemian than you are said phineas  i pique myself on this that whether bohemian or not i will go nowhere that i am not wanted thoughfor the matter of that i suppose im not wanted here then phineas gave him the message from his father he wishes to see me tomorrow morning continued lord chiltern let him send me word what it is he has to say to me i do not choose to be insulted by him though he is my father  i would certainly go if i were you  i doubt it very much if all the circumstances were the same let him tell me what he wants  of course i cannot ask him chiltern  i know what he wants very well laura has been interfering and doing no good you know violet effingham  yes i know her said phineas much surprised  they want her to marry me  and you do not wish to marry her  i did not say that but do you think that such a girl as miss effingham would marry such a man as i am she would be much more likely to take you by george she would do you know that she has three thousand a year of her own  i know that she has money  thats about the tune of it i would take her without a shilling tomorrow if she would have mebecause i like her she is the only girl i ever did like but what is the use of my liking her they have painted me so black among them especially my father that no decent girl would think of marrying me  your father cant be angry with you if you do your best to comply with his wishes  i dont care a straw whether he be angry or not he allows me eight hundred a year and he knows that if he stopped it i should go to the jews the next day i could not help myself he cant leave an acre away from me and yet he wont join me in raising money for the sake of paying laura her fortune  lady laura can hardly want money now  that detestable prig whom she has chosen to marry and whom i hate with all my heart is richer than ever croesus was but nevertheless laura ought to have her own money she shall have it some day  i would see lord brentford if i were you  i will think about it now tell me about coming down to willingford laura says you will come some day in march i can mount you for a couple of days and should be delighted to have you my horses all pull like the mischief and rush like devils and want a deal of riding but an irishman likes that  i do not dislike it particularly  i like it i prefer to have something to do on horseback when a man tells me that a horse is an armchair i always tell him to put the brute into his bedroom mind you come the house i stay at is called the willingford bull and its just four miles from peterborough phineas swore that he would go down and ride the pulling horses and then took his leave earnestly advising lord chiltern as he went to keep the appointment proposed by his father  when the morning came at halfpast eleven the son who had been standing for half an hour with his back to the fire in the large gloomy diningroom suddenly rang the bell tell the earl he said to the servant that i am here and will go to him if he wishes it the servant came back and said that the earl was waiting then lord chiltern strode after the man into his fathers room  oswald said the father i have sent for you because i think it may be as well to speak to you on some business will you sit down lord chiltern sat down but did not answer a word i feel very unhappy about your sisters fortune said the earl  so do ivery unhappy we can raise the money between us and pay her tomorrow if you please it  it was in opposition to my advice that she paid your debts  and in opposition to mine too  i told her that i would not pay them and were i to give her back tomorrow as you say the money that she has so used i should be stultifying myself but i will do so on one condition i will join with you in raising the money for your sister on one condition  what is that  laura tells meindeed she has told me oftenthat you are attached to violet effingham  but violet effingham my lord is unhappily not attached to me  i do not know how that may be of course i cannot say i have never taken the liberty of interrogating her upon the subject  even you my lord could hardly have done that  what do you mean by that i say that i never have said the earl angrily  i simply mean that even you could hardly have asked miss effingham such a question i have asked her and she has refused me  but girls often do that and yet accept afterwards the men whom they have refused laura tells me that she believes that violet would consent if you pressed your suit  laura knows nothing about it my lord  there you are probably wrong laura and violet are very close friends and have no doubt discussed this matter between them at any rate it may be as well that you should hear what i have to say of course i shall not interfere myself there is no ground on which i can do so with propriety  none whatever said lord chiltern  the earl became very angry and nearly broke down in his anger he paused for a moment feeling disposed to tell his son to go and never to see him again but he gulped down his wrath and went on with his speech my meaning sir is thisthat i have so great faith in violet effingham that i would receive her acceptance of your hand as the only proof which would be convincing to me of amendment in your mode of life if she were to do so i would join with you in raising money to pay your sister would make some further sacrifice with reference to an income for you and your wife andwould make you both welcome to saulsbyif you chose to come the earls voice hesitated much and became almost tremulous as he made the last proposition and his eyes had fallen away from his sons gaze and he had bent a little over the table and was moved but he recovered himself at once and added with all proper dignity if you have anything to say i shall be glad to hear it  all your offers would be nothing my lord if i did not like the girl  i should not ask you to marry a girl if you did not like her as you call it  but as to miss effingham it happens that our wishes jump together i have asked her and she has refused me i dont even know where to find her to ask her again if i went to lady baldocks house the servants would not let me in  and whose fault is that  yours partly my lord you have told everybody that i am the devil and now all the old women believe it  i never told anybody so  ill tell you what ill do i will go down to lady baldocks today i suppose she is at baddingham and if i can get speech of miss effingham  miss effingham is not at baddingham miss effingham is staying with your sister in grosvenor place i saw her yesterday  she is in london  i tell you that i saw her yesterday  very well my lord then i will do the best i can laura will tell you of the result  the father would have given the son some advice as to the mode in which he should put forward his claim upon violets hand but the son would not wait to hear it choosing to presume that the conference was over he went back to the room in which he had kept his dumbbells and for a minute or two went to work at his favourite exercise but he soon put the dumbbells down and began to prepare himself for his work if this thing was to be done it might as well be done at once he looked out of his window and saw that the streets were in a mess of slush white snow was becoming black mud as it will do in london and the violence of frost was giving way to the horrors of thaw all would be soft and comparatively pleasant in northamptonshire on the following morning and if everything went right he would breakfast at the willingford bull he would go down by the hunting train and be at the inn by ten the meet was only six miles distant and all would be pleasant he would do this whatever might be the result of his work todaybut in the meantime he would go and do his work he had a cab called and within half an hour of the time at which he had left his father he was at the door of his sisters house in grosvenor place the servants told him that the ladies were at lunch i cant eat lunch he said tell them that i am in the drawingroom  he has come to see you said lady laura as soon as the servant had left the room  i hope not said violet  do not say that  but i do say it i hope he has not come to see methat is not to see me specially of course i cannot pretend not to know what you mean  he may think it civil to call if he has heard that you are in town said lady laura after a pause  if it be only that i will be civil in returnas sweet as may to him if it be really only that and if i were sure of it i should be really glad to see him then they finished their lunch and lady laura got up and led the way to the drawingroom  i hope you remember said she gravely that you might be a saviour to him  i do not believe in girls being saviours to men it is the man who should be the saviour to the girl if i marry at all i have the right to expect that protection shall be given to menot that i shall have to give it  violet you are determined to misrepresent what i mean  lord chiltern was walking about the room and did not sit down when they entered the ordinary greetings took place and miss effingham made some remark about the frost but it seems to be going she said and i suppose that you will soon be at work again  yesi shall hunt tomorrow said lord chiltern  and the next day and the next and the next said violet till about the middle of apriland then your period of misery will begin  exactly said lord chiltern i have nothing but hunting that i can call an occupation  why dont you make one said his sister  i mean to do so if it be possible laura would you mind leaving me and miss effingham alone for a few minutes  lady laura got up and so also did miss effingham for what purpose said the latter it cannot be for any good purpose  at any rate i wish it and i will not harm you lady laura was now going but paused before she reached the door laura will you do as i ask you said the brother then lady laura went  it was not that i feared you would harm me lord chiltern said violet  noi know it was not but what i say is always said awkwardly an hour ago i did not know that you were in town but when i was told the news i came at once my father told me  i am so glad that you see your father  i have not spoken to him for months before and probably may not speak to him for months again but there is one point violet on which he and i agree  i hope there will soon be many  it is possiblebut i fear not probable look here violetand he looked at her with all his eyes till it seemed to her that he was all eyes so great was the intensity of his gazei should scorn myself were i to permit myself to come before you with a plea for your favour founded on my fathers whims my father is unreasonable and has been very unjust to me he has ever believed evil of me and has believed it often when all the world knew that he was wrong i care little for being reconciled to a father who has been so cruel to me  he loves me dearly and is my friend i would rather that you should not speak against him to me  you will understand at least that i am asking nothing from you because he wishes it laura probably has told you that you may make things straight by becoming my wife  she hascertainly lord chiltern  it is an argument that she should never have used it is an argument to which you should not listen for a moment make things straight indeed who can tell there would be very little made straight by such a marriage if it were not that i loved you violet that is my plea and my only one i love you so well that i do believe that if you took me i should return to the old ways and become as other men are and be in time as respectable as stupidand perhaps as illnatured as old lady baldock herself  my poor aunt  you know she says worse things of me than that now dearest you have heard all that i have to say to you as he spoke he came close to her and put out his handbut she did not touch it i have no other argument to usenot a word more to say as i came here in the cab i was turning it over in my mind that i might find what best i should say but after all there is nothing more to be said than that  the words make no difference she replied  not unless they be so uttered as to force a belief i do love you i know no other reason but that why you should be my wife i have no other excuse to offer for coming to you again you are the one thing in the world that to me has any charm can you be surprised that i should be persistent in asking for it he was looking at her still with the same gaze and there seemed to be a power in his eye from which she could not escape he was still standing with his right hand out as though expecting or at least hoping that her hand might be put into his  how am i to answer you she said  with your love if you can give it to me do you remember how you swore once that you would love me for ever and always  you should not remind me of that i was a child thena naughty child she added smiling and was put to bed for what i did on that day  be a child still  ah if we but could  and have you no other answer to make me  of course i must answer you you are entitled to an answer lord chiltern i am sorry that i cannot give you the love for which you ask  never  never  is it myself personally or what you have heard of me that is so hateful to you  nothing is hateful to me i have never spoken of hate i shall always feel the strongest regard for my old friend and playfellow but there are many things which a woman is bound to consider before she allows herself so to love a man that she can consent to become his wife  allow herself then it is a matter entirely of calculation  i suppose there should be some thought in it lord chiltern  there was now a pause and the mans hand was at last allowed to drop as there came no response to the proffered grasp he walked once or twice across the room before he spoke again and then he stopped himself closely opposite to her  i shall never try again he said  it will be better so she replied  there is something to me unmanly in a mans persecuting a girl just tell laura will you that it is all over and she may as well tell my father goodbye  she then tendered her hand to him but he did not take itprobably did not see it and at once left the room and the house  and yet i believe you love him lady laura said to her friend in her anger when they discussed the matter immediately on lord chilterns departure  you have no right to say that laura  i have a right to my belief and i do believe it i think you love him and that you lack the courage to risk yourself in trying to save him  is a woman bound to marry a man if she love him  yes she is replied lady laura impetuously without thinking of what she was saying that is if she be convinced that she also is loved  whatever be the mans characterwhatever be the circumstances must she do so whatever friends may say to the contrary is there to be no prudence in marriage  there may be a great deal too much prudence said lady laura  that is true there is certainly too much prudence if a woman marries prudently but without love violet intended by this no attack upon her friendhad not had present in her mind at the moment any idea of lady lauras special prudence in marrying mr kennedy but lady laura felt it keenly and knew at once that an arrow had been shot which had wounded her  we shall get nothing she said by descending to personalities with each other  i meant none laura  i suppose it is always hard said lady laura for any one person to judge altogether of the mind of another if i have said anything severe of your refusal of my brother i retract it i only wish that it could have been otherwise  lord chiltern when he left his sisters house walked through the slush and dirt to a haunt of his in the neighbourhood of covent garden and there he remained through the whole afternoon and evening a certain captain clutterbuck joined him and dined with him he told nothing to captain clutterbuck of his sorrow but captain clutterbuck could see that he was unhappy  lets have another bottle of cham said captain clutterbuck when their dinner was nearly over cham is the only thing to screw one up when one is down a peg  you can have what you like said lord chiltern but i shall have some brandyandwater  the worst of brandyandwater is that one gets tired of it before the night is over said captain clutterbuck  nevertheless lord chiltern did go down to peterborough the next day by the hunting train and rode his horse bonebreaker so well in that famous run from sutton springs to gidding that after the run young pilesof the house of piles sarsnet and ginghamoffered him three hundred pounds for the animal  he isnt worth above fifty said lord chiltern  but ill give you the three hundred said piles  you couldnt ride him if youd got him said lord chiltern  oh couldnt i said piles but mr piles did not continue the conversation contenting himself with telling his friend grogram that that red devil chiltern was as drunk as a lord     chapter xx  the debate on the ballot   phineas took his seat in the house with a consciousness of much inward trepidation of heart on that night of the ballot debate after leaving lord chiltern he went down to his club and dined alone three or four men came and spoke to him but he could not talk to them at his ease nor did he quite know what they were saying to him he was going to do something which he longed to achieve but the very idea of which now that it was so near to him was a terror to him to be in the house and not to speak would to his thinking be a disgraceful failure indeed he could not continue to keep his seat unless he spoke he had been put there that he might speak he would speak of course he would speak had he not already been conspicuous almost as a boy orator and yet at this moment he did not know whether he was eating mutton or beef or who was standing opposite to him and talking to him so much was he in dread of the ordeal which he had prepared for himself as he went down to the house after dinner he almost made up his mind that it would be a good thing to leave london by one of the night mail trains he felt himself to be stiff and stilted as he walked and that his clothes were uneasy to him when he turned into westminster hall he regretted more keenly than ever he had done that he had seceded from the keeping of mr low he could he thought have spoken very well in court and would there have learned that selfconfidence which now failed him so terribly it was however too late to think of that he could only go in and take his seat  he went in and took his seat and the chamber seemed to him to be mysteriously large as though benches were crowded over benches and galleries over galleries he had been long enough in the house to have lost the original awe inspired by the speaker and the clerks of the house by the row of ministers and by the unequalled importance of the place on ordinary occasions he could saunter in and out and whisper at his ease to a neighbour but on this occasion he went direct to the bench on which he ordinarily sat and began at once to rehearse to himself his speech he had in truth been doing this all day in spite of the effort that he had made to rid himself of all memory of the occasion he had been collecting the heads of his speech while mr low had been talking to him and refreshing his quotations in the presence of lord chiltern and the dumbbells he had taxed his memory and his intellect with various tasks which as he feared would not adjust themselves one with another he had learned the headings of his speechso that one heading might follow the other and nothing be forgotten and he had learned verbatim the words which he intended to utter under each headingwith a hope that if any one compact part should be destroyed or injured in its compactness by treachery of memory or by the course of the debate each other compact part might be there in its entirety ready for useor at least so many of the compact parts as treachery of memory and the accidents of the debate might leave to him so that his speech might be like a vessel watertight in its various compartments that would float by the buoyancy of its stern and bow even though the hold should be waterlogged but this use of his composed words even though he should be able to carry it through would not complete his workfor it would be his duty to answer in some sort those who had gone before him and in order to do this he must be able to insert without any prearrangement of words or ideas little intercalatory parts between those compact masses of argument with which he had been occupying himself for many laborious hours as he looked round upon the house and perceived that everything was dim before him that all his original awe of the house had returned and with it a present quaking fear that made him feel the pulsations of his own heart he became painfully aware that the task he had prepared for himself was too great he should on this the occasion of his rising to his maiden legs have either prepared for himself a short general speech which could indeed have done little for his credit in the house but which might have served to carry off the novelty of the thing and have introduced him to the sound of his own voice within those wallsor he should have trusted to what his wit and spirit would produce for him on the spur of the moment and not have burdened himself with a huge exercise of memory during the presentation of a few petitions he tried to repeat to himself the first of his compact partsa compact part on which as it might certainly be brought into use let the debate have gone as it might he had expended great care he had flattered himself that there was something of real strength in his words as he repeated them to himself in the comfortable seclusion of his own room and he had made them so ready to his tongue that he thought it to be impossible that he should forget even an intonation now he found that he could not remember the first phrases without unloosing and looking at a small roll of paper which he held furtively in his hand what was the good of looking at it he would forget it again in the next moment he had intended to satisfy the most eager of his friends and to astound his opponents as it was no one would be satisfiedand none astounded but they who had trusted in him  the debate began and if the leisure afforded by a long and tedious speech could have served him he might have had leisure enough he tried at first to follow all that this advocate for the ballot might say hoping thence to acquire the impetus of strong interest but he soon wearied of the work and began to long that the speech might be ended although the period of his own martyrdom would thereby be brought nearer to him at halfpast seven so many members had deserted their seats that phineas began to think that he might be saved all further pains by a count out he reckoned the members present and found that they were below the mystic fortyfirst by two then by four by five by seven and at one time by eleven it was not for him to ask the speaker to count the house but he wondered that no one else should do so and yet as the idea of this termination to the nights work came upon him and as he thought of his lost labour he almost took courage againalmost dreaded rather than wished for the interference of some malicious member but there was no malicious member then present or else it was known that lords of the treasury and lords of the admiralty would flock in during the speakers ponderous countingand thus the slow length of the ballotlovers verbosity was permitted to evolve itself without interruption at eight oclock he had completed his catalogue of illustrations and immediately mr monk rose from the treasury bench to explain the grounds on which the government must decline to support the motion before the house  phineas was aware that mr monk intended to speak and was aware also that his speech would be very short my idea is he had said to phineas that every man possessed of the franchise should dare to have and to express a political opinion of his own that otherwise the franchise is not worth having and that men will learn that when all so dare no evil can come from such daring as the ballot would make any courage of that kind unnecessary i dislike the ballot i shall confine myself to that and leave the illustration to younger debaters phineas also had been informed that mr turnbull would reply to mr monk with the purpose of crushing mr monk into dust and phineas had prepared his speech with something of an intention of subsequently crushing mr turnbull he knew however that he could not command his opportunity there was the chapter of accidents to which he must accommodate himself but such had been his programme for the evening  mr monk made his speechand though he was short he was very fiery and energetic quick as lightning words of wrath and scorn flew from him in which he painted the cowardice the meanness the falsehood of the ballot the ballotbox he said was the grave of all true political opinion though he spoke hardly for ten minutes he seemed to say more than enough ten times enough to slaughter the argument of the former speaker at every hot word as it fell phineas was driven to regret that a paragraph of his own was taken away from him and that his choicest morsels of standing ground were being cut from under his feet when mr monk sat down phineas felt that mr monk had said all that he phineas finn had intended to say  then mr turnbull rose slowly from the bench below the gangway with a speaker so frequent and so famous as mr turnbull no hurry is necessary he is sure to have his opportunity the speakers eye is ever travelling to the accustomed spots mr turnbull rose slowly and began his oration very mildly there was nothing he said that he admired so much as the poetic imagery and the highflown sentiment of his right honourable friend the member for west bromwichmr monk sat for west bromwichunless it were the stubborn facts and unanswered arguments of his honourable friend who had brought forward this motion then mr turnbull proceeded after his fashion to crush mr monk he was very prosaic very clear both in voice and language very harsh and very unscrupulous he and mr monk had been joined together in politics for over twenty yearsbut one would have thought from mr turnbulls words that they had been the bitterest of enemies mr monk was taunted with his office taunted with his desertion of the liberal party taunted with his ambitionand taunted with his lack of ambition i once thought said mr turnbullnay not long ago i thought that he and i would have fought this battle for the people shoulder to shoulder and knee to kneebut he has preferred that the knee next to his own shall wear a garter and that the shoulder which supports him shall be decked with a blue ribbonas shoulders i presume are decked in those closet conferences which are called cabinets  just after this while mr turnbull was still going on with a variety of illustrations drawn from the united states barrington erle stepped across the benches up to the place where phineas was sitting and whispered a few words into his ear bonteen is prepared to answer turnbull and wishes to do it i told him that i thought you should have the opportunity if you wish it phineas was not ready with a reply to erle at the spur of the moment somebody told me continued erle that you had said that you would like to speak tonight  so i did said phineas  shall i tell bonteen that you will do it  the chamber seemed to swim round before our heros eyes mr turnbull was still going on with his clear loud unpleasant voice but there was no knowing how long he might go on upon phineas if he should now consent might devolve the duty within ten minutes within three minutes of rising there before a full house to defend his great friend mr monk from a gross personal attack was it fit that such a novice as he should undertake such a work as that were he to do so all that speech which he had prepared with its various selffloating parts must go for nothing the task was exactly that which of all tasks he would best like to have accomplished and to have accomplished well but if he should fail and he felt that he would fail for such work a man should have all his senses about himhis full courage perfect confidence something almost approaching to contempt for listening opponents and nothing of fear in regard to listening friends he should be as a cock in his own farmyard master of all the circumstances around him but phineas finn had not even as yet heard the sound of his own voice in that room at this moment so confused was he that he did not know where sat mr mildmay and where mr daubeny all was confused and there arose as it were a sound of waters in his ears and a feeling as of a great hell around him i had rather wait he said at last bonteen had better reply barrington erle looked into his face and then stepping back across the benches told mr bonteen that the opportunity was his  mr turnbull continued speaking quite long enough to give poor phineas time for repentance but repentance was of no use he had decided against himself and his decision could not be reversed he would have left the house only it seemed to him that had he done so every one would look at him he drew his hat down over his eyes and remained in his place hating mr bonteen hating barrington erle hating mr turnbullbut hating no one so much as he hated himself he had disgraced himself for ever and could never recover the occasion which he had lost  mr bonteens speech was in no way remarkable mr monk he said had done the state good service by adding his wisdom and patriotism to the cabinet the sort of argument which mr bonteen used to prove that a man who has gained credit as a legislator should in process of time become a member of the executive is trite and common and was not used by mr bonteen with any special force mr bonteen was glib of tongue and possessed that familiarity with the place which poor phineas had lacked so sorely there was one moment however which was terrible to phineas as soon as mr bonteen had shown the purpose for which he was on his legs mr monk looked round at phineas as though in reproach he had expected that this work should fall into the hands of one who would perform it with more warmth of heart than could be expected from mr bonteen when mr bonteen ceased two or three other short speeches were made and members fired off their little guns phineas having lost so great an opportunity would not now consent to accept one that should be comparatively valueless then there came a division the motion was lost by a large majorityby any number you might choose to name as phineas had said to lord brentford but in that there was no triumph to the poor wretch who had failed through fear and who was now a coward in his own esteem  he left the house alone carefully avoiding all speech with any one as he came out he had seen laurence fitzgibbon in the lobby but he had gone on without pausing a moment so that he might avoid his friend and when he was out in palace yard where was he to go next he looked at his watch and found that it was just ten he did not dare to go to his club and it was impossible for him to go home and to bed he was very miserable and nothing would comfort him but sympathy was there any one who would listen to his abuse of himself and would then answer him with kindly apologies for his own weakness mrs bunce would do it if she knew how but sympathy from mrs bunce would hardly avail there was but one person in the world to whom he could tell his own humiliation with any hope of comfort and that person was lady laura kennedy sympathy from any man would have been distasteful to him he had thought for a moment of flinging himself at mr monks feet and telling all his weaknessbut he could not have endured pity even from mr monk it was not to be endured from any man  he thought that lady laura kennedy would be at home and probably alone he knew at any rate that he might be allowed to knock at her door even at that hour he had left mr kennedy in the house and there he would probably remain for the next hour there was no man more constant than mr kennedy in seeing the work of the dayor of the nightto its end so phineas walked up victoria street and from thence into grosvenor place and knocked at lady lauras door yes lady laura was at home and alone he was shown up into the drawingroom and there he found lady laura waiting for her husband  so the great debate is over she said with as much of irony as she knew how to throw into the epithet  yes it is over  and what have they donethose leviathans of the people  then phineas told her what was the majority  is there anything the matter with you mr finn she said looking at him suddenly are you not well  yes i am very well  will you not sit down there is something wrong i know what is it  i have simply been the greatest idiot the greatest coward the most awkward ass that ever lived  what do you mean  i do not know why i should come to tell you of it at this hour at night but i have come that i might tell you probably because there is no one else in the whole world who would not laugh at me  at any rate i shall not laugh at you said lady laura  but you will despise me  that i am sure i shall not do  you cannot help it i despise myself for years i have placed before myself the ambition of speaking in the house of commonsfor years i have been thinking whether there would ever come to me an opportunity of making myself heard in that assembly which i consider to be the first in the world today the opportunity has been offered to meand though the motion was nothing the opportunity was great the subject was one on which i was thoroughly prepared the manner in which i was summoned was most flattering to me i was especially called on to perform a task which was most congenial to my feelingsand i declined because i was afraid  you had thought too much about it my friend said lady laura  too much or too little what does it matter replied phineas in despair there is the fact i could not do it do you remember the story of conachar in the fair maid of perthhow his heart refused to give him blood enough to fight he had been suckled with the milk of a timid creature and though he could die there was none of the strength of manhood in him it is about the same thing with me i take it  i do not think you are at all like conachar said lady laura  i am equally disgraced and i must perish after the same fashion i shall apply for the chiltern hundreds in a day or two  you will do nothing of the kind said lady laura getting up from her chair and coming towards him you shall not leave this room till you have promised me that you will do nothing of the kind i do not know as yet what has occurred tonight but i do know that that modesty which has kept you silent is more often a grace than a disgrace  this was the kind of sympathy which he wanted she drew her chair nearer to him and then he explained to her as accurately as he could what had taken place in the house on this eveninghow he had prepared his speech how he had felt that his preparation was vain how he perceived from the course of the debate that if he spoke at all his speech must be very different from what he had first intended how he had declined to take upon himself a task which seemed to require so close a knowledge of the ways of the house and of the temper of the men as the defence of such a man as mr monk in accusing himself he unconsciously excused himself and his excuse in lady lauras ears was more valid than his accusation  and you would give it all up for that she said  yes i think i ought  i have very little doubt but that you were right in allowing mr bonteen to undertake such a task i should simply explain to mr monk that you felt too keen an interest in his welfare to stand up as an untried member in his defence it is not i think the work for a man who is not at home in the house i am sure mr monk will feel this and i am quite certain that mr kennedy will think that you have been right  i do not care what mr kennedy may think  why do you say that mr finn that is not courteous  simply because i care so much what mr kennedys wife may think your opinion is all in all to meonly that i know you are too kind to me  he would not be too kind to you he is never too kind to any one he is justice itself  phineas as he heard the tones of her voice could not but feel that there was in lady lauras words something of an accusation against her husband  i hate justice said phineas i know that justice would condemn me but love and friendship know nothing of justice the value of love is that it overlooks faults and forgives even crimes  i at any rate said lady laura will forgive the crime of your silence in the house my strong belief in your success will not be in the least affected by what you tell me of your failure tonight you must await another opportunity and if possible you should be less anxious as to your own performance there is violet as lady laura spoke the last words there was a sound of a carriage stopping in the street and the front door was immediately opened she is staying here but has been dining with her uncle admiral effingham then violet effingham entered the room rolled up in pretty white furs and silk cloaks and lace shawls here is mr finn come to tell us of the debate about the ballot  i dont care twopence about the ballot said violet as she put out her hand to phineas are we going to have a new iron fleet built thats the question  sir simeon has come out strong tonight said lady laura  there is no political question of any importance except the question of the iron fleet said violet i am quite sure of that and so if mr finn can tell me nothing about the iron fleet ill go to bed  mr kennedy will tell you everything when he comes home said phineas  oh mr kennedy mr kennedy never tells one anything i doubt whether mr kennedy thinks that any woman knows the meaning of the british constitution  do you know what it means violet asked lady laura  to be sure i do it is liberty to growl about the iron fleet or the ballot or the taxes or the peers or the bishopsor anything else except the house of commons thats the british constitution goodnight mr finn  what a beautiful creature she is said phineas  yes indeed said lady laura  and full of wit and grace and pleasantness i do not wonder at your brothers choice  it will be remembered that this was said on the day before lord chiltern had made his offer for the third time  poor oswald he does not know as yet that she is in town  after that phineas went not wishing to await the return of mr kennedy he had felt that violet effingham had come into the room just in time to remedy a great difficulty he did not wish to speak of his love to a married womanto the wife of the man who called him friendto a woman who he felt sure would have rebuked him but he could hardly have restrained himself had not miss effingham been there  but as he went home he thought more of miss effingham than he did of lady laura and i think that the voice of miss effingham had done almost as much towards comforting him as had the kindness of the other  at any rate he had been comforted     chapter xxi  do be punctual   on the very morning after his failure in the house of commons when phineas was reading in the telegraphhe took the telegraph not from choice but for economythe words of that debate which he had heard and in which he should have taken a part a most unwelcome visit was paid to him it was near eleven and the breakfast things were still on the table he was at this time on a committee of the house with reference to the use of potted peas in the army and navy at which he had sat onceat a preliminary meetingand in reference to which he had already resolved that as he had failed so frightfully in debate he would certainly do his duty to the utmost in the more easy but infinitely more tedious work of the committee room the committee met at twelve and he intended to walk down to the reform club and then to the house he had just completed his reading of the debate and of the leaders in the telegraph on the subject he had told himself how little the writer of the article knew about mr turnbull how little about mr monk and how little about the peoplesuch being his own ideas as to the qualifications of the writer of that leading articleand was about to start but mrs bunce arrested him by telling him that there was a man below who wanted to see him  what sort of a man mrs bunce  he aint a gentleman sir  did he give his name  he did not sir but i know its about money i know the ways of them so well ive seen this ones face before somewhere  you had better show him up said phineas he knew well the business on which the man was come the man wanted money for that bill which laurence fitzgibbon had sent afloat and which phineas had endorsed phineas had never as yet fallen so deeply into troubles of money as to make it necessary that he need refuse himself to any callers on that score and he did not choose to do so now nevertheless he most heartily wished that he had left his lodgings for the club before the man had come this was not the first he had heard of the bill being overdue and unpaid the bill had been brought to him noted a month since and then he had simply told the youth who brought it that he would see mr fitzgibbon and have the matter settled he had spoken to his friend laurence and laurence had simply assured him that all should be made right in two daysor at furthest by the end of a week since that time he had observed that his friend had been somewhat shy of speaking to him when no others were with them phineas would not have alluded to the bill had he and laurence been alone together but he had been quick enough to guess from his friends manner that the matter was not settled now no doubt serious trouble was about to commence  the visitor was a little man with grey hair and a white cravat some sixty years of age dressed in black with a very decent hatwhich on entering the room he at once put down on the nearest chairwith reference to whom any judge on the subject would have concurred at first sight in the decision pronounced by mrs bunce though none but a judge very well used to sift the causes of his own conclusions could have given the reasons for that early decision he aint a gentleman mrs bunce had said and the man certainly was not a gentleman the old man in the white cravat was very neatly dressed and carried himself without any of that humility which betrays one class of uncertified aspirants to gentility or of that assumed arrogance which is at once fatal to another class but nevertheless mrs bunce had seen at a glance that he was not a gentlemanhad seen moreover that such a man could have come only upon one mission she was right there too this visitor had come about money  about this bill mr finn said the visitor proceeding to take out of his breast coatpocket a rather large leathern case as he advanced up towards the fire my name is clarkson mr finn if i may venture so far ill take a chair  certainly mr clarkson said phineas getting up and pointing to a seat  thankye mr finn thankye we shall be more comfortable doing business sitting shant we whereupon the horrid little man drew himself close in to the fire and spreading out his leathern case upon his knees began to turn over one suspicious bit of paper after another as though he were uncertain in what part of his portfolio lay this identical bit which he was seeking he seemed to be quite at home and to feel that there was no ground whatever for hurry in such comfortable quarters phineas hated him at oncewith a hatred altogether unconnected with the difficulty which his friend fitzgibbon had brought upon him  here it is said mr clarkson at last oh dear me dear me the third of november and here we are in march i didnt think it was so bad as thisi didnt indeed this is very badvery bad and for parliament gents too who should be more punctual than anybody because of the privilege shouldnt they now mr finn  all men should be punctual i suppose said phineas  of course they should of course they should i always say to my gents be punctual and ill do anything for you but perhaps mr finn you can hand me a cheque for this amount and then you and i will begin square  indeed i cannot mr clarkson  not hand me a cheque for it  upon my word no  thats very badvery bad indeed then i suppose i must take the half and renew for the remainder though i dont like iti dont indeed  i can pay no part of that bill mr clarkson  pay no part of it and mr clarkson in order that he might the better express his surprise arrested his hand in the very act of poking his hosts fire  if youll allow me ill manage the fire said phineas putting out his hand for the poker  but mr clarkson was fond of poking fires and would not surrender the poker pay no part of it he said again holding the poker away from phineas in his left hand dont say that mr finn pray dont say that dont drive me to be severe i dont like to be severe with my gents ill do anything mr finn if youll only be punctual  the fact is mr clarkson i have never had one penny of consideration for that bill and  oh mr finn oh mr finn and then mr clarkson had his will of the fire  i never had one penny of consideration for that bill continued phineas of course i dont deny my responsibility  no mr finn you cant deny that here it isphineas finnand everybody knows you because youre a parliament gent  i dont deny it but i had no reason to suppose that i should be called upon for the money when i accommodated my friend mr fitzgibbon and i have not got it that is the long and the short of it i must see him and take care that arrangements are made  arrangements  yes arrangements for settling the bill  he hasnt got the money mr finn you know that as well as i do  i know nothing about it mr clarkson  oh yes mr finn you know you know  i tell you i know nothing about it said phineas waxing angry  as to mr fitzgibbon hes the pleasantest gent that ever lived isnt he now ive knowd him these ten years i dont suppose that for ten years ive been without his name in my pocket but bless you mr finn theres an end to everything i shouldnt have looked at this bit of paper if it hadnt been for your signature of course not youre just beginning and its natural you should want a little help youll find me always ready if youll only be punctual  i tell you again sir that i never had a shilling out of that for myself and do not want any such help here mr clarkson smiled sweetly i gave my name to my friend simply to oblige him  i like you irish gents because you do hang together so close said mr clarkson  simply to oblige him continued phineas as i said before i know that i am responsible but as i said before also i have not the means of taking up that bill i will see mr fitzgibbon and let you know what we propose to do then phineas got up from his seat and took his hat it was full time that he should go down to his committee but mr clarkson did not get up from his seat im afraid i must ask you to leave me now mr clarkson as i have business down at the house  business at the house never presses mr finn said mr clarkson thats the best of parliament ive known parliament gents this thirty years and more would you believe itive had a prime ministers name in that portfolio that i have and a lord chancellors that i haveand an archbishops too i know what parliament is mr finn come come dont put me off with parliament  there he sat before the fire with his pouch open before him and phineas had no power of moving him could phineas have paid him the money which was manifestly due to him on the bill the man would of course have gone but failing in that phineas could not turn him out there was a black cloud on the young members brow and great anger at his heartagainst fitzgibbon rather than against the man who was sitting there before him sir he said it is really imperative that i should go i am pledged to an appointment at the house at twelve and it wants now only a quarter i regret that your interview with me should be so unsatisfactory but i can only promise you that i will see mr fitzgibbon  and when shall i call again mr finn  perhaps i had better write to you said phineas  oh dear no said mr clarkson i should much prefer to look in looking in is always best we can get to understand one another in that way let me see i daresay youre not particular suppose i say sunday morning  really i could not see you on sunday morning mr clarkson  parliament gents aint generally particularspeciaily not among the catholics pleaded mr clarkson  i am always engaged on sundays said phineas  suppose we say mondayor tuesday tuesday morning at eleven and do be punctual mr finn at tuesday morning ill come and then no doubt i shall find you ready whereupon mr clarkson slowly put up his bills within his portfolio and then before phineas knew where he was had warmly shaken that poor dismayed member of parliament by the hand only do be punctual mr finn he said as he made his way down the stairs  it was now twelve and phineas rushed off to a cab he was in such a fervour of rage and misery that he could hardly think of his position or what he had better do till he got into the committee room and when there he could think of nothing else he intended to go deeply into the question of potted peas holding an equal balance between the assailed government offices on the one hand and the advocates of the potted peas on the other the potters of the peas who wanted to sell their article to the crown declared that an extensiveperhaps we may say an unlimiteduse of the article would save the whole army and navy from the scourges of scurvy dyspepsia and rheumatism would be the best safeguard against typhus and other fevers and would be an invaluable aid in all other maladies to which soldiers and sailors are peculiarly subject the peas in question were grown on a large scale in holstein and their growth had been fostered with the special object of doing good to the british army and navy the peas were so cheap that there would be a great saving in moneyand it really had seemed to many that the officials of the horse guards and the admiralty had been actuated by some fiendish desire to deprive their men of salutary fresh vegetables simply because they were of foreign growth but the officials of the war office and the admiralty declared that the potted peas in question were hardly fit for swine the motion for the committee had been made by a gentleman of the opposition and phineas had been put upon it as an independent member he had resolved to give it all his mind and as far as he was concerned to reach a just decision in which there should be no favour shown to the government side new brooms are proverbial for thorough work and in this committee work phineas was as yet a new broom but unfortunately on this day his mind was so harassed that he could hardly understand what was going on it did not perhaps much signify as the witnesses examined were altogether agricultural they only proved the production of peas in holsteina fact as to which phineas had no doubt the proof was naturally slow as the evidence was given in german and had to be translated into english and the work of the day was much impeded by a certain member who unfortunately spoke german who seemed to be fond of speaking german before his brethren of the committee and who was curious as to agriculture in holstein generally the chairman did not understand german and there was a difficulty in checking this gentleman and in making him understand that his questions were not relevant to the issue  phineas could not keep his mind during the whole afternoon from the subject of his misfortune what should he do if this horrid man came to him once or twice a week he certainly did owe the man the money he must admit that to himself the man no doubt was a dishonest knave who had discounted the bill probably at fifty per cent but nevertheless phineas had made himself legally responsible for the amount the privilege of the house prohibited him from arrest he thought of that very often but the thought only made him the more unhappy would it not be said and might it not be said truly that he had incurred this responsibilitya responsibility which he was altogether unequal to answerbecause he was so protected he did feel that a certain consciousness of his privilege had been present to him when he had put his name across the paper and there had been dishonesty in that very consciousness and of what service would his privilege be to him if this man could harass every hour of his life the man was to be with him again in a day or two and when the appointment had been proposed he phineas had not dared to negative it and how was he to escape as for paying the bill that with him was altogether impossible the man had told himand he had believed the manthat payment by fitzgibbon was out of the question and yet fitzgibbon was the son of a peer whereas he was only the son of a country doctor of course fitzgibbon must make some effortsome great effortand have the thing settled alas alas he knew enough of the world already to feel that the hope was vain  he went down from the committee room into the house and he dined at the house and remained there until eight or nine at night but fitzgibbon did not come he then went to the reform club but he was not there both at the club and in the house many men spoke to him about the debate of the previous night expressing surprise that he had not spokenmaking him more and more wretched he saw mr monk but mr monk was walking arm in arm with his colleague mr palliser and phineas could do no more than just speak to them he thought that mr monks nod of recognition was very cold that might be fancy but it certainly was a fact that mr monk only nodded to him he would tell mr monk the truth and then if mr monk chose to quarrel with him he at any rate would take no step to renew their friendship  from the reform club he went to the shakspeare a smaller club to which fitzgibbon belongedand of which phineas much wished to become a memberand to which he knew that his friend resorted when he wished to enjoy himself thoroughly and to be at ease in his inn men at the shakspeare could do as they pleased there were no politics there no fashion no stiffness and no rulesso men said but that was hardly true everybody called everybody by his christian name and members smoked all over the house they who did not belong to the shakspeare thought it an elysium upon earth and they who did believed it to be among pandemoniums the most pleasant phineas called at the shakspeare and was told by the porter that mr fitzgibbon was upstairs he was shown into the strangers room and in five minutes his friend came down to him  i want you to come down to the reform with me said phineas  by jingo my dear fellow im in the middle of a rubber of whist  there has been a man with me about that bill  whatclarkson  yes clarkson said phineas  dont mind him said fitzgibbon  thats nonsense how am i to help minding him i must mind him he is coming to me again on tuesday morning  dont see him  how can i help seeing him  make them say youre not at home  he has made an appointment he has told me that hell never leave me alone hell be the death of me if this is not settled  it shall be settled my dear fellow ill see about it ill see about it and write you a line you must excuse me now because those fellows are waiting ill have it all arranged  again as phineas went home he thoroughly wished that he had not seceded from mr low     chapter xxii  lady baldock at home   about the middle of march lady baldock came up from baddingham to london coerced into doing so as violet effingham declared in thorough opposition to all her own tastes by the known wishes of her friends and relatives her friends and relatives so miss effingham insinuated were unanimous in wishing that lady baldock should remain at baddingham park and thereforethat wish having been indiscreetly expressedshe had put herself to great inconvenience and had come to london in march gustavus will go mad said violet to lady laura the gustavus in question was the lord baldock of the present generation miss effinghams lady baldock being the peers mother why does not lord baldock take a house himself asked lady laura dont you know my dear violet answered how much we baddingham people think of money we dont like being vexed and driven mad but even that is better than keeping up two households as regarded violet the injury arising from lady baldocks early migration was very great for she was thus compelled to move from grosvenor place to lady baldocks house in berkeley square as you are so fond of being in london augusta and i have made up our minds to come up before easter lady baldock had written to her  i shall go to her now violet had said to her friend because i have not quite made up my mind as to what i will do for the future  marry oswald and be your own mistress  i mean to be my own mistress without marrying oswald though i dont see my way quite clearly as yet i think i shall set up a little house of my own and let the world say what it pleases i suppose they couldnt make me out to be a lunatic  i shouldnt wonder if they were to try said lady laura  they could not prevent me in any other way but i am in the dark as yet and so i shall be obedient and go to my aunt  miss effingham went to berkeley square and phineas finn was introduced to lady baldock he had been often in grosvenor place and had seen violet frequently mr kennedy gave periodical dinnersonce a weekto which everybody went who could get an invitation and phineas had been a guest more than once indeed in spite of his miseries he had taken to dining out a good deal and was popular as an eater of dinners he could talk when wanted and did not talk too much was pleasant in manners and appearance and had already achieved a certain recognised position in london life of those who knew him intimately not one in twenty were aware from whence he came what was his parentage or what his means of living he was a member of parliament a friend of mr kennedys was intimate with mr monk though an irishman did not as a rule herd with other irishmen and was the right sort of person to have at your house some people said he was a cousin of lord brentfords and others declared that he was lord chilterns earliest friend there he was however with a position gained and even lady baldock asked him to her house  lady baldock had evenings people went to her house and stood about the room and on the stairs talked to each other for half an hour and went away in these march days there was no crowding but still there were always enough of people there to show that lady baldock was successful why people should have gone to lady baldocks i cannot explainbut there are houses to which people go without any reason phineas received a little card asking him to go and he always went  i think you like my friend mr finn lady laura said to miss effingham after the first of these evenings  yes i do i like him decidedly  so do i i should hardly have thought that you would have taken a fancy to him  i hardly know what you call taking a fancy said violet i am not quite sure i like to be told that i have taken a fancy for a young man  i mean no offence my dear  of course you dont but to speak truth i think i have rather taken a fancy to him there is just enough of him but not too much i dont mean materiallyin regard to his inches but as to his mental belongings i hate a stupid man who cant talk to me and i hate a clever man who talks me down i dont like a man who is too lazy to make any effort to shine but i particularly dislike the man who is always striving for effect i abominate a humble man but yet i love to perceive that a man acknowledges the superiority of my sex and youth and all that kind of thing  you want to be flattered without plain flattery  of course i do a man who would tell me that i am pretty unless he is over seventy ought to be kicked out of the room but a man who cant show me that he thinks me so without saying a word about it is a lout now in all those matters your friend mr finn seems to know what he is about in other words he makes himself pleasant and therefore one is glad to see him  i suppose you do not mean to fall in love with him  not that i know of my dear but when i do ill be sure to give you notice  i fear that there was more of earnestness in lady lauras last question than miss effingham had supposed she had declared to herself over and over again that she had never been in love with phineas finn she had acknowledged to herself before mr kennedy had asked her hand in marriage that there had been dangerthat she could have learned to love the man if such love would not have been ruinous to herthat the romance of such a passion would have been pleasant to her she had gone farther than this and had said to herself that she would have given way to that romance and would have been ready to accept such love if offered to her had she not put it out of her own power to marry a poor man by her generosity to her brother then she had thrust the thing aside and had clearly understoodshe thought that she had clearly understoodthat life for her must be a matter of business was it not the case with nine out of every ten among mankind with nine hundred and ninetynine out of every thousand that life must be a matter of business and not of romance of course she could not marry mr finn knowing as she did that neither of them had a shilling of all men in the world she esteemed mr kennedy the most and when these thoughts were passing through her mind she was well aware that he would ask her to be his wife had she not resolved that she would accept the offer she would not have gone to loughlinter having put aside all romance as unfitted to her life she could she thought do her duty as mr kennedys wife she would teach herself to love him nayshe had taught herself to love him she was at any rate so sure of her own heart that she would never give her husband cause to rue the confidence he placed in her and yet there was something sore within her when she thought that phineas finn was fond of violet effingham  it was lady baldocks second evening and phineas came to the house at about eleven oclock at this time he had encountered a second and a third interview with mr clarkson and had already failed in obtaining any word of comfort from laurence fitzgibbon about the bill it was clear enough now that laurence felt that they were both made safe by their privilege and that mr clarkson should be treated as you treat the organgrinders they are a nuisance and must be endured but the nuisance is not so great but what you can live in comfortif only you are not too sore as to the annoyance my dear fellow laurence had said to him i have had clarkson almost living in my rooms he used to drink nearly a pint of sherry a day for me all i looked to was that i didnt live there at the same time if you wish it ill send in the sherry this was very bad and phineas tried to quarrel with his friend but he found that it was difficult to quarrel with laurence fitzgibbon  but though on this side phineas was very miserable on another side he had obtained great comfort mr monk and he were better friends than ever as to what turnbull says about me in the house mr monk had said laughing he and i understand each other perfectly i should like to see you on your legs but it is just as well perhaps that you have deferred it we shall have the real question on immediately after easter and then youll have plenty of opportunities phineas had explained how he had attempted how he had failed and how he had sufferedand mr monk had been generous in his sympathy i know all about it said he and have gone through it all myself the more respect you feel for the house the more satisfaction you will have in addressing it when you have mastered this difficulty  the first person who spoke to phineas at lady baldocks was miss fitzgibbon laurences sister aspasia fitzgibbon was a warm woman as regarded money and as she was moreover a most discreet spinster she was made welcome by lady baldock in spite of the wellknown iniquities of her male relatives mr finn said she how dye do i want to say a word to ye just come here into the corner phineas not knowing how to escape did retreat into the corner with miss fitzgibbon tell me now mr finnhave ye been lending money to laurence  no i have lent him no money said phineas much astonished by the question  dont thats my advice to ye dont on any other matter laurence is the best creature in the worldbut hes bad to lend money to you aint in any hobble with him then  wellnothing to speak of what makes you ask  then you are in a hobble dear dear i never saw such a man as laurencenever goodbye i wouldnt do it again if i were youthats all then miss fitzgibbon came out of the corner and made her way downstairs  phineas immediately afterwards came across miss effingham i did not know said she that you and the divine aspasia were such close allies  we are the dearest friends in the world but she has taken my breath away now  may a body be told how she has done that violet asked  well no im afraid not even though the body be miss effingham it was a profound secretreally a secret concerning a third person and she began about it just as though she were speaking about the weather  how charming i do so like her you havent heard have you that mr ratler proposed to her the other day  no  but he didat least so she tells everybody she said shed take him if he would promise to get her brothers salary doubled  did she tell you  no not me and of course i dont believe a word of it i suppose barrington erle made up the story are you going out of town next week mr finn the week next to this was easterweek i heard you were going into northamptonshire  from lady laura  yesfrom lady laura  i intend to spend three days with lord chiltern at willingford it is an old promise i am going to ride his horsesthat is if i am able to ride them  take care what you are about mr finnthey say his horses are so dangerous  im rather good at falling i flatter myself  i know that lord chiltern rides anything he can sit so long as it is some animal that nobody else will ride it was always so with him he is so odd is he not  phineas knew of course that lord chiltern had more than once asked violet effingham to be his wifeand he believed that she from her intimacy with lady laura must know that he knew it he had also heard lady laura express a very strong wish that in spite of these refusals violet might even yet become her brothers wife and phineas also knew that violet effingham was becoming in his own estimation the most charming woman of his acquaintance how was he to talk to her about lord chiltern  he is odd said phineas but he is an excellent fellowwhom his father altogether misunderstands  exactlyjust so i am so glad to hear you say thatyou who have never had the misfortune to have anything to do with a bad set why dont you tell lord brentford lord brentford would listen to you  to me  yesof course he wouldfor you are just the link that is wanting you are chilterns intimate friend and you are also the friend of bigwigs and cabinet ministers  lord brentford would put me down at once if i spoke to him on such a subject  i am sure he would not you are too big to be put down and no man can really dislike to hear his son well spoken of by those who are well spoken of themselves wont you try mr finn phineas said that he would think of itthat he would try if any fit opportunity could be found of course you know how intimate i have been with the standishes said violet that laura is to me a sister and that oswald used to be almost a brother  why do not you speak to lord brentfordyou who are his favourite  there are reasons mr finn besides how can any girl come forward and say that she knows the disposition of any man you can live with lord chiltern and see what he is made of and know his thoughts and learn what is good in him and also what is bad after all how is any girl really to know anything of a mans life  if i can do anything miss effingham i will said phineas  and then we shall all of us be so grateful to you said violet with her sweetest smile  phineas retreating from this conversation stood for a while alone thinking of it had she spoken thus of lord chiltern because she did love him or because she did not and the sweet commendations which had fallen from her lips upon himhim phineas finnwere they compatible with anything like a growing partiality for himself or were they incompatible with any such feeling had he most reason to be comforted or to be discomfited by what had taken place it seemed hardly possible to his imagination that violet effingham should love such a nobody as he and yet he had had fair evidence that one standing as high in the world as violet effingham would fain have loved him could she have followed the dictates of her heart he had trembled when he had first resolved to declare his passion to lady laurafearing that she would scorn him as being presumptuous but there had been no cause for such fear as that he had declared his love and she had not thought him to be presumptuous that now was ages agoeight months since and lady laura had become a married woman since he had become so warmly alive to the charms of violet effingham he had determined with stern propriety that a passion for a married woman was disgraceful such love was in itself a sin even though it was accompanied by the severest forbearance and the most rigid propriety of conduct nolady laura had done wisely to check the growing feeling of partiality which she had admitted and now that she was married he would be as wise as she it was clear to him that as regarded his own heart the way was open to him for a new enterprise but what if he were to fail again and be told by violet when he declared his love that she had just engaged herself to lord chiltern  what were you and violet talking about so eagerly said lady laura to him with a smile that in its approach to laughter almost betrayed its mistress  we were talking about your brother  you are going to him are you not  yes i leave london on sunday nightbut only for a day or two  has he any chance there do you think  what with miss effingham  yeswith violet sometimes i think she loves him  how can i say in such a matter you can judge better than i can do one woman with reference to another can draw the line between love and friendship she certainly likes chiltern  oh i believe she loves him i do indeed but she fears him she does not quite understand how much there is of tenderness with that assumed ferocity and oswald is so strange so unwise so impolitic that though he loves her better than all the world beside he will not sacrifice even a turn of a word to win her when he asks her to marry him he almost flies at her throat as an angry debtor who applies for instant payment tell him mr finn never to give it overand teach him that he should be soft with her tell him also that in her heart she likes him one woman as you say knows another woman and i am certain he would win her if he would only be gentle with her then again before they parted lady laura told him that this marriage was the dearest wish of her heart and that there would be no end to her gratitude if phineas could do anything to promote it all which again made our hero unhappy     chapter xxiii  sunday in grosvenor place   mr kennedy though he was a most scrupulously attentive member of parliament was a man very punctual to hours and rules in his own houseand liked that his wife should be as punctual as himself lady laura who in marrying him had firmly resolved that she would do her duty to him in all ways even though the ways might sometimes be painfuland had been perhaps more punctilious in this respect than she might have been had she loved him heartilywas not perhaps quite so fond of accurate regularity as her husband and thus by this time certain habits of his had become rather bonds than habits to her he always had prayers at nine and breakfasted at a quarter past nine let the hours on the night before have been as late as they might before the time for rest had come after breakfast he would open his letters in his study but he liked her to be with him and desired to discuss with her every application he got from a constituent he had his private secretary in a room apart but he thought that everything should be filtered to his private secretary through his wife he was very anxious that she herself should superintend the accounts of their own private expenditure and had taken some trouble to teach her an excellent mode of bookkeeping he had recommended to her a certain course of readingwhich was pleasant enough ladies like to receive such recommendations but mr kennedy having drawn out the course seemed to expect that his wife should read the books he had named and worse still that she should read them in the time he had allocated for the work this i think was tyranny then the sundays became very wearisome to lady laura going to church twice she had learnt would be a part of her duty and though in her fathers household attendance at church had never been very strict she had made up her mind to this cheerfully but mr kennedy expected also that he and she should always dine together on sundays that there should be no guests and that there should be no evening company after all the demand was not very severe but yet she found that it operated injuriously upon her comfort the sundays were very wearisome to her and made her feel that her lord and master washer lord and master she made an effort or two to escape but the efforts were all in vain he never spoke a cross word to her he never gave a stern command but yet he had his way i wont say that reading a novel on a sunday is a sin he said but we must at any rate admit that it is a matter on which men disagree that many of the best of men are against such occupation on sunday and that to abstain is to be on the safe side so the novels were put away and sunday afternoon with the long evening became rather a stumblingblock to lady laura  those two hours moreover with her husband in the morning became very wearisome to her at first she had declared that it would be her greatest ambition to help her husband in his work and she had read all the letters from the macnabs and macfies asking to be made gaugers and landingwaiters with an assumed interest but the work palled upon her very quickly her quick intellect discovered soon that there was nothing in it which she really did it was all form and verbiage and pretence at business her husband went through it all with the utmost patience reading every word giving orders as to every detail and conscientiously doing that which he conceived he had undertaken to do but lady laura wanted to meddle with high politics to discuss reform bills to assist in putting up mr this and putting down my lord that why should she waste her time in doing that which the lad in the next room who was called a private secretary could do as well  still she would obey let the task be as hard as it might she would obey if he counselled her to do this or that she would follow his counselbecause she owed him so much if she had accepted the half of all his wealth without loving him she owed him the more on that account but she knewshe could not but knowthat her intellect was brighter than his and might it not be possible for her to lead him then she made efforts to lead her husband and found that he was as stiffnecked as an ox mr kennedy was not perhaps a clever man but he was a man who knew his own way and who intended to keep it  i have got a headache robert she said to him one sunday after luncheon i think i will not go to church this afternoon  it is not serious i hope  oh dear no dont you know how one feels sometimes that one has got a head and when that is the case ones armchair is the best place  i am not sure of that said mr kennedy  if i went to church i should not attend said lady laura  the fresh air would do you more good than anything else and we could walk across the park  thank youi wont go out again today this she said with something almost of crossness in her manner and mr kennedy went to the afternoon service by himself  lady laura when she was left alone began to think of her position she was not more than four or five months married and she was becoming very tired of her life was it not also true that she was becoming tired of her husband she had twice told phineas finn that of all men in the world she esteemed mr kennedy the most she did not esteem him less now she knew no point or particle in which he did not do his duty with accuracy but no person can live happily with anothernot even with a brother or a sister or a friendsimply upon esteem all the virtues in the calendar though they exist on each side will not make a man and woman happy together unless there be sympathy lady laura was beginning to find out that there was a lack of sympathy between herself and her husband  she thought of this till she was tired of thinking of it and then wishing to divert her mind she took up the book that was lying nearest to her hand it was a volume of a new novel which she had been reading on the previous day and now without much thought about it she went on with her reading there came to her no doubt some dim halfformed idea that as she was freed from going to church by the plea of a headache she was also absolved by the same plea from other sunday hindrances a child when it is ill has buttered toast and a picturebook instead of breadandmilk and lessons in this way lady laura conceived herself to be entitled to her novel  while she was reading it there came a knock at the door and barrington erle was shown upstairs mr kennedy had given no orders against sunday visitors but had simply said that sunday visiting was not to his taste barrington however was lady lauras cousin and people must be very strict if they cant see their cousins on sunday lady laura soon lost her headache altogether in the animation of discussing the chances of the new reform bill with the prime ministers private secretary and had left her chair and was standing by the table with the novel in her hand protesting this and denying that expressing infinite confidence in mr monk and violently denouncing mr turnbull when her husband returned from church and came up into the drawingroom lady laura had forgotten her headache altogether and had in her composition none of that thoughtfulness of hypocrisy which would have taught her to moderate her political feeling at her husbands return  i do declare she said that if mr turnbull opposes the government measure now because he cant have his own way in everything i will never again put my trust in any man who calls himself a popular leader  you never should said barrington erle  thats all very well for you barrington who are an aristocratic whig of the old official school and who call yourself a liberal simply because fox was a liberal a hundred years ago my hearts in it  heart should never have anything to do with politics should it said erle turning round to mr kennedy  mr kennedy did not wish to discuss the matter on a sunday nor yet did he wish to say before barrington erle that he thought it wrong to do so and he was desirous of treating his wife in some way as though she were an invalidthat she thereby might be as it were punished but he did not wish to do this in such a way that barrington should be aware of the punishment  laura had better not disturb herself about it now he said  how is a person to help being disturbed said lady laura laughing  well well we wont mind all that now said mr kennedy turning away then he took up the novel which lady laura had just laid down from her hand and having looked at it carried it aside and placed it on a bookshelf which was remote from them lady laura watched him as he did this and the whole course of her husbands thoughts on the subject was open to her at once she regretted the novel and she regretted also the political discussion soon afterwards barrington erle went away and the husband and wife were alone together  i am glad that your head is so much better said he he did not intend to be severe but he spoke with a gravity of manner which almost amounted to severity  yes it is she said barringtons coming in cheered me up  i am sorry that you should have wanted cheering  dont you know what i mean robert  no i do not think that i do exactly  i suppose your head is stronger you do not get that feeling of dazed helpless imbecility of brain which hardly amounts to headache but which yetis almost as bad  imbecility of brain may be worse than headache but i dont think it can produce it  well welli dont know how to explain it  headache comes i think always from the stomach even when produced by nervous affections but imbecility of the brain  oh robert i am so sorry that i used the word  i see that it did not prevent your reading he said after a pause  not such reading as that i was up to nothing better  then there was another pause  i wont deny that it may be a prejudice he said but i confess that the use of novels in my own house on sundays is a pain to me my mothers ideas on the subject are very strict and i cannot think that it is bad for a son to hang on to the teaching of his mother this he said in the most serious tone which he could command  i dont know why i took it up said lady laura simply i believe because it was there i will avoid doing so for the future  do my dear said the husband i shall be obliged and grateful if you will remember what i have said then he left her and she sat alone first in the dusk and then in the dark for two hours doing nothing was this to be the life which she had procured for herself by marrying mr kennedy of loughlinter if it was harsh and unendurable in london what would it be in the country     chapter xxiv  the willingford bull   phineas left london by a night mail train on easter sunday and found himself at the willingford bull about half an hour after midnight lord chiltern was up and waiting for him and supper was on the table the willingford bull was an english inn of the old stamp which had now in these latter years of railway travelling ceased to have a road businessfor there were no travellers on the road and but little postingbut had acquired a new trade as a d√©p√¥t for hunters and hunting men the landlord let out horses and kept hunting stables and the house was generally filled from the beginning of november till the middle of april then it became a desert in the summer and no guests were seen there till the pink coats flocked down again into the shires  how many days do you mean to give us said lord chiltern as he helped his friend to a devilled leg of turkey  i must go back on wednesday said phineas  that means wednesday night ill tell you what well do weve the cottesmore tomorrow well get into tailbys country on tuesday and fitzwilliam will be only twelve miles off on wednesday we shall be rather short of horses  pray dont let me put you out i can hire something here i suppose  you wont put me out at all therell be three between us each day and well run our luck the horses have gone on to empingham for tomorrow tailby is rather a way offat somerby but well manage it if the worst comes to the worst we can get back to stamford by rail on wednesday we shall have everything very comfortable theyre out beyond stilton and will draw home our way ive planned it all out ive a trap with a fast stepper and if we start tomorrow at halfpast nine we shall be in plenty of time you shall ride meg merrilies and if she dont carry you you may shoot her  is she one of the pulling ones  she is heavy in hand if you are heavy at her but leave her mouth alone and shell go like flowing water youd better not ride more in a crowd than you can help now whatll you drink  they sat up half the night smoking and talking and phineas learned more about lord chiltern then than ever he had learned before there was brandy and water before them but neither of them drank lord chiltern indeed had a pint of beer by his side from which he sipped occasionally ive taken to beer he said as being the best drink going when a man hunts six days a week he can afford to drink beer im on an allowancethree pints a day thats not too much  and you drink nothing else  nothing when im aloneexcept a little cherrybrandy when im out i never cared for drinknever in my life i do like excitement and have been less careful than i ought to have been as to what it has come from i could give up drink tomorrow without a struggleif it were worth my while to make up my mind to do it and its the same with gambling i never do gamble now because ive got no money but i own i like it better than anything in the world while you are at it there is life in it  you should take to politics chiltern  and i would have done so but my father would not help me never mind we will not talk about him how does laura get on with her husband  very happily i should say  i dont believe it said lord chiltern her temper is too much like mine to allow her to be happy with such a log of wood as robert kennedy it is such men as he who drive me out of the pale of decent life if that is decency id sooner be indecent you mark my words theyll come to grief shell never be able to stand it  i should think she had her own way in everything said phineas  no no though hes a prig hes a man and she will not find it easy to drive him  but she may bend him  not an inchthat is if i understand his character i suppose you see a good deal of them  yespretty well im not there so often as i used to be in the square  you get sick of it i suppose i should do you see my father often  only occasionally he is always very civil when i do see him  he is the very pink of civility when he pleases but the most unjust man i ever met  i should not have thought that  yes he is said the earls son and all from lack of judgment to discern the truth he makes up his mind to a thing on insufficient proof and then nothing will turn him he thinks well of youwould probably believe your word on any indifferent subject without thought of a doubt but if you were to tell him that i didnt get drunk every night of my life and spend most of my time in thrashing policemen he would not believe you he would smile incredulously and make you a little bow i can see him do it  you are too hard on him chiltern  he has been too hard on me i know is violet effingham still in grosvenor place  no shes with lady baldock  that old grandmother of evil has come to townhas she poor violet when we were young together we used to have such fun about that old woman  the old woman is an ally of mine now said phineas  you make allies everywhere you know violet effingham of course  oh yes i know her  dont you think her very charming said lord chiltern  exceedingly charming  i have asked that girl to marry me three times and i shall never ask her again there is a point beyond which a man shouldnt go there are many reasons why it would be a good marriage in the first place her money would be serviceable then it would heal matters in our family for my father is as prejudiced in her favour as he is against me and i love her dearly ive loved her all my lifesince i used to buy cakes for her but i shall never ask her again  i would if i were you said phineashardly knowing what it might be best for him to say  no i never will but ill tell you what i shall get into some desperate scrape about her of course shell marry and that soon then i shall make a fool of myself when i hear that she is engaged i shall go and quarrel with the man and kick himor get kicked all the world will turn against me and i shall be called a wild beast  a dog in the manger is what you should be called  exactlybut how is a man to help it if you loved a girl could you see another man take her phineas remembered of course that he had lately come through this ordeal it is as though he were to come and put his hand upon me and wanted my own heart out of me though i have no property in her at all no right to herthough she never gave me a word of encouragement it is as though she were the most private thing in the world to me i should be half mad and in my madness i could not master the idea that i was being robbed i should resent it as a personal interference  i suppose it will come to that if you give her up yourself said phineas  it is no question of giving up of course i cannot make her marry me light another cigar old fellow  phineas as he lit the other cigar remembered that he owed a certain duty in this matter to lady laura she had commissioned him to persuade her brother that his suit with violet effingham would not be hopeless if he could only restrain himself in his mode of conducting it phineas was disposed to do his duty although he felt it to be very hard that he should be called upon to be eloquent against his own interest he had been thinking for the last quarter of an hour how he must bear himself if it might turn out that he should be the man whom lord chiltern was resolved to kick he looked at his friend and host and became aware that a kickingmatch with such a one would not be pleasant pastime nevertheless he would be happy enough to be subject to lord chilterns wrath for such a reason he would do his duty by lord chiltern and then when that had been adequately done he would if occasion served fight a battle for himself  you are too sudden with her chiltern he said after a pause  what do you mean by too sudden said lord chiltern almost angrily  you frighten her by being so impetuous you rush at her as though you wanted to conquer her by a single blow  so i do  you should be more gentle with her you should give her time to find out whether she likes you or not  she has known me all her life and has found that out long ago not but what you are right i know you are right if i were you and had your skill in pleasing i should drop soft words into her ear till i had caught her but i have no gifts in that way i am as awkward as a pig at what is called flirting and i have an accursed pride which stands in my own light if she were in this house this moment and if i knew she were to be had for asking i dont think i could bring myself to ask again but well go to bed its halfpast two and we must be off at halfpast nine if were to be at exton park gates at eleven  phineas as he went upstairs assured himself that he had done his duty if there ever should come to be anything between him and violet effingham lord chiltern might quarrel with himmight probably attempt that kicking encounter to which allusion had been madebut nobody could justly say that he had not behaved honourably to his friend  on the next morning there was a bustle and a scurry as there always is on such occasions and the two men got off about ten minutes after time but lord chiltern drove hard and they reached the meet before the master had moved off they had a fair days sport with the cottesmore and phineas though he found that meg merrilies did require a good deal of riding went through his days work with credit he had been riding since he was a child as is the custom with all boys in munster and had an irishmans natural aptitude for jumping when they got back to the willingford bull he felt pleased with the day and rather proud of himself it wasnt fast you know said chiltern and i dont call that a stiff country besides meg is very handy when youve got her out of the crowd you shall ride bonebreaker tomorrow at somerby and youll find that better fun  bonebreaker havent i heard you say he rushes like mischief  well he does rush but by george you want a horse to rush in that country when you have to go right through four or five feet of stiff green wood like a bullet through a target you want a little force or youre apt to be left up a tree  and what do you ride  a brute i never put my leg on yet he was sent down to wilcox here out of lincolnshire because they couldnt get anybody to ride him there they say he goes with his head up in the air and wont look at a fence that isnt as high as his breast but i think hell do here i never saw a better made beast or one with more power do you look at his shoulders hes to be had for seventy pounds and these are the sort of horses i like to buy  again they dined alone and lord chiltern explained to phineas that he rarely associated with the men of either of the hunts in which he rode there is a set of fellows down here who are poison to me and there is another set and i am poison to them everybody is very civil as you see but i have no associates and gradually i am getting to have a reputation as though i were the devil himself i think i shall come out next year dressed entirely in black  are you not wrong to give way to that kind of thing  what the deuce am i to do i cant make civil little speeches when once a man gets a reputation as an ogre it is the most difficult thing in the world to drop it i could have a score of men here every day if i liked itmy title would do that for mebut they would be men i should loathe and i should be sure to tell them so even though i did not mean it bonebreaker and the new horse and another went on at twelve today you must expect hard work tomorrow as i daresay we shant be home before eight  the next days meet was in leicestershire not far from melton and they started early phineas to tell the truth of him was rather afraid of bonebreaker and looked forward to the probability of an accident he had neither wife nor child and nobody had a better right to risk his neck well put a gag on im said the groom and youll ride im in a ringso that you may wellnigh break his jaw but he is a rum un sir ill do my best said phineas hell take all that said the groom just let him have his own way at everything said lord chiltern as they moved away from the meet to pickwell gorse and if youll only sit on his back hell carry you through as safe as a church phineas could not help thinking that the counsels of the master and of the groom were very different my idea is continued lord chiltern that in hunting you should always avoid a crowd i dont think a horse is worth riding that will go in a crowd its just like yachtingyou should have plenty of searoom if youre to pull your horse up at every fence till somebody else is over i think youd better come out on a donkey and so they went away to pickwell gorse  there were over two hundred men out and phineas began to think that it might not be so easy to get out of the crowd a crowd in a fast run no doubt quickly becomes small by degrees and beautifully less but it is very difficult especially for a stranger to free himself from the rush at the first start lord chilterns horse plunged about so violently as they stood on a little hillside looking down upon the cover that he was obliged to take him to a distance and phineas followed him if he breaks down wind said lord chiltern we cant be better than we are here if he goes up wind he must turn before long and we shall be all right as he spoke an old hound opened true and sharpan old hound whom all the pack believedand in a moment there was no doubt that the fox had been found there are not above eight or nine acres in it said lord chiltern and he cant hang long did you ever see such an uneasy brute as this in your life but i feel certain hell go well when he gets away  phineas was too much occupied with his own horse to think much of that on which lord chiltern was mounted bonebreaker the very moment that he heard the old hounds note stretched out his head and put his mouth upon the bit and began to tremble in every muscle hes a great deal more anxious for it than you and i are said lord chiltern i see theyve given you that gag but dont you ride him on it till he wants it give him lots of room and hell go in the snaffle all which caution made phineas think that any insurance office would charge very dear on his life at the present moment  the fox took two rings of the gorse and then he wentup wind its not a vixen ill swear said lord chiltern a vixen in cub never went away like that yet now then finn my boy keep to the right and lord chiltern with the horse out of lincolnshire went away across the brow of the hill leaving the hounds to the left and selected as his point of exit into the next field a stiff rail which had there been an accident must have put a very wide margin of ground between the rider and his horse go hard at your fences and then youll fall clear he had said to phineas i dont think however that he would have ridden at the rail as he did but that there was no help for him the brute began in his own way and carried on after in the same fashion all through he said afterwards phineas took the fence a little lower down and what it was at which he rode he never knew bonebreaker sailed over it whatever it was and he soon found himself by his friends side  the ruck of the men were lower down than our two heroes and there were others far away to the left and others again who had been at the end of the gorse and were now behind our friends were not near the hounds not within two fields of them but the hounds were below them and therefore could be seen dont be in a hurry and theyll be round upon us lord chiltern said how the deuce is one to help being in a hurry said phineas who was doing his very best to ride bonebreaker with the snaffle but had already began to feel that bonebreaker cared nothing for that weak instrument by george i should like to change with you said lord chiltern the lincolnshire horse was going along with his head very low boring as he galloped but throwing his neck up at his fences just when he ought to have kept himself steady after this though phineas kept near lord chiltern throughout the run they were not again near enough to exchange words and indeed they had but little breath for such purpose  lord chiltern rode still a little in advance and phineas knowing his friends partiality for solitude when taking his fences kept a little to his left he began to find that bonebreaker knew pretty well what he was about as for not using the gag rein that was impossible when a horse puts out what strength he has against a mans arm a man must put out what strength he has against the horses mouth but bonebreaker was cunning and had had a gag rein on before he contracted his lip here and bent out his jaw there till he had settled it to his mind and then went away after his own fashion he seemed to have a passion for smashing through big highgrown oxfences and by degrees his rider came to feel that if there was nothing worse coming the fun was not bad  the fox ran up wind for a couple of miles or so as lord chiltern had prophesied and then turnednot to the right as would best have served him and phineas but to the leftso that they were forced to make their way through the ruck of horses before they could place themselves again phineas found himself crossing a road in and out of it before he knew where he was and for a while he lost sight of lord chiltern but in truth he was leading now whereas lord chiltern had led before the two horses having been together all the morning and on the previous day were willing enough to remain in company if they were allowed to do so they both crossed the road not very far from each other going in and out amidst a crowd of horses and before long were again placed well now having the hunt on their right whereas hitherto it had been on their left they went over large pasture fields and phineas began to think that as long as bonebreaker would be able to go through the thick grownup hedges all would be right now and again he came to a cut fence a fence that had been cut and laid and these were not so pleasant force was not sufficient for them and they admitted of a mistake but the horse though he would rush at them unpleasantly took them when they came without touching them it might be all right yetunless the beast should tire with him and then phineas thought a misfortune might probably occur he remembered as he flew over one such impediment that he rode a stone heavier than his friend at the end of fortyfive minutes bonebreaker also might become aware of the fact  the hounds were running well in sight to their right and phineas began to feel some of that pride which a man indulges when he becomes aware that he has taken his place comfortably has left the squad behind and is going well there were men nearer the hounds than he was but he was near enough even for ambition there had already been enough of the run to make him sure that it would be a good thing and enough to make him aware also that probably it might be too good when a run is over men are very apt to regret the termination who a minute or two before were anxiously longing that the hounds might pull down their game to finish well is everything in hunting to have led for over an hour is nothing let the pace and country have been what they might if you fall away during the last half mile therefore it is that those behind hope that the fox may make this or that cover while the forward men long to see him turned over in every field to ride to hounds is very glorious but to have ridden to hounds is more glorious still they had now crossed another road and a larger one and had got into a somewhat closer country the fields were not so big and the fences were not so high phineas got a moment to look about him and saw lord chiltern riding without his cap he was very red in the face and his eyes seemed to glare and he was tugging at his horse with all his might but the animal seemed still to go with perfect command of strength and phineas had too much work on his own hands to think of offering quixotic assistance to any one else he saw some one a farmer as he thought speak to lord chiltern as they rode close together but chiltern only shook his head and pulled at his horse  there were brooks in those parts the river eye forms itself thereabouts or some of its tributaries do so and these tributaries though small as rivers are considerable to men on one side who are called by the exigencies of the occasion to place themselves quickly on the other phineas knew nothing of these brooks but bonebreaker had gone gallantly over two and now that there came a third in the way it was to be hoped that he might go gallantly over that also phineas at any rate had no power to decide otherwise as long as the brute would go straight with him he could sit him but he had long given up the idea of having a will of his own indeed till he was within twenty yards of the brook he did not see that it was larger than the others he looked around and there was chiltern close to him still fighting with his horsebut the farmer had turned away he thought that chiltern nodded to him as much as to tell him to go on on he went at any rate the brook when he came to it seemed to be a huge black hole yawning beneath him the banks were quite steep and just where he was to take off there was an ugly stump it was too late to think of anything he stuck his knees against his saddleand in a moment was on the other side the brute who had taken off a yard before the stump knowing well the danger of striking it with his foot came down with a grunt and did i think begin to feel the weight of that extra stone phineas as soon as he was safe looked back and there was lord chilterns horse in the very act of his springhigher up the rivulet where it was even broader at that distance phineas could see that lord chiltern was wild with rage against the beast but whether he wished to take the leap or wished to avoid it there was no choice left to him the animal rushed at the brook and in a moment the horse and horseman were lost to sight it was well then that that extra stone should tell as it enabled phineas to arrest his horse and to come back to his friend  the lincolnshire horse had chested the further bank and of course had fallen back into the stream when phineas got down he found that lord chiltern was wedged in between the horse and the bank which was better at any rate than being under the horse in the water all right old fellow he said with a smile when he saw phineas you go on its too good to lose but he was very pale and seemed to be quite helpless where he lay the horse did not moveand never did move again he had smashed his shoulder to pieces against a stump on the bank and was afterwards shot on that very spot  when phineas got down he found that there was but little water where the horse lay the depth of the stream had been on the side from which they had taken off and the thick black mud lay within a foot of the surface close to the bank against which lord chiltern was propped thats the worst one i ever was on said lord chiltern but i think hes gruelled now  are you hurt  welli fancy there is something amiss i cant move my arms and i catch my breath my legs are all right if i could get away from this accursed brute  i told you so said the farmer coming and looking down upon them from the bank i told you so but you wouldnt be said then he too got down and between them both they extricated lord chiltern from his position and got him on to the bank  that uns a dead un said the farmer pointing to the horse  so much the better said his lordship give us a drop of sherry finn  he had broken his collarbone and three of his ribs they got a farmers trap from wissindine and took him into oakham when there he insisted on being taken on through stamford to the willingford bull before he would have his bones setpicking up however a surgeon at stamford phineas remained with him for a couple of days losing his run with the fitzwilliams and a day at the potted peas and became very fond of his patient as he sat by his bedside  that was a good run though wasnt it said lord chiltern as phineas took his leave and by george phineas you rode bonebreaker so well that you shall have him as often as youll come down i dont know how it is but you irish fellows always ride     chapter xxv  mr turnbulls carriage stops the way   when phineas got back to london a day after his time he found that there was already a great political commotion in the metropolis he had known that on easter monday and tuesday there was to be a gathering of the people in favour of the ballot and that on wednesday there was to be a procession with a petition which mr turnbull was to receive from the hands of the people on primrose hill it had been at first intended that mr turnbull should receive the petition at the door of westminster hall on the thursday but he had been requested by the home secretary to put aside this intention and he had complied with the request made to him mr mildmay was to move the second reading of his reform bill on that day the preliminary steps having been taken without any special notice but the bill of course included no clause in favour of the ballot and this petition was the consequence of that omission mr turnbull had predicted evil consequences both in the house and out of it and was now doing the best in his power to bring about the verification of his own prophecies phineas who reached his lodgings late on the thursday found that the town had been in a state of ferment for three days that on the wednesday forty or fifty thousand persons had been collected at primrose hill and that the police had been forced to interfereand that worse was expected on the friday though mr turnbull had yielded to the government as to receiving the petition the crowd was resolved that they would see the petition carried into the house it was argued that the government would have done better to have refrained from interfering as to the previously intended arrangement it would have been easier to deal with a procession than with a mob of men gathered together without any semblance of form mr mildmay had been asked to postpone the second reading of his bill but the request had come from his opponents and he would not yield to it he said that it would be a bad expedient to close parliament from fear of the people phineas found at the reform club on the thursday evening that members of the house of commons were requested to enter on the friday by the door usually used by the peers and to make their way thence to their own house he found that his landlord mr bunce had been out with the people during the entire three daysand mrs bunce with a flood of tears begged phineas to interfere as to the friday hes that headstrong that hell be took if anybodys took and they say that all westminster is to be lined with soldiers phineas on the friday morning did have some conversation with his landlord but his first work on reaching london was to see lord chilterns friends and tell them of the accident  the potted peas committee sat on the thursday and he ought to have been there his absence however was unavoidable as he could not have left his friends bedside so soon after the accident on the wednesday he had written to lady laura and on the thursday evening he went first to portman square and then to grosvenor place  of course he will kill himself some day said the earlwith a tear however in each eye  i hope not my lord he is a magnificent horseman but accidents of course will happen  how many of his bones are there not broken i wonder said the father it is useless to talk of course you think he is not in danger  certainly not  i should fear that he would be so liable to inflammation  the doctor says that there is none he has been taking an enormous deal of exercise said phineas and drinking no wine all that is in his favour  what does he drink then asked the earl  nothing i rather think my lord you are mistaken a little about his habits i dont fancy he ever drinks unless he is provoked to do it  provoked could anything provoke you to make a brute of yourself but i am glad that he is in no danger if you hear of him let me know how he goes on  lady laura was of course full of concern i wanted to go down to him she said but mr kennedy thought that there was no occasion  nor is there anyi mean in regard to danger he is very solitary there  you must go to him again mr kennedy will not let me go unless i can say that there is danger he seems to think that because oswald has had accidents before it is nothing of course i cannot leave london without his leave  your brother makes very little of it you know  ahhe would make little of anything but if i were ill he would be in london by the first train  kennedy would let you go if you asked him  but he advises me not to go he says my duty does not require it unless oswald be in danger dont you know mr finn how hard it is for a wife not to take advice when it is so given this she said within six months of her marriage to the man who had been her husbands rival  phineas asked her whether violet had heard the news and learned that she was still ignorant of it i got your letter only this morning and i have not seen her said lady laura indeed i am so angry with her that i hardly wish to see her thursday was lady baldocks night and phineas went from grosvenor place to berkeley square there he saw violet and found that she had heard of the accident  i am so glad to see you mr finn she said do tell meis it much  much in inconvenience certainly but not much in danger  i think laura was so unkind not to send me word i only heard it just now did you see it  i was close to him and helped him up the horse jumped into a river with him and crushed him up against the bank  how lucky that you should be there had you jumped the river  yesalmost unintentionally for my horse was rushing so that i could not hold him chiltern was riding a brute that no one should have ridden no one will again  did he destroy himself  he had to be killed afterwards he broke his shoulder  how very lucky that you should have been near himand again how lucky that you should not have been hurt yourself  it was not likely that we should both come to grief at the same fence  but it might have been you and you think there is no danger  none whateverif i may believe the doctor his hunting is done for this year and he will be very desolate i shall go down again to him in a few days and try to bring him up to town  dodo if he is laid up in his fathers house his father must see him phineas had not looked at the matter in that light but he thought that miss effingham might probably be right  early on the next morning he saw mr bunce and used all his eloquence to keep that respectable member of society at homebut in vain what good do you expect to do mr bunce he said with perhaps some little tone of authority in his voice  to carry my point said bunce  and what is your point  my present point is the ballot as a part of the government measure  and you expect to carry that by going out into the streets with all the roughs of london and putting yourself in direct opposition to the authority of the magistrates do you really believe that the ballot will become the law of the land any sooner because you incur this danger and inconvenience  look here mr finn i dont believe the sea will become any fuller because the piddle runs into it out of the dorsetshire fields but i do believe that the waters from all the countries is what makes the ocean i shall help and its my duty to help  its your duty as a respectable citizen with a wife and family to stay at home  if everybody with a wife and family was to say so thered be none there but roughs and then where should we be what would the government people say to us then if every man with a wife and family was to show hisself in the streets tonight we should have the ballot before parliament breaks up and if none of em dont do it we shall never have the ballot aint that so phineas who intended to be honest was not prepared to dispute the assertion on the spur of the moment if thats so said bunce triumphantly a mans dutys clear enough he ought to go though hed two wives and families and he went  the petition was to be presented at six oclock but the crowd who collected to see it carried into westminster hall began to form itself by noon it was said afterwards that many of the houses in the neighbourhood of palace yard and the bridge were filled with soldiers but if so the men did not show themselves in the course of the evening three or four companies of the guards in st jamess park did show themselves and had some rough work to do for many of the people took themselves away from westminster by that route the police who were very numerous in palace yard had a hard time of it all the afternoon and it was said afterwards that it would have been much better to have allowed the petition to have been brought up by the procession on wednesday a procession let it be who it will that proceeds has in it of its own nature something of order but now there was no order the petition which was said to fill fifteen cabsthough the absolute sheets of signatures were carried into the house by four menwas being dragged about half the day and it certainly would have been impossible for a member to have made his way into the house through westminster hall between the hours of four and six to effect an entrance at all they were obliged to go round at the back of the abbey as all the spaces round st margarets church and cannings monument were filled with the crowd parliament street was quite impassable at five o clock and there was no traffic across the bridge from that hour till after eight as the evening went on the mob extended itself to downing street and the front of the treasury chambers and before the night was over all the hoardings round the new government offices had been pulled down the windows also of certain obnoxious members of parliament were broken when those obnoxious members lived within reach one gentleman who unfortunately held a house in richmond terrace and who was said to have said that the ballot was the resort of cowards fared very badlyfor his windows were not only broken but his furniture and mirrors were destroyed by the stones that were thrown mr mildmay i say was much blamed but after all it may be a doubt whether the procession on wednesday might not have ended worse mr turnbull was heard to say afterwards that the number of people collected would have been much greater  mr mildmay moved the second reading of his bill and made his speech he made his speech with the knowledge that the houses of parliament were surrounded by a mob and i think that the fact added to its efficacy it certainly gave him an appropriate opportunity for a display which was not difficult his voice faltered on two or three occasions and faltered through real feeling but this sort of feeling though it be real is at the command of orators on certain occasions and does them yeomans service mr mildmay was an old man nearly worn out in the service of his country who was known to have been true and honest and to have loved his country wellthough there were of course they who declared that his hand had been too weak for power and that his services had been naughtand on this evening his virtues were remembered once when his voice failed him the whole house got up and cheered the nature of a whig prime ministers speech on such an occasion will be understood by most of my readers without further indication the bill itself had been read before and it was understood that no objection would be made to the extent of the changes provided in it by the liberal side of the house the opposition coming from liberal members was to be confined to the subject of the ballot and even as yet it was not known whether mr turnbull and his followers would vote against the second reading or whether they would take what was given and declare their intention of obtaining the remainder on a separate motion the opposition of a large party of conservatives was a matter of certainty but to this party mr mildmay did not conceive himself bound to offer so large an amount of argument as he would have given had there been at the moment no crowd in palace yard and he probably felt that that crowd would assist him with his old tory enemies when in the last words of his speech he declared that under no circumstances would he disfigure the close of his political career by voting for the ballotnot though the people on whose behalf he had been fighting battles all his life should be there in any number to coerce himthere came another round of applause from the opposition benches and mr daubeny began to fear that some young horses in his team might get loose from their traces with great dignity mr daubeny had kept aloof from mr turnbull and from mr turnbulls tactics but he was not the less alive to the fact that mr turnbull with his mob and his big petition might be of considerable assistance to him in this present duel between himself and mr mildmay i think mr daubeny was in the habit of looking at these contests as duels between himself and the leader on the other side of the housein which assistance from any quarter might be accepted if offered  mr mildmays speech did not occupy much over an hour and at halfpast seven mr turnbull got up to reply it was presumed that he would do so and not a member left his place though that time of the day is an interesting time and though mr turnbull was accustomed to be long there soon came to be but little ground for doubting what would be the nature of mr turnbulls vote on the second reading how may i dare said he to accept so small a measure of reform as this with such a message from the country as is now conveyed to me through the presence of fifty thousand of my countrymen who are at this moment demanding their measure of reform just beyond the frail walls of this chamber the right honourable gentleman has told us that he will never be intimidated by a concourse of people i do not know that there was any need that he should speak of intimidation no one has accused the right honourable gentleman of political cowardice but as he has so said i will follow in his footsteps neither will i be intimidated by the large majority which this house presented the other night against the wishes of the people i will support no great measure of reform which does not include the ballot among its clauses and so mr turnbull threw down the gauntlet  mr turnbull spoke for two hours and then the debate was adjourned till the monday the adjournment was moved by an independent member who as was known would support the government and at once received mr turnbulls assent there was no great hurry with the bill and it was felt that it would be well to let the ferment subside enough had been done for glory when mr mildmay moved the second reading and quite enough in the way of debatewith such an audience almost within hearingwhen mr turnbulls speech had been made then the house emptied itself at once the elderly cautious members made their exit through the peers door the younger men got out into the crowd through westminster hall and were pushed about among the roughs for an hour or so phineas who made his way through the hall with laurence fitzgibbon found mr turnbulls carriage waiting at the entrance with a dozen policemen round it  i hope he wont get home to dinner before midnight said phineas  he understands all about it said laurence he had a good meal at three before he left home and youd find sandwiches and sherry in plenty if you were to search his carriage he knows how to remedy the costs of mob popularity  at that time poor bunce was being hustled about in the crowd in the vicinity of mr turnbulls carriage phineas and fitzgibbon made their way out and by degrees worked a passage for themselves into parliament street mr turnbull had been somewhat behind them in coming down the hall and had not been without a sense of enjoyment in the ovation which was being given to him there can be no doubt that he was wrong in what he was doing that affair of the carriage was altogether wrong and did mr turnbull much harm for many a day afterwards when he got outside the door where were the twelve policemen guarding his carriage a great number of his admirers endeavoured to shake hands with him among them was the devoted bunce but the policemen seemed to think that mr turnbull was to be guarded even from the affection of his friends and were as careful that he should be ushered into his carriage untouched as though he had been the favourite object of political aversion for the moment mr turnbull himself when he began to perceive that men were crowding close upon the gates and to hear the noise and to feel as it were the breath of the mob stepped on quickly into his carriage he said a word or two in a loud voice thank you my friends i trust you may obtain all your just demands but he did not pause to speak indeed he could hardly have done so as the policemen were manifestly in a hurry the carriage was got away at a snails pacebut there remained in the spot where the carriage had stood the makings of a very pretty street row  bunce had striven hard to shake hands with his herobunce and some other reformers as ardent and as decent as himself the police were very determinate that there should be no such interruption to their programme for getting mr turnbull off the scene mr bunce who had his own ideas as to his right to shake hands with any gentleman at westminster hall who might choose to shake hands with him became uneasy under the impediments that were placed in his way and expressed himself warmly as to his civil rights now a london policeman in a political row is i believe the most forbearing of men so long as he meets with no special political opposition ordinary illusage does not even put him out of temper he is paid for rough work among roughs and takes his rubs gallantly but he feels himself to be an instrument for the moment of despotic power as opposed to civil rights and he wont stand what he calls jaw trip up a policeman in such a scramble and he will take it in good spirit but mention the words habeas corpus and hell lock you up if he can as a rule his instincts are right for the man who talks about habeas corpus in a political crowd will generally do more harm than can be effected by the tripping up of any constable but these instincts may be the means of individual injustice i think they were so when mr bunce was arrested and kept a fast prisoner his wife had shown her knowledge of his character when she declared that hed be took if any one was took  bunce was taken into custody with some three or four others like himselfdecent men who meant no harm but who thought that as men they were bound to show their political opinions perhaps at the expense of a little martyrdomand was carried into a temporary stronghold which had been provided for the necessities of the police under the clocktower  keep me at your peril said bunce indignantly  we means it said the sergeant who had him in custody  ive done no haporth to break the law said bunce  you was breaking the law when you was upsetting my men as i saw you said the sergeant  ive upset nobody said bunce  very well rejoined the sergeant you can say it all before the magistrate tomorrow  and am i to be locked up all night said bunce  im afraid you will replied the sergeant  bunce who was not by nature a very talkative man said no more but he swore in his heart that there should be vengeance between eleven and twelve he was taken to the regular policestation and from thence he was enabled to send word to his wife  bunce has been taken said she with something of the tragic queen and something also of the injured wife in the tone of her voice as soon as phineas let himself in with the latchkey between twelve and one and then mingled with and at last dominant over those severer tones came the voice of the loving woman whose beloved one was in trouble i knew how itd be mr finn didnt i and what must we do i dont suppose hed had a bit to eat from the moment he went outand as for a drop of beer he never thinks of it except what i puts down for him at his meals them nasty police always take the best thats why i was so afeard  phineas said all that he could to comfort her and promised to go to the policeoffice early in the morning and look after bunce no serious evil would he thought probably come of it but still bunce had been wrong to go  but you might have been took yourself argued mrs bunce just as well as he then phineas explained that he had gone forth in the execution of a public duty you might have been took all the same said mrs bunce for im sure bunce didnt do nothing amiss     chapter xxvi  the first speech   on the following morning which was saturday phineas was early at the policeoffice at westminster looking after the interests of his landlord but there had been a considerable number of men taken up during the row and our friend could hardly procure that attention for mr bunces case to which he thought the decency of his client and his own position as a member of parliament were entitled the men who had been taken up were taken in batches before the magistrates but as the soldiers in the park had been maltreated and a considerable injury had been done in the neighbourhood of downing street there was a good deal of strong feeling against the mob and the magistrates were disposed to be severe if decent men chose to go out among such companions and thereby get into trouble decent men must take the consequences during the saturday and sunday a very strong feeling grew up against mr turnbull the story of the carriage was told and he was declared to be a turbulent demagogue only desirous of getting popularity and together with this feeling there arose a general verdict of serve them right against all who had come into contact with the police in the great turnbull row and thus it came to pass that mr bunce had not been liberated up to the monday morning on the sunday mrs bunce was in hysterics and declared her conviction that mr bunce would be imprisoned for life poor phineas had an unquiet time with her on the morning of that day in every ecstasy of her grief she threw herself into his arms either metaphorically or materially according to the excess of her agony at the moment and expressed repeatedly an assured conviction that all her children would die of starvation and that she herself would be picked up under the arches of one of the bridges phineas who was softhearted did what he could to comfort her and allowed himself to be worked up to strong parliamentary anger against the magistrates and police when they think that they have public opinion on their side there is nothing in the way or arbitrary excess which is too great for them this he said to barrington erle who angered him and increased the warmth of his feeling by declaring that a little close confinement would be good for the bunces of the day if we dont keep the mob down the mob will keep us down said the whig private secretary phineas had no opportunity of answering this but declared to himself that barrington erle was no more a liberal at heart than was mr daubeny he was born on that side of the question and has been receiving whig wages all his life that is the history of his politics  on the sunday afternoon phineas went to lord brentfords in portman square intending to say a word or two about lord chiltern and meaning also to induce if possible the cabinet minister to take part with him against the magistrateshaving a hope also in which he was not disappointed that he might find lady laura kennedy with her father he had come to understand that lady laura was not to be visited at her own house on sundays so much indeed she had told him in so many words but he had come to understand also without any plain telling that she rebelled in heart against this sabbath tyrannyand that she would escape from it when escape was possible she had now come to talk to her father about her brother and had brought violet effingham with her they had walked together across the park after church and intended to walk back again mr kennedy did not like to have any carriage out on a sunday and to this arrangement his wife made no objection  phineas had received a letter from the stamford surgeon and was able to report favourably of lord chiltern the man says that he had better not be moved for a month said phineas but that means nothing they always say that  will it not be best for him to remain where he is said the earl  he has not a soul to speak to said phineas  i wish i were with him said his sister  that is of course out of the question said the earl they know him at that inn and it really seems to me best that he should stay there i do not think he would be so much at his ease here  it must be dreadful for a man to be confined to his room without a creature near him except the servants said violet the earl frowned but said nothing further they all perceived that as soon as he had learned that there was no real danger as to his sons life he was determined that this accident should not work him up to any show of tenderness i do so hope he will come up to london continued violet who was not afraid of the earl and was determined not to be put down  you dont know what you are talking about my dear said lord brentford  after this phineas found it very difficult to extract any sympathy from the earl on behalf of the men who had been locked up he was moody and cross and could not be induced to talk on the great subject of the day violet effingham declared that she did not care how many bunces were locked up nor for how longadding however a wish that mr turnbull himself had been among the number of the prisoners lady laura was somewhat softer than this and consented to express pity in the case of mr bunce himself but phineas perceived that the pity was awarded to him and not to the sufferer the feeling against mr turnbull was at the present moment so strong among all the upper classes that mr bunce and his brethren might have been kept in durance for a week without commiseration from them  it is very hard certainly on a man like mr bunce said lady laura  why did not mr bunce stay at home and mind his business said the earl  phineas spent the remainder of that day alone and came to a resolution that on the coming occasion he certainly would speak in the house the debate would be resumed on the monday and he would rise to his legs on the very first moment that it became possible for him to do so and he would do nothing towards preparing a speechnothing whatever on this occasion he would trust entirely to such words as might come to him at the momentay and to such thoughts he had before burdened his memory with preparations and the very weight of the burden had been too much for his mind he had feared to trust himself to speak because he had felt that he was not capable of performing the double labour of saying his lesson by heart and of facing the house for the first time there should be nothing now for him to remember his thoughts were full of his subject he would support mr mildmays bill with all his eloquence but he would implore mr mildmay and the home secretary and the government generally to abstain from animosity against the populace of london because they desired one special boon which mr mildmay did not think that it was his duty to give them he hoped that ideas and words would come to him ideas and words had been free enough with him in the old days of the dublin debating society if they failed him now he must give the thing up and go back to mr low  on the monday morning phineas was for two hours at the policecourt in westminster and at about one on that day mr bunce was liberated when he was brought up before the magistrate mr bunce spoke his mind very freely as to the usage he had received and declared his intention of bringing an action against the sergeant who had detained him the magistrate of course took the part of the police and declared that from the evidence of two men who were examined bunce had certainly used such violence in the crowd as had justified his arrest  i used no violence said bunce  according to your own showing you endeavoured to make your way up to mr turnbulls carriage said the magistrate  i was close to the carriage before the police even saw me said bunce  but you tried to force your way round to the door  i used no force till a man had me by the collar to push me back and i wasnt violent not then i told him i was doing what i had a right to doand it was that as made him hang on to me  you were not doing what you had a right to do you were assisting to create a riot said the magistrate with that indignation which a london magistrate should always know how to affect  phineas however was allowed to give evidence as to his landlords character and then bunce was liberated but before he went he again swore that that should not be the last of it and he told the magistrate that he had been illused when liberated he was joined by a dozen sympathising friends who escorted him home and among them were one or two literary gentlemen employed on those excellent penny papers the peoples banner and the ballotbox it was their intention that mr bunces case should not be allowed to sleep one of these gentlemen made a distinct offer to phineas finn of unbounded popularity during life and of immortality afterwards if he as a member of parliament would take up bunces case with vigour phineas not quite understanding the nature of the offer and not as yet knowing the profession of the gentleman gave some general reply  you come out strong mr finn and well see that you are properly reported im on the banner sir and ill answer for that  phineas who had been somewhat eager in expressing his sympathy with bunce and had not given very close attention to the gentleman who was addressing him was still in the dark the nature of the banner which the gentleman was on did not at once come home to him  something ought to be done certainly said phineas  we shall take it up strong said the gentleman and we shall be happy to have you among us youll find mr finn that in public life theres nothing like having a horgan to back you what is the most you can do in the ouse nothing if youre not reported youre speaking to the countryaint you and you cant do that without a horgan mr finn you come among us on the banner mr finn you cant do better  then phineas understood the nature of the offer made to him as they parted the literary gentleman gave our hero his card mr quintus slide so much was printed then on the corner of the card was written banner office 137 fetter lane mr quintus slide was a young man under thirty not remarkable for clean linen and who always talked of the ouse but he was a wellknown and not undistinguished member of a powerful class of men he had been a reporter and as such knew the ouse well and was a writer for the press and though he talked of ouses and horgans he wrote good english with great rapidity and was possessed of that special sort of political fervour which shows itself in a mans work rather than in his conduct it was mr slides taste to be an advanced reformer and in all his operations on behalf of the peoples banner he was a reformer very much advanced no man could do an article on the peoples indefeasible rights with more pronounced vigour than mr slide but it had never occurred to him as yet that he ought to care for anything else than the fightthan the advantage of having a good subject on which to write slashing articles mr slide was an energetic but not a thoughtful man but in his thoughts on politics as far as they went with him he regarded the wrongs of the people as being of infinitely greater value than their rights it was not that he was insincere in all that he was daily sayingbut simply that he never thought about it very early in life he had fallen among peoples friends and an opening on the liberal press had come in his way to be a peoples friend suited the turn of his ambition and he was a peoples friend it was his business to abuse government and to express on all occasions an opinion that as a matter of course the ruling powers were the peoples enemies had the ruling powers ceased to be the peoples enemies mr slides ground would have been taken from under his feet but such a catastrophe was out of the question that excellent old arrangement that had gone on since demagogues were first invented was in full vigour there were the ruling powers and there were the peopledevils on one side and angels on the otherand as long as a peoples friend had a pen in his hand all was right  phineas when he left the indignant bunce to go among his friends walked to the house thinking a good deal of what mr slide had said to him the potted peas committee was again on and he had intended to be in the committee room by twelve punctually but he had been unable to leave mr bunce in the lurch and it was now past one indeed he had from one unfortunate circumstance after another failed hitherto in giving to the potted peas that resolute attention which the subject demanded on the present occasion his mind was full of mr quintus slide and the peoples banner after all was there not something in mr slides proposition he phineas had come into parliament as it were under the wing of a government pack and his friendships which had been very successful had been made with ministers and with the friends of ministers he had made up his mind to be whig ministerial and to look for his profession in that line he had been specially fortified in this resolution by his dislike to the ballotwhich dislike had been the result of mr monks teaching had mr turnbull become his friend instead it may well be that he would have liked the ballot on such subjects men must think long and be sure that they have thought in earnest before they are justified in saying that their opinions are the results of their own thoughts but now he began to reflect how far this ministerial profession would suit him would it be much to be a lord of the treasury subject to the dominion of mr ratler such lordship and such subjection would be the result of success he told himself that he was at heart a true liberal would it not be better for him to abandon the idea of office trammels and go among them on the peoples banner a glow of enthusiasm came over him as he thought of it but what would violet effingham say to the peoples banner and mr quintus slide and he would have liked the banner better had not mr slide talked about the ouse  from the committee room in which alas he took no active part in reference to the potted peas he went down to the house and was present when the debate was resumed not unnaturally one speaker after another made some allusion to the row in the streets and the work which had fallen to the lot of the magistrates mr turnbull had declared that he would vote against the second reading of mr mildmays bill and had explained that he would do so because he could consent to no reform bill which did not include the ballot as one of its measures the debate fashioned itself after this speech of mr turnbulls and turned again very much upon the ballotalthough it had been thought that the late debate had settled that question one or two of mr turnbulls followers declared that they also would vote against the billof course as not going far enough and one or two gentlemen from the conservative benches extended a spoken welcome to these new colleagues then mr palliser got up and addressed the house for an hour struggling hard to bring back the real subject and to make the house understand that the ballot whether good or bad had been knocked on the head and that members had no right at the present moment to consider anything but the expediency or inexpediency of so much reform as mr mildmay presented to them in the present bill  phineas was determined to speak and to speak on this evening if he could catch the speakers eye again the scene before him was going round before him again things became dim and again he felt his blood beating hard at his heart but things were not so bad with him as they had been before because he had nothing to remember he hardly knew indeed what he intended to say he had an idea that he was desirous of joining in earnest support of the measure with a vehement protest against the injustice which had been done to the people in general and to mr bunce in particular he had firmly resolved that no fear of losing favour with the government should induce him to hold his tongue as to the buncean cruelties sooner than do so he would certainly go among them at the banner office  he started up wildly when mr palliser had completed his speech but the speakers eye not unnaturally had travelled to the other side of the house and there was a tory of the old school upon his legsmr western the member for east barsetshire one of the gallant few who dared to vote against sir robert peels bill for repealing the corn laws in 1846 mr western spoke with a slow ponderous unimpressive but very audible voice for some twenty minutes disdaining to make reference to mr turnbull and his politics but pleading against any reform with all the old arguments phineas did not hear a word that he saiddid not attempt to hear he was keen in his resolution to make another attempt at the speakers eye and at the present moment was thinking of that and of that only he did not even give himself a moments reflection as to what his own speech should be he would dash at it and take his chance resolved that at least he would not fail in courage twice he was on his legs before mr western had finished his slow harangue and twice he was compelled to reseat himselfthinking that he had subjected himself to ridicule at last the member for east barset sat down and phineas was conscious that he had lost a moment or two in presenting himself again to the speaker  he held his ground however though he saw that he had various rivals for the right of speech he held his ground and was instantly aware that he had gained his point there was a slight pause and as some other urgent member did not reseat himself phineas heard the president of that august assembly call upon himself to address the house the thing was now to be done there he was with the house of commons at his feeta crowded house bound to be his auditors as long as he should think fit to address them and reporters by tens and twenties in the gallery ready and eager to let the country know what the young member for loughshane would say in this his maiden speech  phineas finn had sundry gifts a powerful and pleasant voice which he had learned to modulate a handsome presence and a certain natural mixture of modesty and selfreliance which would certainly protect him from the faults of arrogance and pomposity and which perhaps might carry him through the perils of his new position and he had also the great advantage of friends in the house who were anxious that he should do well but he had not that gift of slow blood which on the former occasion would have enabled him to remember his prepared speech and which would now have placed all his own resources within his own reach he began with the expression of an opinion that every true reformer ought to accept mr mildmays bill even if it were accepted only as an instalmentbut before he had got through these sentences he became painfully conscious that he was repeating his own words  he was cheered almost from the outset and yet he knew as he went on that he was failing he had certain arguments at his fingers endspoints with which he was in truth so familiar that he need hardly have troubled himself to arrange them for special useand he forgot even these he found that he was going on with one platitude after another as to the benefit of reform in a manner that would have shamed him six or seven years ago at a debating club he pressed on fearing that words would fail him altogether if he pausedbut he did in truth speak very much too fast knocking his words together so that no reporter could properly catch them but he had nothing to say for the bill except what hundreds had said before and hundreds would say again still he was cheered and still he went on and as he became more and more conscious of his failure there grew upon him the ideathe dangerous hope that he might still save himself from ignominy by the eloquence of his invective against the police  he tried it and succeeded thoroughly in making the house understand that he was very angrybut he succeeded in nothing else he could not catch the words to express the thoughts of his mind he could not explain his idea that the people out of the house had as much right to express their opinion in favour of the ballot as members in the house had to express theirs against it and that animosity had been shown to the people by the authorities because they had so expressed their opinion then he attempted to tell the story of mr bunce in a light and airy way failed and sat down in the middle of it again he was cheered by all around himcheered as a new member is usually cheeredand in the midst of the cheer would have blown out his brains had there been a pistol there ready for such an operation  that hour with him was very bad he did not know how to get up and go away or how to keep his place for some time he sat with his hat off forgetful of his privilege of wearing it and then put it on hurriedly as though the fact of his not wearing it must have been observed by everybody at last at about two the debate was adjourned and then as he was slowly leaving the house thinking how he might creep away without companionship mr monk took him by the arm  are you going to walk said mr monk  yes said phineas i shall walk  then we may go together as far as pall mall come along phineas had no means of escape and left the house hanging on mr monks arm without a word nor did mr monk speak till they were out in palace yard it was not much amiss said mr monk but youll do better than that yet  mr monk said phineas i have made an ass of myself so thoroughly that there will at any rate be this good result that i shall never make an ass of myself again after the same fashion  ahi thought you had some such feeling as that and therefore i was determined to speak to you you may be sure finn that i do not care to flatter you and i think you ought to know that as far as i am able i will tell you the truth your speech which was certainly nothing great was about on a par with other maiden speeches in the house of commons you have done yourself neither good nor harm nor was it desirable that you should my advice to you now is never to avoid speaking on any subject that interests you but never to speak for above three minutes till you find yourself as much at home on your legs as you are when sitting but do not suppose that you have made an ass of yourselfthat is in any special degree now goodnight     chapter xxvii  phineas discussed   lady laura kennedy heard two accounts of her friends speechand both from men who had been present her husband was in his place in accordance with his constant practice and lord brentford had been seated perhaps unfortunately in the peers gallery  and you think it was a failure lady laura said to her husband  it certainly was not a success there was nothing particular about it there was a good deal of it you could hardly hear  after that she got the morning newspapers and turned with great interest to the report phineas finn had been as it were adopted by her as her own political offspringor at any rate as her political godchild she had made promises on his behalf to various personages of high political standingto her father to mr monk to the duke of st bungay and even to mr mildmay himself she had thoroughly intended that phineas finn should be a political success from the first and since her marriage she had i think been more intent upon it than before perhaps there was a feeling on her part that having wronged him in one way she would repay him in another she had become so eager for his successfor a while scorning to conceal her feelingthat her husband had unconsciously begun to entertain a dislike to her eagerness we know how quickly women arrive at an understanding of the feelings of those with whom they live and now on that very occasion lady laura perceived that her husband did not take in good part her anxiety on behalf of her friend she saw that it was so as she turned over the newspaper looking for the report of the speech it was given in six lines and at the end of it there was an intimationexpressed in the shape of advicethat the young orator had better speak more slowly if he wished to be efficacious either with the house or with the country  he seems to have been cheered a good deal said lady laura  all members are cheered at their first speech said mr kennedy  ive no doubt hell do well yet said lady laura  very likely said mr kennedy then he turned to his newspaper and did not take his eyes off it as long as his wife remained with him  later in the day lady laura saw her father and miss effingham was with her at the time lord brentford said something which indicated that he had heard the debate on the previous evening and lady laura instantly began to ask him about phineas  the less said the better was the earls reply  do you mean that it was so bad as that asked lady laura  it was not very bad at firstthough indeed nobody could say it was very good but he got himself into a mess about the police and the magistrates before he had done and nothing but the kindly feeling always shown to a first effort saved him from being coughed down lady laura had not a word more to say about phineas to her father but womanlike she resolved that she would not abandon him how many first failures in the world had been the precursors of ultimate success mildmay will lose his bill said the earl sorrowfully there does not seem to be a doubt about that  and what will you all do asked lady laura  we must go to the country i suppose said the earl  whats the use you cant have a more liberal house than you have now said lady laura  we may have one less liberalor rather less radicalwith fewer men to support mr turnbull i do not see what else we can do they say that there are no less than twentyseven men on our side of the house who will either vote with turnbull against us or will decline to vote at all  every one of them ought to lose his seat said lady laura  but what can we do how is the queens government to be carried on we all know the sad earnestness which impressed itself on the earls brow as he asked these momentous questions i dont suppose that mr turnbull can form a ministry  with mr daubeny as whipperin perhaps he might said lady laura  and will mr finn lose his seat asked violet effingham most probably said the earl he only got it by an accident  you must find him a seat somewhere in england said violet  that might be difficult said the earl who then left the room  the two women remained together for some quarter of an hour before they spoke again then lady laura said something about her brother if there be a dissolution i hope oswald will stand for loughton loughton was a borough close to saulsby in which as regarded its political interests lord brentford was supposed to have considerable influence to this violet said nothing it is quite time continued lady laura that old mr standish should give way he has had the seat for twentyfive years and has never done anything and he seldom goes to the house now  he is not your uncle is he  no he is papas cousin but he is ever so much older than papanearly eighty i believe  would not that be just the place for mr finn said violet  then lady laura became very serious oswald would of course have a better right to it than anybody else  but would lord chiltern go into parliament i have heard him declare that he would not  if we could get papa to ask him i think he would change his mind said lady laura  there was again silence for a few moments after which violet returned to the original subject of their conversation it would be a thousand pities that mr finn should be turned out into the cold dont you think so  i for one should be very sorry  so should iand the more so from what lord brentford says about his not speaking well last night i dont think that it is very much of an accomplishment for a gentleman to speak well mr turnbull i suppose speaks well and they say that that horrid man mr bonteen can talk by the hour together i dont think that it shows a man to be clever at all but i believe mr finn would do it if he set his mind to it and i shall think it a great shame if they turn him out  it would depend very much i suppose on lord tulla  i dont know anything about lord tulla said violet but im quite sure that he might have loughton if we manage it properly of course lord chiltern should have it if he wants it but i dont think he will stand in mr finns way  im afraid its out of the question said lady laura gravely papa thinks so much about the borough the reader will remember that both lord brentford and his daughter were thorough reformers the use of a little borough of his own however is a convenience to a great peer  those difficult things have always to be talked of for a long while and then they become easy said violet i believe if you were to propose to mr kennedy to give all his property to the church missionaries and emigrate to new zealand hed begin to consider it seriously after a time  i shall not try at any rate  because you dont want to go to new zealandbut you might try about loughton for poor mr finn  violet said lady laura after a moments pauseand she spoke sharply violet i believe you are in love with mr finn  thats just like you laura  i never made such an accusation against you before or against anybody else that i can remember but i do begin to believe that you are in love with mr finn  why shouldnt i be in love with him if i like  i say nothing about thatonly he has not got a penny  but i have my dear  and i doubt whether you have any reason for supposing that he is in love with you  that would be my affair my dear  then you are in love with him  that is my affair also  lady laura shrugged her shoulders of course it is and if you tell me to hold my tongue of course i will do so if you ask me whether i think it a good match of course i must say i do not  i dont tell you to hold your tongue and i dont ask you what you think about the match you are quite welcome to talk as much about me as you pleasebut as to mr phineas finn you have no business to think anything  i shouldnt talk to anybody but yourself  i am growing to be quite indifferent as to what people say lady baldock asked me the other day whether i was going to throw myself away on mr laurence fitzgibbon  no  indeed she did  and what did you answer  i told her that it was not quite settled but that as i had only spoken to him once during the last two years and then for not more than half a minute and as i wasnt sure whether i knew him by sight and as i had reason to suppose he didnt know my name there might perhaps be a delay of a week or two before the thing came off then she flounced out of the room  but what made her ask about mr fitzgibbon  somebody had been hoaxing her i am beginning to think that augusta does it for her private amusement if so i shall think more highly of my dear cousin than i have hitherto done but laura as you have made a similar accusation against me and as i cannot get out of it with you as i do with my aunt i must ask you to hear my protestation i am not in love with mr phineas finn heaven help meas far as i can tell i am not in love with any one and never shall be lady laura looked pleased do you know continued violet that i think i could be in love with mr phineas finn if i could be in love with anybody then lady laura looked displeased in the first place he is a gentleman continued violet then he is a man of spirit and then he has not too much spiritnot that kind of spirit which makes some men think that they are the finest things going his manners are perfectnot chesterfieldian and yet never offensive he never browbeats any one and never toadies any one he knows how to live easily with men of all ranks without any appearance of claiming a special status for himself if he were made archbishop of canterbury tomorrow i believe he would settle down into the place of the first subject in the land without arrogance and without false shame  you are his eulogist with a vengeance  i am his eulogist but i am not in love with him if he were to ask me to be his wife tomorrow i should be distressed and should refuse him if he were to marry my dearest friend in the world i should tell him to kiss me and be my brother as to mr phineas finnthose are my sentiments  what you say is very odd  why odd  simply because mine are the same  are they the same i once thought laura that you did love himthat you meant to be his wife  lady laura sat for a while without making any reply to this she sat with her elbow on the table and with her face leaning on her handthinking how far it would tend to her comfort if she spoke in true confidence violet during the time never took her eyes from her friends face but remained silent as though waiting for an answer she had been very explicit as to her feelings would laura kennedy be equally explicit she was too clever to forget that such plainness of speech would be must be more difficult to lady laura than to herself lady laura was a married woman but she felt that her friend would have been wrong to search for secrets unless she were ready to tell her own it was probably some such feeling which made lady laura speak at last  so i did nearly said lady laura very nearly you told me just now that you had money and could therefore do as you pleased i had no money and could not do as i pleased  and you told me also that i had no reason for thinking that he cared for me  did i welli suppose you have no reason he did care for me he did love me  he told you so  yeshe told me so  and how did you answer him  i had that very morning become engaged to mr kennedy that was my answer  and what did he say when you told him  i do not know i cannot remember but he behaved very well  and nowif he were to love me you would grudge me his love  not for that reasonnot if i know myself oh no i would not be so selfish as that  for what reason then  because i look upon it as written in heaven that you are to be oswalds wife  heavens writings then are false said violet getting up and walking away  in the meantime phineas was very wretched at home when he reached his lodgings after leaving the houseafter his short conversation with mr monkhe tried to comfort himself with what that gentleman had said to him for a while while he was walking there had been some comfort in mr monks words mr monk had much experience and doubtless knew what he was sayingand there might yet be hope but all this hope faded away when phineas was in his own rooms there came upon him as he looked round them an idea that he had no business to be in parliament that he was an impostor that he was going about the world under false pretences and that he would never set himself aright even unto himself till he had gone through some terrible act of humiliation he had been a cheat even to mr quintus slide of the banner in accepting an invitation to come among them he had been a cheat to lady laura in that he had induced her to think that he was fit to live with her he was a cheat to violet effingham in assuming that he was capable of making himself agreeable to her he was a cheat to lord chiltern when riding his horses and pretending to be a proper associate for a man of fortune whywhat was his income what his birth what his proper position and now he had got the reward which all cheats deserve then he went to bed and as he lay there he thought of mary flood jones had he plighted his troth to mary and then worked like a slave under mr lows auspiceshe would not have been a cheat  it seemed to him that he had hardly been asleep when the girl came into his room in the morning sir said she theres that gentleman there  what gentleman  the old gentleman  then phineas knew that mr clarkson was in his sittingroom and that he would not leave it till he had seen the owner of the room nayphineas was pretty sure that mr clarkson would come into the bedroom if he were kept long waiting damn the old gentleman said phineas in his wrathand the maidservant heard him say so  in about twenty minutes he went out into the sittingroom with his slippers on and in his dressinggown suffering under the circumstances of such an emergency how is any man to go through the work of dressing and washing with proper exactness as to the prayers which he said on that morning i think that no question should be asked he came out with a black cloud on his brow and with his mind half made up to kick mr clarkson out of the room mr clarkson when he saw him moved his chin round within his white cravat as was a custom with him and put his thumb and forefinger on his lips and then shook his head  very bad mr finn very bad indeed very bad aint it  you coming here in this way at all times in the day is very bad said phineas  and where would you have me go would you like to see me down in the lobby of the house  to tell you the truth mr clarkson i dont want to see you anywhere  ah yes i daresay and thats what you call honest being a parliament gent you had my money and then you tell me you dont want to see me any more  i have not had your money said phineas  but let me tell you continued mr clarkson that i want to see youand shall go on seeing you till the money is paid  ive not had any of your money said phineas  mr clarkson again twitched his chin about on the top of his cravat and smiled mr finn said he showing the bill is that your name  yes it is  then i want my money  i have no money to give you  do be punctual now why aint you punctual id do anything for you if you were punctual i would indeed mr clarkson as he said this sat down in the chair which had been placed for our heros breakfast and cutting a slice off the loaf began to butter it with great composure  mr clarkson said phineas i cannot ask you to breakfast here i am engaged  ill just take a bit of bread and butter all the same said clarkson where do you get your butter now i could tell you a woman whod give it you cheaper and a deal better than this this is all lard shall i send her to you  no said phineas there was no tea ready and therefore mr clarkson emptied the milk into a cup and drank it after this said phineas i must beg mr clarkson that you will never come to my room any more i shall not be at home to you  the lobby of the house is the same thing to me said mr clarkson they know me there well i wish youd be punctual and then wed be the best of friends after that mr clarkson having finished his bread and butter took his leave     chapter xxviii  the second reading is carried   the debate on the bill was prolonged during the whole of that week lord brentford who loved his seat in the cabinet and the glory of being a minister better even than he loved his borough had taken a gloomy estimate when he spoke of twentyseven defaulters and of the bill as certainly lost men who were better able than he to make estimatesthe bonteens and fitzgibbons on each side of the house and above all the ratlers and robys produced lists from day to day which varied now by three names in one direction then by two in another and which fluctuated at last by units only they all concurred in declaring that it would be a very near division a great effort was made to close the debate on the friday but it failed and the full tide of speech was carried on till the following monday on that morning phineas heard mr ratler declare at the club that as far as his judgment went the division at that moment was a fair subject for a bet there are two men doubtful in the house said ratler and if one votes on one side and one on the other or if neither votes at all it will be a tie mr roby however the whip on the other side was quite sure that one at least of these gentlemen would go into his lobby and that the other would not go into mr ratlers lobby i am inclined to think that the town was generally inclined to put more confidence in the accuracy of mr roby than in that of mr ratler and among betting men there certainly was a point given by those who backed the conservatives the odds however were lost for on the division the numbers in the two lobbies were equal and the speaker gave his casting vote in favour of the government the bill was read a second time and was lost as a matter of course in reference to any subsequent action mr roby declared that even mr mildmay could not go on with nothing but the speakers vote to support him mr mildmay had no doubt felt that he could not go on with his bill from the moment in which mr turnbull had declared his opposition but he could not with propriety withdraw it in deference to mr turnbulls opinion  during the week phineas had had his hands sufficiently full twice he had gone to the potted peas inquiry but he had been at the office of the peoples banner more often than that bunce had been very resolute in his determination to bring an action against the police for false imprisonment even though he spent every shilling of his savings in doing so and when his wife in the presence of phineas begged that bygones might be bygones reminding him that spilt milk could not be recovered he called her a meanspirited woman then mrs bunce wept a flood of tears and told her favourite lodger that for her all comfort in this world was over drat the reformers i say and i wish there was no parliament so i do whats the use of all the voting when it means nothing but dry bread and cross words phineas by no means encouraged his landlord in his litigious spirit advising him rather to keep his money in his pocket and leave the fighting of the battle to the columns of the bannerwhich would fight it at any rate with economy but bunce though he delighted in the banner and showed an unfortunate readiness to sit at the feet of mr quintus slide would have his action at lawin which resolution mr slide did i fear encourage him behind the back of his better friend phineas finn  phineas went with bunce to mr lows chambersfor mr low had in some way become acquainted with the lawstationers journeymanand there some very good advice was given have you asked yourself what is your object mr bunce said mr low mr bunce declared he had asked himself that question and had answered it his object was redress in the shape of compensation to yourself suggested mr low no mr bunce would not admit that he personally required any compensation the redress wanted was punishment to the man is it for vengeance asked mr low no it was not for vengeance mr bunce declared it ought not to be continued mr low because though you think that the man exceeded in his duty you must feel that he was doing so through no personal illwill to yourself  what i want is to have the fellows kept in their proper places said mr bunce  exactlyand therefore these things when they occur are mentioned in the press and in parliamentand the attention of a secretary of state is called to them thank god we dont have very much of that kind of thing in england  maybe we shall have more if we dont look to it said bunce stoutly  we always are looking to it said mr lowlooking to it very carefully but i dont think anything is to be done in that way by indictment against a single man whose conduct has been already approved by the magistrates if you want notoriety mr bunce and dont mind what you pay for it or have got anybody else to pay for it then indeed  there aint nobody to pay for it said bunce waxing angry  then i certainly should not pay for it myself if i were you said mr low  but bunce was not to be counselled out of his intention when he was out in the square with phineas he expressed great anger against mr low he dont know what patriotism means said the law scrivener and then he talks to me about notoriety it has always been the same way with em if a man shows a spark of public feeling its all hambition i dont want no notoriety i wants to earn my bread peaceable and to be let alone when im about my own business i pays rates for the police to look after rogues not to haul folks about and lock em up for days and nights who is doing what they has a legal right to do after that bunce went to his attorney to the great detriment of the business at the stationers shop and phineas visited the office of the peoples banner there he wrote a leading article about bunces case for which he was in due time to be paid a guinea after all the peoples banner might do more for him in this way than ever would be done by parliament mr slide however and another gentleman at the banner office much older than mr slide who announced himself as the actual editor were anxious that phineas should rid himself of his heterodox political resolutions about the ballot it was not that they cared much about his own opinions and when phineas attempted to argue with the editor on the merits of the ballot the editor put him down very shortly we go in for it mr finn he said if mr finn would go in for it too the editor seemed to think that mr finn might make himself very useful at the banner office phineas stoutly maintained that this was impossibleand was therefore driven to confine his articles in the service of the people to those open subjects on which his opinions agreed with those of the peoples banner this was his second article and the editor seemed to think that backward as he was about the ballot he was too useful an aid to be thrown aside a member of parliament is not now all that he was once but still there is a prestige in the letters affixed to his name which makes him loom larger in the eyes of the world than other men get into parliament if it be but for the borough of loughshane and the peoples banners all round will be glad of your assistance as will also companies limited and unlimited to a very marvellous extent phineas wrote his article and promised to look in again and so they went on mr quintus slide continued to assure him that a horgan was indispensable to him and phineas began to accommodate his ears to the sound which had at first been so disagreeable he found that his acquaintance mr slide had ideas of his own as to getting into the ouse at some future time i always look upon the ouse as my oyster and eres my sword said mr slide brandishing an old quill pen and i feel that if once there i could get along i do indeed what is it a man wants its only pluckthat he shouldnt funk because a undred other men are looking at him then phineas asked him whether he had any idea of a constituency to which mr slide replied that he had no absolutely formed intention many boroughs however would doubtless be set free from aristocratic influence by the redistribution of seats which must take place as mr slide declared at any rate in the next session then he named the borough of loughton and phineas finn thinking of saulsby thinking of the earl thinking of lady laura and thinking of violet walked away disgusted would it not be better that the quiet town clustering close round the walls of saulsby should remain as it was than that it should be polluted by the presence of mr quintus slide  on the last day of the debate at a few moments before four oclock phineas encountered another terrible misfortune he had been at the potted peas since twelve and had on this occasion targed two or three commissariat officers very tightly with questions respecting cabbages and potatoes and had asked whether the officers on board a certain ship did not always eat preserved asparagus while the men had not even a bean i fear that he had been put up to this business by mr quintus slide and that he made himself nasty there was however so much nastiness of the kind going that his little effort made no great difference the conservative members of the committee on whose side of the house the inquiry had originated did not scruple to lay all manner of charges to officers whom were they themselves in power they would be bound to support and would support with all their energies about a quarter before four the members of the committee had dismissed their last witness for the day being desirous of not losing their chance of seats on so important an occasion and hurried down into the lobbyso that they might enter the house before prayers phineas here was buttonholed by barrington erle who said something to him as to the approaching division they were standing in front of the door of the house almost in the middle of the lobby with a crowd of members around themon a spot which as frequenters know is hallowed ground and must not be trodden by strangers he was in the act of answering erle when he was touched on the arm and on turning round saw mr clarkson about that little bill mr finn said the horrible man turning his chin round over his white cravat they always tell me at your lodgings that you aint at home by this time a policeman was explaining to mr clarkson with gentle violence that he must not stand therethat he must go aside into one of the corners i know all that said mr clarkson retreating of course i do but what is a man to do when a gent wont see him at home mr clarkson stood aside in his corner quietly giving the policeman no occasion for further action against him but in retreating he spoke loud and there was a lull of voices around and twenty members at least had heard what had been said phineas finn no doubt had his privilege but mr clarkson was determined that the privilege should avail him as little as possible  it was very hard the real offender the lord of the treasury the peers son with a thousand a year paid by the country was not treated with this cruel persecution phineas had in truth never taken a farthing from any one but his father and though doubtless he owed something at this moment he had no creditor of his own that was even angry with him as the world goes he was a clear manbut for this debt of his friend fitzgibbon he left barrington erle in the lobby and hurried into the house blushing up to the eyes he looked for fitzgibbon in his place but the lord of the treasury was not as yet there doubtless he would be there for the division and phineas resolved that he would speak a bit of his mind before he let his friend out of his sight  there were some great speeches made on that evening mr gresham delivered an oration of which men said that it would be known in england as long as there were any words remaining of english eloquence in it he taunted mr turnbull with being a recreant to the people of whom he called himself so often the champion but mr turnbull was not in the least moved mr gresham knew well enough that mr turnbull was not to be moved by any wordsbut the words were not the less telling to the house and to the country men who heard it said that mr gresham forgot himself in that speech forgot his party forgot his strategy forgot his longdrawn schemeseven his love of applause and thought only of his cause mr daubeny replied to him with equal genius and with equal skillif not with equal heart mr gresham had asked for the approbation of all present and of all future reformers mr daubeny denied him boththe one because he would not succeed and the other because he would not have deserved success then mr mildmay made his reply getting up at about three oclock and uttered a prayera futile prayerthat this his last work on behalf of his countrymen might be successful his bill was read a second time as i have said before in obedience to the casting vote of the speakerbut a majority such as that was tantamount to a defeat  there was of course on that night no declaration as to what ministers would do without a meeting of the cabinet and without some further consideration though each might know that the bill would be withdrawn they could not say in what way they would act but late as was the hour there were many words on the subject before members were in their beds mr turnbull and mr monk left the house together and perhaps no two gentlemen in it had in former sessions been more in the habit of walking home arminarm and discussing what each had heard and what each had said in that assembly latterly these two men had gone strangely asunder in their pathsvery strangely for men who had for years walked so closely together and this separation had been marked by violent words spoken against each otherby violent words at least spoken against him in office by the one who had never contaminated his hands by the queens shilling and yet on such an occasion as this they were able to walk away from the house arminarm and did not fly at each others throat by the way  singular enough is it not said mr turnbull that the thing should have been so close  very odd said mr monk but men have said that it would be so all the week  gresham was very fine said mr turnbull  very fine indeed i never have heard anything like it before  daubeny was very powerful too said mr turnbull  yesno doubt the occasion was great and he answered to the spur but greshams was the speech of the debate  wellyes perhaps it was said mr turnbull who was thinking of his own flight the other night and who among his special friends had been much praised for what he had then done but of course he made no allusion to his own doingsor to those of mr monk in this way they conversed for some twenty minutes till they parted but neither of them interrogated the other as to what either might be called upon to do in consequence of the division which had just been effected they might still be intimate friends but the days of confidence between them were passed  phineas had seen laurence fitzgibbon enter the housewhich he did quite late in the night so as to be in time for the division no doubt he had dined in the house and had been all the evening in the libraryor in the smokingroom when mr mildmay was on his legs making his reply fitzgibbon had sauntered in not choosing to wait till he might be rung up by the bell at the last moment phineas was near him as they passed by the tellers near him in the lobby and near him again as they all passed back into the house but at the last moment he thought that he would miss his prey in the crowd as they left the house he failed to get his hand upon his friends shoulder but he hurried down the members passage and just at the gate leading out into westminster hall he overtook fitzgibbon walking arminarm with barrington erle  laurence he said taking hold of his countrymans arm with a decided grasp i want to speak to you for a moment if you please  speak away said laurence then phineas looking up into his face knew very well that he had beenwhat the world calls dining  phineas remembered at the moment that barrington erle had been close to him when the odious moneylender had touched his arm and made his inquiry about that little bill he much wished to make erle understand that the debt was not his ownthat he was not in the hands of usurers in reference to his own concerns but there was a feeling within him that he stilleven stillowed something to his friendship to fitzgibbon just give me your arm and come on with me for a minute said phineas erle will excuse us  oh blazes said laurence what is it youre after i aint good at private conferences at three in the morning were all out and isnt that enough for ye  i have been dreadfully annoyed tonight said phineas and i wished to speak to you about it  bedad finn my boy and there are a good many of us are annoyedeh barrington  phineas perceived clearly that though fitzgibbon had been dining there was as much of cunning in all this as of wine and he was determined not to submit to such unlimited illusage my annoyance comes from your friend mr clarkson who had the impudence to address me in the lobby of the house  and serve you right too finn my boy why the devil did you sport your oak to him he has told me all about it there aint such a patient little fellow as clarkson anywhere if youll only let him have his own way hell look in as he calls it three times a week for a whole season and do nothing further of course he dont like to be locked out  is that the gentleman with whom the police interfered in the lobby erle inquired  a confounded bill discounter to whom our friend here has introduced mefor his own purposes said phineas  a very gentlemanlike fellow said laurence barrington knows him i daresay look here finn my boy take my advice ask him to breakfast and let him understand that the house will always be open to him after this laurence fitzgibbon and barrington erle got into a cab together and were driven away     chapter xxix  a cabinet meeting   and now will the muses assist me while i sing an altogether new song on the tuesday the cabinet met at the first lords official residence in downing street and i will attempt to describe what according to the bewildered brain of a poor fictionist was said or might have been said what was done or might have been done on so august an occasion  the poor fictionist very frequently finds himself to have been wrong in his description of things in general and is told so roughly by the critics and tenderly by the friends of his bosom he is moved to tell of things of which he omits to learn the nature before he tells of themas should be done by a strictly honest fictionist he catches salmon in october or shoots his partridges in march his dahlias bloom in june and his birds sing in the autumn he opens the operahouses before easter and makes parliament sit on a wednesday evening and then those terrible meshes of the law how is a fictionist in these excited days to create the needed biting interest without legal difficulties and how again is he to steer his little bark clear of so many rockswhen the rocks and the shoals have been purposely arranged to make the taking of a pilot on board a necessity as to those law meshes a benevolent pilot will indeed now and again give a poor fictionist a helping handnot used however generally with much discretion but from whom is any assistance to come in the august matter of a cabinet assembly there can be no such assistance no man can tell aught but they who will tell nothing but then again there is this safety that let the story be ever so mistoldlet the fiction be ever so far removed from the truth no critic short of a cabinet minister himself can convict the narrator of error  it was a large dingy room covered with a turkey carpet and containing a dark polished mahogany dinnertable on very heavy carved legs which an old messenger was preparing at two oclock in the day for the use of her majestys ministers the table would have been large enough for fourteen guests and along the side further from the fire there were placed some six heavy chairs good comfortable chairs stuffed at the back as well as the seatbut on the side nearer to the fire the chairs were placed irregularly and there were four armchairstwo on one side and two on the other there were four windows to the room which looked on to st jamess park and the curtains of the windows were dark and heavyas became the gravity of the purposes to which that chamber was appropriated in old days it had been the diningroom of one prime minister after another to pitt it had been the abode of his own familiar prandial penates and lord liverpool had been dull there among his dull friends for long year after year the ministers of the present day find it more convenient to live in private homes and indeed not unfrequently carry their cabinets with them but under mr mildmays rule the meetings were generally held in the old room at the official residence thrice did the aged messenger move each armchair now a little this way and now a little that and then look at them as though something of the tendency of the coming meeting might depend on the comfort of its leading members if mr mildmay should find himself to be quite comfortable so that he could hear what was said without a struggle to his ear and see his colleagues faces clearly and feel the fire without burning his shins it might be possible that he would not insist upon resigning if this were so how important was the work now confided to the hands of that aged messenger when his anxious eyes had glanced round the room some half a dozen times when he had touched each curtain laid his hand upon every chair and dusted certain papers which lay upon a sidetableand which had been lying there for two years and at which no one ever looked or would lookhe gently crept away and ensconced himself in an easy chair not far from the door of the chamber for it might be necessary to stop the attempt of a rash intruder on those secret counsels  very shortly there was heard the ring of various voices in the passagesthe voices of men speaking pleasantly the voices of men with whom it seemed from their tone that things were doing well in the world and then a cluster of four or five gentlemen entered the room at first sight they seemed to be as ordinary gentlemen as you shall meet anywhere about pall mall on an afternoon there was nothing about their outward appearance of the august wiggery of statecraft nothing of the ponderous dignity of ministerial position that little man in the squarecut coatwe may almost call it a shootingcoatswinging an umbrella and wearing no gloves is no less a person than the lord chancellorlord weazelingwho made a hundred thousand pounds as attorneygeneral and is supposed to be the best lawyer of his age he is fifty but he looks to be hardly over forty and one might take him to be from his appearanceperhaps a clerk in the war office welltodo and popular among his brotherclerks immediately with him is sir harry coldfoot also a lawyer by profession though he has never practised he has been in the house for nearly thirty years and is now at the home office he is a stout healthy greyhaired gentleman who certainly does not wear the cares of office on his face perhaps however no minister gets more bullied than he by the press and men say that he will be very willing to give up to some political enemy the control of the police and the onerous duty of judging in all criminal appeals behind these come our friend mr monk young lord cantrip from the colonies next door than whom no smarter young peer now does honour to our hereditary legislature and sir marmaduke morecombe the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster why sir marmaduke has always been placed in mr mildmays cabinets nobody ever knew as chancellor of the duchy he has nothing to doand were there anything he would not do it he rarely speaks in the house and then does not speak well he is a handsome man or would be but for an assumption of grandeur in the carriage of his eyes giving to his face a character of pomposity which he himself well deserves he was in the guards when young and has been in parliament since he ceased to be young it must be supposed that mr mildmay has found something in him for he has been included in three successive liberal cabinets he has probably the virtue of being true to mr mildmay and of being duly submissive to one whom he recognises as his superior  within two minutes afterwards the duke followed with plantagenet palliser the duke as all the world knows was the duke of st bungay the very front and head of the aristocratic old whigs of the countrya man who has been thrice spoken of as prime minister and who really might have filled the office had he not known himself to be unfit for it the duke has been consulted as to the making of cabinets for the last fiveandthirty years and is even now not an old man in appearancea fussy popular clever conscientious man whose digestion has been too good to make politics a burden to him but who has thought seriously about his country and is one who will be sure to leave memoirs behind him he was born in the semipurple of ministerial influences and men say of him that he is honester than his uncle who was cannings friend but not so great a man as his grandfather with whom fox once quarrelled and whom burke loved plantagenet palliser himself the heir to a dukedom was the young chancellor of the exchequer of whom some statesmen thought much as the rising star of the age if industry rectitude of purpose and a certain clearness of intellect may prevail planty pall as he is familiarly called may become a great minister  then came viscount thrift by himselfthe first lord of the admiralty with the whole weight of a new ironclad fleet upon his shoulders he has undertaken the herculean task of cleansing the dockyardsand with it the lesser work of keeping afloat a navy that may be esteemed by his countrymen to be the best in the world and he thinks that he will do both if only mr mildmay will not resignan industrious honest selfdenying nobleman who works without ceasing from morn to night and who hopes to rise in time to high thingsto the translating of homer perhaps and the wearing of the garter  close behind him there was a ruck of ministers with the muchhonoured greyhaired old premier in the midst of them there was mr gresham the foreign minister said to be the greatest orator in europe on whose shoulders it was thought that the mantle of mr mildmay would fallto be worn however quite otherwise than mr mildmay had worn it for mr gresham is a man with no feelings for the past void of historical association hardly with memoriesliving altogether for the future which he is anxious to fashion anew out of the vigour of his own brain whereas with mr mildmay even his love of reform is an inherited passion for an oldworld liberalism and there was with them mr legge wilson the brother of a peer secretary at war a great scholar and a polished gentleman very proud of his position as a cabinet minister but conscious that he has hardly earned it by political work and lord plinlimmon is with them the comptroller of indiaof all working lords the most jaunty the most pleasant and the most popular very good at taking chairs at dinners and making becoming speeches at the shortest notice a man apparently very free and open in his ways of lifebut cautious enough in truth as to every step knowing well how hard it is to climb and how easy to fall mr mildmay entered the room leaning on lord plinlimmons arm and when he made his way up among the armchairs upon the rug before the fire the others clustered around him with cheering looks and kindly questions then came the privy seal our old friend lord brentford lastand i would say least but that the words of no councillor could go for less in such an assemblage than will those of sir marmaduke morecombe the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster  mr mildmay was soon seated in one of the armchairs while lord plinlimmon leaned against the table close at his elbow mr gresham stood upright at the corner of the chimneypiece furthest from mr mildmay and mr palliser at that nearest to him the duke took the armchair close at mr mildmays left hand lord plinlimmon was as i have said leaning against the table but the lord chancellor who was next to him sat upon it viscount thrift and mr monk occupied chairs on the further side of the table near to mr mildmays end and mr legge wilson placed himself at the head of the table thus joining them as it were into a body the home secretary stood before the lord chancellor screening him from the fire and the chancellor of the duchy after waiting for a few minutes as though in doubt took one of the vacant armchairs the young lord from the colonies stood a little behind the shoulders of his great friend from the foreign office and the privy seal after moving about for a while uneasily took a chair behind the chancellor of the duchy one armchair was thus left vacant but there was no other comer  it is not so bad as i thought it would be said the duke speaking aloud but nevertheless addressing himself specially to his chief  it was bad enough said mr mildmay laughing  bad enough indeed said sir marmaduke morecombe without any laughter  and such a good bill lost said lord plinlimmon the worst of these failures is that the same identical bill can never be brought in again  so that if the lost bill was best the bill that will not be lost can only be second best said the lord chancellor  i certainly did think that after the debate before easter we should not have come to shipwreck about the ballot said mr mildmay  it was brewing for us all along said mr gresham who then with a gesture of his hand and a pressure of his lips withheld words which he was nearly uttering and which would not probably have been complimentary to mr turnbull as it was he turned half round and said something to lord cantrip which was not audible to any one else in the room it was worthy of note however that mr turnbulls name was not once mentioned aloud at that meeting  i am afraid it was brewing all along said sir marmaduke morecombe gravely  well gentlemen we must take it as we get it said mr mildmay still smiling and now we must consider what we shall do at once then he paused as though expecting that counsel would come to him first from one colleague and then from another but no such counsel came and probably mr mildmay did not in the least expect that it would come  we cannot stay where we are of course said the duke the duke was privileged to say as much as that but though every man in the room knew that it must be so no one but the duke would have said it before mr mildmay had spoken plainly himself  no said mr mildmay i suppose that we can hardly stay where we are probably none of us wish it gentlemen then he looked round upon his colleagues and there came a sort of an assent though there were no spoken words the sound from sir marmaduke morecombe was louder than that from the othersbut yet from him it was no more than an attesting grunt we have two things to consider continued mr mildmayand though he spoke in a very low voice every word was heard by all presenttwo things chiefly that is the work of the country and the queens comfort i propose to see her majesty this afternoon at fivethat is in something less than two hours time and i hope to be able to tell the house by seven what has taken place between her majesty and me my friend his grace will do as much in the house of lords if you agree with me gentlemen i will explain to the queen that it is not for the welfare of the country that we should retain our places and i will place your resignations and my own in her majestys hands  you will advise her majesty to send for lord de terrier said mr gresham  certainlythere will be no other course open to me  or to her said mr gresham to this remark from the rising minister of the day no word of reply was made but of those present in the room three or four of the most experienced servants of the crown felt that mr gresham had been imprudent the duke who had ever been afraid of mr gresham told mr palliser afterwards that such an observation should not have been made and sir harry coldfoot pondered upon it uneasily and sir marmaduke morecombe asked mr mildmay what he thought about it times change so much and with the times the feelings of men said mr mildmay but i doubt whether sir marmaduke quite understood him  there was silence in the room for a moment or two after mr gresham had spoken and then mr mildmay again addressed his friends of course it may be possible that my lord de terrier may foresee difficulties or may find difficulties which will oblige him either at once or after an attempt has been made to decline the task which her majesty will probably commit to him all of us no doubt know that the arrangement of a government is not the most easy task in the world and that it is not made the more easy by an absence of a majority in the house of commons  he would dissolve i presume said the duke  i should say so continued mr mildmay but it may not improbably come to pass that her majesty will feel herself obliged to send again for some one or two of us that we may tender to her majesty the advice which we owe to herfor me for instance or for my friend the duke in such a matter she would be much guided probably by what lord de terrier might have suggested to her should this be so and should i be consulted my present feeling is that we should resume our offices so that the necessary business of the session should be completed and that we should then dissolve parliament and thus ascertain the opinion of the country in such case however we should of course meet again  i quite think that the course proposed by mr mildmay will be the best said the duke who had no doubt already discussed the matter with his friend the prime minister in private no one else said a word either of argument or disagreement and the cabinet council was broken up the old messenger who had been asleep in his chair stood up and bowed as the ministers walked by him and then went in and rearranged the chairs  he has as much idea of giving up as you or i have said lord cantrip to his friend mr gresham as they walked arminarm together from the treasury chambers across st jamess park towards the clubs  i am not sure that he is not right said mr gresham  do you mean for himself or for the country asked lord cantrip  for his future fame they who have abdicated and have clung to their abdication have always lost by it cincinnatus was brought back again and charles v is felt to have been foolish the peaches of retired ministers of which we hear so often have generally been cultivated in a constrained seclusionor at least the world so believes they were talking probably of mr mildmay as to whom some of his colleagues had thought it probable knowing that he would now resign that he would have today declared his intention of laying aside for ever the cares of office  mr monk walked home alone and as he went there was something of a feeling of disappointment at heart which made him ask himself whether mr turnbull might not have been right in rebuking him for joining the government but this i think was in no way due to mr mildmays resignation but rather to a conviction on mr monks part that that he had contributed but little to his countrys welfare by sitting in mr mildmays cabinet     chapter xxx  mr kennedys luck   after the holding of that cabinet council of which the author has dared to attempt a slight sketch in the last chapter there were various visits made to the queen first by mr mildmay and then by lord de terrier afterwards by mr mildmay and the duke together and then again by lord de terrier and there were various explanations made to parliament in each house and rivals were very courteous to each other promising assistanceand at the end of it the old men held their seats the only change made was effected by the retirement of sir marmaduke morecombe who was raised to the peerage and by the selection ofmr kennedy to fill his place in the cabinet mr kennedy during the late debate had made one of those speeches few and far between by which he had created for himself a parliamentary reputation but nevertheless all men expressed their great surprise and no one could quite understand why mr kennedy had been made a cabinet minister  it is impossible to say whether he is pleased or not said lady laura speaking of him to phineas i am pleased of course  his ambition must be gratified said phineas  it would be if he had any said lady laura  i do not believe in a man lacking ambition  it is hard to say there are men who by no means wear their hearts upon their sleeves and my husband is one of them he told me that it would be unbecoming in him to refuse and that was all he said to me about it  the old men held their seats but they did so as it were only upon further trial mr mildmay took the course which he had indicated to his colleagues at the cabinet meeting before all the explanations and journeyings were completed april was over and the muchneeded whitsuntide holidays were coming on but little of the routine work of the session had been done and as mr mildmay told the house more than once the country would suffer were the queen to dissolve parliament at this period of the year the old ministers would go on with the business of the country lord de terrier with his followers having declined to take affairs into their hands and at the close of the session which should be made as short as possible writs should be issued for new elections this was mr mildmays programme and it was one of which no one dared to complain very loudly  mr turnbull indeed did speak a word of caution he told mr mildmay that he had lost his bill good in other respects because he had refused to introduce the ballot into his measure let him promise to be wiser for the future and to obey the manifested wishes of the country and then all would be well with him in answer to this mr mildmay declared that to the best of his power of reading the country his countrymen had manifested no such wish and that if they did so if by the fresh election it should be shown that the ballot was in truth desired he would at once leave the execution of their wishes to abler and younger hands mr turnbull expressed himself perfectly satisfied with the ministers answers and said that the coming election would show whether he or mr mildmay were right  many men and among them some of his colleagues thought that mr mildmay had been imprudent no man ought ever to pledge himself to anything said sir harry coldfoot to the dukethat is to anything unnecessary the duke who was very true to mr mildmay made no reply to this but even he thought that his old friend had been betrayed into a promise too rapidly but the pledge was given and some people already began to make much of it there appeared leader after leader in the peoples banner urging the constituencies to take advantage of the prime ministers words and to show clearly at the hustings that they desired the ballot you had better come over to us mr finn you had indeed said mr slide nows the time to do it and show yourself a peoples friend youll have to do it sooner or laterwhether or no come to us and well be your horgan  but in those days phineas was something less in love with mr quintus slide than he had been at the time of the great debate for he was becoming more and more closely connected with people who in their ways of living and modes of expression were very unlike mr slide this advice was given to him about the end of may and at that time lord chiltern was living with him in the lodgings in great marlborough street miss pouncefoot had temporarily vacated her rooms on the first floor and the lord with the broken bones had condescended to occupy them i dont know that i like having a lord bunce had said to his wife itll soon come to you not liking anybody decent anywhere mrs bunce had replied but i shant ask any questions about it when youre wasting so much time and money at your dirty law proceedings its well that somebody should earn something at home  there had been many discussions about the bringing of lord chiltern up to london in all of which phineas had been concerned lord brentford had thought that his son had better remain down at the willingford bull and although he said that the rooms were at his sons disposal should lord chiltern choose to come to london still he said it in such a way that phineas who went down to willingford could not tell his friend that he would be made welcome in portman square i think i shall leave those diggings altogether lord chiltern said to him my father annoys me by everything he says and does and i annoy him by saying and doing nothing then there came an invitation to him from lady laura and mr kennedy would he come to grosvenor place lady laura pressed this very much though in truth mr kennedy had hardly done more than give a cold assent but lord chiltern would not hear of it there is some reason for my going to my fathers house said he though he and i are not the best friends in the world but there can be no reason for my going to the house of a man i dislike so much as i do robert kennedy the matter was settled in the manner told above miss pouncefoots rooms were prepared for him at mr bunces house and phineas finn went down to willingford and brought him up ive sold bonebreaker he saidto a young fellow whose neck will certainly be the sacrifice if he attempts to ride him id have given him to you phineas only you wouldnt have known what to do with him  lord chiltern when he came up to london was still in bandages though as the surgeon said his bones seemed to have been made to be broken and set again and his bandages of course were a sufficient excuse for his visiting the house neither of his father nor his brotherinlaw but lady laura went to him frequently and thus became acquainted with our heros home and with mrs bunce and there were messages taken from violet to the man in bandages some of which lost nothing in the carrying once lady laura tried to make violet think that it would be right or rather not wrong that they two should go together to lord chilterns rooms  and would you have me tell my aunt or would you have me not tell her violet asked  i would have you do just as you pleased lady laura answered  so i shall violet replied but i will do nothing that i should be ashamed to tell any one your brother professes to be in love with me  he is in love with you said lady laura even you do not pretend to doubt his faith  very well in those circumstances a girl should not go to a mans rooms unless she means to consider herself as engaged to him even with his sisternot though he had broken every bone in his skin i know what i may do laura and i know what i maynt and i wont be led either by you or by my aunt  may i give him your love  nobecause youll give it in a wrong spirit he knows well enough that i wish him wellbut you may tell him that from me if you please he has from me all those wishes which one friend owes to another  but there were other messages sent from violet through phineas finn which she worded with more show of affectionperhaps as much for the discomfort of phineas as for the consolation of lord chiltern tell him to take care of himself said violet and bid him not to have any more of those wild brutes that are not fit for any christian to ride tell him that i say so its a great thing to be brave but whats the use of being foolhardy  the session was to be closed at the end of june to the great dismay of london tradesmen and of young ladies who had not been entirely successful in the early season but before the old parliament was closed and the writs for the new election were despatched there occurred an incident which was of very much importance to phineas finn near the end of june when the remaining days of the session were numbered by three or four he had been dining at lord brentfords house in portman square in company with mr kennedy but lady laura had not been there at this time he saw lord brentford not unfrequently and there was always a word said about lord chiltern the father would ask how the son occupied himself and phineas would hopethough hitherto he had hoped in vainthat he would induce the earl to come and see lord chiltern lord brentford could never be brought to that but it was sufficiently evident that he would have done so had he not been afraid to descend so far from the altitude of his paternal wrath on this evening at about eleven mr kennedy and phineas left the house together and walked from the square through orchard street into oxford street here their ways parted but phineas crossed the road with mr kennedy as he was making some reply to a second invitation to loughlinter phineas considering what had been said before on the subject thought that the invitation came late and that it was not warmly worded he had therefore declined it and was in the act of declining it when he crossed the road with mr kennedy in walking down orchard street from the square he had seen two men standing in the shadow a few yards up a mews or small alley that was there but had thought nothing of them it was just that period of the year when there is hardly any of the darkness of night but at this moment there were symptoms of coming rain and heavy drops began to fall and there were big clouds coming and going before the young moon mr kennedy had said that he would get a cab but he had seen none as he crossed oxford street and had put up his umbrella as he made his way towards park street phineas as he left him distinctly perceived the same two figures on the other side of oxford street and then turning into the shadow of a butchers porch he saw them cross the street in the wake of mr kennedy it was now raining in earnest and the few passengers who were out were scudding away quickly this way and that  it hardly occurred to phineas to think that any danger was imminent to mr kennedy from the men but it did occur to him that he might as well take some notice of the matter phineas knew that mr kennedy would make his way down park street that being his usual route from portman square towards his own home and knew also that he himself could again come across mr kennedys track by going down north audley street to the corner of grosvenor square and thence by brook street into park street without much thought therefore he went out of his own course down to the corner of the square hurrying his steps till he was running and then ran along brook street thinking as he went of some special word that he might say to mr kennedy as an excuse should he again come across his late companion he reached the corner of park street before that gentleman could have been there unless he also had run but just in time to see him as he was coming onand also to see in the dark glimmering of the slight uncertain moonlight that the two men were behind him he retreated a step backwards in the corner resolving that when mr kennedy came up they two would go on together for now it was clear that mr kennedy was followed but mr kennedy did not reach the corner when he was within two doors of it one of the men had followed him up quickly and had thrown something round his throat from behind him phineas understood well now that his friend was in the act of being garrotted and that his instant assistance was needed he rushed forward and as the second ruffian had been close upon the footsteps of the first there was almost instantaneously a concourse of the four men but there was no fight the man who had already nearly succeeded in putting mr kennedy on to his back made no attempt to seize his prey when he found that so unwelcome an addition had joined the party but instantly turned to fly his companion was turning also but phineas was too quick for him and having seized on to his collar held to him with all his power dash it all said the man didnt yer see as how i was ahurrying up to help the genleman myself phineas however hadnt seen this and held on gallantly and in a couple of minutes the first ruffian was back again upon the spot in the custody of a policeman youve done it uncommon neat sir said the policeman complimenting phineas upon his performance if the genleman aint none the worst for it itll have been a very pretty evenings amusement mr kennedy was now leaning against the railings and hitherto had been unable to declare whether he was really injured or not and it was not till a second policeman came up that the hero of the night was at liberty to attend closely to his friend  mr kennedy when he was able to speak declared that for a minute or two he had thought that his neck had been broken and he was not quite convinced till he found himself in his own house that nothing more serious had really happened to him than certain bruises round his throat the policeman was for a while anxious that at any rate phineas should go with him to the policeoffice but at last consented to take the addresses of the two gentlemen when he found that mr kennedy was a member of parliament and that he was designated as right honourable his respect for the garrotter became more great and he began to feel that the night was indeed a night of great importance he expressed unbounded admiration at mr finns success in his own line and made repeated promises that the men should be forthcoming on the morrow could a cab be got of course a cab could be got a cab was got and within a quarter of an hour of the making of the attack the two members of parliament were on their way to grosvenor place  there was hardly a word spoken in the cab for mr kennedy was in pain when however they reached the door in grosvenor place phineas wanted to go and leave his friend with the servants but this the cabinet minister would not allow of course you must see my wife he said so they went upstairs into the drawingroom and then upon the stairs by the lights of the house phineas could perceive that his companions face was bruised and black with dirt and that his cravat was gone  i have been garrotted said the cabinet minister to his wife  what  simply thator should have been if he had not been there how he came there god only knows  the wifes anxiety and then her gratitude need hardly be describednor the astonishment of the husband which by no means decreased on reflection at the opportune reappearance in the nick of time of the man whom three minutes before the attack he had left in the act of going in the opposite direction  i had seen the men and thought it best to run round by the corner of grosvenor square said phineas  may god bless you said lady laura  amen said the cabinet minister  i think he was born to be my friend said lady laura  the cabinet minister said nothing more that night he was never given to much talking and the little accident which had just occurred to him did not tend to make words easy to him but he pressed our heros hand and lady laura said that of course phineas would come to them on the morrow phineas remarked that his first business must be to go to the policeoffice but he promised that he would come down to grosvenor place immediately afterwards then lady laura also pressed his hand and looked she looked i think as though she thought that phineas would only have done right had he repeated the offence which he had committed under the waterfall of loughlinter  garrotted said lord chiltern when phineas told him the story before they went to bed that night he had been smoking sipping brandyandwater and waiting for finns return robert kennedy garrotted  the fellow was in the act of doing it  and you stopped him  yesi got there just in time wasnt it lucky  you ought to be garrotted yourself i should have lent the man a hand had i been there  how can you say anything so horrible but you are drinking too much old fellow and i shall lock the bottle up  if there were no one in london drank more than i do the wine merchants would have a bad time of it and so the new cabinet minister has been garrotted in the street of course im sorry for poor lauras sake  luckily hes not much the worse for itonly a little bruised  i wonder whether its on the cards he should be improved by itworse except in the way of being strangled he could not be however as hes my brotherinlaw im obliged to you for rescuing him come ill go to bed i must say if he was to be garrotted i should like to have been there to see it that was the manner in which lord chiltern received the tidings of the terrible accident which had occurred to his near relative     chapter xxxi  finn for loughton   by three oclock in the day after the little accident which was told in the last chapter all the world knew that mr kennedy the new cabinet minister had been garrotted or half garrotted and that that child of fortune phineas finn had dropped upon the scene out of heaven at the exact moment of time had taken the two garrotters prisoners and saved the cabinet ministers neck and valuablesif not his life bedad said laurence fitzgibbon when he came to hear this that fellowll marry an heiress and be secretary for oireland yet a good deal was said about it to phineas at the clubs but a word or two that was said to him by violet effingham was worth all the rest why what a paladin you are but you succour men in distress instead of maidens thats my bad luck said phineas the other will come no doubt in time violet replied and then youll get your reward he knew that such words from a girl mean nothingespecially from such a girl as violet effingham but nevertheless they were very pleasant to him  of course you will come to us at loughlinter when parliament is up lady laura said the same day  i dont know really you see i must go over to ireland about my reelection  what has that to do with it you are only making out excuses we go down on the first of july and the english elections wont begin till the middle of the month it will be august before the men of loughshane are ready for you  to tell you the truth lady laura said phineas i doubt whether the men of loughshaneor rather the man of loughshane will have anything more to say to me  what man do you mean  lord tulla he was in a passion with his brother before and i got the advantage of it since that he has paid his brothers debts for the fifteenth time and of course is ready to fight any battle for the forgiven prodigal things are not as they were and my father tells me that he thinks i shall be beaten  that is bad news  it is what i have a right to expect  every word of information that had come to phineas about loughshane since mr mildmay had decided upon a dissolution had gone towards making him feel at first that there was a great doubt as to his reelection and at last that there was almost a certainty against him and as these tidings reached him they made him very unhappy since he had been in parliament he had very frequently regretted that he had left the shades of the inns of court for the glare of westminster and he had more than once made up his mind that he would desert the glare and return to the shade but now when the moment came in which such desertion seemed to be compulsory on him when there would be no longer a choice the seat in parliament was dearer to him than ever if he had gone of his own free willso he told himselfthere would have been something of nobility in such going mr low would have respected him and even mrs low might have taken him back to the friendship of her severe bosom but he would go back now as a cur with his tail between his legskicked out as it were from parliament returning to lincolns inn soiled with failure having accomplished nothing having broken down on the only occasion on which he had dared to show himself on his legs not having opened a single useful book during the two years in which he had sat in parliament burdened with laurence fitzgibbons debt and not quite free from debt of his own how could he start himself in any way by which he might even hope to win success he must he told himself give up all thought of practising in london and betake himself to dublin he could not dare to face his friends in london as a young briefless barrister  on this evening the evening subsequent to that on which mr kennedy had been attacked the house was sitting in committee of ways and means and there came on a discussion as to a certain vote for the army it had been known that there would be such discussion and mr monk having heard from phineas a word or two now and again about the potted peas had recommended him to be ready with a few remarks if he wished to support the government in the matter of that vote phineas did so wish having learned quite enough in the committee room upstairs to make him believe that a large importation of the potted peas from holstein would not be for the advantage of the army or navyor for that of the country at large mr monk had made his suggestion without the slightest allusion to the former failurejust as though phineas were a practised speaker accustomed to be on his legs three or four times a week if i find a chance i will said phineas taking the advice just as it was given  soon after prayers a word was said in the house as to the illfortune which had befallen the new cabinet minister mr daubeny had asked mr mildmay whether violent hands had not been laid in the dead of night on the sacred throatthe throat that should have been sacredof the new chancellor of the duchy of lancaster and had expressed regret that the ministrywhich was he feared in other respects somewhat infirmshould now have been further weakened by this injury to that new bulwark with which it had endeavoured to support itself the prime minister answering his old rival in the same strain said that the calamity might have been very severe both to the country and to the cabinet but that fortunately for the community at large a gallant young member of that houseand he was proud to say a supporter of the governmenthad appeared upon the spot at the nick of timeas a god out of a machine said mr daubeny interrupting himby no means as a god out of a machine continued mr mildmay but as a real help in a very real trouble and succeeded not only in saving my right honourable friend the chancellor of the duchy but in arresting the two malefactors who attempted to rob him in the street then there was a cry of name and mr mildmay of course named the member for loughshane it so happened that phineas was not in the house but he heard it all when he came down to attend the committee of ways and means  then came on the discussion about provisions in the army the subject being mooted by one of mr turnbulls close allies the gentleman on the other side of the house who had moved for the potted peas committee was silent on the occasion having felt that the result of that committee had not been exactly what he had expected the evidence respecting such of the holstein potted peas as had been used in this country was not very favourable to them but nevertheless the rebound from that committeethe very fact that such a committee had been made to sitgave ground for a hostile attack to attack is so easy when a complete refutation barely suffices to save the minister attackeddoes not suffice to save him from future dim memories of something having been wrongand brings down no disgrace whatsoever on the promoter of the false charge the promoter of the false charge simply expresses his gratification at finding that he had been misled by erroneous information it is not customary for him to express gratification at the fact that out of all the mud which he has thrown some will probably stick phineas when the time came did get on his legs and spoke perhaps two or three dozen words the doing so seemed to come to him quite naturally he had thought very little about it beforehandhaving resolved not to think of it and indeed the occasion was one of no great importance the speaker was not in the chair and the house was thin and he intended to make no speechmerely to say something which he had to say till he had finished he hardly remembered that he was doing that in attempting to do which he had before failed so egregiously it was not till he sat down that he began to ask himself whether the scene was swimming before his eyes as it had done on former occasions as it had done even when he had so much as thought of making a speech now he was astonished at the easiness of the thing and as he left the house told himself that he had overcome the difficulty just when the victory could be of no avail to him had he been more eager more constant in his purpose he might at any rate have shown the world that he was fit for the place which he had presumed to take before he was cast out of it  on the next morning he received a letter from his father dr finn had seen lord tulla having been sent for to relieve his lordship in a fit of the gout and had been informed by the earl that he meant to fight the borough to the last manhad he said to the last shilling he would have spoken with perhaps more accuracy you see doctor your son has had it for two years as you may say for nothing and i think he ought to give way he cant expect that hes to go on there as though it were his own and then his lordship upon whom this touch of the gout had come somewhat sharply expressed himself with considerable animation the old doctor behaved with much spirit i told the earl he said that i could not undertake to say what you might do but that as you had come forward at first with my sanction i could not withdraw it now he asked me if i should support you with money i said that i should to a moderate extent by g said the earl a moderate extent will go a very little way i can tell you since that he has had duggin with him so i suppose i shall not see him any more you can do as you please now but from what i hear i fear you will have no chance then with much bitterness of spirit phineas resolved that he would not interfere with lord tulla at loughshane he would go at once to the reform club and explain his reasons to barrington erle and others there who would be interested  but he first went to grosvenor place here he was shown up into mr kennedys room mr kennedy was up and seated in an armchair by an open window looking over into the queens garden but he was in his dressinggown and was to be regarded as an invalid and indeed as he could not turn his neck or thought that he could not do so he was not very fit to go out about his work let us hope that the affairs of the duchy of lancaster did not suffer materially by his absence we may take it for granted that with a man so sedulous as to all his duties there was no arrear of work when the accident took place he put out his hand to phineas and said some word in a whispersome word or two among which phineas caught the sound of potted peasand then continued to look out of the window there are men who are utterly prostrated by any bodily ailment and it seemed that mr kennedy was one of them phineas who was full of his own bad news had intended to tell his sad story at once but he perceived that the neck of the chancellor of the duchy was too stiff to allow of his taking any interest in external matters and so he refrained what does the doctor say about it said phineas perceiving that just for the present there could be only one possible subject for remark mr kennedy was beginning to describe in a long whisper what the doctor did think about it when lady laura came into the room  of course they began at first to talk about mr kennedy it would not have been kind to him not to have done so and lady laura made much of the injury as it behoves a wife to do in such circumstances for the sake both of the sufferer and of the hero she declared her conviction that had phineas been a moment later her husbands neck would have been irredeemably broken  i dont think they ever do kill the people said phineas at any rate they dont mean to do so  i thought they did said lady laura  i fancy not said phineas eager in the cause of truth  i think this man was very clumsy whispered mr kennedy  perhaps he was a beginner said phineas and that may make a difference if so im afraid we have interfered with his education  then by degrees the conversation got away to other things and lady laura asked him after loughshane ive made up my mind to give it up said he smiling as he spoke  i was afraid there was but a bad chance said lady laura smiling also  my father has behaved so well said phineas he has written to say hell find the money if i determine to contest the borough i mean to write to him by tonights post to decline the offer i have no right to spend the money and i shouldnt succeed if i did spend it of course it makes me a little down in the mouth and then he smiled again  ive got a plan of my own said lady laura  what plan  or rather it isnt mine but papas old mr standish is going to give up loughton and papa wants you to come and try your luck there  lady laura  it isnt quite a certainty you know but i suppose its as near a certainty as anything left and this came from a strong radical reformer  lady laura i couldnt accept such a favour from your father then mr kennedy nodded his head very slightly and whispered yes yes i couldnt think of it said phineas finn i have no right to such a favour  that is a matter entirely for papas consideration said lady laura with an affectation of solemnity in her voice i think it has always been felt that any politician may accept such an offer as that when it is made to him but that no politician should ask for it my father feels that he has to do the best he can with his influence in the borough and therefore he comes to you  it isnt that said phineas somewhat rudely  of course private feelings have their weight said lady laura it is not probable that papa would have gone to a perfect stranger and perhaps mr finn i may own that mr kennedy and i would both be very sorry that you should not be in the house and that that feeling on our part has had some weight with my father  of course youll stand whispered mr kennedy still looking straight out of the window as though the slightest attempt to turn his neck would be fraught with danger to himself and the duchy  papa has desired me to ask you to call upon him said lady laura i dont suppose there is very much to be said as each of you know so well the others way of thinking but you had better see him today or tomorrow  of course phineas was persuaded before he left mr kennedys room indeed when he came to think of it there appeared to him to be no valid reason why he should not sit for loughton the favour was of a kind that had prevailed from time out of mind in england between the most respectable of the great land magnates and young rising liberal politicians burke fox and canning had all been placed in parliament by similar influence of course he phineas finn desired earnestlylonged in his very heart of heartsto extinguish all such parliamentary influence to root out for ever the last vestige of close borough nominations but while the thing remained it was better that the thing should contribute to the liberal than to the conservative strength of the houseand if to the liberal how was this to be achieved but by the acceptance of such influence by some liberal candidate and if it were right that it should be accepted by any liberal candidatethen why not by him the logic of this argument seemed to him to be perfect he felt something like a sting of reproach as he told himself that in truth this great offer was made to him not on account of the excellence of his politics but because he had been instrumental in saving lord brentfords soninlaw from the violence of garrotters but he crushed these qualms of conscience as being overscrupulous and as he told himself not practical you must take the world as you find it with a struggle to be something more honest than those around you phineas as he preached to himself this sermon declared to himself that they who attempted more than this flew too high in the clouds to be of service to men and women upon earth  as he did not see lord brentford that day he postponed writing to his father for twentyfour hours on the following morning he found the earl at home in portman square having first discussed the matter fully with lord chiltern do not scruple about me said lord chiltern you are quite welcome to the borough for me  but if i did not stand would you do so there are so many reasons which ought to induce you to accept a seat in parliament  whether that be true or not phineas i shall not accept my fathers interest at loughton unless it be offered to me in a way in which it never will be offered you know me well enough to be sure that i shall not change my mind nor will he and therefore you may go down to loughton with a pure conscience as far as i am concerned  phineas had his interview with the earl and in ten minutes everything was settled on his way to portman square there had come across his mind the idea of a grand effort of friendship what if he could persuade the father so to conduct himself towards his son that the son should consent to be a member for the borough and he did say a word or two to this effect setting forth that lord chiltern would condescend to become a legislator if only his father would condescend to acknowledge his sons fitness for such work without any comments on the sons past life but the earl simply waived the subject away with his hand he could be as obstinate as his son lady laura had been the mercury between them on this subject and lady laura had failed he would not now consent to employ another mercury very littlehardly a word indeedwas said between the earl and phineas about politics phineas was to be the saulsby candidate at loughton for the next election and was to come to saulsby with the kennedys from loughlintereither with the kennedys or somewhat in advance of them i do not say that there will be no opposition said the earl but i expect none he was very courteousnay he was kind feeling doubtless that his family owed a great debt of gratitude to the young man with whom he was conversing but nevertheless there was not absent on his part a touch of that high condescension which perhaps might be thought to become the earl the cabinet minister and the great borough patron phineas who was sensitive felt this and winced he had never quite liked lord brentford and could not bring himself to do so now in spite of the kindness which the earl was showing him  but he was very happy when he sat down to write to his father from the club his father had told him that the money should be forthcoming for the election at loughshane if he resolved to stand but that the chance of success would be very slightindeed that in his opinion there would be no chance of success nevertheless his father had evidently believed when writing that phineas would not abandon his seat without a useless and expensive contest he now thanked his father with many expressions of gratitudedeclared his conviction that his father was right about lord tulla and then in the most modest language that he could use went on to say that he had found another borough open to him in england he was going to stand for loughton with the assistance of lord brentford and thought that the election would probably not cost him above a couple of hundred pounds at the outside then he wrote a very pretty note to lord tulla thanking him for his former kindness and telling the irish earl that it was not his intention to interfere with the borough of loughshane at the next election  a few days after this phineas was very much surprised at a visit that was made to him at his lodgings mr clarkson after that scene in the lobby of the house called again in great marlborough streetand was admitted you had better let him sit in your armchair for half an hour or so fitzgibbon had said and phineas almost believed that it would be better the man was a terrible nuisance to him and he was beginning to think that he had better undertake to pay the debt by degrees it was he knew quite on the cards that mr clarkson should have him arrested while at saulsby since that scene in the lobby mr clarkson had been with him twice and there had been a preliminary conversation as to real payment mr clarkson wanted a hundred pounds down and another bill for two hundred and twenty at three months date think of my time and trouble in coming here mr clarkson had urged when phineas had objected to these terms think of my time and trouble and do be punctual mr finn phineas had offered him ten pounds a quarter the payments to be marked on the back of the bill a tender which mr clarkson had not seemed to regard as strong evidence of punctuality he had not been angry but had simply expressed his intention of calling againgiving phineas to understand that business would probably take him to the west of ireland in the autumn if only business might not take him down either to loughlinter or to saulsby but the strange visitor who came to phineas in the midst of these troubles put an end to them all  the strange visitor was miss aspasia fitzgibbon youll be very much surprised at my coming to your chambers no doubt she said as she sat down in the chair which phineas placed for her phineas could only say that he was very proud to be so highly honoured and that he hoped she was well pretty well i thank you i have just come about a little business mr finn and i hope youll excuse me  im quite sure that there is no need for excuses said phineas  laurence when he hears about it will say that ive been an impertinent old fool but i never care what laurence says either this way or that ive been to that mr clarkson mr finn and ive paid him the money  no said phineas  but i have mr finn i happened to hear what occurred that night at the door of the house of commons  who told you miss fitzgibbon  never mind who told me i heard it i knew before that you had been foolish enough to help laurence about money and so i put two and two together it isnt the first time i have had to do with mr clarkson so i sent to him and ive bought the bill there it is and miss fitzgibbon produced the document which bore the name of phineas finn across the front of it  and did you pay him two hundred and fifty pounds for it  not quite i had a very hard tussle and got it at last for two hundred and twenty pounds  and did you do it yourself  all myself if i had employed a lawyer i should have had to pay two hundred and forty pounds and five pounds for costs and now mr finn i hope you wont have any more money engagements with my brother laurence phineas said that he thought he might promise that he would have no more because if you do i shant interfere if laurence began to find that he could get money out of me in that way there would be no end to it mr clarkson would very soon be spending his spare time in my drawingroom goodbye mr finn if laurence says anything just tell him that hed better come to me then phineas was left looking at the bill it was certainly a great relief to himthat he should be thus secured from the domiciliary visits of mr clarkson a great relief to him to be assured that mr clarkson would not find him out down at loughton but nevertheless he had to suffer a pang of shame as he felt that miss fitzgibbon had become acquainted with his poverty and had found herself obliged to satisfy his pecuniary liabilities     chapter xxxii  lady laura kennedys headache   phineas went down to loughlinter early in july taking loughton in his way he stayed there one night at the inn and was introduced to sundry influential inhabitants of the borough by mr grating the ironmonger who was known by those who knew loughton to be a very strong supporter of the earls interest mr grating and about half a dozen others of the tradesmen of the town came to the inn and met phineas in the parlour he told them he was a good sound liberal and a supporter of mr mildmays government of which their neighbour the earl was so conspicuous an ornament this was almost all that was said about the earl out loud but each individual man of loughton then present took an opportunity during the meeting of whispering into mr finns ear a word or two to show that he also was admitted to the secret councils of the boroughthat he too could see the inside of the arrangement of course we must support the earl one said never mind what you hear about a tory candidate mr finn whispered a second the earl can do what he pleases here and it seemed to phineas that it was thought by them all to be rather a fine thing to be thus held in the hand by an english nobleman phineas could not but reflect much upon this as he lay in his bed at the loughton inn the great political question on which the political world was engrossed up in london was the enfranchisement of englishmenof englishmen down to the rank of artisans and labourersand yet when he found himself in contact with individual englishmen with men even very much above the artisan and the labourer he found that they rather liked being bound hand and foot and being kept as tools in the political pocket of a rich man every one of those loughton tradesmen was proud of his own personal subjection to the earl  from loughton he went to loughlinter having promised to be back in the borough for the election mr grating would propose him and he was to be seconded by mr shortribs the butcher and grazier mention had been made of a conservative candidate and mr shortribs had seemed to think that a good standup fight upon english principles with a clear understanding of course that victory should prevail on the liberal side would be a good thing for the borough but the earls man of business saw phineas on the morning of his departure and told him not to regard mr shortribs theyd all like it said the man of business and i daresay theyll have enough of it when this reform bill is passed but at present no one will be fool enough to come and spend his money here we have them all in hand too well for that mr finn  he found the great house at loughlinter nearly empty mr kennedys mother was there and lord brentford was there and lord brentfords private secretary and mr kennedys private secretary at present that was the entire party lady baldock was expected there with her daughter and violet effingham but as well as phineas could learn they would not be at loughlinter until after he had left it there had come up lately a rumour that there would be an autumn sessionthat the houses would sit through october and a part of november in order that mr mildmay might try the feeling of the new parliament if this were to be so phineas had resolved that in the event of his election at loughton he would not return to ireland till after this autumn session should be over he gave an account to the earl in the presence of the earls soninlaw of what had taken place at loughton and the earl expressed himself as satisfied it was manifestly a great satisfaction to lord brentford that he should still have a borough in his pocket and the more so because there were so very few noblemen left who had such property belonging to them he was very careful in his speech never saying in so many words that the privilege of returning a member was his own but his meaning was not the less clear  those were dreary days at loughlinter there was fishingif phineas chose to fish and he was told that he could shoot a deer if he was minded to go out alone but it seemed as though it were the intention of the host that his guests should spend their time profitably mr kennedy himself was shut up with books and papers all the morning and always took up a book after dinner the earl also would read a littleand then would sleep a good deal old mrs kennedy slept also and lady laura looked as though she would like to sleep if it were not that her husbands eye was upon her as it was she administered tea mr kennedy not liking the practice of having it handed round by a servant when none were there but members of the family circle and she read novels phineas got hold of a stiff bit of reading for himself and tried to utilise his time he took alison in hand and worked his way gallantly through a couple of volumes but even he more than once or twice found himself on the very verge of slumber then he would wake up and try to think about things why was he phineas finn an irishman from killaloe living in that great house of loughlinter as though he were one of the family striving to kill the hours and feeling that he was in some way subject to the dominion of his host would it not be better for him to get up and go away in his heart of hearts he did not like mr kennedy though he believed him to be a good man and of what service to him was it to like lady laura now that lady laura was a possession in the hands of mr kennedy then he would tell himself that he owed his position in the world entirely to lady laura and that he was ungrateful to feel himself ever dull in her society and moreover there was something to be done in the world beyond making love and being merry mr kennedy could occupy himself with a blue book for hours together without wincing so phineas went to work again with his alison and read away till he nodded  in those days he often wandered up and down the linter and across the moor to the linn and so down to the lake he would take a book with him and would seat himself down on spots which he loved and would pretend to readbut i do not think that he got much advantage from his book he was thinking of his life and trying to calculate whether the wonderful success which he had achieved would ever be of permanent value to him would he be nearer to earning his bread when he should be member for loughton than he had been when he was member for loughshane or was there before him any slightest probability that he would ever earn his bread and then he thought of violet effingham and was angry with himself for remembering at that moment that violet effingham was the mistress of a large fortune  once before when he was sitting beside the linter he had made up his mind to declare his passion to lady lauraand he had done so on the very spot now within a twelvemonth of that time he made up his mind on the same spot to declare his passion to miss effingham and he thought his best mode of carrying his suit would be to secure the assistance of lady laura lady laura no doubt had been very anxious that her brother should marry violet but lord chiltern as phineas knew had asked for violets hand twice in vain and moreover chiltern himself had declared to phineas that he would never ask for it again lady laura who was always reasonable would surely perceive that there was no hope of success for her brother that chiltern would quarrel with himwould quarrel with him to the knifehe did not doubt but he felt that no fear of such a quarrel as that should deter him he loved violet effingham and he must indeed be pusillanimous if loving her as he did he was deterred from expressing his love from any fear of a suitor whom she did not favour he would not willingly be untrue to his friendship for lady lauras brother had there been a chance for lord chiltern he would have abstained from putting himself forward but what was the use of his abstaining when by doing so he could in no wise benefit his friendwhen the result of his doing so would be that some interloper would come in and carry off the prize he would explain all this to lady laura and if the prize would be kind to him he would disregard the anger of lord chiltern even though it might be anger to the knife  as he was thinking of all this lady laura stood before him where he was sitting at the top of the falls at this moment he remembered well all the circumstances of the scene when he had been there with her at his last visit to loughlinter how things had changed since then then he had loved lady laura with all his heart and he had now already brought himself to regard her as a discreet matron whom to love would be almost as unreasonable as though he were to entertain a passion for the lord chancellor the reader will understand how thorough had been the cure effected by lady lauras marriage and the interval of a few months when the swain was already prepared to make this lady the depositary of his confidence in another matter of love you are often here i suppose said lady laura looking down upon him as he sat upon the rock  wellyes not very often i come here sometimes because the view down upon the lake is so fine  it is the prettiest spot about the place i hardly ever get here now indeed this is only the second time that i have been up since we have been at home and then i came to bring papa here there was a little wooden seat near to the rock upon which phineas had been lying and upon this lady laura sat down phineas with his eyes turned upon the lake was considering how he might introduce the subject of his love for violet effingham but he did not find the matter very easy he had just resolved to begin by saying that violet would certainly never accept lord chiltern when lady laura spoke a word or two which stopped him altogether how well i remember she said the day when you and i were here last autumn  so do i you told me then that you were going to marry mr kennedy how much has happened since then  much indeed enough for a whole lifetime and yet how slow the time has gone  i do not think it has been slow with me said phineas  no you have been active you have had your hands full of work i am beginning to think that it is a great curse to have been born a woman  and yet i have heard you say that a woman may do as much as a man  that was before i had learned my lesson properly i know better than that now oh dear i have no doubt it is all for the best as it is but i have a kind of wish that i might be allowed to go out and milk the cows  and may you not milk the cows if you wish it lady laura  by no meansnot only not milk them but hardly look at them at any rate i must not talk about them phineas of course understood that she was complaining of her husband and hardly knew how to reply to her he had been sharp enough to perceive already that mr kennedy was an autocrat in his own house and he knew lady laura well enough to be sure that such masterdom would be very irksome to her but he had not imagined that she would complain to him it was so different at saulsby lady laura continued everything there seemed to be my own  and everything here is your own  yesaccording to the prayerbook and everything in truth is my ownas all the dainties at the banquet belonged to sancho the governor  you mean said heand then he hesitated you mean that mr kennedy stands over you guarding you for your own welfare as the doctor stood over sancho and guarded him  there was a pause before she answereda long pause during which he was looking away over the lake and thinking how he might introduce the subject of his love but long as was the pause he had not begun when lady laura was again speaking the truth is my friend she said that i have made a mistake  a mistake  yes phineas a mistake i have blundered as fools blunder thinking that i was clever enough to pick my footsteps aright without asking counsel from any one i have blundered and stumbled and fallen and now i am so bruised that i am not able to stand upon my feet the word that struck him most in all this was his own christian name she had never called him phineas before he was aware that the circle of his acquaintance had fallen into a way of miscalling him by his christian name as one observes to be done now and again in reference to some special young man most of the men whom he called his friends called him phineas even the earl had done so more than once on occasions in which the greatness of his position had dropped for a moment out of his mind mrs low had called him phineas when she regarded him as her husbands most cherished pupil and mrs bunce had called him mr phineas he had always been phineas to everybody at killaloe but still he was quite sure that lady laura had never so called him before nor would she have done so now in her husbands presence he was sure of that also  you mean that you are unhappy he said still looking away from her towards the lake  yes i do mean that though i do not know why i should come and tell you soexcept that i am still blundering and stumbling and have fallen into a way of hurting myself at every step  you can tell no one who is more anxious for your happiness said phineas  that is a very pretty speech but what would you do for my happiness indeed what is it possible that you should do i mean it as no rebuke when i say that my happiness or unhappiness is a matter as to which you will soon become perfectly indifferent  why should you say so lady laura  because it is natural that it should be so you and mr kennedy might have been friends not that you will be because you are unlike each other in all your ways but it might have been so  and are not you and i to be friends he asked  no in a very few months you will not think of telling me what are your desires or what your sorrowsand as for me it will be out of the question that i should tell mine to you how can you be my friend  if you were not quite sure of my friendship lady laura you would not speak to me as you are speaking now still he did not look at her but lay with his face supported on his hands and his eyes turned away upon the lake but she where she was sitting could see him and was aided by her sight in making comparisons in her mind between the two men who had been her loversbetween him whom she had taken and him whom she had left there was something in the hard dry unsympathising unchanging virtues of her husband which almost revolted her he had not a fault but she had tried him at every point and had been able to strike no spark of fire from him even by disobeying she could produce no heatonly an access of firmness how would it have been with her had she thrown all ideas of fortune to the winds and linked her lot to that of the young phoebus who was lying at her feet if she had ever loved any one she had loved him and she had not thrown away her love for money so she swore to herself over and over again trying to console herself in her cold unhappiness she had married a rich man in order that she might be able to do something in the worldand now that she was this rich mans wife she found that she could do nothing the rich man thought it to be quite enough for her to sit at home and look after his welfare in the meantime young phoebusher phoebus as he had been oncewas thinking altogether of some one else  phineas she said slowly i have in you such perfect confidence that i will tell you the truthas one man may tell it to another i wish you would go from here  what at once  not today or tomorrow stay here now till the election but do not return he will ask you to come and press you hard and will be hurtfor strange to say with all his coldness he really likes you he has a pleasure in seeing you here but he must not have that pleasure at the expense of trouble to me  and why is it a trouble to you he asked men are such foolsso awkward so unready with their wits ever behind the occasion by a dozen seconds or so as soon as the words were uttered he knew that they should not have been spoken  because i am a fool she said why else is not that enough for you  laura he said  nono i will have none of that i am a fool but not such a fool as to suppose that any cure is to be found there  only say what i can do for you though it be with my entire life and i will do it  you can do nothingexcept to keep away from me  are you earnest in telling me that now at last he had turned himself round and was looking at her and as he looked he saw the hat of a man appearing up the path and immediately afterwards the face it was the hat and face of the laird of loughlinter here is mr kennedy said phineas in a tone of voice not devoid of dismay and trouble  so i perceive said lady laura but there was no dismay or trouble in the tone of her voice  in the countenance of mr kennedy as he approached closer there was not much to be readonly perhaps some slight addition of gloom or rather perhaps of that frigid propriety of moral demeanour for which he had always been conspicuous which had grown upon him at his marriage and which had been greatly increased by the double action of being made a cabinet minister and being garrotted i am glad that your headache is better he said to his wife who had risen from her seat to meet him phineas also had risen and was now looking somewhat sheepish where he stood  i came out because it was worse she said it irritated me so that i could not stand the house any longer  i will send to callender for dr macnuthrie  pray do nothing of the kind robert i do not want dr macnuthrie at all  where there is illness medical advice is always expedient  i am not ill a headache is not illness  i had thought it was said mr kennedy very drily  at any rate i would rather not have dr macnuthrie  i am sure it cannot do you any good to climb up here in the heat of the sun had you been here long finn  all the morninghere or hereabouts i clambered up from the lake and had a book in my pocket  and you happened to come across him by accident mr kennedy asked there was something so simple in the question that its very simplicity proved that there was no suspicion  yesby chance said lady laura but every one at loughlinter always comes up here if any one ever were missing whom i wanted to find this is where i should look  i am going on towards linter forest to meet blane said mr kennedy blane was the gamekeeper if you dont mind the trouble finn i wish youd take lady laura down to the house do not let her stay out in the heat i will take care that somebody goes over to callender for dr macnuthrie then mr kennedy went on and phineas was left with the charge of taking lady laura back to the house when mr kennedys hat had first appeared coming up the walk phineas had been ready to proclaim himself prepared for any devotion in the service of lady laura indeed he had begun to reply with criminal tenderness to the indiscreet avowal which lady laura had made to him but he felt now after what had just occurred in the husbands presence that any show of tendernessof criminal tendernesswas impossible the absence of all suspicion on the part of mr kennedy had made phineas feel that he was bound by all social laws to refrain from such tenderness lady laura began to descend the path before him without a wordand went on and on as though she would have reached the house without speaking had he not addressed her does your head still pain you he asked  of course it does  i suppose he is right in saying that you should not be out in the heat  i do not know it is not worth while to think about that he sends me in and so of course i must go and he tells you to take me and so of course you must take me  would you wish that i should let you go alone  yes i would only he will be sure to find it out and you must not tell him that you left me at my request  do you think that i am afraid of him said phineas  yesi think you are i know that i am and that papa is and that his mother hardly dares to call her soul her own i do not know why you should escape  mr kennedy is nothing to me  he is something to me and so i suppose i had better go on and now i shall have that horrid man from the little town pawing me and covering everything with snuff and bidding me take scotch physicwhich seems to increase in quantity and nastiness as doses in england decrease and he will stand over me to see that i take it  whatthe doctor from callender  nobut mr kennedy will if he advised me to have a hole in my glove mended he would ask me before he went to bed whether it was done he never forgot anything in his life and was never unmindful of anything that i think will do mr finn you have brought me out from the trees and that may be taken as bringing me home we shall hardly get scolded if we part here remember what i told you up above and remember also that it is in your power to do nothing else for me goodbye so he turned away towards the lake and let lady laura go across the wide lawn to the house by herself  he had failed altogether in his intention of telling his friend of his love for violet and had come to perceive that he could not for the present carry out that intention after what had passed it would be impossible for him to go to lady laura with a passionate tale of his longing for violet effingham if he were even to speak to her of love at all it must be quite of another love than that but he never would speak to her of love noras he felt quite surewould she allow him to do so but what astounded him most as he thought of the interview which had just passed was the fact that the lady laura whom he had knownwhom he had thought he had knownshould have become so subject to such a man as mr kennedy a man whom he had despised as being weak irresolute and without a purpose for the day or two that he remained at loughlinter he watched the family closely and became aware that lady laura had been right when she declared that her father was afraid of mr kennedy  i shall follow you almost immediately said the earl confidentially to phineas when the candidate for the borough took his departure from loughlinter i dont like to be there just when the election is going on but ill be at saulsby to receive you the day afterwards  phineas took his leave from mr kennedy with a warm expression of friendship on the part of his host and from lady laura with a mere touch of the hand he tried to say a word but she was sullen or if not she put on some mood like to sullenness and said never a word to him  on the day after the departure of phineas finn for loughton lady laura kennedy still had a headache she had complained of a headache ever since she had been at loughlinter and dr macnuthrie had been over more than once i wonder what it is that ails you said her husband standing over her in her own sittingroom upstairs it was a pretty room looking away to the mountains with just a glimpse of the lake to be caught from the window and it had been prepared for her with all the skill and taste of an accomplished upholsterer she had selected the room for herself soon after her engagement and had thanked her future husband with her sweetest smile for giving her the choice she had thanked him and told him that she always meant to be happyso happy in that room he was a man not much given to romance but he thought of this promise as he stood over her and asked after her health as far as he could see she had never been even comfortable since she had been at loughlinter a shadow of the truth came across his mind perhaps his wife was bored if so what was to be the future of his life and of hers he went up to london every year and to parliament as a duty and then during some period of the recess would have his house full of guestsas another duty but his happiness was to consist in such hours as these which seemed to inflict upon his wife the penalty of a continual headache a shadow of the truth came upon him what if his wife did not like living quietly at home as the mistress of her husbands house what if a headache was always to be the result of a simple performance of domestic duties  more than a shadow of truth had come upon lady laura herself the dark cloud created by the entire truth was upon her making everything black and wretched around her she had asked herself a question or two and had discovered that she had no love for her husband that the kind of life which he intended to exact from her was insupportable to her and that she had blundered and fallen in her entrance upon life she perceived that her father had already become weary of mr kennedy and that lonely and sad as he would be at saulsby by himself it was his intention to repudiate the idea of making a home at loughlinter yesshe would be deserted by everyone except of course by her husband and then then she would throw herself on some early morning into the lake for life would be insupportable  i wonder what it is that ails you said mr kennedy  nothing serious one cant always help having a headache you know  i dont think you take enough exercise laura i would propose that you should walk four miles every day after breakfast i will always be ready to accompany you i have spoken to dr macnuthrie  i hate dr macnuthrie  why should you hate dr macnuthrie laura  how can i tell why i do that is quite reason enough why you should not send for him to me  you are unreasonable laura one chooses a doctor on account of his reputation in his profession and that of dr macnuthrie stands high  i do not want any doctor  but if you are ill my dear  i am not ill  but you said you had a headache you have said so for the last ten days  having a headache is not being ill i only wish you would not talk of it and then perhaps i should get rid of it  i cannot believe that headache in nine cases out of ten comes from the stomach though he said thissaying it because it was the commonplace commonsense sort of thing to say still at the very moment there was the shadow of the truth before his eyes what if this headache meant simple dislike to him and to his modes of life  it is nothing of that sort said lady laura impatient at having her ailment inquired into with so much accuracy  then what is it you cannot think that i can be happy to hear you complaining of headache every daymaking it an excuse for absolute idleness  what is it that you want me to do she said jumping up from her seat set me a task and if i dont go mad over it ill get through it there are the account books give them to me i dont suppose i can see the figures but ill try to see them  laura this is unkind of youand ungrateful  of courseit is everything that is bad what a pity that you did not find it out last year oh dear oh dear what am i to do then she threw herself down upon the sofa and put both her hands up to her temples  i will send for dr macnuthrie at once said mr kennedy walking towards the door very slowly and speaking as slowly as he walked  nodo no such thing she said springing to her feet again and intercepting him before he reached the door if he comes i will not see him i give you my word that i will not speak to him if he comes you do not understand she said you do not understand at all  what is it that i ought to understand he asked  that a woman does not like to be bothered  he made no reply at once but stood there twisting the handle of the door and collecting his thoughts yes said he at last i am beginning to find that outand to find out also what it is that bothers a woman as you call it i can see now what it is that makes your head ache it is not the stomach you are quite right there it is the prospect of a quiet decent life to which would be attached the performance of certain homely duties dr macnuthrie is a learned man but i doubt whether he can do anything for such a malady  you are quite right robert he can do nothing  it is a malady you must cure for yourself lauraand which is to be cured by perseverance if you can bring yourself to try  but i cannot bring myself to try at all she said  do you mean to tell me laura that you will make no effort to do your duty as my wife  i mean to tell you that i will not try to cure a headache by doing sums that is all that i mean to say at this moment if you will leave me for awhile so that i may lie down perhaps i shall be able to come to dinner he still hesitated standing with the door in his hand but if you go on scolding me she continued what i shall do is to go to bed directly you go away he hesitated for a moment longer and then left the room without another word     chapter xxxiii  mr slides grievance   our hero was elected member for loughton without any trouble to him or as far as he could see to any one else he made one speech from a small raised booth that was called a platform and that was all that he was called upon to do mr grating made a speech in proposing him and mr shortribs another in seconding him and these were all the speeches that were required the thing seemed to be so very easy that he was afterwards almost offended when he was told that the bill for so insignificant a piece of work came to ¬£247 13s 9d he had seen no occasion for spending even the odd fortyseven pounds but then he was member for loughton and as he passed the evening alone at the inn having dined in company with messrs grating shortribs and sundry other influential electors he began to reflect that after all it was not so very great a thing to be a member of parliament it almost seemed that that which had come to him so easily could not be of much value  on the following day he went to the castle and was there when the earl arrived they two were alone together and the earl was very kind to him so you had no opponent after all said the great man of loughton with a slight smile  not the ghost of another candidate  i did not think there would be they have tried it once or twice and have always failed there are only one or two in the place who like to go one way just because their neighbours go the other but in truth there is no conservative feeling in the place  phineas although he was at the present moment the member for loughton himself could not but enjoy the joke of this could there be any liberal feeling in such a place or indeed any political feeling whatsoever would not messrs grating and shortribs have done just the same had it happened that lord brentford had been a tory peer they all seemed to be very obliging said phineas in answer to the earl  yes they are there isnt a house in the town you know let for longer than seven years and most of them merely from year to year and do you know i havent a farmer on the property with a leasenot one and they dont want leases they know theyre safe but i do like the people round me to be of the same way of thinking as myself about politics  on the second day after dinnerthe last evening of finns visit to saulsbythe earl fell suddenly into a confidential conversation about his daughter and his son and about violet effingham so sudden indeed and so confidential was the conversation that phineas was almost silenced for awhile a word or two had been said about loughlinter of the beauty of the place and of the vastness of the property i am almost afraid said lord brentford that laura is not happy there  i hope she is said phineas  he is so hard and dry and what i call exacting that is just the word for it now laura has never been used to that with me she always had her own way in everything and i always found her fit to have it i do not understand why her husband should treat her differently  perhaps it is the temper of the man  temper yes but what a bad prospect is that for her and she too has a temper and so he will find if he tries her too far i cannot stand loughlinter i told laura so fairly it is one of those houses in which a man cannot call his hours his own i told laura that i could not undertake to remain there for above a day or two  it is very sad said phineas  yes indeed it is sad for her poor girl and very sad for me too i have no one else but lauraliterally no one and now i am divided from her it seems that she has been taken as much away from me as though her husband lived in china i have lost them both now  i hope not my lord  i say i have as to chiltern i can perceive that he becomes more and more indifferent to me every day he thinks of me only as a man in his way who must die some day and may die soon  you wrong him lord brentford  i do not wrong him at all why has he answered every offer i have made him with so much insolence as to make it impossible for me to put myself into further communion with him  he thinks that you have wronged him  yesbecause i have been unable to shut my eyes to his mode of living i was to go on paying his debts and taking no other notice whatsoever of his conduct  i do not think he is in debt now  because his sister the other day spent every shilling of her fortune in paying them she gave him ¬£40000 do you think she would have married kennedy but for that i dont i could not prevent her i had said that i would not cripple my remaining years of life by raising the money and i could not go back from my word  you and chiltern might raise the money between you  it would do no good now she has married mr kennedy and the money is nothing to her or to him chiltern might have put things right by marrying miss effingham if he pleased  i think he did his best there  nohe did his worst he asked her to be his wife as a man asks for a railwayticket or a pair of gloves which he buys with a price and because she would not jump into his mouth he gave it up i dont believe he even really wanted to marry her i suppose he has some disreputable connection to prevent it  nothing of the kind he would marry her tomorrow if he could my belief is that miss effingham is sincere in refusing him  i dont doubt her sincerity  and that she will never change  ah well i dont agree with you and i daresay i know them both better than you do but everything goes against me i had set my heart upon it and therefore of course i shall be disappointed what is he going to do this autumn  he is yachting now  and who are with him  i think the boat belongs to captain colepepper  the greatest blackguard in all england a man who shoots pigeons and rides steeplechases and the worst of chiltern is this that even if he didnt like the man and if he were tired of this sort of life he would go on just the same because he thinks it a fine thing not to give way this was so true that phineas did not dare to contradict the statement and therefore said nothing i had some faint hope continued the earl while laura could always watch him because in his way he was fond of his sister but that is all over now she will have enough to do to watch herself  phineas had felt that the earl had put him down rather sharply when he had said that violet would never accept lord chiltern and he was therefore not a little surprised when lord brentford spoke again of miss effingham the following morning holding in his hand a letter which he had just received from her they are to be at loughlinter on the tenth he said and she purposes to come here for a couple of nights on her way  lady baldock and all  well yes lady baldock and all i am not very fond of lady baldock but i will put up with her for a couple of days for the sake of having violet she is more like a child of my own now than anybody else i shall not see her all the autumn afterwards i cannot stand loughlinter  it will be better when the house is full  you will be there i suppose  well no i think not said phineas  you have had enough of it have you phineas made no reply to this but smiled slightly by jove i dont wonder at it said the earl phineas who would have given all he had in the world to be staying in the same country house with violet effingham could not explain how it had come to pass that he was obliged to absent himself i suppose you were asked said the earl  oh yes i was asked nothing can be kinder than they are  kennedy told me that you were coming as a matter of course  i explained to him after that said phineas that i should not return i shall go over to ireland i have a deal of hard reading to do and i can get through it there without interruption  he went up from saulsby to london on that day and found himself quite alone in mrs bunces lodgings i mean not only that he was alone at his lodgings but he was alone at his club and alone in the streets july was not quite over and yet all the birds of passage had migrated mr mildmay by his short session had half ruined the london tradesmen and had changed the summer mode of life of all those who account themselves to be anybody phineas as he sat alone in his room felt himself to be nobody he had told the earl that he was going to ireland and to ireland he must gobecause he had nothing else to do he had been asked indeed to join one or two parties in their autumn plans mr monk had wanted him to go to the pyrenees and lord chiltern had suggested that he should join the yachtbut neither plan suited him it would have suited him to be at loughlinter with violet effingham but loughlinter was a barred house to him his old friend lady laura had told him not to come thither explaining with sufficient clearness her reasons for excluding him from the number of her husbands guests as he thought of it the past scenes of his life became very marvellous to him twelve months since he would have given all the world for a word of love from lady laura and had barely dared to hope that such a word at some future day might possibly be spoken now such a word had in truth been spoken and it had come to be simply a trouble to him she had owned to himfor in truth such had been the meaning of her warning to himthat though she had married another man she had loved and did love him but in thinking of this he took no pride in it it was not till he had thought of it long that he began to ask himself whether he might not be justified in gathering from what happened some hope that violet also might learn to love him he had thought so little of himself as to have been afraid at first to press his suit with lady laura might he not venture to think more of himself having learned how far he had succeeded  but how was he to get at violet effingham from the moment at which he had left saulsby he had been angry with himself for not having asked lord brentford to allow him to remain there till after the baldock party should have gone on to loughlinter the earl who was very lonely in his house would have consented at once phineas indeed was driven to confess to himself that success with violet would at once have put an end to all his friendship with lord brentfordas also to all his friendship with lord chiltern he would in such case be bound in honour to vacate his seat and give back loughton to his offended patron but he would have given up much more than his seat for violet effingham at present however he had no means of getting at her to ask her the question he could hardly go to loughlinter in opposition to the wishes of lady laura  a little adventure happened to him in london which somewhat relieved the dulness of the days of the first week in august he remained in london till the middle of august half resolving to rush down to saulsby when violet effingham should be thereendeavouring to find some excuse for such a proceeding but racking his brains in vainand then there came about his little adventure the adventure was commenced by the receipt of the following letter      banner of the people office    3rd august 186     my dear finn     i must say i think you have treated me badly and without    that sort of brotherly fairness which we on the public    press expect from one another however perhaps we can    come to an understanding and if so things may yet go    smoothly give me a turn and i am not at all adverse to    give you one will you come to me here or shall i call    upon you     yours always q s   phineas was not only surprised but disgusted also at the receipt of this letter he could not imagine what was the deed by which he had offended mr slide he thought over all the circumstances of his short connection with the peoples banner but could remember nothing which might have created offence but his disgust was greater than his surprise he thought that he had done nothing and said nothing to justify quintus slide in calling him dear finn he who had lady lauras secret in his keeping he who hoped to be the possessor of violet effinghams affectionshe to be called dear finn by such a one as quintus slide he soon made up his mind that he would not answer the note but would go at once to the peoples banner office at the hour at which quintus slide was always there he certainly would not write to dear slide and until he had heard something more of this cause of offence he would not make an enemy for ever by calling the man dear sir he went to the office of the peoples banner and found mr slide ensconced in a little glass cupboard writing an article for the next days copy  i suppose youre very busy said phineas inserting himself with some difficulty on to a little stool in the corner of the cupboard  not so particular but what im glad to see you you shoot dont you  shoot said phineas it could not be possible that mr slide was intending after this abrupt fashion to propose a duel with pistols  grouse and pheasants and them sort of things asked mr slide  oh ah i understand yes i shoot sometimes  is it the 12th or 20th for grouse in scotland  the 12th said phineas what makes you ask that just now  im doing a letter about itadvising men not to shoot too many of the young birds and showing that theyll have none next year if they do i had a fellow here just now who knew all about it and he put down a lot but i forgot to make him tell me the day of beginning whats a good place to date from  phineas suggested callender or stirling  stirlings too much of a town isnt it callender sounds better for game i think  so the letter which was to save the young grouse was dated from callender and mr quintus slide having written the word threw down his pen came off his stool and rushed at once at his subject  well now finn he said dont you know that youve treated me badly about loughton  treated you badly about loughton phineas as he repeated the words was quite in the dark as to mr slides meaning did mr slide intend to convey a reproach because phineas had not personally sent some tidings of the election to the peoples banner  very badly said mr slide with his arms akimbovery badly indeed men on the press together do expect that theyre to be stuck by and not thrown over damn it i say whats the good of a brotherhood if it aint to be brotherhood  upon my word i dont know what you mean said phineas  didnt i tell you that i had loughton in my heye said quintus  ohh  its very well to say ho and look guilty but didnt i tell you  i never heard such nonsense in my life  nonsense  how on earth could you have stood for loughton what interest would you have there you could not even have found an elector to propose you  now ill tell you what ill do finn i think you have thrown me over most shabby but i wont stand about that you shall have loughton this session if youll promise to make way for me after the next election if youll agree to that well have a special leader to say how well lord whatshisname has done with the borough and well be your horgan through the whole session  i never heard such nonsense in my life in the first place loughton is safe to be in the schedule of reduced boroughs it will be thrown into the county or joined with a group  ill stand the chance of that will you agree  agree no its the most absurd proposal that was ever made you might as well ask me whether i would agree that you should go to heaven go to heaven if you can i should say i have not the slightest objection but its nothing to me  very well said quintus slide very well now we understand each other and thats all that i desire i think that i can show you what it is to come among gentlemen of the press and then to throw them over good morning  phineas quite satisfied at the result of the interview as regarded himself and by no means sorry that there should have arisen a cause of separation between mr quintus slide and his dear finn shook off a little dust from his foot as he left the office of the peoples banner and resolved that in future he would attempt to make no connection in that direction as he returned home he told himself that a member of parliament should be altogether independent of the press on the second morning after his meeting with his late friend he saw the result of his independence there was a startling article a tremendous article showing the pressing necessity of immediate reform and proving the necessity by an illustration of the boroughmongering rottenness of the present system when such a patron as lord brentfordhimself a cabinet minister with a sinecurecould by his mere word put into the house such a stick as phineas finna man who had struggled to stand on his legs before the speaker but had wanted both the courage and the capacity nothing further could surely be wanted to prove that the reform bill of 1832 required to be supplemented by some more energetic measure  phineas laughed as he read the article and declared to himself that the joke was a good joke but nevertheless he suffered mr quintus slide when he was really anxious to use his thong earnestly could generally raise a wale     chapter xxxiv  was he honest   on the 10th of august phineas finn did return to loughton he went down by the mail train on the night of the 10th having telegraphed to the inn for a bed and was up eating his breakfast in that hospitable house at nine oclock the landlord and landlady with all their staff were at a loss to imagine what had brought down their member again so quickly to his borough but the reader who will remember that lady baldock with her daughter and violet effingham were to pass the 11th of the month at saulsby may perhaps be able to make a guess on the subject  phineas had been thinking of making this sudden visit to loughton ever since he had been up in town but he could suggest to himself no reason to be given to lord brentford for his sudden reappearance the earl had been very kind to him but he had said nothing which could justify his young friend in running in and out of saulsby castle at pleasure without invitation and without notice phineas was so well aware of this himself that often as he had half resolved during the last ten days to return to saulsby so often had he determined that he could not do so he could think of no excuse then the heavens favoured him and he received a letter from lord chiltern in which there was a message for lord brentford if you see my father tell him that i am ready at any moment to do what is necessary for raising the money for laura taking this as his excuse he returned to loughton  as chance arranged it he met the earl standing on the great steps before his own castle doors what finn is this you i thought you were in ireland  not yet my lord as you see then he opened his budget at once and blushed at his own hypocrisy as he went on with his story he had he said felt the message from chiltern to be so allimportant that he could not bring himself to go over to ireland without delivering it he urged upon the earl that he might learn from this how anxious lord chiltern was to effect a reconciliation when it occurred to him he said that there might be a hope of doing anything towards such an object he could not go to ireland leaving the good work behind him in love and war all things are fair so he declared to himself but as he did so he felt that his story was so weak that it would hardly gain for him an admittance into the castle in this he was completely wrong the earl swallowing the bait put his arm through that of the intruder and walking with him through the paths of the shrubbery at length confessed that he would be glad to be reconciled to his son if it were possible let him come here and she shall be here also said the earl speaking of violet to this phineas could say nothing out loud but he told himself that all should be fair between them he would take no dishonest advantage of lord chiltern he would give lord chiltern the whole message as it was given to him by lord brentford but should it so turn out that he himself got an opportunity of saying to violet all that he had come to say and should it also turn outan event which he acknowledged to himself to be most unlikelythat violet did not reject him then how could he write his letter to lord chiltern so he resolved that the letter should be written before he saw violet but how could he write such a letter and instantly afterwards do that which would be false to the spirit of a letter so written could he bid lord chiltern come home to woo violet effingham and instantly go forth to woo her for himself he found that he could not do sounless he told the whole truth to lord chiltern in no other way could he carry out his project and satisfy his own idea of what was honest  the earl bade him send to the hotel for his things the baldock people are all here you know but they go very early tomorrow then phineas declared that he also must return to london very early on the morrowbut in the meantime he would go to the inn and fetch his things the earl thanked him again and again for his generous kindness and phineas blushing as he received the thanks went back and wrote his letter to lord chiltern it was an elaborate letter written as regards the first and larger portion of it with words intended to bring the prodigal son back to the fathers home and everything was said about miss effingham that could or should have been said then on the last page he told his own story now he said i must speak of myselfand he went on to explain to his friend in the plainest language that he could use his own position i have loved her he said for six months and i am here with the express intention of asking her to take me the chances are ten to one that she refuses me i do not deprecate your angerif you choose to be angry but i am endeavouring to treat you well and i ask you to do the same by me i must convey to you your fathers message and after doing so i cannot address myself to miss effingham without telling you i should feel myself to be false were i to do so in the eventthe probable nay almost certain event of my being refusedi shall trust you to keep my secret do not quarrel with me if you can help itbut if you must i will be ready then he posted the letter and went up to the castle  he had only the one day for his action and he knew that violet was watched by lady baldock as by a dragon he was told that the earl was out with the young ladies and was shown to his room on going to the drawingroom he found lady baldock with whom he had been to a certain degree a favourite and was soon deeply engaged in a conversation as to the practicability of shutting up all the breweries and distilleries by act of parliament but lunch relieved him and brought the young ladies in at two miss effingham seemed to be really glad to see him and even miss boreham lady baldocks daughter was very gracious to him for the earl had been speaking well of his young member and phineas had in a way grown into the good graces of sober and discreet people after lunch they were to ridethe earl that is and violet lady baldock and her daughter were to have the carriage i can mount you finn if you would like it said the earl of course hell like it said violet do you suppose mr finn will object to ride with me in saulsby woods it wont be the first time will it violet said lady baldock you have the most singular way of talking i suppose i have said violet but i dont think i can change it now mr finn knows me too well to mind it much  it was past five before they were on horseback and up to that time phineas had not found himself alone with violet effingham for a moment they had sat together after lunch in the diningroom for nearly an hour and had sauntered into the hall and knocked about the billiard balls and then stood together at the open doors of a conservatory but lady baldock or miss boreham had always been there nothing could be more pleasant than miss effinghams words or more familiar than her manner to phineas she had expressed strong delight at his success in getting a seat in parliament and had talked to him about the kennedys as though they had created some special bond of union between her and phineas which ought to make them intimate but for all that she could not be got to separate herself from lady baldockand when she was told that if she meant to ride she must go and dress herself she went at once  but he thought that he might have a chance on horseback and after they had been out about half an hour chance did favour him for awhile he rode behind with the carriage calculating that by his so doing the earl would be put off his guard and would be disposed after awhile to change places with him and so it fell out at a certain fall of ground in the park where the road turned round and crossed a bridge over the little river the carriage came up with the first two horses and lady baldock spoke a word to the earl then violet pulled up allowing the vehicle to pass the bridge first and in this way she and phineas were brought togetherand in this way they rode on but he was aware that he must greatly increase the distance between them and the others of their party before he could dare to plead his suit and even were that done he felt that he would not know how to plead it on horseback  they had gone on some half mile in this way when they reached a spot on which a green ride led away from the main road through the trees to the left you remember this place do you not said violet phineas declared that he remembered it well i must go round by the woodmans cottage you wont mind coming phineas said that he would not mind and trotted on to tell them in the carriage  where is she going asked lady baldock and then when phineas explained she begged the earl to go back to violet the earl feeling the absurdity of this declared that violet knew her way very well herself and thus phineas got his opportunity  they rode on almost without speaking for nearly a mile cantering through the trees and then they took another turn to the right and came upon the cottage they rode to the door and spoke a word or two to the woman there and then passed on i always come here when i am at saulsby said violet that i may teach myself to think kindly of lord chiltern  i understand it all said phineas  he used to be so niceand is so still i believe only that he has taught himself to be so rough will he ever change do you think  phineas knew that in this emergency it was his especial duty to be honest i think he would be changed altogether if we could bring him hereso that he should live among his friends  do you think he would we must put our heads together and do it dont you think that it is to be done  phineas replied that he thought it was to be done ill tell you the truth at once miss effingham he said you can do it by a single word  yesyes she said but i do not mean thatwithout that it is absurd you know that a father should make such a condition as that phineas said that he thought it was absurd and then they rode on again cantering through the wood he had been bold to speak to her about lord chiltern as he had done and she had answered just as he would have wished to be answered but how could he press his suit for himself while she was cantering by his side  presently they came to rough ground over which they were forced to walk and he was close by her side mr finn she said i wonder whether i may ask a question  any question he replied  is there any quarrel between you and lady laura  none  or between you and him  nonone we are greater allies than ever  then why are you not going to be at loughlinter she has written to me expressly saying you would not be there  he paused a moment before he replied it did not suit he said at last  it is a secret then  yesit is a secret you are not angry with me  angry no  it is not a secret of my own or i should not keep it from you  perhaps i can guess it she said but i will not try i will not even think of it  the cause whatever it be has been full of sorrow to me i would have given my left hand to have been at loughlinter this autumn  are you so fond of it  i should have been staying there with you he said he paused and for a moment there was no word spoken by either of them but he could perceive that the hand in which she held her whip was playing with her horses mane with a nervous movement when i found how it must be and that i must miss you i rushed down here that i might see you for a moment and now i am here i do not dare to speak to you of myself they were now beyond the rocks and violet without speaking a word again put her horse into a trot he was by her side in a moment but he could not see her face have you not a word to say to me he asked  nonono she replied not a word when you speak to me like that there is the carriage comewe will join them then she cantered on and he followed her till they reached the earl and lady baldock and miss boreham i have done my devotions now said miss effingham and am ready to return to ordinary life  phineas could not find another moment in which to speak to her though he spent the evening with her and stood over her as she sang at the earls request and pressed her hand as she went to bed and was up to see her start in the morning he could not draw from her either a word or a look     chapter xxxv  mr monk upon reform   phineas finn went to ireland immediately after his return from saulsby having said nothing further to violet effingham and having heard nothing further from her than what is recorded in the last chapter he felt very keenly that his position was unsatisfactory and brooded over it all the autumn and early winter but he could form no plan for improving it a dozen times he thought of writing to miss effingham and asking for an explicit answer he could not however bring himself to write the letter thinking that written expressions of love are always weak and vapidand deterred also by a conviction that violet if driven to reply in writing would undoubtedly reply by a refusal fifty times he rode again in his imagination his ride in saulsby wood and he told himself as often that the syrens answer to himher no no nohad been of all possible answers the most indefinite and provoking the tone of her voice as she galloped away from him the bearing of her countenance when he rejoined her her manner to him when he saw her start from the castle in the morning all forbade him to believe that his words to her had been taken as an offence she had replied to him with a direct negative simply with the word no but she had so said it that there had hardly been any sting in the no and he had known at the moment that whatever might be the result of his suit he need not regard violet effingham as his enemy  but the doubt made his sojourn in ireland very wearisome to him and there were other matters which tended also to his discomfort though he was not left even at this period of his life without a continuation of success which seemed to be very wonderful and first i will say a word of his discomfort he heard not a line from lord chiltern in answer to the letter which he had written to his lordship from lady laura he did hear frequently lady laura wrote to him exactly as though she had never warned him away from loughlinter and as though there had been no occasion for such warning she sent him letters filled chiefly with politics saying something also of the guests at loughlinter something of the game and just a word or two here and there of her husband the letters were very good letters and he preserved them carefully it was manifest to him that they were intended to be good letters and as such to be preserved in one of these which he received about the end of november she told him that her brother was again in his old haunt at the willingford bull and that he had sent to portman square for all property of his own that had been left there but there was no word in that letter of violet effingham and though lady laura did speak more than once of violet she always did so as though violet were simply a joint acquaintance of herself and her correspondent there was no allusion to the existence of any special regard on his part for miss effingham he had thought that violet might probably tell her friend what had occurred at saulsbybut if she did so lady laura was happy in her powers of reticence our hero was disturbed also when he reached home by finding that mrs flood jones and miss flood jones had retired from killaloe for the winter i do not know whether he might not have been more disturbed by the presence of the young lady for he would have found himself constrained to exhibit towards her some tenderness of manner and any such tenderness of manner would in his existing circumstances have been dangerous but he was made to understand that mary flood jones had been taken away from killaloe because it was thought that he had illtreated the lady and the accusation made him unhappy in the middle of the heat of the last session he had received a letter from his sister in which some pushing question had been asked as to his then existing feeling about poor mary this he had answered petulantly nothing more had been written to him about miss jones and nothing was said to him when he reached home he could not however but ask after mary and when he did ask the accusation was made again in that quietly severe manner with which perhaps most of us have been made acquainted at some period of our lives i think phineas said his sister we had better say nothing about dear mary she is not here at present and probably you may not see her while you remain with us whats all that about phineas had demandedunderstanding the whole matter thoroughly then his sister had demurely refused to say a word further on the subject and not a word further was said about miss mary flood jones they were at floodborough living he did not doubt in a very desolate wayand quite willing he did not doubt also to abandon their desolation if he would go over there in the manner that would become him after what had passed on one or two occasions between him and the young lady but how was he to do this with such work on his hands as he had undertaken now that he was in ireland he thought that he did love dear mary very dearly he felt that he had two identitiesthat he was as it were two separate personsand that he could without any real faithlessness be very much in love with violet effingham in his position of man of fashion and member of parliament in england and also warmly attached to dear little mary flood jones as an irishman of killaloe he was aware however that there was a prejudice against such fulness of heart and therefore resolved sternly that it was his duty to be constant to miss effingham how was it possible that he should marry dear maryhe with such extensive jobs of work on his hands it was not possible he must abandon all thought of making dear mary his own no doubt they had been right to remove her but still as he took his solitary walks along the shannon and up on the hills that overhung the lake above the town he felt somewhat ashamed of himself and dreamed of giving up parliament of leaving violet to some noble suitorto lord chiltern if she would take himand of going to floodborough with an honest proposal that he should be allowed to press mary to his heart miss effingham would probably reject him at last whereas mary dear mary would come to his heart without a scruple of doubt dear mary in these days of dreaming he told himself that after all dear mary was his real love but of course such days were days of dreaming only he had letters in his pocket from lady laura kennedy which made it impossible for him to think in earnest of giving up parliament  and then there came a wonderful piece of luck in his way there lived or had lived in the town of galway a very eccentric old lady one miss marian persse who was the aunt of mrs finn the mother of our hero with this lady dr finn had quarrelled persistently ever since his marriage because the lady had expressed her wish to interfere in the management of his familyoffering to purchase such right by favourable arrangements in reference to her will this the doctor had resented and there had been quarrels miss persse was not a very rich old lady but she thought a good deal of her own money and now she died leaving ¬£3000 to her nephew phineas finn another sum of about equal amount she bequeathed to a roman catholic seminary and thus was her worldly wealth divided she couldnt have done better with it said the old doctor and as far as we are concerned the windfall is the more pleasant as being wholly unexpected in these days the doctor was undoubtedly gratified by his sons success in life and never said much about the law phineas in truth did do some work during the autumn reading bluebooks reading law books reading perhaps a novel or two at the same timebut shutting himself up very carefully as he studied so that his sisters were made to understand that for a certain four hours in the day not a sound was to be allowed to disturb him  on the receipt of his legacy he at once offered to repay his father all money that had been advanced him over and above his original allowance but this the doctor refused to take it comes to the same thing phineas he said what you have of your share now you cant have hereafter as regards my present income it has only made me work a little longer than i had intended and i believe that the later in life a man works the more likely he is to live phineas therefore when he returned to london had his ¬£3000 in his pocket he owed some ¬£500 and the remainder he would of course invest  there had been some talk of an autumnal session but mr mildmays decision had at last been against it who cannot understand that such would be the decision of any minister to whom was left the slightest fraction of free will in the matter why should any minister court the danger of unnecessary attack submit himself to unnecessary work and incur the odium of summoning all his friends from their rest in the midst of the doubts as to the new and old ministry when the political needle was vacillating so tremulously on its pivot pointing now to one set of men as the coming government and then to another vague suggestions as to an autumn session might be useful and they were thrown out in all good faith mr mildmay when he spoke on the subject to the duke was earnest in thinking that the question of reform should not be postponed even for six months dont pledge yourself said the dukeand mr mildmay did not pledge himself afterwards when mr mildmay found that he was once more assuredly prime minister he changed his mind and felt himself to be under a fresh obligation to the duke lord de terrier had altogether failed and the country might very well wait till february the country did wait till february somewhat to the disappointment of phineas finn who had become tired of bluebooks at killaloe the difference between his english life and his life at home was so great that it was hardly possible that he should not become weary of the latter he did become weary of it but strove gallantly to hide his weariness from his father and mother  at this time the world was talking much about reform though mr mildmay had become placidly patient the feeling was growing and mr turnbull with his friends was doing all he could to make it grow fast there was a certain amount of excitement on the subject but the excitement had grown downwards from the leaders to the peoplefrom the selfinstituted leaders of popular politics down by means of the press to the ranks of working men instead of growing upwards from the dissatisfaction of the masses till it expressed itself by this mouthpiece and that chosen by the people themselves there was no strong throb through the country making men feel that safety was to be had by reform and could not be had without reform but there was an understanding that the press and the orators were too strong to be ignored and that some new measure of reform must be conceded to them the sooner the concession was made the less it might be necessary to concede and all men of all parties were agreed on this point that reform was in itself odious to many of those who spoke of it freely who offered themselves willingly to be its promoters was acknowledged it was not only odious to lord de terrier and to most of those who worked with him but was equally so to many of mr mildmays most constant supporters the duke had no wish for reform indeed it is hard to suppose that such a duke can wish for any change in a state of things that must seem to him to be so salutary workmen were getting full wages farmers were paying their rent capitalists by the dozen were creating capitalists by the hundreds nothing was wrong in the country but the overdominant spirit of speculative commerceand there was nothing in reform to check that why should the duke want reform as for such men as lord brentford sir harry coldfoot lord plinlimmon and mr legge wilson it was known to all men that they advocated reform as we all of us advocate doctors some amount of doctoring is necessary for us we may hardly hope to avoid it but let us have as little of the doctor as possible mr turnbull and the cheap press and the rising spirit of the loudest among the people made it manifest that something must be conceded let us be generous in our concession that was now the doctrine of manyperhaps of most of the leading politicians of the day let us be generous let us at any rate seem to be generous let us give with an open handbut still with a hand which though open shall not bestow too much the coach must be allowed to run down the hill indeed unless the coach goes on running no journey will be made but let us have the drag on both the hind wheels and we must remember that coaches running down hill without drags are apt to come to serious misfortune  but there were men even in the cabinet who had other ideas of public service than that of dragging the wheels of the coach mr gresham was in earnest plantagenet palliser was in earnest that exceedingly intelligent young nobleman lord cantrip was in earnest mr mildmay threw perhaps as much of earnestness into the matter as was compatible with his age and his full appreciation of the manner in which the present cry for reform had been aroused he was thoroughly honest thoroughly patriotic and thoroughly ambitious that he should be written of hereafter as one who to the end of a long life had worked sedulously for the welfare of the peoplebut he disbelieved in mr turnbull and in the bottom of his heart indulged an aristocratic contempt for the penny press and there was no man in england more in earnest more truly desirous of reform than mr monk it was his great political idea that political advantages should be extended to the people whether the people clamoured for them or did not clamour for themeven whether they desired them or did not desire them you do not ask a child whether he would like to learn his lesson he would say at any rate you do not wait till he cries for his book when therefore men said to him that there was no earnestness in the cry for reform that the cry was a false cry got up for factious purposes by interested persons he would reply that the thing to be done should not be done in obedience to any cry but because it was demanded by justice and was a debt due to the people  our hero in the autumn had written to mr monk on the politics of the moment and the following had been mr monks reply      longroyston october 12 186     my dear finn     i am staying here with the duke and duchess of st    bungay the house is very full and mr mildmay was    here last week but as i dont shoot and cant play    billiards and have no taste for charades i am becoming    tired of the gaieties and shall leave them tomorrow    of course you know that we are not to have the autumn    session i think that mr mildmay is right could we have    been sure of passing our measure it would have been very    well but we could not have been sure and failure with    our bill in a session convened for the express purpose of    passing it would have injured the cause greatly we could    hardly have gone on with it again in the spring indeed    we must have resigned and though i may truly say that i    would as lief have a good measure from lord de terrier    as from mr mildmay and that i am indifferent to my own    present personal position still i think that we should    endeavour to keep our seats as long as we honestly    believe ourselves to be more capable of passing a good    measure than are our opponents     i am astonished by the difference of opinion which    exists about reformnot only as to the difference in    the extent and exact tendency of the measure that is    neededbut that there should be such a divergence of    ideas as to the grand thing to be done and the grand    reason for doing it we are all agreed that we want    reform in order that the house of commons may be returned    by a larger proportion of the people than is at present    employed upon that work and that each member when    returned should represent a somewhat more equal section    of the whole constituencies of the country than our    members generally do at present all men confess that a    ¬£50 county franchise must be too high and that a borough    with less than two hundred registered voters must be    wrong but it seems to me that but few among us perceive    or at any rate acknowledge the real reasons for changing    these things and reforming what is wrong without delay    one great authority told us the other day that the sole    object of legislation on this subject should be to get    together the best possible 658 members of parliament    that to me would be a most repulsive idea if it were    not that by its very vagueness it becomes inoperative    who shall say what is best or what characteristic    constitutes excellence in a member of parliament if    the gentleman means excellence in general wisdom or    in statecraft or in skill in talking or in private    character or even excellence in patriotism then i say    that he is utterly wrong and has never touched with    his intellect the true theory of representation one    only excellence may be acknowledged and that is the    excellence of likeness as a portrait should be like the    person portrayed so should a representative house be    like the people whom it represents nor in arranging    a franchise does it seem to me that we have a right    to regard any other view if a country be unfit for    representative governmentand it may be that there are    still peoples unable to use properly that greatest of    all blessingsthe question as to what state policy may    be best for them is a different question but if we do    have representation let the representative assembly be    like the people whatever else may be its virtuesand    whatever else its vices     another great authority has told us that our house of    commons should be the mirror of the people i say not    its mirror but its miniature and let the artist be    careful to put in every line of the expression of that    evermoving face to do this is a great work and the    artist must know his trade well in america the work has    been done with so coarse a hand that nothing is shown    in the picture but the broad plain unspeaking outline    of the face as you look from the represented to the    representation you cannot but acknowledge the likeness    but there is in that portrait more of the body than of    the mind the true portrait should represent more than    the body with us hitherto there have been snatches    of the countenance of the nation which have been    inimitablea turn of the eye here and a curl of the lip    there which have seemed to denote a power almost divine    there have been marvels on the canvas so beautiful that    one approaches the work of remodelling it with awe    but not only is the picture imperfecta thing of    snatchesbut with years it becomes less and still less    like its original     the necessity for remodelling it is imperative and we    shall be cowards if we decline the work but let us be    specially careful to retain as much as possible of those    lines which we all acknowledge to be so faithfully    representative of our nation to give to a bare numerical    majority of the people that power which the numerical    majority has in the united states would not be to    achieve representation the nation as it now exists would    not be known by such a portraitbut neither can it    now be known by that which exists it seems to me that    they who are adverse to change looking back with an    unmeasured respect on what our old parliaments have done    for us ignore the majestic growth of the english people    and forget the present in their worship of the past they    think that we must be what we wereat any rate what    we were thirty years since they have not perhaps gone    into the houses of artisans or if there they have not    looked into the breasts of the men with population vice    has increased and these politicians with ears but    no eyes hear of drunkenness and sin and ignorance    and then they declare to themselves that this wicked    halfbarbarous idle people should be controlled and not    represented a wicked halfbarbarous idle people may be    controlledbut not a people thoughtful educated and    industrious we must look to it that we do not endeavour    to carry our control beyond the wickedness and the    barbarity and that we be ready to submit to control from    thoughtfulness and industry     i hope we shall find you helping at the good work early    in the spring     yours always faithfully     joshua monk   phineas was up in london before the end of january but did not find there many of those whom he wished to see mr low was there and to him he showed mr monks letter thinking that it must be convincing even to mr low this he did in mrs lows drawingroom knowing that mrs low would also condescend to discuss politics on an occasion he had dined with them and they had been glad to see him and mrs low had been less severe than hitherto against the great sin of her husbands late pupil she had condescended to congratulate him on becoming member for an english borough instead of an irish one and had asked him questions about saulsby castle but nevertheless mr monks letter was not received with that respectful admiration which phineas thought that it deserved phineas foolishly had read it out loud so that the attack came upon him simultaneously from the husband and from the wife  it is just the usual claptrap said mr low only put into language somewhat more grandiloquent than usual  claptrap said phineas  its what i call downright radical nonsense said mrs low nodding her head energetically portrait indeed why should we want to have a portrait of ignorance and ugliness what we all want is to have things quiet and orderly  then youd better have a paternal government at once said phineas  just so said mr lowonly that what you call a paternal government is not always quiet and orderly national order i take to be submission to the law i should not think it quiet and orderly if i were sent to cayenne without being brought before a jury  but such a man as you would not be sent to cayenne said phineas  my nextdoor neighbour might bewhich would be almost as bad let him be sent to cayenne if he deserves it but let a jury say that he has deserved it my idea of government is thisthat we want to be governed by law and not by caprice and that we must have a legislature to make our laws if i thought that parliament as at present established made the laws badly i would desire a change but i doubt whether we shall have them better from any change in parliament which reform will give us  of course not said mrs low but we shall have a lot of beggars put on horseback and we all know where they ride to  then phineas became aware that it is not easy to convince any man or any woman on a point of politicsnot even though he who argues may have an eloquent letter from a philosophical cabinet minister in his pocket to assist him     chapter xxxvi  phineas finn makes progress   february was far advanced and the new reform bill had already been brought forward before lady laura kennedy came up to town phineas had of course seen mr kennedy and had heard from him tidings of his wife she was at saulsby with lady baldock and miss boreham and violet effingham but was to be in london soon mr kennedy as it appeared did not quite know when he was to expect his wife and phineas thought that he could perceive from the tone of the husbands voice that something was amiss he could not however ask any questions excepting such as referred to the expected arrival was miss effingham to come to london with lady laura mr kennedy believed that miss effingham would be up before easter but he did not know whether she would come with his wife women he said are so fond of mystery that one can never quite know what they intend to do he corrected himself at once however perceiving that he had seemed to say something against his wife and explained that his general accusation against the sex was not intended to apply to lady laura this however he did so awkwardly as to strengthen the feeling with phineas that something assuredly was wrong miss effingham said mr kennedy never seems to know her own mind i suppose she is like other beautiful girls who are petted on all sides said phineas as for her beauty i dont think much of it said mr kennedy and as for petting i do not understand it in reference to grown persons children may be petted and dogsthough that too is bad but what you call petting for grown persons is i think frivolous and almost indecent phineas could not help thinking of lord chilterns opinion that it would have been wise to have left mr kennedy in the hands of the garrotters  the debate on the second reading of the bill was to be commenced on the 1st of march and two days before that lady laura arrived in grosvenor place phineas got a note from her in three words to say that she was at home and would see him if he called on sunday afternoon the sunday to which she alluded was the last day of february phineas was now more certain than ever that something was wrong had there been nothing wrong between lady laura and her husband she would not have rebelled against him by asking visitors to the house on a sunday he had nothing to do with that however and of course he did as he was desired he called on the sunday and found mrs bonteen sitting with lady laura i am just in time for the debate said lady laura when the first greeting was over  you dont mean to say that you intend to sit it out said mrs bonteen  every word of itunless i lose my seat what else is there to be done at present  but the place they give us is so unpleasant said mrs bonteen  there are worse places even than the ladies gallery said lady laura and perhaps it is as well to make oneself used to inconveniences of all kinds you will speak mr finn  i intend to do so  of course you will the great speeches will be mr greshams mr daubenys and mr monks  mr palliser intends to be very strong said mrs bonteen  a man cannot be strong or not as he likes it said lady laura mr palliser i believe to be a most useful man but he never can become an orator he is of the same class as mr kennedyonly of course higher in the class  we all look for a great speech from mr kennedy said mrs bonteen  i have not the slightest idea whether he will open his lips said lady laura immediately after that mrs bonteen took her leave i hate that woman like poison continued lady laura she is always playing a game and it is such a small game that she plays and she contributes so little to society she is not witty nor wellinformednot even sufficiently ignorant or ridiculous to be a laughingstock one gets nothing from her and yet she has made her footing good in the world  i thought she was a friend of yours  you did not think so you could not have thought so how can you bring such an accusation against me knowing me as you do but never mind mrs bonteen now on what day shall you speak  on tuesday if i can  i suppose you can arrange it  i shall endeavour to do so as far as any arrangement can go  we shall carry the second reading said lady laura  yes said phineas i think we shall but by the votes of men who are determined so to pull the bill to pieces in committee that its own parents will not know it i doubt whether mr mildmay will have the temper to stand it  they tell me that mr mildmay will abandon the custody of the bill to mr gresham after his first speech  i dont know that mr greshams temper is more enduring than mr mildmays said phineas  wellwe shall see my own impression is that nothing would save the country so effectually at the present moment as the removal of mr turnbull to a higher and a better sphere  let us say the house of lords said phineas  god forbid said lady laura  phineas sat there for half an hour and then got up to go having spoken no word on any other subject than that of politics he longed to ask after violet he longed to make some inquiry respecting lord chiltern and to tell the truth he felt painfully curious to hear lady laura say something about her own self he could not but remember what had been said between them up over the waterfall and how he had been warned not to return to loughlinter and then again did lady laura know anything of what had passed between him and violet where is your brother he said as he rose from his chair  oswald is in london he was here not an hour before you came in  where is he staying  at moronis he goes down on tuesday i think he is to see his father tomorrow morning  by agreement  yesby agreement there is a new troubleabout money that they think to be due to me but i cannot tell you all now there have been some words between mr kennedy and papa but i wont talk about it you would find oswald at moronis at any hour before eleven tomorrow  did he say anything about me asked phineas  we mentioned your name certainly  i do not ask from vanity but i want to know whether he is angry with me  angry with you not in the least ill tell you just what he said he said he should not wish to live even with you but that he would sooner try it with you than with any man he ever knew  he had got a letter from me  he did not say sobut he did not say he had not  i will see him tomorrow if i can and then phineas prepared to go  one word mr finn said lady laura hardly looking him in the face and yet making an effort to do so i wish you to forget what i said to you at loughlinter  it shall be as though it were forgotten said phineas  let it be absolutely forgotten in such a case a man is bound to do all that a woman asks him and no man has a truer spirit of chivalry than yourself that is all look in when you can i will not ask you to dine here as yet because we are so frightfully dull do your best on tuesday and then let us see you on wednesday goodbye  phineas as he walked across the park towards his club made up his mind that he would forget the scene by the waterfall he had never quite known what it had meant and he would wipe it away from his mind altogether he acknowledged to himself that chivalry did demand of him that he should never allow himself to think of lady lauras rash words to him that she was not happy with her husband was very clear to himbut that was altogether another affair she might be unhappy with her husband without indulging any guilty love he had never thought it possible that she could be happy living with such a husband as mr kennedy all that however was now past remedy and she must simply endure the mode of life which she had prepared for herself there were other men and women in london tied together for better and worse in reference to whose union their friends knew that there would be no betterthat it must be all worse lady laura must bear it as it was borne by many another married woman  on the monday morning phineas called at moronis hotel at ten oclock but in spite of lady lauras assurance to the contrary he found that lord chiltern was out he had felt some palpitation at the heart as he made his inquiry knowing well the fiery nature of the man he expected to see it might be that there would be some actual personal conflict between him and this halfmad lord before he got back again into the street what lady laura had said about her brother did not in the estimation of phineas make this at all the less probable the halfmad lord was so singular in his ways that it might well be that he should speak handsomely of a rival behind his back and yet take him by the throat as soon as they were together face to face and yet as phineas thought it was necessary that he should see the halfmad lord he had written a letter to which he had received no reply and he considered it to be incumbent on him to ask whether it had been received and whether any answer to it was intended to be given he went therefore to lord chiltern at onceas i have said with some feeling at his heart that there might be violence at any rate of words before he should find himself again in the street but lord chiltern was not there all that the porter knew was that lord chiltern intended to leave the house on the following morning then phineas wrote a note and left it with the porter      dear chiltern     i particularly want to see you with reference to a letter    i wrote to you last summer i must be in the house today    from four till the debate is over i will be at the reform    club from two till halfpast three and will come if you    will send for me or i will meet you anywhere at any hour    tomorrow morning     yours always p f   no message came to him at the reform club and he was in his seat in the house by four oclock during the debate a note was brought to him which ran as follows      i have got your letter this moment of course we must    meet i hunt on tuesday and go down by the early train    but i will come to town on wednesday we shall require to    be private and i will therefore be at your rooms at one    oclock on that dayc   phineas at once perceived that the note was a hostile note written in an angry spiritwritten to one whom the writer did not at the moment acknowledge to be his friend this was certainly the case whatever lord chiltern may have said to his sister as to his friendship for phineas phineas crushed the note into his pocket and of course determined that he would be in his rooms at the hour named  the debate was opened by a speech from mr mildmay in which that gentleman at great length and with much perspicuity explained his notion of that measure of parliamentary reform which he thought to be necessary he was listened to with the greatest attention to the closeand perhaps at the end of his speech with more attention than usual as there had gone abroad a rumour that the prime minister intended to declare that this would be the last effort of his life in that course but if he ever intended to utter such a pledge his heart misgave him when the time came for uttering it he merely said that as the management of the bill in committee would be an affair of much labour and probably spread over many nights he would be assisted in his work by his colleagues and especially by his right honourable friend the secretary of state for foreign affairs it was then understood that mr gresham would take the lead should the bill go into committeebut it was understood also that no resignation of leadership had been made by mr mildmay  the measure now proposed to the house was very much the same as that which had been brought forward in the last session the existing theory of british representation was not to be changed but the actual practice was to be brought nearer to the ideal theory the ideas of manhood suffrage and of electoral districts were to be as for ever removed from the bulwarks of the british constitution there were to be counties with agricultural constituencies purposely arranged to be purely agricultural whenever the nature of the counties would admit of its being so no artificer at reform let him be conservative or liberal can make middlesex or lancashire agricultural but wiltshire and suffolk were to be preserved inviolable to the ploughand the apples of devonshire were still to have their sway every town in the three kingdoms with a certain population was to have two members but here there was much room for cavilas all men knew would be the case who shall say what is a town or where shall be its limits bits of counties might be borrowed so as to lessen the conservatism of the county without endangering the liberalism of the borough and then there were the boroughs with one memberand then the groups of little boroughs in the discussion of any such arrangement how easy is the picking of holes how impossible the fabrication of a garment that shall be impervious to such picking then again there was that great question of the ballot on that there was to be no mistake mr mildmay again pledged himself to disappear from the treasury bench should any motion clause or resolution be carried by that house in favour of the ballot he spoke for three hours and then left the carcass of his bill to be fought for by the opposing armies  no reader of these pages will desire that the speeches in the debate should be even indicated it soon became known that the conservatives would not divide the house against the second reading of the bill they declared however very plainly their intention of so altering the clauses of the bill in committeeor at least of attempting so to doas to make the bill their bill rather than the bill of their opponents to this mr palliser replied that as long as nothing vital was touched the government would only be too happy to oblige their friends opposite if anything vital were touched the government could only fall back upon their friends on that side and in this way men were very civil to each other but mr turnbull who opened the debate on the tuesday thundered out an assurance to gods and men that he would divide the house on the second reading of the bill itself he did not doubt but that there were many good men and true to go with him into the lobby but into the lobby he would go if he had no more than a single friend to support him and he warned the sovereign and he warned the house and he warned the people of england that the measure of reform now proposed by a socalled liberal minister was a measure prepared in concert with the ancient enemies of the people he was very loud very angry and quite successful in hallooing down sundry attempts which were made to interrupt him i find he said that there are many members here who do not know me yetyoung members probably who are green from the waste lands and roadsides of private life they will know me soon and then may be there will be less of this foolish noise less of this elongation of unnecessary necks our rome must be aroused to a sense of its danger by other voices than these he was called to order but it was ruled that he had not been out of orderand he was very triumphant mr monk answered him and it was declared afterwards that mr monks speech was one of the finest pieces of oratory that had ever been uttered in that house he made one remark personal to mr turnbull i quite agreed with the right honourable gentleman in the chair he said when he declared that the honourable member was not out of order just now we all of us agree with him always on such points the rules of our house have been laid down with the utmost latitude so that the course of our debates may not be frivolously or too easily interrupted but a member may be so in order as to incur the displeasure of the house and to merit the reproaches of his countrymen this little duel gave great life to the debate but it was said that those two great reformers mr turnbull and mr monk could never again meet as friends  in the course of the debate on tuesday phineas got upon his legs the reader i trust will remember that hitherto he had failed altogether as a speaker on one occasion he had lacked even the spirit to use and deliver an oration which he had prepared on a second occasion he had broken downwoefully and past all redemption as said those who were not his friendsunfortunately but not past redemption as said those who were his true friends after that once again he had arisen and said a few words which had called for no remark and had been spoken as though he were in the habit of addressing the house daily it may be doubted whether there were halfadozen men now present who recognised the fact that this man who was so well known to so many of them was now about to make another attempt at a first speech phineas himself diligently attempted to forget that such was the case he had prepared for himself a few headings of what he intended to say and on one or two points had arranged his words his hope was that even though he should forget the words he might still be able to cling to the thread of his discourse when he found himself again upon his legs amidst those crowded seats for a few moments there came upon him that old sensation of awe again things grew dim before his eyes and again he hardly knew at which end of that long chamber the speaker was sitting but there arose within him a sudden courage as soon as the sound of his own voice in that room had made itself intimate to his ear and after the first few sentences all fear all awe was gone from him when he read his speech in the report afterwards he found that he had strayed very wide of his intended course but he had strayed without tumbling into ditches or falling into sunken pits he had spoken much from mr monks letter but had had the grace to acknowledge whence had come his inspiration he hardly knew however whether he had failed again or not till barrington erle came up to him as they were leaving the house with his old easy pressing manner so you have got into form at last he said i always thought that it would come i never for a moment believed but that it would come sooner or later phineas finn answered not a word but he went home and lay awake all night triumphant the verdict of barrington erle sufficed to assure him that he had succeeded     chapter xxxvii  a rough encounter   phineas when he woke had two matters to occupy his mindhis success of the previous night and his coming interview with lord chiltern he stayed at home the whole morning knowing that nothing could be done before the hour lord chiltern had named for his visit he read every word of the debate studiously postponing the perusal of his own speech till he should come to it in due order and then he wrote to his father commencing his letter as though his writing had no reference to the affairs of the previous night but he soon found himself compelled to break into some mention of it i send you a times he said in order that you may see that i have had my finger in the pie i have hitherto abstained from putting myself forward in the house partly through a base fear for which i despise myself and partly through a feeling of prudence that a man of my age should not be in a hurry to gather laurels this is literally true there has been the fear and there has been the prudence my wonder is that i have not incurred more contempt from others because i have been a coward people have been so kind to me that i must suppose them to have judged me more leniently than i have judged myself then as he was putting up the paper he looked again at his own speech and of course read every word of it once more as he did so it occurred to him that the reporters had been more than courteous to him the man who had followed him had been he thought at any rate as longwinded as himself but to this orator less than half a column had been granted to him had been granted ten lines in big type and after that a whole column and a half let lord chiltern come and do his worst  when it wanted but twenty minutes to one and he was beginning to think in what way he had better answer the halfmad lord should the lord in his wrath be very mad there came to him a note by the hand of some messenger he knew at once that it was from lady laura and opened it in hot haste it was as follows      dear mr finn     we are all talking about your speech my father was in    the gallery and heard itand said that he had to thank    me for sending you to loughton that made me very happy    mr kennedy declares that you were eloquent but too    short that coming from him is praise indeed i have seen    barrington who takes pride to himself that you are his    political child violet says that it is the only speech    she ever read i was there and was delighted i was sure    that it was in you to do it     yours l k     i suppose we shall see you after the house is up but    i write this as i shall barely have an opportunity of    speaking to you then i shall be in portman square not    at home from six till seven   the moment in which phineas refolded this note and put it into his breast coatpocket was i think the happiest of his life then before he had withdrawn his hand from his breast he remembered that what was now about to take place between him and lord chiltern would probably be the means of separating him altogether from lady laura and her family nay might it not render it necessary that he should abandon the seat in parliament which had been conferred upon him by the personal kindness of lord brentford let that be as it might one thing was clear to him he would not abandon violet effingham till he should be desired to do so in the plainest language by violet effingham herself looking at his watch he saw that it was one oclock and at that moment lord chiltern was announced  phineas went forward immediately with his hand out to meet his visitor chiltern he said i am very glad to see you but lord chiltern did not take his hand passing on to the table with his hat still on his head and with a dark scowl upon his brow the young lord stood for a few moments perfectly silent then he chucked a letter across the table to the spot at which phineas was standing phineas taking up the letter perceived that it was that which he in his great attempt to be honest had written from the inn at loughton it is my own letter to you he said  yes it is your letter to me i received it oddly enough together with your own note at moronison monday morning it has been round the world i suppose and reached me only then you must withdraw it  withdraw it  yes sir withdraw it as far as i can learn without asking any question which would have committed myself or the young lady you have not acted upon it you have not yet done what you there threaten to do in that you have been very wise and there can be no difficulty in your withdrawing the letter  i certainly shall not withdraw it lord chiltern  do you rememberwhati oncetold youabout myself and miss effingham this question he asked very slowly pausing between the words and looking full into the face of his rival towards whom he had gradually come nearer and his countenance as he did so was by no means pleasant the redness of his complexion had become more ruddy than usual he still wore his hat as though with studied insolence his right hand was clenched and there was that look of angry purpose in his eye which no man likes to see in the eye of an antagonist phineas was afraid of no violence personal to himself but he was afraid ofof what i may perhaps best call a row to be tumbling over the chairs and tables with his late friend and present enemy in mrs bunces room would be most unpleasant to him if there were to be blows he too must strikeand he was very averse to strike lady lauras brother lord brentfords son violet effinghams friend if need be however he would strike  i suppose i remember what you mean said phineas i think you declared that you would quarrel with any man who might presume to address miss effingham is it that to which you allude  it is that said lord chiltern  i remember what you said very well if nothing else was to deter me from asking miss effingham to be my wife you will hardly think that that ought to have any weight the threat had no weight  it was not spoken as a threat sir and that you know as well as i do it was said from a friend to a friendas i thought then but it is not the less true i wonder what you can think of faith and truth and honesty of purpose when you took advantage of my absenceyou whom i had told a thousand times that i loved her better than my own soul you stand before the world as a rising man and i stand before the world as a mandamned you have been chosen by my father to sit for our family borough while i am an outcast from his house you have cabinet ministers for your friends while i have hardly a decent associate left to me in the world but i can say of myself that i have never done anything unworthy of a gentleman while this thing that you are doing is unworthy of the lowest man  i have done nothing unworthy said phineas i wrote to you instantly when i had resolvedthough it was painful to me to have to tell such a secret to any one  you wrote yes when i was miles distant weeks months away but i did not come here to bullyrag like an old woman i got your letter only on monday and know nothing of what has occurred is miss effingham to beyour wife lord chiltern had now come quite close to phineas and phineas felt that that clenched fist might be in his face in half a moment miss effingham of course was not engaged to him but it seemed to him that if he were now so to declare such declaration would appear to have been drawn from him by fear i ask you said lord chiltern in what position you now stand towards miss effingham if you are not a coward you will tell me  whether i tell you or not you know that i am not a coward said phineas  i shall have to try said lord chiltern but if you please i will ask you for an answer to my question  phineas paused for a moment thinking what honesty of purpose and a high spirit would when combined together demand of him and together with these requirements he felt that he was bound to join some feeling of duty towards miss effingham lord chiltern was standing there fiery red with his hand still clenched and his hat still on waiting for his answer let me have your question again said phineas and i will answer it if i find that i can do so without loss of selfrespect  i ask you in what position you stand towards miss effingham mind i do not doubt at all but i choose to have a reply from yourself  you will remember of course that i can only answer to the best of my belief  answer to the best of your belief  i think she regards me as an intimate friend  had you said as an indifferent acquaintance you would i think have been nearer the mark but we will let that be i presume i may understand that you have given up any idea of changing that position  you may understand nothing of the kind lord chiltern  whywhat hope have you  that is another thing i shall not speak of thatat any rate not to you  then sir and now lord chiltern advanced another step and raised his hand as though he were about to put it with some form of violence on the person of his rival  stop chiltern said phineas stepping back so that there was some article of furniture between him and his adversary i do not choose that there should be a riot here  what do you call a riot sir i believe that after all you are a poltroon what i require of you is that you shall meet me will you do that  you meanto fight  yesto fight to fight to fight for what other purpose do you suppose that i can wish to meet you phineas felt at the moment that the fighting of a duel would be destructive to all his political hopes few englishmen fight duels in these days they who do so are always reckoned to be fools and a duel between him and lord brentfords son must as he thought separate him from violet from lady laura from lord brentford and from his borough but yet how could he refuse what have you to think of sir when such an offer as that is made to you said the fieryred lord  i have to think whether i have courage enough to refuse to make myself an ass  you say that you do not wish to have a riot that is your way to escape what you calla riot  you want to bully me chiltern  no siri simply want this that you should leave me where you found me and not interfere with that which you have long known i claim as my own  but it is not your own  then you can only fight me  you had better send some friend to me and i will name some one whom he shall meet  of course i will do that if i have your promise to meet me we can be in belgium in an hour or two and back again in a few more hoursthat is any one of us who may chance to be alive  i will select a friend and will tell him everything and will then do as he bids me  yessome old steadygoing buffer mr kennedy perhaps  it will certainly not be mr kennedy i shall probably ask laurence fitzgibbon to manage for me in such an affair  perhaps you will see him at once then so that colepepper may arrange with him this afternoon and let me assure you mr finn that there will be a meeting between us after some fashion let the ideas of your friend mr fitzgibbon be what they may then lord chiltern purposed to go but turned again as he was going and remember this he said my complaint is that you have been false to medamnably false not that you have fallen in love with this young lady or with that then the fieryred lord opened the door for himself and took his departure  phineas as soon as he was alone walked down to the house at which there was an early sitting as he went there was one great question which he had to settle with himselfwas there any justice in the charge made against him that he had been false to his friend when he had thought over the matter at saulsby after rushing down there that he might throw himself at violets feet he had assured himself that such a letter as that which he resolved to write to lord chiltern would be even chivalrous in its absolute honesty he would tell his purpose to lord chiltern the moment that his purpose was formedand would afterwards speak of lord chiltern behind his back as one dear friend should speak of another had miss effingham shown the slightest intention of accepting lord chilterns offer he would have acknowledged to himself that the circumstances of his position made it impossible that he should with honour become his friends rival but was he to be debarred for ever from getting that which he wanted because lord chiltern wanted it alsoknowing as he did so well that lord chiltern could not get the thing which he wanted all this had been quite sufficient for him at saulsby but now the charge against him that he had been false to his friend rang in his ears and made him unhappy it certainly was true that lord chiltern had not given up his hopes and that he had spoken probably more openly to phineas respecting them than he had done to any other human being if it was true that he had been false then he must comply with any requisition which lord chiltern might makeshort of voluntarily giving up the lady he must fight if he were asked to do so even though fighting were his ruin  when again in the house yesterdays scene came back upon him and more than one man came to him congratulating him mr monk took his hand and spoke a word to him the old premier nodded to him mr gresham greeted him and plantagenet palliser openly told him that he had made a good speech how sweet would all this have been had there not been ever at his heart the remembrance of his terrible difficultythe consciousness that he was about to be forced into an absurdity which would put an end to all this sweetness why was the world in england so severe against duelling after all as he regarded the matter now a duel might be the best way nay the only way out of a difficulty if he might only be allowed to go out with lord chiltern the whole thing might be arranged if he were not shot he might carry on his suit with miss effingham unfettered by any impediment on that side and if he were shot what matter was that to any one but himself why should the world be so thinskinnedso foolishly chary of human life  laurence fitzgibbon did not come to the house and phineas looked for him at both the clubs which he frequentedleaving a note at each as he did not find him he also left a note for him at his lodgings in duke street i must see you this evening i shall dine at the reform clubpray come there after that phineas went up to portman square in accordance with the instructions received from lady laura  there he saw violet effingham meeting her for the first time since he had parted from her on the great steps at saulsby of course he spoke to her and of course she was gracious to him but her graciousness was only a smile and his speech was only a word there were many in the room but not enough to make privacy possibleas it becomes possible at a crowded evening meeting lord brentford was there and the bonteens and barrington erle and lady glencora palliser and lord cantrip with his young wife it was manifestly a meeting of liberals semisocial and semipoliticalso arranged that ladies might feel that some interest in politics was allowed to them and perhaps some influence also afterwards mr palliser himself came in phineas however was most struck by finding that laurence fitzgibbon was there and that mr kennedy was not in regard to mr kennedy he was quite sure that had such a meeting taken place before lady lauras marriage mr kennedy would have been present i must speak to you as we go away said phineas whispering a word into fitzgibbons ear i have been leaving notes for you all about the town not a duel i hope said fitzgibbon  how pleasant it wasthat meeting or would have been had there not been that nightmare on his breast they all talked as though there were perfect accord between them and perfect confidence there were there great mencabinet ministers and beautiful womenthe wives and daughters of some of englands highest nobles and phineas finn throwing back now and again a thought to killaloe found himself among them as one of themselves how could any mr low say that he was wrong  on a sofa near to him so that he could almost touch her foot with his was sitting violet effingham and as he leaned over from his chair discussing some point in mr mildmays bill with that most inveterate politician lady glencora violet looked into his face and smiled oh heavens if lord chiltern and he might only toss up as to which of them should go to patagonia and remain there for the next ten years and which should have violet effingham for a wife in london  come along phineas if you mean to come said laurence fitzgibbon phineas was of course bound to go though lady glencora was still talking radicalism and violet effingham was still smiling ineffably      volume ii  chapter xxxviii  the duel   i knew it was a duelbedad i did said laurence fitzgibbon standing at the corner of orchard street and oxford street when phineas had half told his story i was sure of it from the tone of your voice my boy we mustnt let it come off thats allnot if we can help it then phineas was allowed to proceed and finish his story i dont see any way out of it i dont indeed said laurence by this time phineas had come to think that the duel was in very truth the best way out of the difficulty it was a bad way out but then it was a wayand he could not see any other as for ill treating him thats nonsense said laurence what are the girls to do if one fellow maynt come on as soon as another fellow is down but then you see a fellow never knows when hes down himself and therefore he thinks that hes ill used ill tell you what now i shouldnt wonder if we couldnt do it on the slyunless one of you is stupid enough to hit the other in an awkward place if you are certain of your hand now the right shoulder is the best spot phineas felt very certain that he would not hit lord chiltern in an awkward place although he was by no means sure of his hand let come what might he would not aim at his adversary but of this he had thought it proper to say nothing to laurence fitzgibbon  and the duel did come off on the sly the meeting in the drawingroom in portman square of which mention was made in the last chapter took place on a wednesday afternoon on the thursday friday monday and tuesday following the great debate on mr mildmays bill was continued and at three on the tuesday night the house divided there was a majority in favour of the ministers not large enough to permit them to claim a triumph for their party or even an ovation for themselves but still sufficient to enable them to send their bill into committee mr daubeny and mr turnbull had again joined their forces together in opposition to the ministerial measure on the thursday phineas had shown himself in the house but during the remainder of this interesting period he was absent from his place nor was he seen at the clubs nor did any man know of his whereabouts i think that lady laura kennedy was the first to miss him with any real sense of his absence she would now go to portman square on the afternoon of every sundayat which time her husband was attending the second service of his churchand there she would receive those whom she called her fathers guests but as her father was never there on the sundays and as these gatherings had been created by herself the reader will probably think that she was obeying her husbands behests in regard to the sabbath after a very indifferent fashion the reader may be quite sure however that mr kennedy knew well what was being done in portman square whatever might be lady lauras faults she did not commit the fault of disobeying her husband in secret there were probably a few words on the subject but we need not go very closely into that matter at the present moment  on the sunday which afforded some rest in the middle of the great reform debate lady laura asked for mr finn and no one could answer her question and then it was remembered that laurence fitzgibbon was also absent barrington erle knew nothing of phineashad heard nothing but was able to say that fitzgibbon had been with mr ratler the patronage secretary and liberal whip early on thursday expressing his intention of absenting himself for two days mr ratler had been wroth bidding him remain at his duty and pointing out to him the great importance of the moment then barrington erle quoted laurence fitzgibbons reply my boy said laurence to poor ratler the path of duty leads but to the grave all the same ill be in at the death ratler my boy as sure as the suns in heaven not ten minutes after the telling of this little story fitzgibbon entered the room in portman square and lady laura at once asked him after phineas bedad lady laura i have been out of town myself for two days and i know nothing  mr finn has not been with you then  with me nonot with me i had a job of business of my own which took me over to paris and has phinny fled too poor ratler i shouldnt wonder if it isnt an asylum hes in before the session is over  laurence fitzgibbon certainly possessed the rare accomplishment of telling a lie with a good grace had any man called him a liar he would have considered himself to be not only insulted but injured also he believed himself to be a man of truth there were however in his estimation certain subjects on which a man might depart as wide as the poles are asunder from truth without subjecting himself to any ignominy for falsehood in dealing with a tradesman as to his debts or with a rival as to a lady or with any man or woman in defence of a ladys character or in any such matter as that of a duel laurence believed that a gentleman was bound to lie and that he would be no gentleman if he hesitated to do so not the slightest prick of conscience disturbed him when he told lady laura that he had been in paris and that he knew nothing of phineas finn but in truth during the last day or two he had been in flanders and not in paris and had stood as second with his friend phineas on the sands at blankenberg a little fishingtown some twelve miles distant from bruges and had left his friend since that at an hotel at ostendwith a wound just under the shoulder from which a bullet had been extracted  the manner of the meeting had been in this wise captain colepepper and laurence fitzgibbon had held their meeting and at this meeting laurence had taken certain standingground on behalf of his friend and in obedience to his friends positive instructionwhich was this that his friend could not abandon his right of addressing the young lady should he hereafter ever think fit to do so let that be granted and laurence would do anything but then that could not be granted and laurence could only shrug his shoulders nor would laurence admit that his friend had been false the question lies in a nutshell said laurence with that sweet connaught brogue which always came to him when he desired to be effectivehere it is one gentleman tells another that hes sweet upon a young lady but that the young lady has refused him and always will refuse him for ever and ever thats the truth anyhow is the second gentleman bound by that not to address the young lady i say he is not bound itd be a dd hard tratement captain colepepper if a mans mouth and all the ardent affections of his heart were to be stopped in that manner by jases i dont know whod like to be the friend of any man if thats to be the way of it  captain colepepper was not very good at an argument i think theyd better see each other said colepepper pulling his thick grey moustache  if you choose to have it so so be it but i think it the hardest thing in the worldi do indeed then they put their heads together in the most friendly way and declared that the affair should if possible be kept private  on the thursday night lord chiltern and captain colepepper went over by calais and lille to bruges laurence fitzgibbon with his friend dr oshaughnessy crossed by the direct boat from dover to ostend phineas went to ostend by dover and calais but he took the day route on friday it had all been arranged among them so that there might be no suspicion as to the job in hand even oshaughnessy and laurence fitzgibbon had left london by separate trains they met on the sands at blankenberg about nine oclock on the saturday morning having reached that village in different vehicles from ostend and bruges and had met quite unobserved amidst the sandheaps but one shot had been exchanged and phineas had been wounded in the right shoulder he had proposed to exchange another shot with his left hand declaring his capability of shooting quite as well with the left as with the right but to this both colepepper and fitzgibbon had objected lord chiltern had offered to shake hands with his late friend in a true spirit of friendship if only his late friend would say that he did not intend to prosecute his suit with the young lady in all these disputes the young ladys name was never mentioned phineas indeed had not once named violet to fitzgibbon speaking of her always as the lady in question and though laurence correctly surmised the identity of the young lady he never hinted that he had even guessed her name i doubt whether lord chiltern had been so wary when alone with captain colepepper but then lord chiltern was when he spoke at all a very plainspoken man of course his lordships late friend phineas would give no such pledge and therefore lord chiltern moved off the ground and back to blankenberg and bruges and into brussels in still living enmity with our hero laurence and the doctor took phineas back to ostend and though the bullet was then in his shoulder phineas made his way through blankenberg after such a fashion that no one there knew what had occurred not a living soul except the five concerned was at that time aware that a duel had been fought among the sandhills  laurence fitzgibbon made his way to dover by the saturday nights boat and was able to show himself in portman square on the sunday know anything about phinny finn he said afterwards to barrington erle in answer to an inquiry from that anxious gentleman not a word i think youd better send the towncrier round after him barrington however did not feel quite so well assured of fitzgibbons truth as lady laura had done  dr oshaughnessy remained during the sunday and monday at ostend with his patient and the people at the inn only knew that mr finn had sprained his shoulder badly and on the tuesday they came back to london again via calais and dover no bone had been broken and phineas though his shoulder was very painful bore the journey well oshaughnessy had received a telegram on the monday telling him that the division would certainly take place on the tuesdayand on the tuesday at about ten in the evening phineas went down to the house by  youre here said ratler taking hold of him with an affection that was too warm yes im here said phineas wincing in agony but be a little careful theres a good fellow ive been down in kent and put my arm out  put your arm out have you said ratler observing the sling for the first time im sorry for that but youll stop and vote  yesill stop and vote ive come up for the purpose but i hope it wont be very late  there are both daubeny and gresham to speak yet and at least three others i dont suppose it will be much before three but youre all right now you can go down and smoke if you like in this way phineas finn spoke in the debate and heard the end of it voting for his party and fought his duel with lord chiltern in the middle of it  he did go and sit on a wellcushioned bench in the smokingroom and then was interrogated by many of his friends as to his mysterious absence he had he said been down in kent and had had an accident with his arm by which he had been confined when this questioner and that perceived that there was some little mystery in the matter the questioners did not push their questions but simply entertained their own surmises one indiscreet questioner however did trouble phineas sorely declaring that there must have been some affair in which a woman had had a part and asking after the young lady of kent this indiscreet questioner was laurence fitzgibbon who as phineas thought carried his spirit of intrigue a little too far phineas stayed and voted and then he went painfully home to his lodgings  how singular would it be if this affair of the duel should pass away and no one be a bit the wiser but those four men who had been with him on the sands at blankenberg again he wondered at his own luck he had told himself that a duel with lord chiltern must create a quarrel between him and lord chilterns relations and also between him and violet effingham that it must banish him from his comfortable seat for loughton and ruin him in regard to his political prospects and now he had fought his duel and was back in townand the thing seemed to have been a thing of nothing he had not as yet seen lady laura or violet but he had no doubt but they both were as much in the dark as other people the day might arrive he thought on which it would be pleasant for him to tell violet effingham what had occurred but that day had not come as yet whither lord chiltern had gone or what lord chiltern intended to do he had not any idea but he imagined that he should soon hear something of her brother from lady laura that lord chiltern should say a word to lady laura of what had occurredor to any other person in the worldhe did not in the least suspect there could be no man more likely to be reticent in such matters than lord chilternor more sure to be guided by an almost exaggerated sense of what honour required of him nor did he doubt the discretion of his friend fitzgibbonif only his friend might not damage the secret by being too discreet of the silence of the doctor and the captain he was by no means equally sure but even though they should gossip the gossiping would take so long a time in oozing out and becoming recognised information as to have lost much of its power for injuring him were lady laura to hear at this moment that he had been over to belgium and had fought a duel with lord chiltern respecting violet she would probably feel herself obliged to quarrel with him but no such obligation would rest on her if in the course of six or nine months she should gradually have become aware that such an encounter had taken place  lord chiltern during their interview at the rooms in great marlborough street had said a word to him about the seat in parliamenthad expressed some opinion that as he phineas finn was interfering with the views of the standish family in regard to miss effingham he ought not to keep the standish seat which had been conferred upon him in ignorance of any such intended interference phineas as he thought of this could not remember lord chilterns words but there was present to him an idea that such had been their purport was he bound in circumstances as they now existed to give up loughton he made up his mind that he was not so bound unless lord chiltern should demand from him that he should do so but nevertheless he was uneasy in his position it was quite true that the seat now was his for this session by all parliamentary law even though the electors themselves might wish to be rid of him and that lord brentford could not even open his mouth upon the matter in a tone more loud than that of a whisper but phineas feeling that he had consented to accept the favour of a corrupt seat from lord brentford felt also that he was bound to give up the spoil if it were demanded from him if it were demanded from him either by the father or the son it should be given up at once  on the following morning he found a leading article in the peoples banner devoted solely to himself during the late debateso ran a passage in the leading articlemr finn lord brentfords irish nominee for his pocketborough at loughton did at last manage to stand on his legs and open his mouth if we are not mistaken this is mr finns third session in parliament and hitherto he has been unable to articulate three sentences though he has on more than one occasion made the attempt for what special merit this young man has been selected for aristocratic patronage we do not knowbut that there must be some merit recognisable by aristocratic eyes we surmise three years ago he was a raw young irishman living in london as irishmen only know how to live earning nothing and apparently without means and then suddenly he bursts out as a member of parliament and as the friend of cabinet ministers the possession of one good gift must be acceded to the honourable member for loughtonhe is a handsome young man and looks to be as strong as a coalporter can it be that his promotion has sprung from this be this as it may we should like to know where he has been during his late mysterious absence from parliament and in what way he came by the wound in his arm even handsome young members of parliament f√™ted by titled ladies and their rich lords are amenable to the lawsto the laws of this country and to the laws of any other which it may suit them to visit for a while  infamous scoundrel said phineas to himself as he read this vile low disreputable blackguard it was clear enough however that quintus slide had found out something of his secret if so his only hope would rest on the fact that his friends were not likely to see the columns of the peoples banner     chapter xxxix  lady laura is told   by the time that mr mildmays great bill was going into committee phineas was able to move about london in comfortwith his arm however still in a sling there had been nothing more about him and his wound in the peoples banner and he was beginning to hope that that nuisance would also be allowed to die away he had seen lady laurahaving dined in grosvenor place where he had been petted to his hearts content his dinner had been cut up for him and his wound had been treated with the tenderest sympathy and singular to say no questions were asked he had been to kent and had come by an accident no more than that was told and his dear sympathising friends were content to receive so much information and to ask for no more but he had not as yet seen violet effingham and he was beginning to think that this romance about violet might as well be brought to a close he had not however as yet been able to go into crowded rooms and unless he went out to large parties he could not be sure that he would meet miss effingham  at last he resolved that he would tell lady laura the whole truthnot the truth about the duel but the truth about violet effingham and ask for her assistance when making this resolution i think that he must have forgotten much that he had learned of his friends character and by making it i think that he showed also that he had not learned as much as his opportunities might have taught him he knew lady lauras obstinacy of purpose he knew her devotion to her brother and he knew also how desirous she had been that her brother should win violet effingham for himself this knowledge should i think have sufficed to show him how improbable it was that lady laura should assist him in his enterprise but beyond all this was the facta fact as to the consequences of which phineas himself was entirely blind beautifully ignorantthat lady laura had once condescended to love himself nayshe had gone farther than this and had ventured to tell him even after her marriage that the remembrance of some feeling that had once dwelt in her heart in regard to him was still a danger to her she had warned him from loughlinter and then had received him in londonand now he selected her as his confidante in this love affair had he not been beautifully ignorant and most modestly blind he would surely have placed his confidence elsewhere  it was not that lady laura kennedy ever confessed to herself the existence of a vicious passion she had indeed learned to tell herself that she could not love her husband and once in the excitement of such silent announcements to herself she had asked herself whether her heart was quite a blank and had answered herself by desiring phineas finn to absent himself from loughlinter during all the subsequent winter she had scourged herself inwardly for her own imprudence her quite unnecessary folly in so doing what could not she laura standish who from her earliest years of girlish womanhood had resolved that she would use the world as men use it and not as women docould not she have felt the slight shock of a passing tenderness for a handsome youth without allowing the feeling to be a rock before her big enough and sharp enough for the destruction of her entire barque could not she command if not her heart at any rate her mind so that she might safely assure herself that whether this man or any man was here or there her course would be unaltered what though phineas finn had been in the same house with her throughout all the winter could not she have so lived with him on terms of friendship that every deed and word and look of her friendship might have been open to her husbandor open to all the world she could have done so she told herself that that was notneed not have been her great calamity whether she could endure the dull monotonous control of her slow but imperious lordor whether she must not rather tell him that it was not to be enduredthat was her trouble so she told herself and again admitted phineas to her intimacy in london but nevertheless phineas had he not been beautifully ignorant and most blind to his own achievements would not have expected from lady laura kennedy assistance with miss violet effingham  phineas knew when to find lady laura alone and he came upon her one day at the favourable hour the two first clauses of the bill had been passed after twenty fights and endless divisions two points had been settled as to which however mr gresham had been driven to give way so far and to yield so much that men declared that such a bill as the government could consent to call its own could never be passed by that parliament in that session immediately on his entrance into her room lady laura began about the third clause would the house let mr gresham have his way about the phineas stopped her at once my dear friend he said i have come to you in a private trouble and i want you to drop politics for half an hour i have come to you for help  a private trouble mr finn is it serious  it is very seriousbut it is no trouble of the kind of which you are thinking but it is serious enough to take up every thought  can i help you  indeed you can whether you will or no is a different thing  i would help you in anything in my power mr finn do you not know it  you have been very kind to me  and so would mr kennedy  mr kennedy cannot help me here  what is it mr finn  i suppose i may as well tell you at oncein plain language i do not know how to put my story into words that shall fit it i love violet effingham will you help me to win her to be my wife  you love violet effingham said lady laura and as she spoke the look of her countenance towards him was so changed that he became at once aware that from her no assistance might be expected his eyes were not opened in any degree to the second reason above given for lady lauras opposition to his wishes but he instantly perceived that she would still cling to that destination of violets hand which had for years past been the favourite scheme of her life have you not always known mr finn what have been our hopes for violet  phineas though he had perceived his mistake felt that he must go on with his cause lady laura must know his wishes sooner or later and it was as well that she should learn them in this way as in any other yesbut i have known also from your brothers own lipsand indeed from yours also lady laurathat chiltern has been three times refused by miss effingham  what does that matter do men never ask more than three times  and must i be debarred for ever while he prosecutes a hopeless suit  yesyou of all men  why so lady laura  because in this matter you have been his chosen friendand mine we have told you everything trusting to you we have believed in your honour we have thought that with you at any rate we were safe these words were very bitter to phineas and yet when he had written his letter at loughton he had intended to be so perfectly honest chivalrously honest now lady laura spoke to him and looked at him as though he had been most basely falsemost untrue to that noble friendship which had been lavished upon him by all her family he felt that he would become the prey of her most injurious thoughts unless he could fully explain his ideas and he felt also that the circumstances did not admit of his explaining them he could not take up the argument on violets side and show how unfair it would be to her that she should be debarred from the homage due to her by any man who really loved her because lord chiltern chose to think that he still had a claimor at any rate a chance and phineas knew well of himselfor thought that he knew wellthat he would not have interfered had there been any chance for lord chiltern lord chiltern had himself told him more than once that there was no such chance how was he to explain all this to lady laura mr finn said lady laura i can hardly believe this of you even when you tell it me yourself  listen to me lady laura for a moment  certainly i will listen but that you should come to me for assistance i cannot understand it men sometimes become harder than stones  i do not think that i am hard poor blind fool he was still thinking only of violet and of the accusation made against him that he was untrue to his friendship for lord chiltern of that other accusation which could not be expressed in open words he understood nothingnothing at all as yet  hard and falsecapable of receiving no impression beyond the outside husk of the heart  oh lady laura do not say that if you could only know how true i am in my affection for you all  and how do you show itby coming in between oswald and the only means that are open to us of reconciling him to his fathermeans that have been explained to you exactly as though you had been one of ourselves oswald has treated you as a brother in the matter telling you everything and this is the way you would repay him for his confidence  can i help it that i have learnt to love this girl  yes siryou can help it what if she had been oswalds wifewould you have loved her then do you speak of loving a woman as if it were an affair of fate over which you have no control i doubt whether your passions are so strong as that you had better put aside your love for miss effingham i feel assured that it will never hurt you then some remembrance of what had passed between him and lady laura standish near the falls of the linter when he first visited scotland came across his mind believe me she said with a smile this little wound in your heart will soon be cured  he stood silent before her looking away from her thinking over it all he certainly had believed himself to be violently in love with lady laura and yet when he had just now entered her drawingroom he had almost forgotten that there had been such a passage in his life and he had believed that she had forgotten iteven though she had counselled him not to come to loughlinter within the last nine months he had been a boy then and had not known himselfbut now he was a man and was proud of the intensity of his love there came upon him some passing throb of pain from his shoulder reminding him of the duel and he was proud also of that he had been willing to risk everythinglife prospects and positionsooner than abandon the slight hope which was his of possessing violet effingham and now he was told that this wound in his heart would soon be cured and was told so by a woman to whom he had once sung a song of another passion it is very hard to answer a woman in such circumstances because her womanhood gives her so strong a ground of vantage lady laura might venture to throw in his teeth the fickleness of his heart but he could not in reply tell her that to change a love was better than to marry without lovethat to be capable of such a change showed no such inferiority of nature as did the capacity for such a marriage she could hit him with her argument but he could only remember his and think how violent might be the blow he could inflictif it were not that she were a woman and therefore guarded you will not help me then he said when they had both been silent for a while  help you how should i help you  i wanted no other help than thisthat i might have had an opportunity of meeting violet here and of getting from her some answer  has the question then never been asked already said lady laura to this phineas made no immediate reply there was no reason why he should show his whole hand to an adversary why do you not go to lady baldocks house continued lady laura you are admitted there you know lady baldock go and ask her to stand your friend with her niece see what she will say to you as far as i understand these matters that is the fair honourable open way in which gentlemen are wont to make their overtures  i would make mine to none but to herself said phineas  then why have you made it to me sir demanded lady laura  i have come to you as i would to my sister  your sister psha i am not your sister mr finn nor were i so should i fail to remember that i have a dearer brother to whom my faith is pledged look here within the last three weeks oswald has sacrificed everything to his father because he was determined that mr kennedy should have the money which he thought was due to my husband he has enabled my father to do what he will with saulsby papa will never hurt himi know that hard as papa is with him he will never hurt oswalds future position papa is too proud to do that violet has heard what oswald has done and now that he has nothing of his own to offer her for the future but his bare title now that he has given papa power to do what he will with the property i believe that she would accept him instantly that is her disposition  phineas again paused a moment before he replied let him try he said  he is awayin brussels  send to him and bid him return i will be patient lady laura let him come and try and i will bide my time i confess that i have no right to interfere with him if there be a chance for him if there is no chance my right is as good as that of any other  there was something in this which made lady laura feel that she could not maintain her hostility against this man on behalf of her brotherand yet she could not force herself to be other than hostile to him her heart was sore and it was he that had made it sore she had lectured herself schooling herself with mental sackcloth and ashes rebuking herself with heaviest censures from day to day because she had found herself to be in danger of regarding this man with a perilous love and she had been constant in this work of penance till she had been able to assure herself that the sackcloth and ashes had done their work and that the danger was past i like him still and love him well she had said to herself with something almost of triumph but i have ceased to think of him as one who might have been my lover and yet she was now sick and sore almost beside herself with the agony of the wound because this man whom she had been able to throw aside from her heart had also been able so to throw her aside and she felt herself constrained to rebuke him with what bitterest words she might use she had felt it easy to do this at first on her brothers score she had accused him of treachery to his friendshipboth as to oswald and as to herself on that she could say cutting words without subjecting herself to suspicion even from herself but now this power was taken away from her and still she wished to wound him she desired to taunt him with his old fickleness and yet to subject herself to no imputation your right she said what gives you any right in the matter  simply the right of a fair field and no favour  and yet you come to me for favourto me because i am her friend you cannot win her yourself and think i may help you i do not believe in your love for her there if there were no other reason and i could help you i would not because i think your heart is a sham heart she is pretty and has money  lady laura  she is pretty and has money and is the fashion i do not wonder that you should wish to have her but mr finn i believe that oswald really loves herand that you do not his nature is deeper than yours  he understood it all now as he listened to the tone of her voice and looked into the lines of her face there was written there plainly enough that spret√¶ injuria form√¶ of which she herself was conscious but only conscious even his eyes blind as he had been were openedand he knew that he had been a fool  i am sorry that i came to you he said  it would have been better that you should not have done so she replied  and yet perhaps it is well that there should be no misunderstanding between us  of course i must tell my brother  he paused but for a moment and then he answered her with a sharp voice he has been told  and who told him  i did i wrote to him the moment that i knew my own mind i owed it to him to do so but my letter missed him and he only learned it the other day  have you seen him since  yesi have seen him  and what did he say how did he take it did he bear it from you quietly  no indeed and phineas smiled as he spoke  tell me mr finn what happened what is to be done  nothing is to be done everything has been done i may as well tell you all i am sure that for the sake of me as well as of your brother you will keep our secret he required that i should either give up my suit or that i shouldfight him as i could not comply with the one request i found myself bound to comply with the other  and there has been a duel  yesthere has been a duel we went over to belgium and it was soon settled he wounded me here in the arm  suppose you had killed him mr finn  that lady laura would have been a misfortune so terrible that i was bound to prevent it then he paused again regretting what he had said you have surprised me lady laura into an answer that i should not have made i may be suremay i notthat my words will not go beyond yourself  yesyou may be sure of that this she said plaintively with a tone of voice and demeanour of body altogether different from that which she lately bore neither of them knew what was taking place between them but she was in truth gradually submitting herself again to this mans influence though she rebuked him at every turn for what he said for what he had done for what he proposed to do still she could not teach herself to despise him or even to cease to love him for any part of it she knew it all nowexcept that word or two which had passed between violet and phineas in the rides of saulsby park but she suspected something even of that feeling sure that the only matter on which phineas would say nothing would be that of his own successif success there had been and so you and oswald have quarrelled and there has been a duel that is why you were away  that is why i was away  how wrong of youhow very wrong had he beenkilled how could you have looked us in the face again  i could not have looked you in the face again  but that is over now and were you friends afterwards  nowe did not part as friends having gone there to fight with himmost unwillinglyi could not afterwards promise him that i would give up miss effingham you say she will accept him now let him come and try she had nothing further to sayno other argument to use there was the soreness at her heart still present to her making her wretched instigating her to hurt him if she knew how to do so in spite of her regard for him but she felt that she was weak and powerless she had shot her arrows at himall but oneand if she used that its poisoned point would wound herself far more surely than it would touch him the duel was very silly he said you will not speak of it  no certainly not  i am glad at least that i have told you everything  i do not know why you should be glad i cannot help you  and you will say nothing to violet  everything that i can say in oswalds favour i will say nothing of the duel but beyond that you have no right to demand my secrecy with her yes you had better go mr finn for i am hardly well and remember thisif you can forget this little episode about miss effingham so will i forget it also and so will oswald i can promise for him then she smiled and gave him her hand and he went  she rose from her chair as he left the room and waited till she heard the sound of the great door closing behind him before she again sat down then when he was gonewhen she was sure that he was no longer there with her in the same houseshe laid her head down upon the arm of the sofa and burst into a flood of tears she was no longer angry with phineas there was no further longing in her heart for revenge she did not now desire to injure him though she had done so as long as he was with her nayshe resolved instantly almost instinctively that lord brentford must know nothing of all this lest the political prospects of the young member for loughton should be injured to have rebuked him to rebuke him again and again would be only fairwould at least be womanly but she would protect him from all material injury as far as her power of protection might avail and why was she weeping now so bitterly of course she asked herself as she rubbed away the tears with her handswhy should she weep she was not weak enough to tell herself that she was weeping for any injury that had been done to oswald she got up suddenly from the sofa and pushed away her hair from her face and pushed away the tears from her cheeks and then clenched her fists as she held them out at full length from her body and stood looking up with her eyes fixed upon the wall ass she exclaimed fool idiot that i should not be able to crush it into nothing and have done with it why should he not have her after all he is better than oswald ohis that you the door of the room had been opened while she was standing thus and her husband had entered  yesit is i is anything wrong  very much is wrong  what is it laura  you cannot help me  if you are in trouble you should tell me what it is and leave it to me to try to help you  nonsense she said shaking her head  laura that is uncourteousnot to say undutiful also  i suppose it wasboth i beg your pardon but i could not help it  laura you should help such words to me  there are moments robert when even a married woman must be herself rather than her husbands wife it is so though you cannot understand it  i certainly do not understand it  you cannot make a woman subject to you as a dog is so you may have all the outside and as much of the inside as you can master with a dog you may be sure of both  i suppose this means that you have secrets in which i am not to share  i have troubles about my father and my brother which you cannot share my brother is a ruined man  who ruined him  i will not talk about it any more i will not speak to you of him or of papa i only want you to understand that there is a subject which must be secret to myself and on which i may be allowed to shed tearsif i am so weak i will not trouble you on a matter in which i have not your sympathy then she left him standing in the middle of the room depressed by what had occurredbut not thinking of it as of a trouble which would do more than make him uncomfortable for that day     chapter xl  madame max goesler   day after day and clause after clause the bill was fought in committee and few men fought with more constancy on the side of the ministers than did the member for loughton troubled though he was by his quarrel with lord chiltern by his love for violet effingham by the silence of his friend lady laurafor since he had told her of the duel she had become silent to him never writing to him and hardly speaking to him when she met him in societynevertheless phineas was not so troubled but what he could work at his vocation now when he would find himself upon his legs in the house he would wonder at the hesitation which had lately troubled him so sorely he would sit sometimes and speculate upon that dimness of eye upon that tendency of things to go round upon that obtrusive palpitation of heart which had afflicted him so seriously for so long a time the house now was no more to him than any other chamber and the members no more than other men he guarded himself from orations speaking always very shortlybecause he believed that policy and good judgment required that he should be short but words were very easy to him and he would feel as though he could talk for ever and there quickly came to him a reputation for practical usefulness he was a man with strong opinions who could yet be submissive and no man seemed to know how his reputation had come he had made one good speech after two or three failures all who knew him his whole party had been aware of his failure and his one good speech had been regarded by many as no very wonderful effort but he was a man who was pleasant to other mennot combative not selfasserting beyond the point at which selfassertion ceases to be a necessity of manliness nature had been very good to him making him comely inside and outand with this comeliness he had crept into popularity  the secret of the duel was i think at this time known to a great many men and women so phineas perceived but it was not he thought known either to lord brentford or to violet effingham and in this he was right no rumour of it had yet reached the ears of either of these personsand rumour though she flies so fast and so far is often slow in reaching those ears which would be most interested in her tidings some dim report of the duel reached even mr kennedy and he asked his wife who told you said she sharply  bonteen told me that it was certainly so  mr bonteen always knows more than anybody else about everything except his own business  then it is not true  lady laura pausedand then she lied of course it is not true i should be very sorry to ask either of them but to me it seems to be the most improbable thing in life then mr kennedy believed that there had been no duel in his wifes word he put absolute faith and he thought that she would certainly know anything that her brother had done as he was a man given to but little discourse he asked no further questions about the duel either in the house or at the clubs  at first phineas had been greatly dismayed when men had asked him questions tending to elicit from him some explanation of the mysterybut by degrees he became used to it and as the tidings which had got abroad did not seem to injure him and as the questionings were not pushed very closely he became indifferent there came out another article in the peoples banner in which lord cn and mr ps fn were spoken of as glaring examples of that aristocratic snobilitythat was the expressive word coined evidently with great delight for the occasionwhich the rotten state of london society in high quarters now produced here was a young lord infamously notorious quarrelling with one of his booncompanions whom he had appointed to a private seat in the house of commons fighting duels breaking the laws scandalising the publicand all this was done without punishment to the guilty there were old stories afloatso said the articleof what in a former century had been done by lord mohuns and mr bests but now in 186 c c c and so the article went on any reader may fill in without difficulty the concluding indignation and virtuous appeal for reform in social morals as well as parliament but phineas had so far progressed that he had almost come to like this kind of thing  certainly i think that the duel did him no harm in society otherwise he would hardly have been asked to a semipolitical dinner at lady glencora pallisers even though he might have been invited to make one of the five hundred guests who were crowded into her saloons and staircases after the dinner was over to have been one of the five hundred was nothing but to be one of the sixteen was a great dealwas indeed so much that phineas not understanding as yet the advantage of his own comeliness was at a loss to conceive why so pleasant an honour was conferred upon him there was no man among the eight men at the dinnerparty not in parliamentand the only other except phineas not attached to the government was mr pallisers great friend john grey the member for silverbridge there were four cabinet ministers in the roomthe duke lord cantrip mr gresham and the owner of the mansion there was also barrington erle and young lord fawn an undersecretary of state but the wit and grace of the ladies present lent more of character to the party than even the position of the men lady glencora palliser herself was a host there was no woman then in london better able to talk to a dozen people on a dozen subjects and then moreover she was still in the flush of her beauty and the bloom of her youth lady laura was thereby what means divided from her husband phineas could not imagine but lady glencora was good at such divisions lady cantrip had been allowed to come with her lordbut as was well understood lord cantrip was not so manifestly a husband as was mr kennedy there are men who cannot guard themselves from the assertion of marital rights at most inappropriate moments now lord cantrip lived with his wife most happily yet you should pass hours with him and her together and hardly know that they knew each other one of the dukes daughters was therebut not the duchess who was known to be heavyand there was the beauteous marchioness of hartletop violet effingham was in the room alsogiving phineas a blow at the heart as he saw her smile might it be that he could speak a word to her on this occasion mr grey had also brought his wifeand then there was madame max goesler phineas found that it was his fortune to take down to dinnernot violet effingham but madame max goesler and when he was placed at dinner on the other side of him there sat lady hartletop who addressed the few words which she spoke exclusively to mr palliser there had been in former days matters difficult of arrangement between those two but i think that those old passages had now been forgotten by them both phineas was therefore driven to depend exclusively on madame max goesler for conversation and he found that he was not called upon to cast his seed into barren ground  up to that moment he had never heard of madame max goesler lady glencora in introducing them had pronounced the ladys name so clearly that he had caught it with accuracy but he could not surmise whence she had come or why she was there she was a woman probably something over thirty years of age she had thick black hair which she wore in curlsunlike anybody else in the worldin curls which hung down low beneath her face covering and perhaps intended to cover a certain thinness in her cheeks which would otherwise have taken something from the charm of her countenance her eyes were large of a dark blue colour and very brightand she used them in a manner which is as yet hardly common with englishwomen she seemed to intend that you should know that she employed them to conquer you looking as a knight may have looked in olden days who entered a chamber with his sword drawn from the scabbard and in his hand her forehead was broad and somewhat low her nose was not classically beautiful being broader at the nostrils than beauty required and moreover not perfectly straight in its line her lips were thin her teeth which she endeavoured to show as little as possible were perfect in form and colour they who criticised her severely said however that they were too large her chin was well formed and divided by a dimple which gave to her face a softness of grace which would otherwise have been much missed but perhaps her great beauty was in the brilliant clearness of her dark complexion you might almost fancy that you could see into it so as to read the different lines beneath the skin she was somewhat tall though by no means tall to a fault and was so thin as to be almost meagre in her proportions she always wore her dress close up to her neck and never showed the bareness of her arms though she was the only woman so clad now present in the room this singularity did not specially strike one because in other respects her apparel was so rich and quaint as to make inattention to it impossible the observer who did not observe very closely would perceive that madame max goeslers dress was unlike the dress of other women but seeing that it was unlike in make unlike in colour and unlike in material the ordinary observer would not see also that it was unlike in form for any other purpose than that of maintaining its general peculiarity of character in colour she was abundant and yet the fabric of her garment was always black my pen may not dare to describe the traceries of yellow and ruby silk which went in and out through the black lace across her bosom and round her neck and over her shoulders and along her arms and down to the very ground at her feet robbing the black stuff of all its sombre solemnity and producing a brightness in which there was nothing gaudy she wore no vestige of crinoline and hardly anything that could be called a train and the lace sleeves of her dress with their bright traceries of silk were fitted close to her arms and round her neck she wore the smallest possible collar of lace above which there was a short chain of roman gold with a ruby pendant and she had rubies in her ears and a ruby brooch and rubies in the bracelets on her arms such as regarded the outward woman was madame max goesler and phineas as he took his place by her side thought that fortune for the nonce had done well with himonly that he should have liked it so much better could he have been seated next to violet effingham  i have said that in the matter of conversation his morsel of seed was not thrown into barren ground i do not know that he can truly be said to have produced even a morsel the subjects were all mooted by the lady and so great was her fertility in discoursing that all conversational grasses seemed to grow with her spontaneously mr finn she said what would i not give to be a member of the british parliament at such a moment as this  why at such a moment as this particularly  because there is something to be done which let me tell you senator though you are is not always the case with you  my experience is short but it sometimes seems to me that there is too much to be done  too much of nothingness mr finn is not that the case but now there is a real fight in the lists the one great drawback to the life of women is that they cannot act in politics  and which side would you take  what here in england said madame max goeslerfrom which expression and from one or two others of a similar nature phineas was led into a doubt whether the lady were a countrywoman of his or not indeed it is hard to say politically i should want to outturnbull mr turnbull to vote for everything that could be voted forballot manhood suffrage womanhood suffrage unlimited right of striking tenant right education of everybody annual parliaments and the abolition of at least the bench of bishops  that is a strong programme said phineas  it is strong mr finn but thats what i should like i think however that i should be tempted to feel a dastard security in the conviction that i might advocate my views without any danger of seeing them carried out for to tell you the truth i dont at all want to put down ladies and gentlemen  you think that they would go with the bench of bishops  i dont want anything to gothat is as far as real life is concerned theres that dear good bishop of abingdon is the best friend i have in the worldand as for the bishop of dorchester id walk from here to there to hear him preach and id sooner hem aprons for them all myself than that they should want those pretty decorations but then mr finn there is such a difference between life and theoryis there not  and it is so comfortable to have theories that one is not bound to carry out said phineas  isnt it mr palliser do you live up to your political theories at this moment mr palliser was sitting perfectly silent between lady hartletop and the dukes daughter and he gave a little spring in his chair as this sudden address was made to him your house of commons theories i mean mr palliser mr finn is saying that it is very well to have far advanced ideasit does not matter how far advancedbecause one is never called upon to act upon them practically  that is a dangerous doctrine i think said mr palliser  but pleasantso at least mr finn says  it is at least very common said phineas not caring to protect himself by a contradiction  for myself said mr palliser gravely i think i may say that i always am really anxious to carry into practice all those doctrines of policy which i advocate in theory  during this conversation lady hartletop sat as though no word of it reached her ears she did not understand madame max goesler and by no means loved her mr palliser when he had made his little speech turned to the dukes daughter and asked some question about the conservatories at longroyston  i have called forth a word of wisdom said madame max goesler almost in a whisper  yes said phineas and taught a cabinet minister to believe that i am a most unsound politician you may have ruined my prospects for life madame max goesler  let me hope not as far as i can understand the way of things in your government the aspirants to office succeed chiefly by making themselves uncommonly unpleasant to those who are in power if a man can hit hard enough he is sure to be taken into the elysium of the treasury benchnot that he may hit others but that he may cease to hit those who are there i dont think men are chosen because they are useful  you are very severe upon us all  indeed as far as i can see one man is as useful as another but to put aside jokingthey tell me that you are sure to become a minister  phineas felt that he blushed could it be that people said of him behind his back that he was a man likely to rise high in political position your informants are very kind he replied awkwardly but i do not know who they are i shall never get up in the way you describethat is by abusing the men i support  after that madame max goesler turned round to mr grey who was sitting on the other side of her and phineas was left for a moment in silence he tried to say a word to lady hartletop but lady hartletop only bowed her head gracefully in recognition of the truth of the statement he made so he applied himself for a while to his dinner  what do you think of miss effingham said madame max goesler again addressing him suddenly  what do i think about her  you know her i suppose  oh yes i know her she is closely connected with the kennedys who are friends of mine  so i have heard they tell me that scores of men are raving about her are you one of them  oh yesi dont mind being one of sundry scores there is nothing particular in owning to that  but you admire her  of course i do said phineas  ah i see you are joking i do amazingly they say women never do admire women but i most sincerely do admire miss effingham  is she a friend of yours  oh noi must not dare to say so much as that i was with her last winter for a week at matching and of course i meet her about at peoples houses she seems to me to be the most independent girl i ever knew in my life i do believe that nothing would make her marry a man unless she loved him and honoured him and i think it is so very seldom that you can say that of a girl  i believe so also said phineas then he paused a moment before he continued to speak i cannot say that i know miss effingham very intimately but from what i have seen of her i should think it very probable that she may not marry at all  very probably said madame max goesler who then again turned away to mr grey  ten minutes after this when the moment was just at hand in which the ladies were to retreat madame max goesler again addressed phineas looking very full into his face as she did so i wonder whether the time will ever come mr finn in which you will give me an account of that days journey to blankenberg  to blankenberg  yesto blankenberg i am not asking for it now but i shall look for it some day then lady glencora rose from her seat and madame max goesler went out with the others     chapter xli  lord fawn   what had madame max goesler to do with his journey to blankenberg thought phineas as he sat for a while in silence between mr palliser and mr grey and why should she who was a perfect stranger to him have dared to ask him such a question but as the conversation round the table after the ladies had gone soon drifted into politics and became general phineas for a while forgot madame max goesler and the blankenberg journey and listened to the eager words of cabinet ministers now and again uttering a word of his own and showing that he too was as eager as others but the session in mr pallisers diningroom was not long and phineas soon found himself making his way amidst a throng of coming guests into the rooms above his object was to meet violet effingham but failing that he would not be unwilling to say a few more words to madame max goesler  he first encountered lady laura to whom he had not spoken as yet and finding himself standing close to her for a while he asked her after his late neighbour do tell me one thing lady laurawho is madame max goesler and why have i never met her before  that will be two things mr finn but i will answer both questions as well as i can you have not met her before because she was in germany last spring and summer and in the year before that you were not about so much as you have been since still you must have seen her i think she is the widow of an austrian banker and has lived the greater part of her life at vienna she is very rich and has a small house in park lane where she receives people so exclusively that it has come to be thought an honour to be invited by madame max goesler her enemies say that her father was a german jew living in england in the employment of the viennese bankers and they say also that she has been married a second time to an austrian count to whom she allows ever so much a year to stay away from her but of all this nobody i fancy knows anything what they do know is that madame max goesler spends seven or eight thousand a year and that she will give no man an opportunity of even asking her to marry him people used to be shy of her but she goes almost everywhere now  she has not been at portman square  oh no but then lady glencora is so much more advanced than we are after all we are but humdrum people as the world goes now  then phineas began to roam about the rooms striving to find an opportunity of engrossing five minutes of miss effinghams attention during the time that lady laura was giving him the history of madame max goesler his eyes had wandered round and he had perceived that violet was standing in the further corner of a large lobby on to which the stairs openedso situated indeed that she could hardly escape because of the increasing crowd but on that very account almost impossible to be reached he could see also that she was talking to lord fawn an unmarried peer of something over thirty years of age with an unrivalled pair of whiskers a small estate and a rising political reputation lord fawn had been talking to violet through the whole dinner and phineas was beginning to think that he should like to make another journey to blankenberg with the object of meeting his lordship on the sands when lady laura had done speaking his eyes were turned through a large open doorway towards the spot on which his idol was standing it is of no use my friend she said touching his arm i wish i could make you know that it is of no use because then i think you would be happier to this phineas made no answer but went and roamed about the rooms why should it be of no use would violet effingham marry any man merely because he was a lord  some halfhour after this he had succeeded in making his way up to the place in which violet was still standing with lord fawn beside her i have been making such a struggle to get to you he said  and now you are here you will have to stay for it is impossible to get out she answered lord fawn has made the attempt halfadozen times but has failed grievously  i have been quite contented said lord fawnmore than contented  phineas felt that he ought to give some special reason to miss effingham to account for his efforts to reach her but yet he had nothing special to say had lord fawn not been there he would immediately have told her that he was waiting for an answer to the question he had asked her in saulsby park but he could hardly do this in presence of the noble undersecretary of state she received him with her pleasant genial smile looking exactly as she had looked when he had parted from her on the morning after their ride she did not show any sign of anger or even of indifference at his approach but still it was almost necessary that he should account for his search of her i have so longed to hear from you how you got on at loughlinter he said  yesyes and i will tell you something of it some day perhaps why do you not come to lady baldocks  i did not even know that lady baldock was in town  you ought to have known of course she is in town where did you suppose i was living lord fawn was there yesterday and can tell you that my aunt is quite blooming  lady baldock is blooming said lord fawn certainly bloomingthat is if evergreens may be said to bloom  evergreens do bloom as well as spring plants lord fawn you come and see her mr finnonly you must bring a little money with you for the female protestant unmarried womens emigration society that is my aunts present hobby as lord fawn knows to his cost  i wish i may never spend halfasovereign worse  but it is a perilous affair for me as my aunt wants me to go out as a sort of leading protestant unmarried female emigrant pioneer myself  you dont mean that said lord fawn with much anxiety  of course youll go said phineas i should if i were you  i am in doubt said violet  it is such a grand prospect said he such an opening in life so much excitement you know and such a useful career  as if there were not plenty of opening here for miss effingham said lord fawn and plenty of excitement  do you think there is said violet you are much more civil than mr finn i must say then phineas began to hope that he need not be afraid of lord fawn what a happy man you were at dinner continued violet addressing herself to phineas  i thought lord fawn was the happy man  you had madame max goesler all to yourself for nearly two hours and i suppose there was not a creature in the room who did not envy you i dont doubt that ever so much interest was made with lady glencora as to taking madame max down to dinner lord fawn i know intrigued  miss effingham really i mustcontradict you  and barrington erle begged for it as a particular favour the duke with a sigh owned that it was impossible because of his cumbrous rank and mr gresham when it was offered to him declared that he was fatigued with the business of the house and not up to the occasion how much did she say to you and what did she talk about  the ballot chieflythat and manhood suffrage  ah she said something more than that i am sure madame max goesler never lets any man go without entrancing him if you have anything near your heart mr finn madame max goesler touched it i am sure now phineas had two things near his heartpolitical promotion and violet effinghamand madame max goesler had managed to touch them both she had asked him respecting his journey to blankenberg and had touched him very nearly in reference to miss effingham you know madame max goesler of course said violet to lord fawn  oh yes i know the ladythat is as well as other people do no one i take it knows much of her and it seems to me that the world is becoming tired of her a mystery is good for nothing if it remains always a mystery  and it is good for nothing at all when it is found out said violet  and therefore it is that madame max goesler is a bore said lord fawn  you did not find her a bore said violet then phineas choosing to oppose lord fawn as well as he could on that matter as on every other declared that he had found madame max goesler most delightful and beautifulis she not said violet  beautiful exclaimed lord fawn  i think her very beautiful said phineas  so do i said violet and she is a dear ally of mine we were a week together last winter and swore an undying friendship she told me ever so much about mr goesler  but she told you nothing of her second husband said lord fawn  now that you have run into scandal i shall have done said violet  half an hour after this when phineas was preparing to fight his way out of the house he was again close to madame max goesler he had not found a single moment in which to ask violet for an answer to his old question and was retiring from the field discomfited but not dispirited lord fawn he thought was not a serious obstacle in his way lady laura had told him that there was no hope for him but then lady lauras mind on that subject was he thought prejudiced violet effingham certainly knew what were his wishes and knowing them smiled on him and was gracious to him would she do so if his pretensions were thoroughly objectionable to her  i saw that you were successful this evening said madame max goesler to him  i was not aware of any success  i call it great success to be able to make your way where you will through such a crowd as there is here you seem to me to be so stout a cavalier that i shall ask you to find my servant and bid him get my carriage will you mind phineas of course declared that he would be delighted he is a german and not in livery but if somebody will call out he will hear he is very sharp and much more attentive than your english footmen an englishman hardly ever makes a good servant  is that a compliment to us britons  no certainly not if a man is a servant he should be clever enough to be a good one phineas had now given the order for the carriage and having returned was standing with madame max goesler in the cloakroom after all we are surely the most awkward people in the world she said you know lord fawn who was talking to miss effingham just now you should have heard him trying to pay me a compliment before dinner it was like a donkey walking a minuet and yet they say he is a clever man and can make speeches could it be possible that madame max goeslers ears were so sharp that she had heard the things which lord fawn had said of her  he is a wellinformed man said phineas  for a lord you mean said madame max goesler but he is an oaf is he not and yet they say he is to marry that girl  i do not think he will said phineas stoutly  i hope not with all my heart and i hope that somebody else mayunless somebody else should change his mind thank you i am so much obliged to you mind you come and call on me193 park lane i dare say you know the little cottage then he put madame max goesler into her carriage and walked away to his club     chapter xlii  lady baldock does not send a card to phineas finn   lady baldocks house in berkeley square was very statelya large house with five front windows in a row and a big door and a huge square hall and a fat porter in a roundtopped chairbut it was dingy and dull and could not have been painted for the last ten years or furnished for the last twenty nevertheless lady baldock had evenings and people went to themthough not such a crowd of people as would go to the evenings of lady glencora now mr phineas finn had not been asked to the evenings of lady baldock for the present season and the reason was after this wise  yes mr finn lady baldock had said to her daughter who early in the spring was preparing the cards you may send one to mr finn certainly  i dont know that he is very nice said augusta boreham whose eyes at saulsby had been sharper perhaps than her mothers and who had her suspicions  but lady baldock did not like interference from her daughter mr finn certainly she continued they tell me that he is a very rising young man and he sits for lord brentfords borough of course he is a radical but we cannot help that all the rising young men are radicals now i thought him very civil at saulsby  but mamma  well  dont you think that he is a little free with violet  what on earth do you mean augusta  have you not fancied that he isfond of her  good gracious no  i think he is and i have sometimes fancied that she is fond of him too  i dont believe a word of it augustanot a word i should have seen it if it was so i am very sharp in seeing such things they never escape me even violet would not be such a fool as that send him a card and if he comes i shall soon see miss boreham quite understood her mother though she could never master herand the card was prepared miss boreham could never master her mother by her own efforts but it was i think by a little intrigue on her part that lady baldock was mastered and indeed altogether cowed in reference to our hero and that this victory was gained on that very afternoon in time to prevent the sending of the card  when the mother and daughter were at tea before dinner lord baldock came into the room and after having been patted and petted and praised by his mother he took up all the cards out of a china bowl and ran his eyes over them lord fawn he said the greatest ass in all london lady hartletop you know she wont come i dont see why she shouldnt come said lady baldocka mere country clergymans daughter julius c√¶sar conwaya great friend of mine and therefore he always blackballs my other friends at the club lord chiltern i thought you were at daggers drawn with chiltern they say he is going to be reconciled to his father gustavus and i do it for lord brentfords sake and he wont come so it does not signify and i do believe that violet has really refused him you are quite right about his not coming said lord baldock continuing to read the cards chiltern certainly wont come count sparrowskyi wonder what you know about sparrowsky that you should ask him here he is asked about gustavus he is indeed pleaded lady baldock i believe that sparrowsky is a penniless adventurer mr monk well he is a cabinet minister sir gregory greeswing you mix your people nicely at any rate sir gregory greeswing is the most oldfashioned tory in england of course we are not political gustavus phineas finn they come alternatelyone and one  mr finn is asked everywhere gustavus  i dont doubt it they say he is a very good sort of fellow they say also that violet has found that out as well as other people  what do you mean gustavus  i mean that everybody is saying that this phineas finn is going to set himself up in the world by marrying your niece he is quite right to try it on if he has a chance  i dont think he would be right at all said lady baldock with much energy i think he would be wrongshamefully wrong they say he is the son of an irish doctor and that he hasnt a shilling in the world  that is just why he would be right what is such a man to do but to marry money hes a deuced goodlooking fellow too and will be sure to do it  he should work for his money in the city then or somewhere there but i dont believe it gustavus i dont indeed  very well i only tell you what i hear the fact is that he and chiltern have already quarrelled about her if i were to tell you that they have been over to holland together and fought a duel about her you wouldnt believe that  fought a duel about violet people dont fight duels now and i should not believe it  very well then send your card to mr finn and so saying lord baldock left the room  lady baldock sat in silence for some time toasting her toes at the fire and augusta boreham sat by waiting for orders she felt pretty nearly sure that new orders would be given if she did not herself interfere you had better put by that card for the present my dear said lady baldock at last i will make inquiries i dont believe a word of what gustavus has said i dont think that even violet is such a fool as that but if rash and illnatured people have spoken of it it may be as well to be careful  it is always well to be carefulis it not mamma  not but what i think it very improper that these things should be said about a young woman and as for the story of the duel i dont believe a word of it it is absurd i dare say that gustavus invented it at the moment just to amuse himself  the card of course was not sent and lady baldock at any rate put so much faith in her sons story as to make her feel it to be her duty to interrogate her niece on the subject lady baldock at this period of her life was certainly not free from fear of violet effingham in the numerous encounters which took place between them the aunt seldom gained that amount of victory which would have completely satisfied her spirit she longed to be dominant over her niece as she was dominant over her daughter and when she found that she missed such supremacy she longed to tell violet to depart from out her borders and be no longer niece of hers but had she ever done so violet would have gone at the instant and then terrible things would have followed there is a satisfaction in turning out of doors a nephew or niece who is pecuniarily dependent but when the youthful relative is richly endowed the satisfaction is much diminished it is the duty of a guardian no doubt to look after the ward but if this cannot be done the wards money should at least be held with as close a fist as possible but lady baldock though she knew that she would be sorely wounded poked about on her old body with the sharp lances of disobedience and struck with the cruel swords of satire if she took upon herself to scold or even to question violet nevertheless would not abandon the pleasure of lecturing and teaching it is my duty she would say to herself and though it be taken in a bad spirit i will always perform my duty so she performed her duty and asked violet effingham some few questions respecting phineas finn my dear she said do you remember meeting a mr finn at saulsby  a mr finn aunt why he is a particular friend of mine of course i do and he was at saulsby i have met him there more than once dont you remember that we were riding about together  i remember that he was there certainly but i did not know that he was a specialfriend  most especial aunt a 1 i may sayamong young men i mean  lady baldock was certainly the most indiscreet of old women in such a matter as this and violet the most provoking of young ladies lady baldock believing that there was something to fearas indeed there was much to fearshould have been content to destroy the card and to keep the young lady away from the young gentleman if such keeping away was possible to her but miss effingham was certainly very wrong to speak of any young man as being a 1 fond as i am of miss effingham i cannot justify her and must acknowledge that she used the most offensive phrase she could find on purpose to annoy her aunt  violet said lady baldock bridling up i never heard such a word before from the lips of a young lady  not as a 1 i thought it simply meant very good  a 1 is a nobleman said lady baldock  no aunta 1 is a shipa ship that is very good said violet  and do you mean to say that mr finn isisisvery good  yes indeed you ask lord brentford and mr kennedy you know he saved poor mr kennedy from being throttled in the streets  that has nothing to do with it a policeman might have done that  then he would have been a 1 of policementhough a 1 does not mean a policeman  he would have done his duty and so perhaps did mr finn  of course he did aunt it couldnt have been his duty to stand by and see mr kennedy throttled and he nearly killed one of the men and took the other prisoner with his own hands and he made a beautiful speech the other day i read every word of it i am so glad hes a liberal i do like young men to be liberals now lord baldock was a tory as had been all the lord baldockssince the first who had been bought over from the whigs in the time of george iii at the cost of a barony  you have nothing to do with politics violet  why shouldnt i have something to do with politics aunt  and i must tell you that your name is being very unpleasantly mentioned in connection with that of this young man because of your indiscretion  what indiscretion violet as she made her demand for a more direct accusation stood quite upright before her aunt looking the old woman full in the facealmost with her arms akimbo  calling him a 1 violet  people have been talking about me and mr finn because i just now at this very moment called him a 1 to you if you want to scold me about anything aunt do find out something less ridiculous than that  it was most improper languageand if you used it to me i am sure you would to others  to what others  to mr finnand those sort of people  call mr finn a 1 to his face wellupon my honour i dont know why i should not lord chiltern says he rides beautifully and if we were talking about riding i might do so  you have no business to talk to lord chiltern about mr finn at all  have i not i thought that perhaps the one sin might palliate the other you know aunt no young lady let her be ever so illdisposed can marry two objectionable young menat the same time  i said nothing about your marrying mr finn  then aunt what did you mean  i meant that you should not allow yourself to be talked of with an adventurer a young man without a shilling a person who has come from nobody knows where in the bogs of ireland  but you used to ask him here  yesas long as he knew his place but i shall not do so again and i must beg you to be circumspect  my dear aunt we may as well understand each other i will not be circumspect as you call it and if mr finn asked me to marry him tomorrow and if i liked him well enough i would take himeven though he had been dug right out of a bog not only because i liked himmind if i were unfortunate enough to like a man who was nothing i would refuse him in spite of my likingbecause he was nothing but this young man is not nothing mr finn is a fine fellow and if there were no other reason to prevent my marrying him than his being the son of a doctor and coming out of the bogs that would not do so now i have made a clean breast to you as regards mr finn and if you do not like what ive said aunt you must acknowledge that you have brought it on yourself  lady baldock was left for a time speechless but no card was sent to phineas finn     chapter xliii  promotion   phineas got no card from lady baldock but one morning he received a note from lord brentford which was of more importance to him than any card could have been at this time bit by bit the reform bill of the day had nearly made its way through the committee but had been so mutilated as to be almost impossible of recognition by its progenitors and there was still a clause or two as to the rearrangement of seats respecting which it was known that there would be a combatprobably combatscarried on after the internecine fashion there was a certain clipping of counties to be done as to which it was said that mr daubeny had declared that he would not yield till he was made to do so by the brute force of majoritiesand there was another clause for the drafting of certain superfluous members from little boroughs and bestowing them on populous towns at which they were much wanted respecting which mr turnbull had proclaimed that the clause as it now stood was a fain√©ant clause capable of doing and intended to do no good in the proper direction a clause put into the bill to gull ignorant folk who had not eyes enough to recognise the fact that it was fain√©ant a makebelieve clauseso said mr turnbullto be detested on that account by every true reformer worse than the old philistine bonds and tory figments of representation as to which there was at least no hypocritical pretence of popular fitness mr turnbull had been very loud and very angryhad talked much of demonstrations among the people and had almost threatened the house the house in its present mood did not fear any demonstrationsbut it did fear that mr turnbull might help mr daubeny and that mr daubeny might help mr turnbull it was now maythe middle of mayand ministers who had been at work on their reform bill ever since the beginning of the session were becoming weary of it and then should these odious clauses escape the threatened turnbulldaubeny alliancethen there was the house of lords what a pity we cant pass our bills at the treasury and have done with them said laurence fitzgibbon yes indeed replied mr ratler for myself i was never so tired of a session in my life i wouldnt go through it again to be madeno not to be made chancellor of the exchequer  lord brentfords note to phineas finn was as follows      house of lords 16th may 186     my dear mr finn     you are no doubt aware that lord bosanquets death has    taken mr mottram into the upper house and that as    he was undersecretary for the colonies and as the    undersecretary must be in the lower house the vacancy    must be filled up   the heart of phineas finn at this moment was almost in his mouth not only to be selected for political employment but to be selected at once for an office so singularly desirable undersecretaries he fancied were paid two thousand a year what would mr low say now but his great triumph soon received a check mr mildmay has spoken to me on the subject continued the letter and informs me that he has offered the place at the colonies to his old supporter mr laurence fitzgibbon laurence fitzgibbon      i am inclined to think that he could not have done better    as mr fitzgibbon has shown great zeal for his party this    will vacate the irish seat at the treasury board and i am    commissioned by mr mildmay to offer it to you perhaps    you will do me the pleasure of calling on me tomorrow    between the hours of eleven and twelve     yours very sincerely     brentford   phineas was himself surprised to find that his first feeling on reading this letter was one of dissatisfaction here were his golden hopes about to be realisedhopes as to the realisation of which he had been quite despondent twelve months agoand yet he was uncomfortable because he was to be postponed to laurence fitzgibbon had the new undersecretary been a man whom he had not known whom he had not learned to look down upon as inferior to himself he would not have minded itwould have been full of joy at the promotion proposed for himself but laurence fitzgibbon was such a poor creature that the idea of filling a place from which laurence had risen was distasteful to him it seems to be all a matter of favour and convenience he said to himself without any reference to the service his triumph would have been so complete had mr mildmay allowed him to go into the higher place at one leap other men who had made themselves useful had done so in the first hour after receiving lord brentfords letter the idea of becoming a lord of the treasury was almost displeasing to him he had an idea that junior lordships of the treasury were generally bestowed on young members whom it was convenient to secure but who were not good at doing anything there was a moment in which he thought that he would refuse to be made a junior lord  but during the night cooler reflections told him that he had been very wrong he had taken up politics with the express desire of getting his foot upon a rung of the ladder of promotion and now in his third session he was about to be successful even as a junior lord he would have a thousand a year and how long might he have sat in chambers and have wandered about lincolns inn and have loitered in the courts striving to look as though he had business before he would have earned a thousand a year even as a junior lord he could make himself useful and when once he should be known to be a good working man promotion would come to him no ladder can be mounted without labour but this ladder was now open above his head and he already had his foot upon it  at halfpast eleven he was with lord brentford who received him with the blandest smile and a pressure of the hand which was quite cordial my dear finn he said this gives me the most sincere pleasurethe greatest pleasure in the world our connection together at loughton of course makes it doubly agreeable to me  i cannot be too grateful to you lord brentford  no no no no it is all your own doing when mr mildmay asked me whether i did not think you the most promising of the young members on our side in your house i certainly did say that i quite concurred but i should be taking too much on myself i should be acting dishonestly if i were to allow you to imagine that it was my proposition had he asked me to recommend i should have named you that i say frankly but he did not he did not mr mildmay named you himself do you think he said that your friend finn would join us at the treasury i told him that i did think so and do you not think said he that it would be a useful appointment then i ventured to say that i had no doubt whatever on that pointthat i knew you well enough to feel confident that you would lend a strength to the liberal government then there were a few words said about your seat and i was commissioned to write to you that was all  phineas was grateful but not too grateful and bore himself very well in the interview he explained to lord brentford that of course it was his object to serve the countryand to be paid for his servicesand that he considered himself to be very fortunate to be selected so early in his career for parliamentary place he would endeavour to do his duty and could safely say of himself that he did not wish to eat the bread of idleness as he made this assertion he thought of laurence fitzgibbon laurence fitzgibbon had eaten the bread of idleness and yet he was promoted but phineas said nothing to lord brentford about his idle friend when he had made his little speech he asked a question about the borough  i have already ventured to write a letter to my agent at loughton telling him that you have accepted office and that you will be shortly there again he will see shortribs and arrange it but if i were you i should write to shortribs and to gratingafter i had seen mr mildmay of course you will not mention my name and the earl looked very grave as he uttered this caution  of course i will not said phineas  i do not think youll find any difficulty about the seat said the peer there never has been any difficulty at loughton yet i must say that for them and if we can scrape through with clause 72 we shall be all rightshall we not this was the clause as to which so violent an opposition was expected from mr turnbulla clause as to which phineas himself had felt that he would hardly know how to support the government in the event of the committee being pressed to a division upon it could he an ardent reformer a reformer at heartcould he say that such a borough as loughton should be sparedthat the arrangement by which shortribs and grating had sent him to parliament in obedience to lord brentfords orders was in due accord with the theory of a representative legislature in what respect had gatton and old sarum been worse than loughton was he not himself false to his principle in sitting for such a borough as loughton he had spoken to mr monk and mr monk had told him that rome was not built in a dayand had told him also that good things were most valued and were more valuable when they came by instalments but then mr monk himself enjoyed the satisfaction of sitting for a popular constituency he was not personally pricked in the conscience by his own parliamentary position now however now that phineas had consented to join the government any such considerations as these must be laid aside he could no longer be a free agent or even a free thinker he had been quite aware of this and had taught himself to understand that members of parliament in the direct service of the government were absolved from the necessity of freethinking individual freethinking was incompatible with the position of a member of the government and unless such abnegation were practised no government would be possible it was of course a mans duty to bind himself together with no other men but those with whom on matters of general policy he could agree heartilybut having found that he could so agree he knew that it would be his duty as a subaltern to vote as he was directed it would trouble his conscience less to sit for loughton and vote for an objectionable clause as a member of the government than it would have done to give such a vote as an independent member in so resolving he thought that he was simply acting in accordance with the acknowledged rules of parliamentary government and therefore when lord brentford spoke of clause 72 he could answer pleasantly i think we shall carry it and you see in getting it through committee if we can carry it by one that is as good as a hundred thats the comfort of closefighting in committee in the open house we are almost as much beaten by a narrow majority as by a vote against us  just so just so said lord brentford delighted to see that his young pupilas he regarded himunderstood so well the system of parliamentary management bythebye finn have you seen chiltern lately  not quite lately said phineas blushing up to his eyes  or heard from him  nonor heard from him when last i heard of him he was in brussels  ahyes he is somewhere on the rhine now i thought that as you were so intimate perhaps you corresponded with him have you heard that we have arranged about lady lauras money  i have heard lady laura has told me  i wish he would return said lord brentford sadlyalmost solemnly as that great difficulty is over i would receive him willingly and make my house pleasant to him if i can do so i am most anxious that he should settle and marry could you not write to him phineas not daring to tell lord brentford that he had quarrelled with lord chilternfeeling that if he did so everything would go wrongsaid that he would write to lord chiltern  as he went away he felt that he was bound to get an answer from violet effingham if it should be necessary he was willing to break with lord brentford on that mattereven though such breaking should lose him his borough and his placebut not on any other matter     chapter xliv  phineas and his friends   our heros friends were i think almost more elated by our heros promotion than was our hero himself he never told himself that it was a great thing to be a junior lord of the treasury though he acknowledged to himself that to have made a successful beginning was a very great thing but his friends were loud in their congratulationsor condolements as the case might be  he had his interview with mr mildmay and after that one of his first steps was to inform mrs bunce that he must change his lodgings the truth is mrs bunce not that i want anything better but that a better position will be advantageous to me and that i can afford to pay for it mrs bunce acknowledged the truth of the argument with her apron up to her eyes ive got to be so fond of looking after you mr finn i have indeed said mrs bunce it is not just what you pays like because another party will pay as much but weve got so used to you mr finnhavent we mrs bunce was probably not aware herself that the comeliness of her lodger had pleased her feminine eye and touched her feminine heart had anybody said that mrs bunce was in love with phineas the scandal would have been monstrous and yet it was soafter a fashion and bunce knew itafter his fashion dont be such an old fool he said crying after him because hes six foot high i aint crying after him because hes six foot high whined the poor womanbut one does like old faces better than new and a gentleman about ones place is pleasant gentleman be dd said bunce but his anger was excited not by his wifes love for phineas but by the use of an objectionable word  bunce himself had been on very friendly terms with phineas and they two had had many discussions on matters of politics bunce taking up the cudgels always for mr turnbull and generally slipping away gradually into some account of his own martyrdom for he had been a martyr having failed in obtaining any redress against the policeman who had imprisoned him so wrongfully the peoples banner had fought for him manfully and therefore there was a little disagreement between him and phineas on the subject of that great organ of public opinion and as mr bunce thought that his lodger was very wrong to sit for lord brentfords borough subjects were sometimes touched which were a little galling to phineas  touching this promotion bunce had nothing but condolement to offer to the new junior lord oh yes said he in answer to an argument from phineas i suppose there must be lords as you call em though for the matter of that i cant see as they is of any mortal use  wouldnt you have the government carried on  government well i suppose there must be government but the less of it the better im not against governmentnor yet against laws mr finn though the less of them too the better but what does these lords do in the government lords indeed ill tell you what they do mr finn they wotes thats what they do they wotes hard black or white white or black aint that true when youre a lord will you be able to wote against mr mildmay to save your very soul  if it comes to be a question of soulsaving mr bunce i shant save my place at the expense of my conscience  not if you knows it you mean but the worst of it is that a man gets so thick into the mud that he dont know whether hes dirty or clean youll have to wote as youre told and of course youll think its right enough aint you been among parliament gents long enough to know that thats the way it goes  you think no honest man can be a member of the government  i dont say that but i think honestys a deal easier away from em the fact is mr finn its all wrong with us yet and will be till we get it nigher to the great american model if a poor man gets into parliamentyoull excuse me mr finn but i calls you a poor man  certainlyas a member of parliament i am a very poor man  just soand therefore what do you do you goes and lays yourself out for government im not saying as how youre anyways wrong a man has to live you has winning ways and a good physiognomy of your own and are as big as a lifeguardsman phineas as he heard this doubtful praise laughed and blushed very well you makes your way with the big wigs lords and earls and them like and you gets returned for a rotten boroughyoull excuse me but thats about it aint itand then you goes in for government a man may have a mission to govern such as washington and cromwell and the like o them but when i hears of mr fitzgibbon agoverning why then i saysdn it all  there must be good and bad you know  weve got to change a deal yet mr finn and well do it when a young man as has liberal feelings gets into parliament he shouldnt be snapped up and brought into the governing business just because hes poor and wants a salary they dont do it that way in the states and they wont do it that way here long its the system as i hates and not you mr finn well goodbye sir i hope youll like the governing business and find it suits your health  these condolements from mr bunce were not pleasant but they set him thinking he felt assured that bunce and quintus slide and mr turnbull were wrong bunce was ignorant quintus slide was dishonest turnbull was greedy of popularity for himself he thought that as a young man he was fairly well informed he knew that he meant to be true in his vocation and he was quite sure that the object nearest to his heart in politics was not selfaggrandisement but the welfare of the people in general and yet he could not but agree with bunce that there was something wrong when such men as laurence fitzgibbon were called upon to act as governors was it not to be expected that the ignorant but still intelligent bunces of the population shoulddn it all  on the evening of that day he went up to mrs lows very sure that he should receive some encouragement from her and from her husband she had been angry with him because he had put himself into a position in which money must be spent and none could be made the lows especially mrs low had refused to believe that any success was within his reach now that he had succeeded now that he was in receipt of a salary on which he could live and save money he would be sure of sympathy from his old friends the lows  but mrs low was as severe upon him as mr bunce had been and even from mr low he could extract no real comfort of course i congratulate you said mr low coldly  and you mrs low  well you know mr finn i think you have begun at the wrong end i thought so before and i think so still i suppose i ought not to say so to a lord of the treasury but if you ask me what can i do  speak the truth out of course  exactly thats what i must do well the truth is mr finn that i do not think it is a very good opening for a young man to be made what they call a lord of the treasuryunless he has got a private fortune you know to support that kind of life  you see phineas a ministry is such an uncertain thing said mr low  of course its uncertainbut as i did go into the house its something to have succeeded  if you call that success said mrs low  you did intend to go on with your profession said mr low he could not tell them that he had changed his mind and that he meant to marry violet effingham who would much prefer a parliamentary life for her husband to that of a working barrister i suppose that is all given up now continued mr low  just for the present said phineas  yesand for ever i fear said mrs low youll never go back to real work after frittering away your time as a lord of the treasury what sort of work must it be when just anybody can do it that it suits them to lay hold of but of course a thousand a year is something though a man may have it for only six months  it came out in the course of the evening that mr low was going to stand for the borough vacated by mr mottram at which it was considered that the conservatives might possibly prevail you see after all phineas said mr low that i am following your steps  ah you are going into the house in the course of your profession  just so said mrs low  and are taking the first step towards being a tory attorneygeneral  thats as may be said mr low but its the kind of thing a man does after twenty years of hard work for myself i really dont care much whether i succeed or fail i should like to live to be a vicechancellor i dont mind saying as much as that to you but im not at all sure that parliament is the best way to the equity bench  but it is a grand thing to get into parliament when you do it by means of your profession said mrs low  soon after that phineas took his departure from the house feeling sore and unhappy but on the next morning he was received in grosvenor place with an amount of triumph which went far to compensate him lady laura had written to him to call there and on his arrival he found both violet effingham and madame max goesler with his friend when phineas entered the room his first feeling was one of intense joy at seeing that violet effingham was present there then there was one of surprise that madame max goesler should make one of the little party lady laura had told him at mr pallisers dinnerparty that they in portman square had not as yet advanced far enough to receive madame max goeslerand yet here was the lady in mr kennedys drawingroom now phineas would have thought it more likely that he should find her in portman square than in grosvenor place the truth was that madame goesler had been brought by miss effinghamwith the consent indeed of lady laura but with a consent given with much of hesitation what are you afraid of violet had asked i am afraid of nothing lady laura had answered but one has to choose ones acquaintance in accordance with rules which one doesnt lay down very strictly she is a clever woman said violet and everybody likes her but if you think mr kennedy would object of course you are right then lady laura had consented telling herself that it was not necessary that she should ask her husbands approval as to every new acquaintance she might form at the same time violet had been told that phineas would be there and so the party had been made up  see the conquering hero comes said violet in her cheeriest voice  i am so glad that mr finn has been made a lord of something said madame max goesler i had the pleasure of a long political discussion with him the other night and i quite approve of him  we are so much gratified mr finn said lady laura mr kennedy says that it is the best appointment they could have made and papa is quite proud about it  you are lord brentfords member are you not asked madame max goesler this was a question which phineas did not quite like and which he was obliged to excuse by remembering that the questioner had lived so long out of england as to be probably ignorant of the myths and theories and system and working of the british constitution violet effingham little as she knew of politics would never have asked a question so imprudent  but the question was turned off and phineas with an easy grace submitted himself to be petted and congratulated and purred over and almost caressed by the three ladies their goodnatured enthusiasm was at any rate better than the satire of bunce or the wisdom of mrs low lady laura had no misgivings as to phineas being fit for governing and violet effingham said nothing as to the shortlived tenure of ministers madame max goesler though she had asked an indiscreet question thoroughly appreciated the advantage of government pay and the prestige of government power you are a lord now she said speaking as was customary with her with the slightest possible foreign accent and you will be a president soon and then perhaps a secretary the order of promotion seems odd but i am told it is very pleasant  it is pleasant to succeed of course said phineas let the success be ever so little  we knew you would succeed said lady laura we were quite sure of it were we not violet  you always said so my dear for myself i do not venture to have an opinion on such matters will you always have to go to that big building in the corner mr finn and stay there from ten till four wont that be a bore  we have a halfholiday on saturday you know said phineas  and do the lords of the treasury have to take care of the money asked madame max goesler  only their own and they generally fail in doing that said phineas  he sat there for a considerable time wondering whether mr kennedy would come in and wondering also as to what mr kennedy would say to madame max goesler when he did come in he knew that it was useless for him to expect any opportunity then or there of being alone for a moment with violet effingham his only chance in that direction would be in some crowded room at some ball at which he might ask her to dance with him but it seemed that fate was very unkind to him and that no such chance came in his way mr kennedy did not appear and madame max goesler with violet went away leaving phineas still sitting with lady laura each of them said a kind word to him as they went i dont know whether i may dare to expect that a lord of the treasury will come and see me said madame max goesler then phineas made a second promise that he would call in park lane violet blushed as she remembered that she could not ask him to call at lady baldocks goodbye mr finn she said giving him her hand im so very glad that they have chosen you and i do hope that as madame max says theyll make you a secretary and a president and everything else very quicklytill it will come to your turn to be making other people he is very nice said madame goesler to violet as she took her place in the carriage he bears being petted and spoilt without being either awkward or conceited on the whole he is rather nice said violet only he has not got a shilling in the world and has to make himself before he will be anybody he must marry money of course said madame max goesler  i hope you are contented said lady laura rising from her chair and coming opposite to him as soon as they were alone  of course i am contented  i was notwhen i first heard of it why did they promote that emptyheaded countryman of yours to a place for which he was quite unfit i was not contented but then i am more ambitious for you than you are for yourself he sat without answering her for awhile and she stood waiting for his reply have you nothing to say to me she asked  i do not know what to say when i think of it all i am lost in amazement you tell me that you are not contentedthat you are ambitious for me why is it that you should feel any interest in the matter  is it not reasonable that we should be interested for our friends  but when you and i last parted here in this room you were hardly my friend  was i not you wrong me therevery deeply  i told you what was my ambition and you resented it said phineas  i think i said that i could not help you and i think i said also that i thought you would fail i do not know that i showed much resentment you see i told her that you were here that she might come and meet you you know that i wished my brother should succeed i wished it before i ever knew you you cannot expect that i should change my wishes  but if he cannot succeed pleaded phineas  who is to say that has a woman never been won by devotion and perseverance besides how can i wish to see you go on with a suit which must sever you from my father and injure your political prospectsperhaps fatally injure them it seems to me now that my father is almost the only man in london who has not heard of this duel  of course he will hear of it i have half made up my mind to tell him myself  do not do that mr finn there can be no reason for it but i did not ask you to come here today to talk to you about oswald or violet i have given you my advice about that and i can do no more  lady laura i cannot take it it is out of my power to take it  very well the matter shall be what you members of parliament call an open question between us when papa asked you to accept this place at the treasury did it ever occur to you to refuse it  it didfor half an hour or so  i hoped you wouldand yet i knew that i was wrong i thought that you should count yourself to be worth more than that and that you should as it were assert yourself but then it is so difficult to draw the line between proper selfassertion and proper selfdenialto know how high to go up the table and how low to go down i do not doubt that you have been rightonly make them understand that you are not as other junior lordsthat you have been willing to be a junior lord or anything else for a purpose but that the purpose is something higher than that of fetching and carrying in parliament for mr mildmay and mr palliser  i hope in time to get beyond fetching and carrying said phineas  of course you will and knowing that i am glad that you are in office i suppose there will be no difficulty about loughton  then phineas laughed i hear said he that mr quintus slide of the peoples banner has already gone down to canvass the electors  mr quintus slide to canvass the electors of loughton and lady laura drew herself up and spoke of this unseemly intrusion on her fathers borough as though the vulgar man who had been named had forced his way into the very drawingroom in portman square at that moment mr kennedy came in do you hear what mr finn tells me she said he has heard that mr quintus slide has gone down to loughton to stand against him  and why not said mr kennedy  my dear ejaculated lady laura  mr quintus slide will no doubt lose his time and his moneybut he will gain the prestige of having stood for a borough which will be something for him on the staff of the peoples banner said mr kennedy  he will get that horrid man vellum to propose him said lady laura  very likely said mr kennedy and the less any of us say about it the better finn my dear fellow i congratulate you heartily nothing for a long time has given me greater pleasure than hearing of your appointment it is equally honourable to yourself and to mr mildmay it is a great step to have gained so early  phineas as he thanked his friend could not help asking himself what his friend had done to be made a cabinet minister little as he phineas himself had done in the house in his two sessions and a half mr kennedy had hardly done more in his fifteen or twenty but then mr kennedy was possessed of almost miraculous wealth and owned half a county whereas he phineas owned almost nothing at all of course no prime minister would offer a junior lordship at the treasury to a man with ¬£30000 a year soon after this phineas took his leave i think he will do well said mr kennedy to his wife  i am sure he will do well replied lady laura almost scornfully  he is not quite such a black swan with me as he is with you but still i think he will succeed if he takes care of himself it is astonishing how that absurd story of his duel with chiltern has got about  it is impossible to prevent people talking said lady laura  i suppose there was some quarrel though neither of them will tell you they say it was about miss effingham i should hardly think that finn could have any hopes in that direction  why should he not have hopes  because he has neither position nor money nor birth said mr kennedy  he is a gentleman said lady laura and i think he has position i do not see why he should not ask any girl to marry him  there is no understanding you laura said mr kennedy angrily i thought you had quite other hopes about miss effingham  so i have but that has nothing to do with it you spoke of mr finn as though he would be guilty of some crime were he to ask violet effingham to be his wife in that i disagree with you mr finn is  you will make me sick of the name of mr finn  i am sorry that i offend you by my gratitude to a man who saved your life mr kennedy shook his head he knew that the argument used against him was false but he did not know how to show that he knew that it was false perhaps i had better not mention his name any more continued lady laura  nonsense  i quite agree with you that it is nonsense robert  all i mean to say is that if you go on as you do you will turn his head and spoil him do you think i do not know what is going on among you  and what is going on among usas you call it  you are taking this young man up and putting him on a pedestal and worshipping him just because he is welllooking and rather clever and decently behaved its always the way with women who have nothing to do and who cannot be made to understand that they should have duties they cannot live without some kind of idolatry  have i neglected my duty to you robert  yesyou know you havein going to those receptions at your fathers house on sundays  what has that to do with mr finn  psha  i begin to think i had better tell mr finn not to come here any more since his presence is disagreeable to you all the world knows how great is the service he did you and it will seem to be very ridiculous people will say all manner of things but anything will be better than that you should go on as you have doneaccusing your wife of idolatry towardsa young man becausehe iswelllooking  i never said anything of the kind  you did robert  i did not i did not speak more of you than of a lot of others  you accused me personally saying that because of my idolatry i had neglected my duty but really you made such a jumble of it all with papas visitors and sunday afternoons that i cannot follow what was in your mind  then mr kennedy stood for awhile collecting his thoughts so that he might unravel the jumble if that were possible to him but finding that it was not possible he left the room and closed the door behind him  then lady laura was left alone to consider the nature of the accusation which her husband had brought against her or the nature rather of the accusation which she had chosen to assert that her husband had implied for in her heart she knew that he had made no such accusation and had intended to make none such the idolatry of which he had spoken was the idolatry which a woman might show to her cat her dog her picture her china her furniture her carriage and horses or her pet maidservant such was the idolatry of which mr kennedy had spokenbut was there no other worship in her heart worse more pernicious than that in reference to this young man  she had schooled herself about him very severely and had come to various resolutions she had found out and confessed to herself that she did not and could not love her husband she had found out and confessed to herself that she did love and could not help loving phineas finn then she had resolved to banish him from her presence and had gone the length of telling him so after that she had perceived that she had been wrong and had determined to meet him as she met other menand to conquer her love then when this could not be done when something almost like idolatry grew upon her she determined that it should be the idolatry of friendship that she would not sin even in thought that there should be nothing in her heart of which she need be ashamedbut that the one great object and purport of her life should be the promotion of this friends welfare she had just begun to love after this fashion had taught herself to believe that she might combine something of the pleasure of idolatry towards her friend with a full complement of duty towards her husband when phineas came to her with his tale of love for violet effingham the lesson which she got then was a very rough oneso hard that at first she could not bear it her anger at his love for her brothers wishedfor bride was lost in her dismay that phineas should love any one after having once loved her but by sheer force of mind she had conquered that dismay that feeling of desolation at her heart and had almost taught herself to hope that phineas might succeed with violet he wished itand why should he not have what he wishedhe whom she so fondly idolised it was not his fault that he and she were not man and wife she had chosen to arrange it otherwise and was she not bound to assist him now in the present object of his reasonable wishes she had got over in her heart that difficulty about her brother but she could not quite conquer the other difficulty she could not bring herself to plead his cause with violet she had not brought herself as yet to do it  and now she was accused of idolatry for phineas by her husbandshe with a lot of others in which lot violet was of course included would it not be better that they two should be brought together would not her friends husband still be her friend would she not then forget to love him would she not then be safer than she was now  as she sat alone struggling with her difficulties she had not as yet forgotten to love himnor was she as yet safe     chapter xlv  miss effinghams four lovers   one morning early in june lady laura called at lady baldocks house and asked for miss effingham the servant was showing her into the large drawingroom when she again asked specially for miss effingham i think miss effingham is there said the man opening the door miss effingham was not there lady baldock was sitting all alone and lady laura perceived that she had been caught in the net which she specially wished to avoid now lady baldock had not actually or openly quarrelled with lady laura kennedy or with lord brentford but she had conceived a strong idea that her niece violet was countenanced in all improprieties by the standish family generally and that therefore the standish family was to be regarded as a family of enemies there was doubtless in her mind considerable confusion on the subject for she did not know whether lord chiltern or mr finn was the suitor whom she most fearedand she was aware after a sort of muddled fashion that the claims of these two wicked young men were antagonistic to each other but they were both regarded by her as emanations from the same source of iniquity and therefore without going deeply into the machinations of lady laurawithout resolving whether lady laura was injuring her by pressing her brother as a suitor upon miss effingham or by pressing a rival of her brotherstill she became aware that it was her duty to turn a cold shoulder on those two houses in portman square and grosvenor place but her difficulties in doing this were very great and it may be said that lady baldock was placed in an unjust and cruel position before the end of may she had proposed to leave london and to take her daughter and violet down to baddinghamor to brighton if they preferred it or to switzerland brighton in june violet had exclaimed would not a month among the glaciers be delightful miss boreham had said dont let me keep you in town aunt violet replied but i do not think i shall go till other people go i can have a room at laura kennedys house then lady baldock whose position was hard and cruel resolved that she would stay in town here she had in her hands a ward over whom she had no positive power and yet in respect to whom her duty was imperative her duty was imperative and lady baldock was not the woman to neglect her dutyand yet she knew that the doing of her duty would all be in vain violet would marry a shoeblack out of the streets if she were so minded it was of no use that the poor lady had provided herself with two strings two most excellent strings to her bowtwo strings either one of which should have contented miss effingham there was lord fawn a young peer not very rich indeedbut still with means sufficient for a wife a rising man and in every way respectable although a whig and there was mr appledom one of the richest commoners in england a fine conservative too with a seat in the house and everything appropriate he was fifty but looked hardly more than thirtyfive and wasso at least lady baldock frequently assertedviolently in love with violet effingham why had not the law or the executors or the lord chancellor or some power levied for the protection of the proprieties made violet absolutely subject to her guardian till she should be made subject to a husband  yes i think she is at home said lady baldock in answer to lady lauras inquiry for violet at least i hardly know she seldom tells me what she means to doand sometimes she will walk out quite alone a most imprudent old woman was lady baldock always opening her hand to her adversaries unable to control herself in the scolding of people either before their faces or behind their backs even at moments in which such scolding was most injurious to her own cause however we will see she continued then the bell was rung and in a few minutes violet was in the room in a few minutes more they were upstairs together in violets own room in spite of the openlydisplayed wrath of lady baldock i almost wish she had never been born said lady baldock to her daughter oh mamma dont say that i certainly do wish that i had never seen her indeed she has been a grievous trouble to you mamma said miss boreham sympathetically  brighton what nonsense said lady laura  of course its nonsense fancy going to brighton and then they have proposed switzerland if you could only hear augusta talking in rapture of a month among the glaciers and i feel so ungrateful i believe they would spend three months with me at any horrible place that i could suggestat hong kong if i were to ask itso intent are they on taking me away from metropolitan danger  but you will not go  noi wont go i know i am very naughty but i cant help feeling that i cannot be good without being a fool at the same time i must either fight my aunt or give way to her if i were to yield what a life i should haveand i should despise myself after all  and what is the special danger to be feared now  i dont knowyou i fancy i told her that if she went i should go to you i knew that would make her stay  i wish you would come to me said lady laura  i shouldnt think of it reallynot for any length of time  why not  because i should be in mr kennedys way  you wouldnt be in his way in the least if you would only be down punctually for morning prayers and go to church with him on sunday afternoon he would be delighted to have you  what did he say about madame max coming  not a word i dont think he quite knew who she was then i fancy he has inquired since by something he said yesterday  what did he say  nothing that mattersonly a word i havent come here to talk about madame max goeslernor yet about mr kennedy  whom have you come to talk about asked violet laughing a little with something of increased colour in her cheeks though she could not be said to blush  a lover of course said lady laura  i wish you would leave me alone with my lovers you are as bad or worse than my aunt she at any rate varies her prescription she has become sick of poor lord fawn because hes a whig  and who is her favourite now  old mr appledomwho is really a most unexceptionable old party and whom i like of all things i really think i could consent to be mrs appledom to get rid of my troublesif he did not dye his whiskers and have his coats padded  hed give up those little things if you asked him  i shouldnt have the heart to do it besides this isnt his time of the year for making proposals his love fever which is of a very low kind and intermits annually never comes on till the autumn it is a rural malady against which he is proof while among his clubs  well violeti am like your aunt  like lady baldock  in one respect i too will vary my prescription  what do you mean laura  just thisthat if you like to marry phineas finn i will say that you are right  heaven and earth and why am i to marry phineas finn  only for two reasons because he loves you and because  noi deny it i do not  i had come to fancy that you did  keep your fancy more under control then but upon my word i cant understand this he was your great friend  what has that to do with it demanded lady laura  and you have thrown over your brother laura  you have thrown him over is he to go on for ever asking and being refused  i do not know why he should not said violet seeing how very little trouble it gives him half an hour once in six months does it all for him allowing him time for coming and going in a cab  violet i do not understand you have you refused oswald so often because he does not pass hours on his knees before you  no indeed his nature would be altered very much for the worse before he could do that  why do you throw it in his teeth then that he does not give you more of his time  why have you come to tell me to marry mr phineas finn that is what i want to know mr phineas finn as far as i am aware has not a shilling in the worldexcept a months salary now due to him from the government mr phineas finn i believe to be the son of a country doctor in irelandwith about seven sisters mr phineas finn is a roman catholic mr phineas finn isor was a short time agoin love with another lady and mr phineas finn is not so much in love at this moment but what he is able to intrust his cause to an ambassador none short of a royal suitor should ever do that with success  has he never pleaded his cause to you himself  my dear i never tell gentlemens secrets it seems that if he has his success was so trifling that he has thought he had better trust some one else for the future  he has not trusted me he has not given me any commission  then why have you come  becausei hardly know how to tell his story there have been things about oswald which made it almost necessary that mr finn should explain himself to me  i know it allabout their fighting foolish young men i am not a bit obliged to either of themnot a bit only fancy if my aunt knew it what a life she would lead me gustavus knows all about it and i feel that i am living at his mercy why were they so wrongheaded  i cannot answer thatthough i know them well enough to be sure that chiltern was the one in fault  it is so odd that you should have thrown your brother over  i have not thrown my brother over will you accept oswald if he asks you again  no almost shouted violet  then i hope that mr finn may succeed i want him to succeed in everything thereyou may know it all he is my phoebus apollo  that is flattering to melooking at the position in which you desire to place your phoebus at the present moment  come violet i am true to you and let me have a little truth from you this man loves you and i think is worthy of you he does not love me but he is my friend as his friend and believing in his worth i wish for his success beyond almost anything else in the world listen to me violet i dont believe in those reasons which you gave me just now for not becoming this mans wife  nor do i  i know you do not look at me i who have less of real heart than you i who thought that i could trust myself to satisfy my mind and my ambition without caring for my heart i have married for what you call position my husband is very rich and a cabinet minister and will probably be a peer and he was willing to marry me at a time when i had not a shilling of my own  he was very generous  he has asked for it since said lady laura but never mind i have not come to talk about myselfotherwise than to bid you not do what i have done all that you have said about this mans want of money and of family is nothing  nothing at all said violet mere wordsfit only for such people as my aunt  well then  well  if you love him  ah but if i do not you are very close in inquiring into my secrets tell me laurawas not this young crichton once a lover of your own  psha and do you think i cannot keep a gentlemans secret as well as you  what is the good of any secret laura when we have been already so open he tried his prentice hand on you and then he came to me let us watch him and see wholl be the third i too like him well enough to hope that hell land himself safely at last     chapter xlvi  the mousetrap   phineas had certainly no desire to make love by an ambassadorat secondhand he had given no commission to lady laura and was as the reader is aware quite ignorant of what was being done and said on his behalf he had asked no more from lady laura than an opportunity of speaking for himself and that he had asked almost with a conviction that by so asking he would turn his friend into an enemy he had read but little of the workings of lady lauras heart towards himself and had no idea of the assistance she was anxious to give him she had never told him that she was willing to sacrifice her brother on his behalf and of course had not told him that she was willing also to sacrifice herself nor when she wrote to him one june morning and told him that violet would be found in portman square alone that afternoonnaming an hour and explaining that miss effingham would be there to meet herself and her father but that at such an hour she would be certainly alonedid he even then know how much she was prepared to do for him the short note was signed l and then there came a long postscript ask for me she said in a postscript i shall be there later and i have told them to bid you wait i can give you no hope of success but if you choose to tryyou can do so if you do not come i shall know that you have changed your mind i shall not think the worse of you and your secret will be safe with me i do that which you have asked me to dosimply because you have asked it burn this at oncebecause i ask it phineas destroyed the note tearing it into atoms the moment that he had read it and reread it of course he would go to portman square at the hour named of course he would take his chance he was not buoyed up by much of hopebut even though there were no hope he would take his chance  when lord brentford had first told phineas of his promotion he had also asked the new lord of the treasury to make a certain communication on his behalf to his son this phineas had found himself obliged to promise to doand he had done it the letter had been difficult enough to writebut he had written it after having made the promise he had found himself bound to keep it  dear lord chiltern he had commenced i will not think that there was anything in our late encounter to prevent my so addressing you i now write at the instance of your father who has heard nothing of our little affair then he explained at length lord brentfords wishes as he understood them pray come home he said finishing his letter touching v e i feel that i am bound to tell you that i still mean to try my fortune but that i have no ground for hoping that my fortune will be good since the day on the sands i have never met her but in society i know you will be glad to hear that my wound was nothing and i think you will be glad to hear that i have got my foot on to the ladder of promotionyours always  phineas finn  now he had to try his fortunethat fortune of which he had told lord chiltern that he had no reason for hoping that it would be good he went direct from his office at the treasury to portman square resolving that he would take no trouble as to his dress simply washing his hands and brushing his hair as though he were going down to the house and he knocked at the earls door exactly at the hour named by lady laura  miss effingham he said i am so glad to find you alone  yes she said laughing i am alonea poor unprotected female but i fear nothing i have strong reason for believing that lord brentford is somewhere about and pomfret the butler who has known me since i was a baby is a host in himself  with such allies you can have nothing to fear he replied attempting to carry on her little jest  nor even without them mr finn we unprotected females in these days are so selfreliant that our natural protectors fall off from us finding themselves to be no longer wanted now with youwhat can i fear  nothingas i hope  there used to be a time and that not so long ago either when young gentlemen and ladies were thought to be very dangerous to each other if they were left alone but propriety is less rampant now and upon the whole virtue and morals with discretion and all that kind of thing have been the gainers dont you think so  i am sure of it  all the same but i dont like to be caught in a trap mr finn  in a trap  yesin a trap is there no trap here if you will say so i will acknowledge myself to be a dolt and will beg your pardon  i hardly know what you call a trap  you were told that i was here  he paused a moment before he replied yes i was told  i call that a trap  am i to blame  i dont say that you set itbut you use it  miss effingham of course i have used it you must knowi think you must know that i have that to say to you which has made me long for such an opportunity as this  and therefore you have called in the assistance of your friend  it is true  in such matters you should never talk to any one mr finn if you cannot fight your own battle no one can fight it for you  miss effingham do you remember our ride at saulsby  very wellas if it were yesterday  and do you remember that i asked you a question which you have never answered  i did answer itas well as i knew how so that i might tell you a truth without hurting you  it was necessaryis necessary that i should be hurt sorely or made perfectly happy violet effingham i have come to you to ask you to be my wifeto tell you that i love you and to ask for your love in return whatever may be my fate the question must be asked and an answer must be given i have not hoped that you should tell me that you loved me  for what then have you hoped  for not much indeedbut if for anything then for some chance that you might tell me so hereafter  if i loved you i would tell you so nowinstantly i give you my word of that  can you never love me  what is a woman to answer to such a question noi believe never i do not think i shall ever wish you to be my husband you ask me to be plain and i must be plain  is it because he paused hardly knowing what the question was which he proposed to himself to ask  it is for no becausefor no cause except that simple one which should make any girl refuse any man whom she did not love mr finn i could say pleasant things to you on any other subject than thisbecause i like you  i know that i have nothing to justify my suit  you have everything to justify itat least i am bound to presume that you have if you love meyou are justified  you know that i love you  i am sorry that it should ever have been sovery sorry i can only hope that i have not been in fault  will you try to love me  nowhy should i try if any trying were necessary i would try rather not to love you why should i try to do that which would displease everybody belonging to me for yourself i admit your right to address meand tell you frankly that it would not be in vain if i loved you but i tell you as frankly that such a marriage would not please those whom i am bound to try to please  he paused a moment before he spoke further i shall wait he said and come again  what am i to say to that do not tease me so that i be driven to treat you with lack of courtesy lady laura is so much attached to you and mr kennedy and lord brentfordand indeed i may say i myself also that i trust there may be nothing to mar our good fellowship come mr finnsay that you will take an answer and i will give you my hand  give it me said he she gave him her hand and he put it up to his lips and pressed it i will wait and come again he said i will assuredly come again then he turned from her and went out of the house at the corner of the square he saw lady lauras carriage but did not stop to speak to her and she also saw him  so you have had a visitor here said lady laura to violet  yesi have been caught in the trap  poor mouse and has the cat made a meal of you  i fancy he has after his fashion there be cats that eat their mice without playingand cats that play with their mice and then eat them and cats again which only play with their mice and dont care to eat them mr finn is a cat of the latter kind and has had his afternoons diversion  you wrong him there  i think not laura i do not mean to say that he would not have liked me to accept him but if i can see inside his bosom such a little job as that he has now done will be looked back upon as one of the past pleasures of his lifenot as a pain     chapter xlvii  mr mildmays bill   it will be necessary that we should go back in our story for a very short period in order that the reader may be told that phineas finn was duly reelected at loughton after his appointment at the treasury board there was some little trouble at loughton and something more of expense than he had before encountered mr quintus slide absolutely came down and was proposed by mr vellum for the borough mr vellum being a gentleman learned in the law and hostile to the interests of the noble owner of saulsby was able to raise a little trouble against our hero mr slide was proposed by mr vellum and seconded by mr vellums clerkthough as it afterwards appeared mr vellums clerk was not in truth an electorand went to the poll like a man he received three votes and at twelve oclock withdrew this in itself could hardly have afforded compensation for the expense which mr slide or his backers must have encounteredbut he had an opportunity of making a speech every word of which was reported in the peoples banner and if the speech was made in the language given in the report mr slide was really possessed of some oratorical power most of those who read the speech in the columns of the peoples banner were probably not aware how favourable an opportunity of retouching his sentences in type had been given to mr slide by the fact of his connection with the newspaper the speech had been very severe upon our hero and though the speaker had been so hooted and pelted at loughton as to have been altogether inaudibleso maltreated that in point of fact he had not been able to speak above a tenth part of his speech at allnevertheless the speech did give phineas a certain amount of pain why phineas should have read it who can tell but who is there that abstains from reading that which is printed in abuse of himself  in the speech as it was printed mr slide declared that he had no thought of being returned for the borough he knew too well how the borough was managed what slaves the electors werehow they groaned under a tyranny from which hitherto they had been unable to release themselves of course the earls nominee his lacquey as the honourable gentleman might be called would be returned the earl could order them to return whichever of his lacqueys he pleasedthere is something peculiarly pleasing to the democratic ear in the word lacquey any one serving a big man whatever the service may be is the big mans lacquey in the peoples bannerthe speech throughout was very bitter mr phineas finn who had previously served in parliament as the lacquey of an irish earl and had been turned off by him had now fallen into the service of the english earl and was the lacquey chosen for the present occasion but he quintus slide who boasted himself to be a man of the peoplehe could tell them that the days of their thraldom were coming to an end and that their enfranchisement was near at hand that friend of the people mr turnbull had a clause in his breechespocket which he would either force down the unwilling throat of mr mildmay or else drive the imbecile premier from office by carrying it in his teeth loughton as loughton must be destroyed but it should be born again in a better birth as a part of a real electoral district sending a real member chosen by a real constituency to a real parliament in those daysand they would come soonmr quintus slide rather thought that mr phineas finn would be found nowhere and he rather thought also that when he showed himself again as he certainly should do in the midst of that democratic electoral district as the popular candidate for the honour of representing it in parliament that democratic electoral district would accord to him a reception very different from that which he was now receiving from the earls lacqueys in the parliamentary village of loughton a prettier bit of fiction than these sentences as composing a part of any speech delivered or proposed to be delivered at loughton phineas thought he had never seen and when he read at the close of the speech that though the earls hired bullies did their worst the remarks of mr slide were received by the people with reiterated cheering he threw himself back in his chair at the treasury and roared the poor fellow had been three minutes on his legs had received three rotten eggs and one dead dog and had retired but not the half of the speech as printed in the peoples banner has been quoted the sins of phineas who in spite of his inability to open his mouth in public had been made a treasury hack by the aristocratic influenceby aristocratic influence not confined to the male sexwere described at great length and in such language that phineas for a while was fool enough to think that it would be his duty to belabour mr slide with a horsewhip this notion however did not endure long with him and when mr monk told him that things of that kind came as a matter of course he was comforted  but he found it much more difficult to obtain comfort when he weighed the arguments brought forward against the abominations of such a borough as that for which he sat and reflected that if mr turnbull brought forward his clause he phineas finn would be bound to vote against the clause knowing the clause to be right because he was a servant of the government the arguments even though they appeared in the peoples banner were true arguments and he had on one occasion admitted their truth to his friend lady laurain the presence of that great cabinet minister her husband what business has such a man as that down there is there a single creature who wants him lady laura had said i dont suppose anybody does want mr quintus slide phineas had replied but i am disposed to think the electors should choose the man they do want and that at present they have no choice left to them they are quite satisfied said lady laura angrily then lady laura continued phineas that alone should be sufficient to prove that their privilege of returning a member to parliament is too much for them we cant defend it it is defended by tradition said mr kennedy and by its great utility said lady laura bowing to the young member who was present and forgetting that very useless old gentleman her cousin who had sat for the borough for many years in this country it doesnt do to go too fast said mr kennedy and then the mixture of vulgarity falsehood and pretence said lady laura shuddering as her mind recurred to the fact that mr quintus slide had contaminated loughton by his presence i am told that they hardly let him leave the place alive  whatever mr kennedy and lady laura might think about loughton and the general question of small boroughs it was found by the government to their great cost that mr turnbulls clause was a reality after two months of hard work all questions of franchise had been settled rating and renting new and newfangled fancy franchises and those which no one fancied franchises for boroughs and franchises for counties franchises single dual threecornered and foursidedby various clauses to which the committee of the whole house had agreed after some score of divisionsthe matter of the franchise had been settled no doubt there was the house of lords and there might yet be shipwreck but it was generally believed that the lords would hardly look at the billthat they would not even venture on an amendment the lords would only be too happy to let the matter be settled by the commons themselves but then after the franchise came redistribution how sick of the subject were all members of the government no one could tell who did not see their weary faces the whole house was sick having been whipped into various lobbies night after night during the heat of the summer for weeks past redistribution why should there be any redistribution they had got or would get a beautiful franchise could they not see what that would do for them why redistribute anything but alas it was too late to go back to so blessed an idea as that redistribution they must have but there should be as little redistribution as possible men were sick of it all and would not be exigeant something should be done for overgrown countiessomething for new towns which had prospered in brick and mortar it would be easy to crush up a peccant borough or twoa borough that had been discovered in its sin and a few boroughs now blessed with two members might consent to be blessed only with one fifteen small clauses might settle the redistribution in spite of mr turnbullif only mr daubeny would be goodnatured  neither the weather which was very hot nor the tedium of the session which had been very great nor the anxiety of ministers which was very pressing had any effect in impairing the energy of mr turnbull he was as instant as oratorical as hostile as indignant about redistribution as he had been about the franchise he had been sure then and he was sure now that ministers desired to burke the question to deceive the people to produce a bill that should be no bill he brought out his clauseand made loughton his instance would the honourable gentleman who sat lowest on the treasury benchwho at this moment was in sweet confidential intercourse with the right honourable gentleman now president of the board of trade who had once been a friend of the peoplewould the young lord of the treasury get up in his place and tell them that no peer of parliament had at present a voice in sending a member to their house of commonsthat no peer would have a voice if this bill as proposed by the government were passed in its present useless ineffectual conservative and most dishonest form  phineas who replied to this and who told mr turnbull that he himself could not answer for any peersbut that he thought it probable that most peers would by their opinions somewhat influence the opinions of some electorswas thought to have got out of his difficulty very well but there was the clause of mr turnbull to be dealt witha clause directly disfranchising seven singlewinged boroughs of which loughton was of course onea clause to which the government must either submit or object submission would be certain defeat in one way and objection would be as certain defeat in anotherif the gentlemen on the other side were not disposed to assist the ministers it was said that the cabinet was divided mr gresham and mr monk were for letting the seven boroughs go mr mildmay could not bring himself to obey mr turnbull and mr palliser supported him when mr mildmay was told that mr daubeny would certainly go into the same lobby with mr turnbull respecting the seven boroughs he was reported to have said that in that case mr daubeny must be prepared with a government mr daubeny made a beautiful speech about the seven boroughsthe seven sins and seven stars and seven churches and seven lamps he would make no party question of this gentlemen who usually acted with him would vote as their own sense of right or wrong directed themfrom which expression of a special sanction it was considered that these gentlemen were not accustomed to exercise the privilege now accorded to them but in regarding the question as one of right and wrong and in looking at what he believed to be both the wish of the country and its interests he mr daubenyhe himself being simply a humble member of that housemust support the clause of the honourable gentleman almost all those to whom had been surrendered the privilege of using their own judgment for that occasion only used it discreetlyas their chief had used it himselfand mr turnbull carried his clause by a majority of fifteen it was then 3 am and mr gresham rising after the division said that his right honourable friend the first lord of the treasury was too tired to return to the house and had requested him to state that the government would declare their purpose at 6 pm on the following evening  phineas though he had made his little speech in answer to mr turnbull with goodhumoured flippancy had recorded his vote in favour of the seven boroughs with a sore heart much as he disliked mr turnbull he knew that mr turnbull was right in this he had spoken to mr monk on the subject as it were asking mr monks permission to throw up his office and vote against mr mildmay but mr monk was angry with him telling him that his conscience was of that restless uneasy sort which is neither useful nor manly we all know said mr monk and none better than mr mildmay that we cannot justify such a borough as loughton by the theory of our parliamentary representationany more than we can justify the fact that huntingdonshire should return as many members as the east riding there must be compromises and you should trust to others who have studied the matter more thoroughly than you to say how far the compromise should go at the present moment  it is the influence of the peer not the paucity of the electors said phineas  and has no peer any influence in a county would you disfranchise westmoreland believe me finn if you want to be useful you must submit yourself in such matters to those with whom you act  phineas had no answer to make but he was not happy in his mind and he was the less happy perhaps because he was very sure that mr mildmay would be beaten mr low in these days harassed him sorely mr low was very keen against such boroughs as loughton declaring that mr daubeny was quite right to join his standard to that of mr turnbull on such an issue mr low was the reformer now and phineas found himself obliged to fight a losing battle on behalf of an acknowledged abuse he never went near bunce but unfortunately for him bunce caught him once in the street and showed him no mercy slide was a little eavy on you in the banner the other dayeh mr finntoo eavy as i told him  mr slide can be just as heavy as he pleases bunce  thats in course the press is free thank godas yet but it wasnt any good rattling away at the earls little borough when its sure to go of course itll go mr finn  i think it will  the whole seven on em the ouse couldnt but do it they tell me its all mr mildmays own work sticking out for keeping on em hes very old and so well forgive him but he must go mr finn  we shall know all about that soon bunce  if you dont get another seat mr finn i suppose we shall see you back at the inn i hope we may its better than being member for loughton mr finnyou may be sure of that and then mr bunce passed on  mr turnbull carried his clause and loughton was doomed loughton and the other six deadly sins were anathematized exorcised and finally got rid of out of the world by the voices of the gentlemen who had been proclaiming the beauty of such pleasant vices all their lives and who in their hearts hated all changes that tended towards popular representation but not the less was mr mildmay beaten and in accordance with the promise made by his first lieutenant immediately after the vote was taken the prime minister came forward on the next evening and made his statement he had already put his resignation into the hands of her majesty and her majesty had graciously accepted it he was very old and felt that the time had come in which it behoved him to retire into that leisure which he thought he had perhaps earned he had hoped to carry this bill as the last act of his political life but he was too old too stiff as he said in his prejudices to bend further than he had bent already and he must leave the completion of the matter in other hands her majesty had sent for mr gresham and mr gresham had already seen her majesty mr gresham and his other colleagues though they dissented from the clause which had been carried by the united efforts of gentlemen opposite to him and of gentlemen below him on his own side of the house were younger men than he and would for the countrys sakeand for the sake of her majestyendeavour to carry the bill through there would then of course be a dissolution and the future government would no doubt depend on the choice of the country from all which it was understood that mr gresham was to go on with the bill to a conclusion whatever might be the divisions carried against him and that a new secretary of state for foreign affairs must be chosen phineas understood also that he had lost his seat at loughton for the borough of loughton there would never again be an election if i had been mr mildmay i would have thrown the bill up altogether lord brentford said afterwards but of course it was not for me to interfere  the session was protracted for two months after thatbeyond the time at which grouse should have been shotand by the 23rd of august became the law of the land i shall never get over it said mr ratler to mr finn seated one terribly hot evening on a bench behind the cabinet ministersnever i dont suppose such a session for work was ever known before think what it is to have to keep men together in august with the thermometer at 81¬∞ and the river stinking likelike the very mischief mr ratler however did not die  on the last day of the session laurence fitzgibbon resigned rumours reached the ears of phineas as to the cause of this but no certain cause was told him it was said that lord cantrip had insisted upon it laurence having by mischance been called upon for some official statement during an unfortunate period of absence there was however a mystery about itbut the mystery was not half so wonderful as the triumph to phineas when mr gresham offered him the place  but i shall have no seat said phineas  we shall none of us have seats tomorrow said mr gresham  but i shall be at a loss to find a place to stand for  the election will not come on till november and you must look about you both mr monk and lord brentford seem to think you will be in the house  and so the bill was carried and the session was ended     chapter xlviii  the duke   by the middle of september there was assembled a large party at matching priory a country mansion belonging to mr plantagenet palliser the men had certainly been chosen in reference to their political feelings and positionfor there was not a guest in the house who had voted for mr turnbulls clause or the wife or daughter or sister of any one who had so voted indeed in these days politics ran so high that among politicians all social gatherings were brought together with some reference to the state of parties phineas was invited and when he arrived at matching he found that half the cabinet was there mr kennedy was not there nor was lady laura mr monk was there and the dukewith the duchess and mr gresham and lord thrift mrs max goesler was there also and mrs bonteenmr bonteen being detained somewhere out of the way and violet effingham was expected in two days and lord chiltern at the end of the week lady glencora took an opportunity of imparting this latter information to phineas very soon after his arrival and phineas as he watched her eye and her mouth while she spoke was quite sure that lady glencora knew the story of the duel i shall be delighted to see him again said phineas that is all right said lady glencora there were also there mr and mrs grey who were great friends of the pallisersand on the very day on which phineas reached matching at half an hour before the time for dressing the duke of omnium arrived now mr palliser was the dukes nephew and heirand the duke of omnium was a very great person indeed i hardly know why it should have been so but the duke of omnium was certainly a greater man in public estimation than the other duke then presentthe duke of st bungay the duke of st bungay was a useful man and had been so all his life sitting in cabinets and serving his country constant as any peer in the house of lords always ready to take on his own shoulders any troublesome work required of him than whom mr mildmay and mr mildmays predecessor at the head of the liberal party had had no more devoted adherent but the duke of omnium had never yet done a days work on behalf of his country they both wore the garter the duke of st bungay having earned it by service the duke of omnium having been decorated with the blue ribbonbecause he was duke of omnium the one was a moral good man a good husband a good father and a good friend the otherdid not bear quite so high a reputation but men and women thought but little of the duke of st bungay while the other duke was regarded with an almost reverential awe i think the secret lay in the simple fact that the duke of omnium had not been common in the eyes of the people he had contrived to envelope himself in something of the ancient mystery of wealth and rank within three minutes of the dukes arrival mrs bonteen with an air of great importance whispered a word to phineas he has come he arrived exactly at seven  who has come phineas asked  the duke of omnium she said almost reprimanding him by her tone of voice for his indifference there has been a great doubt whether or no he would show himself at last lady glencora told me that he never will pledge himself i am so glad he has come  i dont think i ever saw him said phineas  oh i have seen hima magnificentlooking man i think it is so very nice of lady glencora getting him to meet us it is very rarely that he will join in a great party but they say lady glencora can do anything with him since the heir was born i suppose you have heard all about that  no said phineas i have heard nothing of the heir but i know that there are three or four babies  there was no heir you know for a year and a half and they were all au d√©sespoir and the duke was very nearly quarrelling with his nephew and mr palliser you know it had very nearly come to a separation  i dont know anything at all about it said phineas who was not very fond of the lady who was giving him the information  it is so i can assure you but since the boy was born lady glencora can do anything with the duke she made him go to ascot last spring and he presented her with the favourite for one of the races on the very morning the horse ran they say he gave three thousand pounds for him  and did lady glencora win  nothe horse lost and mr palliser has never known what to do with him since but it was very pretty of the dukewas it not  phineas though he had intended to show to mrs bonteen how little he thought about the duke of omniumhow small was his respect for a great peer who took no part in politicscould not protect himself from a certain feeling of anxiety as to the aspect and gait and words of the man of whom people thought so much of whom he had heard so often and of whom he had seen so little he told himself that the duke of omnium should be no more to him than any other man but yet the duke of omnium was more to him than other men when he came down into the drawingroom he was angry with himself and stood apartand was then angry with himself again because he stood apart why should he make a difference in his own bearing because there was such a man in the company and yet he could not avoid it when he entered the room the duke was standing in a large bowwindow and two or three ladies and two or three men were standing round him phineas would not go near the group telling himself that he would not approach a man so grand as was the duke of omnium he saw madame max goesler among the party and after a while he saw her retreat as she retreated phineas knew that some words from madame max goesler had not been received with the graciousness which she had expected there was the prettiest smile in the world on the ladys face and she took a corner on a sofa with an air of perfect satisfaction but yet phineas knew that she had received a wound  i called twice on you in london said phineas coming up close to her but was not fortunate enough to find you  yesbut you came so late in the season as to make it impossible that there should be any arrangements for our meeting what can any woman do when a gentleman calls on her in august  i came in july  yes you did on the 31st i keep the most accurate record of all such things mr finn but let us hope that we may have better luck next year in the meantime we can only enjoy the good things that are going  socially or politically madame goesler  oh socially how can i mean anything else when the duke of omnium is here i feel so much taller at being in the same house with him do not you but you are a spoilt child of fortune and perhaps you have met him before  i think i once saw the back of a hat in the park and somebody told me that the dukes head was inside it  and you have never seen him but that once  never but that oncetill now  and do not you feel elated  of course i do for what do you take me madame goesler  i doimmensely i believe him to be a fool and i never heard of his doing a kind act to anybody in my life  not when he gave the racehorse to lady glencora  i wonder whether that was true did you ever hear of such an absurdity as i was saying i dont think he ever did anything for anybodybut then you know to be duke of omnium it isnt necessaryis itthat a duke of omnium should do anything except be duke of omnium  at this moment lady glencora came up to phineas and took him across to the duke the duke had expressed a desire to be introduced to him phineas halfpleased and halfdisgusted had no alternative and followed lady glencora the duke shook hands with him and made a little bow and said something about the garrotters which phineas in his confusion did not quite understand he tried to reply as he would have replied to anybody else but the weight of the dukes majesty was too much for him and he bungled the duke made another little bow and in a moment was speaking a word of condescension to some other favoured individual phineas retreated altogether disgustedhating the duke but hating himself worse but he would not retreat in the direction of madame max goesler it might suit that lady to take an instant little revenge for her discomfiture but it did not suit him to do so the question with him would be whether in some future part of his career it might not be his duty to assist in putting down dukes of omnium  at dinner phineas sat between mrs bonteen and the duchess of st bungay and did not find himself very happy at the other end of the table the dukethe great duke was seated at lady glencoras right hand and on his other side fortune had placed madame max goesler the greatest interest which phineas had during the dinner was in watching the operationsthe triumphantly successful operations of that lady before dinner she had been wounded by the duke the duke had not condescended to accord the honour of his little bow of graciousness to some little flattering morsel of wit which the lady had uttered on his behoof she had said a sharp word or two in her momentary anger to phineas but when fortune was so good to her in that matter of her place at dinner she was not fool enough to throw away her chance throughout the soup and fish she was very quiet she said a word or two after her first glass of champagne the duke refused two dishes one after another and then she glided into conversation by the time that he had his roast mutton before him she was in full play and as she eat her peach the duke was bending over her with his most gracious smile  didnt you think the session was very long mr finn said the duchess to phineas  very long indeed duchess said phineas with his attention still fixed on madame max goesler  the duke found it very troublesome  i daresay he did said phineas that duke and that duchess were no more than any other man and any other mans wife the session had not been longer to the duke of st bungay than to all the public servants phineas had the greatest possible respect for the duke of st bungay but he could not take much interest in the wailings of the duchess on her husbands behalf  and things do seem to be so very uncomfortable now said the duchessthinking partly of the resignation of mr mildmay and partly of the fact that her own old peculiar maid who had lived with her for thirty years had retired into private life  not so very bad duchess i hope said phineas observing that at this moment madame max goeslers eyes were brilliant with triumph then there came upon him a sudden ambitionthat he would like to cut out the duke of omnium in the estimation of madame max goesler the brightness of madame max goeslers eyes had not been thrown away upon our hero  violet effingham came at the appointed time and to the surprise of phineas was brought to matching by lord brentford phineas at first thought that it was intended that the earl and his son should meet and make up their quarrel at mr pallisers house but lord brentford stayed only one night and phineas on the next morning heard the whole history of his coming and going from violet i have almost been on my knees to him to stay she said indeed i did go on my kneesactually on my knees  and what did he say  he put his arm round me and kissed me andandi cannot tell you all that he said but it ended in thisthat if chiltern can be made to go to saulsby fatted calves without stint will be killed i shall do all i can to make him go and so must you mr finn of course that silly affair in foreign parts is not to make any difference between you two  phineas smiled and said he would do his best and looked up into her face and was just able to talk to her as though things were going comfortably with him but his heart was very cold as violet had spoken to him about lord chiltern there had come upon him for the first timefor the first time since he had known that lord chiltern had been refusedan idea a doubt whether even yet violet might not become lord chilterns wife his heart was very sad but he struggled ondeclaring that it was incumbent on them both to bring together the father and son  i am so glad to hear you say so mr finn said violet i really do believe that you can do more towards it than any one else lord chiltern would think nothing of my advicewould hardly speak to me on such a subject but he respects you as well as likes you and not the less because of what has occurred  how was it that violet should know aught of the respect or liking felt by this rejected suitor for that other suitorwho had also been rejected and how was it that she was thus able to talk of one of them to the other as though neither of them had ever come forward with such a suit phineas felt his position to be so strange as to be almost burdensome he had told violet when she had refused him very plainly that he should come again to her and ask once more for the great gift which he coveted but he could not ask again now in the first place there was that in her manner which made him sure that were he to do so he would ask in vain and then he felt that she was placing a special confidence in him against which he would commit a sin were he to use her present intimacy with him for the purposes of making love they two were to put their shoulders together to help lord chiltern and while doing so he could not continue a suit which would be felt by both of them to be hostile to lord chiltern there might be opportunity for a chance word and if so the chance word should be spoken but he could not make a deliberate attack such as he had made in portman square violet also probably understood that she had not now been caught in a mousetrap  the duke was to spend four days at matching and on the third daythe day before lord chiltern was expectedhe was to be seen riding with madame max goesler by his side madame max goesler was known as a perfect horsewomanone indeed who was rather fond of going a little fast on horseback and who rode well to hounds but the duke seldom moved out of a walk and on this occasion madame max was as steady in her seat and almost as slow as the mounted ghost in don juan but it was said by some there especially by mrs bonteen that the conversation between them was not slow and on the next morning the duke and madame max goesler were together again before luncheon standing on a terrace at the back of the house looking down on a party who were playing croquet on the lawn  do you never play said the duke  oh yesone does everything a little  i am sure you would play well why do you not play now  noi shall not play now  i should like to see you with your mallet  i am sorry your grace cannot be gratified i have played croquet till i am tired of it and have come to think it is only fit for boys and girls the great thing is to give them opportunities for flirting and it does that  and do you never flirt madame goesler  never at croquet duke  and what with you is the choicest time  that depends on so many thingsand so much on the chosen person what do you recommend  ahi am so ignorant i can recommend nothing  what do you say to a mountaintop at dawn on a summer day asked madame max goesler  you make me shiver said the duke  or a boat on a lake on a summer evening or a good lead after hounds with nobody else within three fields or the bottom of a saltmine or the deck of an ocean steamer or a military hospital in time of war or a railway journey from paris to marseilles  madame max goesler you have the most uncomfortable ideas  i have no doubt your grace has tried each of themsuccessfully but perhaps after all a comfortable chair over a good fire in a pretty room beats everything  i think it doescertainly said the duke then he whispered something at which madame max goesler blushed and smiled and immediately after that she followed those who had already gone in to lunch  mrs bonteen had been hovering round the spot on the terrace on which the duke and madame max goesler had been standing looking on with envious eyes meditating some attack some interruption some excuse for an interpolation but her courage had failed her and she had not dared to approach the duke had known nothing of the hovering propinquity of mrs bonteen but madame goesler had seen and had understood it all  dear mrs bonteen she said afterwards why did you not come and join us the duke was so pleasant  two is company and three is none said mrs bonteen who in her anger was hardly able to choose her words quite as well as she might have done had she been more cool  our friend madame max has made quite a new conquest said mrs bonteen to lady glencora  i am so pleased said lady glencora with apparently unaffected delight it is such a great thing to get anybody to amuse my uncle you see everybody cannot talk to him and he will not talk to everybody  he talked enough to her in all conscience said mrs bonteen who was now more angry than ever     chapter xlix  the duellists meet   lord chiltern arrived and phineas was a little nervous as to their meeting he came back from shooting on the day in question and was told by the servant that lord chiltern was in the house phineas went into the billiardroom in his knickerbockers thinking probably that he might be there and then into the drawingroom and at last into the librarybut lord chiltern was not to be found at last he came across violet  have you seen him he asked  yeshe was with me half an hour since walking round the gardens  and how is he cometell me something about him  i never knew him to be more pleasant he would give no promise about saulsby but he did not say that he would not go  does he know that i am here  yesi told him so i told him how much pleasure i should have in seeing you two togetheras friends  and what did he say  he laughed and said you were the best fellow in the world you see i am obliged to be explicit  but why did he laugh phineas asked  he did not tell me but i suppose it was because he was thinking of a little trip he once took to belgium and he perceived that i knew all about it  i wonder who told you but never mind i do not mean to ask any questions as i do not like that our first meeting should be before all the people in the drawingroom i will go to him in his own room  do dothat will be so nice of you  phineas sent his card up by a servant and in a few minutes was standing with his hand on the lock of lord chilterns door the last time he had seen this man they had met with pistols in their hands to shoot at each other and lord chiltern had in truth done his very best to shoot his opponent the cause of quarrel was the same between them as ever phineas had not given up violet and had no intention of giving her up and he had received no intimation whatever from his rival that there was to be a truce between them phineas had indeed written in friendship to lord chiltern but he had received no answerand nothing of certainty was to be gathered from the report which violet had just made it might well be that lord chiltern would turn upon him now in his wrath and that there would be some scene which in a strange house would be obviously objectionable nevertheless he had resolved that even that would be better than a chance encounter among strangers in a drawingroom so the door was opened and the two men met  well old fellow said lord chiltern laughing then all doubt was over and in a moment phineas was shaking his formerand present friend warmly by the hand so weve come to be an undersecretary have weand all that kind of thing  i had to get into harnesswhen the harness offered itself said phineas  i suppose so its a deuce of a bore isnt it  i always liked work you know  i thought you liked hunting better you used to ride as if you did theres bonebreaker back again in the stable for you that poor fool who bought him could do nothing with him and i let him have his money back  i dont see why you should have done that  because i was the biggest fool of the two do you remember when that brute got me down under the bank in the river that was about the nearest touch i ever had lord bless mehow he did squeeze me so here you arestaying with the pallisersone of a government party i suppose but what are you going to do for a seat my friend  dont talk about that yet chiltern  a sore subjectisnt it i think they have been quite right you know to put loughton into the meltingpotthough im sorry enough for your sake  quite right said phineas  and yet you voted against it old chap but come im not going to be down upon you so my father has been here  yeshe was here for a day or two  violet has just been telling me you and he are as good friends as ever  i trust we are  he never heard of that little affair and lord chiltern nodded his head intending to indicate the direction of blankenberg  i do not think he has yet  so violet tells me of course you know that she has heard all about it  i have reason to suppose as much  and so does laura  i told her myself said phineas  the deuce you did but i daresay it was for the best its a pity you had not proclaimed it at charing cross and then nobody would have believed a word about it of course my father will hear it some day  you are going to saulsby i hope chiltern  that question is easier asked than answered it is quite true that the great difficulty has been got over laura has had her money and if my father will only acknowledge that he has wronged me throughout from beginning to end i will go to saulsby tomorrowand would cut you out at loughton the next day only that loughton is not loughton any longer  you cannot expect your father to do that  noand therefore there is a difficulty so youve had that awfully ponderous duke here how did you get on with him  admirably he condescended to do something which he called shaking hands with me  he is the greatest old dust out said lord chiltern disrespectfully did he take any notice of violet  not that i observed  he ought not to be allowed into the same room with her after that there was a short pause and phineas felt some hesitation in speaking of miss effingham to lord chiltern and how do you get on with her asked lord chiltern here was a question for a man to answer the question was so hard to be answered that phineas did not at first make any attempt to answer it you know exactly the ground that i stand on continued lord chiltern she has refused me three times have you been more fortunate  lord chiltern as he asked his question looked full into finns face in a manner that was irresistible his look was not one of anger nor even of pride it was not indeed without a strong dash of fun but such as it was it showed phineas that lord chiltern intended to have an answer no said he at last i have not been more fortunate  perhaps you have changed your mind said his host  noi have not changed my mind said phineas quickly  how stands it then comelet us be honest to each other i told you down at willingford that i would quarrel with any man who attempted to cut me out with violet effingham you made up your mind that you would do so and therefore i quarrelled with you but we cant always be fighting duels  i hope we may not have to fight another  noit would be absurd said lord chiltern i rather think that what we did was absurd but upon my life i did not see any other way out of it however that is over how is it to be now  what am i to say in answer to that asked phineas  just the truth you have asked her i suppose  yesi have asked her  and she has refused you  yesshe has refused me  and you mean to ask her again  i shallif i ever think that there is a chance indeed chiltern i believe i shall whether i think that i have any chance or not  then we start fairly finn i certainly shall do so i believe i once told you that i never wouldbut that was long before i suspected that you would enter for the same plate what a man says on such a matter when he is down in the mouth goes for nothing now we understand each other and you had better go and dress the bell rang nearly half an hour ago and my fellow is hanging about outside the door  the interview had in one respect been very pleasant to phineas and in another it had been very bitter it was pleasant to him to know that he and lord chiltern were again friends it was a delight to him to feel that this halfsavage but highspirited young nobleman who had been so anxious to fight with him and to shoot him was nevertheless ready to own that he had behaved well lord chiltern had in fact acknowledged that though he had been anxious to blow out our heros brains he was aware all the time that our hero was a good sort of fellow phineas understood this and felt that it was pleasant but with this understanding and accompanying this pleasure there was a conviction in his heart that the distance between lord chiltern and violet would daily grow to be less and still lessand that lord chiltern could afford to be generous if miss effingham could teach herself to be fond of lord chiltern what had he phineas finn to offer in opposition to the claims of such a suitor  that evening lord chiltern took miss effingham out to dinner phineas told himself that this was of course so arranged by lady glencora with the express view of serving the saulsby interest it was almost nothing to him at the moment that madame max goesler was intrusted to him he had his ambition respecting madame max goesler but that for the time was in abeyance he could hardly keep his eyes off miss effingham and yet as he well knew his observation of her must be quite useless he knew beforehand with absolute accuracy the manner in which she would treat her lover she would be kind genial friendly confidential nay affectionate and yet her manner would mean nothing would give no clue to her future decision either for or against lord chiltern it was as phineas thought a peculiarity with violet effingham that she could treat her rejected lovers as dear familiar friends immediately after her rejection of them  mr finn said madame max goesler your eyes and ears are telltales of your passion  i hope not said phineas as i certainly do not wish that any one should guess how strong is my regard for you  that is prettily turnedvery prettily turned and shows more readiness of wit than i gave you credit for under your present suffering but of course we all know where your heart is men do not undertake perilous journeys to belgium for nothing  that unfortunate journey to belgium but dear madame max really nobody knows why i went  you met lord chiltern there  oh yesi met lord chiltern there  and there was a duel  madame maxyou must not ask me to criminate myself  of course there was and of course it was about miss effingham and of course the lady thinks herself bound to refuse both the gentlemen who were so very wicked and of course  wellwhat follows  ah if you have not wit enough to see i do not think it can be my duty to tell you but i wished to caution you as a friend that your eyes and ears should be more under your command  you will go to saulsby violet said to lord chiltern  i cannot possibly tell as yet said he frowning  then i can tell you that you ought to go i do not care a bit for your frowns what does the fifth commandment say  if you have no better arguments than the commandments violet  there can be none better do you mean to say that the commandments are nothing to you  i mean to say that i shant go to saulsby because i am told in the twentieth chapter of exodus to honour my father and motherand that i shouldnt believe anybody who told me that he did anything because of the commandments  oh lord chiltern  people are so prejudiced and so used to humbug that for the most part they do not in the least know their own motives for what they do i will go to saulsby tomorrowfor a reward  for what reward said violet blushing  for the only one in the world that could tempt me to do anything  you should go for the sake of duty i should not even care to see you go much as i long for it if that feeling did not take you there  it was arranged that phineas and lord chiltern were to leave matching together phineas was to remain at his office all october and in november the general election was to take place what he had hitherto heard about a future seat was most vague but he was to meet ratler and barrington erle in london and it had been understood that barrington erle who was now at saulsby was to make some inquiry as to that group of boroughs of which loughton at this moment formed one but as loughton was the smallest of four boroughs and as one of the four had for many years had a representative of its own phineas feared that no success would be found there in his present agony he began to think that there might be a strong plea made for a few private seats in the house of commons and that the propriety of throwing loughton into the meltingpot was after all open to question he and lord chiltern were to return to london together and lord chiltern according to his present scheme was to proceed at once to willingford to look after the cubhunting nothing that either violet or phineas could say to him would induce him to promise to go to saulsby when phineas pressed it he was told by lord chiltern that he was a fool for his painsby which phineas understood perfectly well that when lord chiltern did go to saulsby he phineas was to take that as strong evidence that everything was over for him as regarded violet effingham when violet expressed her eagerness that the visit should be made she was stopped with an assurance that she could have it done at once if she pleased let him only be enabled to carry with him the tidings of his betrothal and he would start for his fathers house without an hours delay but this authority violet would not give him when he answered her after this fashion she could only tell him that he was ungenerous at any rate i am not false he replied on one occasion what i say is the truth  there was a very tender parting between phineas and madame max goesler she had learned from him pretty nearly all his history and certainly knew more of the reality of his affairs than any of those in london who had been his most staunch friends of course youll get a seat she said as he took his leave of her if i understand it at all they never throw over an ally so useful as you are  but the intention is that in this matter nobody shall any longer have the power of throwing over or of not throwing over anybody  that is all very well my friend but cakes will still be hot in the mouth even though mr daubeny turn purist with mr turnbull to help him if you want any assistance in finding a seat you will not go to the peoples bannereven yet  certainly not to the peoples banner  i dont quite understand what the franchise is continued madame max goesler  household in boroughs said phineas with some energy  very wellhousehold in boroughs i daresay that is very fine and very liberal though i dont comprehend it in the least and you want a borough very well you wont go to the households i dont think you willnot at first that is  where shall i go then  ohto some great patron of a boroughor to a clubor perhaps to some great firm the households will know nothing about it till they are told is not that it  the truth is madame max i do not know where i shall go i am like a child lost in a wood and you may understand thisif you do not see me in park lane before the end of january i shall have perished in the wood  then i will come and find youwith a troop of householders you will come you will be there i do not believe in death coming without signs you are full of life as she spoke she had hold of his hand and there was nobody near them they were in a little bookroom inside the library at matching and the door though not latched was nearly closed phineas had flattered himself that madame goesler had retreated there in order that this farewell might be spoken without interruption and mr finni wonder whether i may say one thing she continued  you may say anything to me he replied  nonot in this country in this england there are things one may not say herethat are tabooed by a sort of consentand that without any reason she paused again and phineas was at a loss to think what was the subject on which she was about to speak could she mean no she could not mean to give him any outward plainspoken sign that she was attached to him it was the peculiar merit of this man that he was not vain though much was done to him to fill him with vanity and as the idea crossed his brain he hated himself because it had been there  to me you may say anything madame goesler he saidhere in england as plainly as though we were in vienna  but i cannot say it in english she said then in french blushing and laughing as she spokealmost stammering in spite of her usual selfconfidenceshe told him that accident had made her rich full of money money was a drug with her money she knew was wanted even for householders would he not understand her and come to her and learn from her how faithful a woman could be  he still was holding her by the hand and he now raised it to his lips and kissed it the offer from you he said is as highminded as generous and as honourable as its acceptance by me would be meanspirited vile and ignoble but whether i fail or whether i succeed you shall see me before the winter is over     chapter l  again successful   phineas also said a word of farewell to violet before he left matching but there was nothing peculiar in her little speech to him or in his to her of course we shall see each other in london dont talk of not being in the house of course you will be in the house then phineas had shaken his head and smiled where was he to find a requisite number of householders prepared to return him but as he went up to london he told himself that the air of the house of commons was now the very breath of his nostrils life to him without it would be no life to have come within the reach of the good things of political life to have made his mark so as to have almost insured future success to have been the petted young official aspirant of the dayand then to sink down into the miserable platitudes of private life to undergo daily attendance in lawcourts without a brief to listen to men who had come to be much below him in estimation and social intercourse to sit in a wretched chamber up three pairs of stairs at lincolns inn whereas he was now at this moment provided with a gorgeous apartment looking out into the park from the colonial office in downing street to be attended by a mongrel between a clerk and an errand boy at 17s 6d a week instead of by a private secretary who was the son of an earls sister and was petted by countesses daughters innumerableall this would surely break his heart he could have done it so he told himself and could have taken glory in doing it had not these other things come in his way but the other things had come he had run the risk and had thrown the dice and now when the game was so nearly won must it be that everything should be lost at last  he knew that nothing was to be gained by melancholy looks at his club or by show of wretchedness at his office london was very empty but the approaching elections still kept some there who otherwise would have been looking after the first flush of pheasants barrington erle was there and was not long in asking phineas what were his views  ahthat is so hard to say ratler told me that he would be looking about  ratler is very well in the house said barrington but he is of no use for anything beyond it i suppose you were not brought up at the london university  oh no said phineas remembering the glories of trinity  because there would have been an opening what do you say to stratfordthe new essex borough  broadbury the brewer is there already  yesand ready to spend any money you like to name let me see loughton is grouped with smotherem and walker is a deal too strong at smotherem to hear of any other claim i dont think we could dare to propose it there are the chelsea hamlets but it will take a wack of money  i have not got a wack of money said phineas laughing  thats the devil of it i think if i were you i should hark back upon some place in ireland couldnt you get laurence to give you up his seat  what fitzgibbon  yes he has not a ghost of a chance of getting into office again nothing on earth would induce him to look at a paper during all those weeks he was at the colonial office and when cantrip spoke to him all he said was ah bother cantrip did not like it i can tell you  but that wouldnt make him give up his seat  of course youd have to arrange it by which phineas understood barrington erle to mean that he phineas was in some way to give to laurence fitzgibbon some adequate compensation for the surrender of his position as a county member  im afraid thats out of the question said phineas if he were to go i should not get it  would you have a chance at loughshane  i was thinking of trying it said phineas  of course you know that morris is very ill this mr morris was the brother of lord tulla and was the sitting member of loughshane upon my word i think i should try that i dont see where were to put our hands on a seat in england i dont indeed phineas as he listened to this could not help thinking that barrington erle though he had certainly expressed a great deal of solicitude was not as true a friend as he used to be perhaps he phineas had risen too fast and barrington erle was beginning to think that he might as well be out of the way  he wrote to his father asking after the borough and asking after the health of mr morris and in his letter he told his own story very plainlyalmost pathetically he perhaps had been wrong to make the attempt which he had made he began to believe that he had been wrong but at any rate he had made it so far successfully and failure now would be doubly bitter he thought that the party to which he belonged must now remain in office it would hardly be possible that a new election would produce a house of commons favourable to a conservative ministry and with a liberal ministry he phineas would be sure of his place and sure of an official incomeif only he could find a seat it was all very true and was almost pathetic the old doctor who was inclined to be proud of his son was not unwilling to make a sacrifice mrs finn declared before her daughters that if there was a seat in all ireland phineas ought to have it and mary flood jones stood by listening and wondering what phineas would do if he lost his seat would he come back and live in county clare and be like any other girls lover poor mary had come to lose her ambition and to think that girls whose lovers stayed at home were the happiest nevertheless she would have walked all the way to lord tullas house and back again might that have availed to get the seat for phineas then there came an express over from castlemorris the doctor was wanted at once to see mr morris mr morris was very bad with gout in his stomach according to the messenger it was supposed that mr morris was dying before dr finn had had an opportunity of answering his sons letter mr morris the late member for loughshane had been gathered to his fathers  dr finn understood enough of elections for parliament and of the nature of boroughs to be aware that a candidates chance of success is very much improved by being early in the field and he was aware also that the death of mr morris would probably create various aspirants for the honour of representing loughshane but he could hardly address the earl on the subject while the dead body of the late member was lying in the house at castlemorris the bill which had passed in the late session for reforming the constitution of the house of commons had not touched ireland a future measure having been promised to the irish for their comfort and loughshane therefore was as to lord tullas influence the same as it had ever been he had not there the plenary power which the other lord had held in his hands in regard to loughtonbut still the castlemorris interest would go a long way it might be possible to stand against it but it would be much more desirable that the candidate should have it at his back dr finn was fully alive to this as he sat opposite to the old lord saying now a word about the old lords gout in his legs and arms and then about the gout in the stomach which had carried away to another world the lamented late member for the borough  poor jack said lord tulla piteously if id known it i neednt have paid over two thousand pounds for him last yearneed i doctor  no indeed said dr finn feeling that his patient might perhaps approach the subject of the borough himself  he never would live by any rule you know said the desolate brother  very hard to guidewas he not my lord  the very devil now you see i do do what im told pretty welldont i doctor  sometimes  by george i do nearly always i dont know what you mean by sometimes ive been drinking brandyandwater till im sick of it to oblige you and you tell me aboutsometimes you doctors expect a man to be a slave havent i kept it out of my stomach  thank god yes  its all very well thanking god but i should have gone as poor jack has gone if i hadnt been the most careful man in the world he was drinking champagne ten days agowould do it you know lord tulla could talk about himself and his own ailments by the hour together and dr finn who had thought that his noble patient was approaching the subject of the borough was beginning again to feel that the double interest of the gout that was present and the gout that had passed away would be too absorbing he however could say but little to direct the conversation  mr morris you see lived more in london than you do and was subject to temptation  i dont know what you call temptation havent i the temptation of a bottle of wine under my nose every day of my life  no doubt you have  and i dont drink it i hardly ever take above a glass or two of brown sherry by george when i think of it i wonder at my own courage i do indeed  but a man in london my lord  why the deuce would he go to london bythebye what am i to do about the borough now  let my son stand for it if you will my lord  theyve clean swept away brentfords seat at loughton havent they ha ha ha what a nice game for himto have been forced to help to do it himself theres nobody on earth i pity so much as a radical peer who is obliged to work like a nigger with a spade to shovel away the ground from under his own feet as for me i dont care who sits for loughshane i did care for poor jack while he was alive i dont think i shall interfere any longer i am glad it lasted jacks time lord tulla had probably already forgotten that he himself had thrown jack over for the last session but one  phineas my lord began the father is now undersecretary of state  oh ive no doubt hes a very fine fellowbut you see hes an outandout radical  no my lord  then how can he serve with such men as mr gresham and mr monk theyve turned out poor old mildmay among them because hes not fast enough for them dont tell me  my anxiety of course is for my boys prospects he seems to have done so well in parliament  why dont he stand for marylebone or finsbury  the money you know my lord  i shant interfere here doctor if he comes and the people then choose to return him i shall say nothing they may do just as they please they tell me lambert st george of mockrath is going to stand if he does its the d piece of impudence i ever heard of hes a tenant of my own though he has a lease for ever and his father never owned an acre of land in the county till his uncle died then the doctor knew that with a little management the lords interest might be secured for his son  phineas came over and stood for the borough against mr lambert st george and the contest was sharp enough the gentry of the neighbourhood could not understand why such a man as lord tulla should admit a liberal candidate to succeed his brother no one canvassed for the young undersecretary with more persistent zeal than did his father who when phineas first spoke of going into parliament had produced so many good arguments against that perilous step lord tullas agent stood aloofdesolate with grief at the death of the late member at such a moment of family affliction lord tulla he declared could not think of such a matter as the borough but it was known that lord tulla was dreadfully jealous of mr lambert st george whose property in that part of the county was now nearly equal to his own and who saw much more company at mockrath than was ever entertained at castlemorris a word from lord tullaso said the conservatives of the countywould have put mr st george into the seat but that word was not spoken and the conservatives of the neighbourhood swore that lord tulla was a renegade the contest was very sharp but our hero was returned by a majority of seventeen votes  again successful as he thought of it he remembered stories of great generals who were said to have chained fortune to the wheels of their chariots but it seemed to him that the goddess had never served any general with such staunch obedience as she had displayed in his cause had not everything gone well with himso well as almost to justify him in expecting that even yet violet effingham would become his wife dear dearest violet if he could only achieve that no general who ever led an army across the alps would be his equal either in success or in the reward of success then he questioned himself as to what he would say to miss flood jones on that very night he was to meet dear little mary flood jones that evening at a neighbours house his sister barbara had so told him in a tone of voice which he quite understood to imply a caution i shall be so glad to see her phineas had replied  if there ever was an angel on earth it is mary said barbara finn  i know that she is as good as gold said phineas  gold replied barbaragold indeed she is more precious than refined gold but phineas perhaps you had better not single her out for any special attention she has thought it wisest to meet you  of course said phineas why not  that is all phineas i have nothing more to say men of course are different from girls  thats true barbara at any rate  dont laugh at me phineas when i am thinking of nothing but of you and your interests and when i am making all manner of excuses for you because i know what must be the distractions of the world in which you live barbara made more than one attempt to renew the conversation before the evening came but phineas thought that he had had enough of it he did not like being told that excuses were made for him after all what had he done he had once kissed mary flood jones behind the door  i am so glad to see you mary he said coming and taking a chair by her side he had been specially warned not to single mary out for his attention and yet there was the chair left vacant as though it were expected that he would fall into it  thank you we did not happen to meet last year did wemr finn  do not call me mr finn mary  you are such a great man now  not at all a great man if you only knew what little men we understrappers are in london you would hardly speak to me  but you are somethingof state noware you not  wellyes thats the name they give me it simply means that if any member wants to badger some one in the house about the colonies i am the man to be badgered but if there is any credit to be had i am not the man who is to have it  but it is a great thing to be in parliament and in the government too  it is a great thing for me mary to have a salary though it may only be for a year or two however i will not deny that it is pleasant to have been successful  it has been very pleasant to us phineas mamma has been so much rejoiced  i am so sorry not to see her she is at floodborough i suppose  oh yesshe is at home she does not like coming out at night in winter i have been staying here you know for two days but i go home tomorrow  i will ride over and call on your mother then there was a pause in the conversation for a moment does it not seem odd mary that we should see so little of each other  you are so much away of course  yesthat is the reason but still it seems almost unnatural i often wonder when the time will come that i shall be quietly at home again i have to be back in my office in london this day week and yet i have not had a single hour to myself since i have been at killaloe but i will certainly ride over and see your mother you will be at home on wednesday i suppose  yesi shall be at home  upon that he got up and went away but again in the evening he found himself near her perhaps there is no position more perilous to a mans honesty than that in which phineas now found himselfthat namely of knowing himself to be quite loved by a girl whom he almost loves himself of course he loved violet effingham and they who talk best of love protest that no man or woman can be in love with two persons at once phineas was not in love with mary flood jones but he would have liked to take her in his arms and kiss herhe would have liked to gratify her by swearing that she was dearer to him than all the world he would have liked to have an episodeand did at the moment think that it might be possible to have one life in london and another life altogether different at killaloe dear mary he said as he pressed her hand that night things will get themselves settled at last i suppose he was behaving very ill to her but he did not mean to behave ill  he rode over to floodborough and saw mrs flood jones mrs flood jones however received him very coldly and mary did not appear mary had communicated to her mother her resolutions as to her future life the fact is mamma i love him i cannot help it if he ever chooses to come for me here i am if he does not i will bear it as well as i can it may be very mean of me but its true     chapter li  troubles at loughlinter   there was a dull house at loughlinter during the greater part of this autumn a few men went down for the grouse shooting late in the season but they stayed but a short time and when they went lady laura was left alone with her husband mr kennedy had explained to his wife more than once that though he understood the duties of hospitality and enjoyed the performance of them he had not married with the intention of living in a whirlwind he was disposed to think that the whirlwind had hitherto been too predominant and had said so very plainly with a good deal of marital authority this autumn and winter were to be devoted to the cultivation of proper relations between him and his wife does that mean darby and joan his wife had asked him when the proposition was made to her it means mutual regard and esteem replied mr kennedy in his most solemn tone and i trust that such mutual regard and esteem between us may yet be possible when lady laura showed him a letter from her brother received some weeks after this conversation in which lord chiltern expressed his intention of coming to loughlinter for christmas he returned the note to his wife without a word he suspected that she had made the arrangement without asking him and was angry but he would not tell her that her brother would not be welcome at his house it is not my doing she said when she saw the frown on his brow  i said nothing about anybodys doing he replied  i will write to oswald and bid him not come if you wish it of course you can understand why he is coming  not to see me i am sure said mr kennedy  nor me replied lady laura he is coming because my friend violet effingham will be here  miss effingham why was i not told of this i knew nothing of miss effinghams coming  robert it was settled in your own presence last july  i deny it  then lady laura rose up very haughty in her gait and with something of fire in her eye and silently left the room mr kennedy when he found himself alone was very unhappy looking back in his mind to the summer weeks in london he remembered that his wife had told violet that she was to spend her christmas at loughlinter that he himself had given a muttered assent and that violetas far as he could rememberhad made no reply it had been one of those things which are so often mentioned but not settled he felt that he had been strictly right in denying that it had been settled in his presencebut yet he felt that he had been wrong in contradicting his wife so peremptorily he was a just man and he would apologise for his fault but he was an austere man and would take back the value of his apology in additional austerity he did not see his wife for some hours after the conversation which has been narrated but when he did meet her his mind was still full of the subject laura he said i am sorry that i contradicted you  i am quite used to it robert  noyou are not used to it she smiled and bowed her head you wrong me by saying that you are used to it then he paused a moment but she said not a wordonly smiled and bowed her head again i remember he continued that something was said in my presence to miss effingham about her coming here at christmas it was so slight however that it had passed out of my memory till recalled by an effort i beg your pardon  that is unnecessary robert  it is dear  and do you wish that i should put her offor put oswald offor both my brother never yet has seen me in your house  and whose fault has that been  i have said nothing about anybodys fault robert i merely mentioned a fact will you let me know whether i shall bid him stay away  he is welcome to comeonly i do not like assignations for lovemaking  assignations  clandestine meetings lady baldock would not wish it  lady baldock do you think that violet would exercise any secrecy in the matteror that she will not tell lady baldock that oswald will be hereas soon as she knows it herself  that has nothing to do with it  surely robert it must have much to do with it and why should not these two young people meet the acknowledged wish of all the family is that they should marry each other and in this matter at any rate my brother has behaved extremely well mr kennedy said nothing further at the time and it became an understanding that violet effingham was to be a month at loughlinter staying from the 20th of december to the 20th of january and that lord chiltern was to come there for christmaswhich with him would probably mean three days  before christmas came however there were various other sources of uneasiness at loughlinter there had been as a matter of course great anxiety as to the elections with lady laura this anxiety had been very strong and even mr kennedy had been warmed with some amount of fire as the announcements reached him of the successes and of the failures the english returns came firstand then the scotch which were quite as interesting to mr kennedy as the english his own seat was quite safewas not contested but some neighbouring seats were sources of great solicitude then when this was over there were the tidings from ireland to be received and respecting one special borough in ireland lady laura evinced more solicitude than her husband approved there was much danger for the domestic bliss of the house of loughlinter when things came to such a pass and such words were spoken as the election at loughshane produced  he is in said lady laura opening a telegram  who is in said mr kennedy with that frown on his brow to which his wife was now well accustomed though he asked the question he knew very well who was the hero to whom the telegram referred  our friend phineas finn said lady laura speaking still with an excited voicewith a voice that was intended to display excitement if there was to be a battle on this matter there should be a battle she would display all her anxiety for her young friend and fling it in her husbands face if he chose to take it as an injury whatshould she endure reproach from her husband because she regarded the interests of the man who had saved his life of the man respecting whom she had suffered so many heartstruggles and as to whom she had at last come to the conclusion that he should ever be regarded as a second brother loved equally with the elder brother she had done her duty by her husbandso at least she had assured herselfand should he dare to reproach her on this subject she would be ready for the battle and now the battle came i am glad of this she said with all the eagerness she could throw into her voice i am indeedand so ought you to be the husbands brow grew blacker and blacker but still he said nothing he had long been too proud to be jealous and was now too proud to express his jealousyif only he could keep the expression back but his wife would not leave the subject i am so thankful for this she said pressing the telegram between her hands i was so afraid he would fail  you overdo your anxiety on such a subject at last he said speaking very slowly  what do you mean robert how can i be overanxious if it concerned any other dear friend that i have in the world it would not be an affair of life and death to him it is almost so i would have walked from here to london to get him his election and as she spoke she held up the clenched fist of her left hand and shook it while she still held the telegram in her right hand  laura i must tell you that it is improper that you should speak of any man in those termsof any man that is a stranger to your blood  a stranger to my blood what has that to do with it this man is my friend is your friendsaved your life has been my brothers best friend is loved by my fatherand is loved by me very dearly tell me what you mean by improper  i will not have you love any manvery dearly  robert  i tell you that i will have no such expressions from you they are unseemly and are used only to provoke me  am i to understand that i am insulted by an accusation if so let me beg at once that i may be allowed to go to saulsby i would rather accept your apology and retractation there than here  you will not go to saulsby and there has been no accusation and there will be no apology if you please there will be no more mention of mr finns name between us for the present if you will take my advice you will cease to think of him extravagantlyand i must desire you to hold no further direct communication with him  i have held no communication with him said lady laura advancing a step towards him but mr kennedy simply pointed to the telegram in her hand and left the room now in respect to this telegram there had been an unfortunate mistake i am not prepared to say that there was any reason why phineas himself should not have sent the news of his success to lady laura but he had not done so the piece of paper which she still held crushed in her hand was in itself very innocent hurrah for the loughshanes finny has done the trick such were the words written on the slip and they had been sent to lady laura by her young cousin the clerk in the office who acted as private secretary to the undersecretary of state lady laura resolved that her husband should never see those innocent but rather undignified words the occasion had become one of importance and such words were unworthy of it besides she would not condescend to defend herself by bringing forward a telegram as evidence in her favour so she burned the morsel of paper  lady laura and mr kennedy did not meet again till late that evening she was ill she said and would not come down to dinner after dinner she wrote him a note dear robert i think you must regret what you said to me if so pray let me have a line from you to that effect yours affectionately l when the servant handed it to him and he had read it he smiled and thanked the girl who had brought it and said he would see her mistress just now anything would be better than that the servants should know that there was a quarrel but every servant in the house had known all about it for the last three hours when the door was closed and he was alone he sat fingering the note thinking deeply how he should answer it or whether he would answer it at all no he would not answer itnot in writing he would give his wife no written record of his humiliation he had not acted wrongly he had said nothing more than now upon mature consideration he thought that the circumstances demanded but yet he felt that he must in some sort withdraw the accusation which he had made if he did not withdraw it there was no knowing what his wife might do about ten in the evening he went up to her and made his little speech my dear i have come to answer your note  i thought you would have written to me a line  i have come instead laura now if you will listen to me for one moment i think everything will be made smooth  of course i will listen said lady laura knowing very well that her husbands moment would be rather tedious and resolving that she also would have her moment afterwards  i think you will acknowledge that if there be a difference of opinion between you and me as to any question of social intercourse it will be better that you should consent to adopt my opinion  you have the law on your side  i am not speaking of the law  wellgo on robert i will not interrupt you if i can help it  i am not speaking of the law i am speaking simply of convenience and of that which you must feel to be right if i wish that your intercourse with any person should be of such or such a nature it must be best that you should comply with my wishes he paused for her assent but she neither assented nor dissented as far as i can understand the position of a man and wife in this country there is no other way in which life can be made harmonious  life will not run in harmonies  i expect that ours shall be made to do so laura i need hardly say to you that i intend to accuse you of no impropriety of feeling in reference to this young man  no robert you need hardly say that indeed to speak my own mind i think that you need hardly have alluded to it i might go further and say that such an allusion is in itself an insultan insult now repeated after hours of deliberationan insult which i will not endure to have repeated again if you say another word in any way suggesting the possibility of improper relations between me and mr finn either as to deeds or thoughts as god is above me i will write to both my father and my brother and desire them to take me from your house if you wish me to remain here you had better be careful as she was making this speech her temper seemed to rise and to become hot and then hotter till it glowed with a red heat she had been cool till the word insult used by herself had conveyed back to her a strong impression of her own wrongor perhaps i should rather say a strong feeling of the necessity of becoming indignant she was standing as she spoke and the fire flashed from her eyes and he quailed before her the threat which she had held out to him was very dreadful to him he was a man terribly in fear of the worlds good opinion who lacked the courage to go through a great and harassing trial in order that something better might come afterwards his married life had been unhappy his wife had not submitted either to his will or to his ways he had that great desire to enjoy his full rights so strong in the minds of weak ambitious men and he had told himself that a wifes obedience was one of those rights which he could not abandon without injury to his selfesteem he had thought about the matter slowly as was his wont and had resolved that he would assert himself he had asserted himself and his wife told him to his face that she would go away and leave him he could detain her legally but he could not do even that without the fact of such forcible detention being known to all the world how was he to answer her now at this moment so that she might not write to her father and so that his selfassertion might still be maintained  passion laura can never be right  would you have a woman submit to insult without passion i at any rate am not such a woman then there was a pause for a moment if you have nothing else to say to me you had better leave me i am far from well and my head is throbbing  he came up and took her hand but she snatched it away from him laura he said do not let us quarrel  i certainly shall quarrel if such insinuations are repeated  i made no insinuation  do not repeat them that is all  he was cowed and left her having first attempted to get out of the difficulty of his position by making much of her alleged illness and by offering to send for dr macnuthrie she positively refused to see dr macnuthrie and at last succeeded in inducing him to quit the room  this had occurred about the end of november and on the 20th of december violet effingham reached loughlinter life in mr kennedys house had gone quietly during the intervening three weeks but not very pleasantly the name of phineas finn had not been mentioned lady laura had triumphed but she had no desire to acerbate her husband by any unpalatable allusion to her victory and he was quite willing to let the subject die away if only it would die on some other matters he continued to assert himself taking his wife to church twice every sunday using longer family prayers than she approved reading an additional sermon himself every sunday evening calling upon her for weekly attention to elaborate household accounts asking for her personal assistance in much local visiting initiating her into his favourite methods of family life in the country till sometimes she almost longed to talk again about phineas finn so that there might be a rupture and she might escape but her husband asserted himself within bounds and she submitted longing for the coming of violet effingham she could not write to her father and beg to be taken away because her husband would read a sermon to her on sunday evening  to violet very shortly after her arrival she told her whole story this is terrible said violet this makes me feel that i never will be married  and yet what can a woman become if she remain single the curse is to be a woman at all  i have always felt so proud of the privileges of my sex said violet  i never have found them said the other never i have tried to make the best of its weaknesses and this is what i have come to i suppose i ought to have loved some man  and did you never love any man  noi think i never didnot as people mean when they speak of love i have felt that i would consent to be cut in little pieces for my brotherbecause of my regard for him  ah that is nothing  and i have felt something of the same thing for anothera longing for his welfare a delight to hear him praised a charm in his presenceso strong a feeling for his interest that were he to go to wrack and ruin i too should after a fashion be wracked and ruined but it has not been love either  do i know whom you mean may i name him it is phineas finn  of course it is phineas finn  did he ever ask youto love him  i feared he would do so and therefore accepted mr kennedys offer almost at the first word  i do not quite understand your reasoning laura  i understand it i could have refused him nothing in my power to give him but i did not wish to be his wife  and he never asked you  lady laura paused a moment thinking what reply she should makeand then she told a fib no he never asked me but violet did not believe the fib violet was quite sure that phineas had asked lady laura standish to be his wife as far as i can see said violet madame max goesler is his present passion  i do not believe it in the least said lady laura firing up  it does not much matter said violet  it would matter very much you know youyou you know whom he loves and i do believe that sooner or later you will be his wife  never  yes you will had you not loved him you would never have condescended to accuse him about that woman  i have not accused him why should he not marry madame max goesler it would be just the thing for him she is very rich  never you will be his wife  laura you are the most capricious of women you have two dear friends and you insist that i shall marry them both which shall i take first  oswald will be here in a day or two and you can take him if you like it no doubt he will ask you but i do not think you will  no i do not think i shall i shall knock under to mr mill and go in for womens rights and look forward to stand for some female borough matrimony never seemed to me to be very charming and upon my word it does not become more alluring by what i find at loughlinter  it was thus that violet and lady laura discussed these matters together but violet had never showed to her friend the cards in her hand as lady laura had shown those which she held lady laura had in fact told almost everything that there was to tellhad spoken either plainly with true words or equally plainly with words that were not true violet effingham had almost come to love phineas finnbut she never told her friend that it was so at one time she had almost made up her mind to give herself and all her wealth to this adventurer he was a better man she thought than lord chiltern and she had come to persuade herself that it was almost imperative on her to take the one or the other though she could talk about remaining unmarried she knew that that was practically impossible all those around herthose of the baldock as well as those of the brentford factionwould make such a life impossible to her besides in such a case what could she do it was all very well to talk of disregarding the world and of setting up a house for herselfbut she was quite aware that that project could not be used further than for the purpose of scaring her amiable aunt and if not thatthen could she content herself to look forward to a joint life with lady baldock and augusta boreham she might of course oblige her aunt by taking lord fawn or oblige her aunt equally by taking mr appledom but she was strongly of opinion that either lord chiltern or phineas would be preferable to these thinking over it always she had come to feel that it must be either lord chiltern or phineas but she had never whispered her thought to man or woman on her journey to loughlinter where she then knew that she was to meet lord chiltern she endeavoured to persuade herself that it should be phineas but lady laura had marred it all by that illtold fib there had been a moment before in which violet had felt that phineas had sacrificed something of that truth of love for which she gave him credit to the glances of madame goeslers eyes but she had rebuked herself for the idea accusing herself not only of a little jealousy but of foolish vanity was he whom she had rejected not to speak to another woman then came the blow from lady laura and violet knew that it was a blow this gallant lover this young crichton this unassuming but ardent lover had simply taken up with her as soon as he had failed with her friend lady laura had been most enthusiastic in her expressions of friendship such platonic regards might be all very well it was for mr kennedy to look to that but for herself she felt that such expressions were hardly compatible with her ideas of having her lover all to herself and then she again remembered madame goeslers bright blue eyes  lord chiltern came on christmas eve and was received with open arms by his sister and with that painful irritating affection which such a girl as violet can show to such a man as lord chiltern when she will not give him that other affection for which his heart is panting the two men were civil to each otherbut very cold they called each other kennedy and chiltern but even that was not done without an effort on the christmas morning mr kennedy asked his brotherinlaw to go to church its a kind of thing i never do said lord chiltern mr kennedy gave a little start and looked a look of horror lady laura showed that she was unhappy violet effingham turned away her face and smiled  as they walked across the park violet took lord chilterns part he only means that he does not go to church on christmas day  i dont know what he means said mr kennedy  we need not speak of it said lady laura  certainly not said mr kennedy  i have been to church with him on sundays myself said violet perhaps not reflecting that the practices of early years had little to do with the young mans life at present  christmas day and the next day passed without any sign from lord chiltern and on the day after that he was to go away but he was not to leave till one or two in the afternoon not a word had been said between the two women since he had been in the house on the subject of which both of them were thinking very much had been said of the expediency of his going to saulsby but on this matter he had declined to make any promise sitting in lady lauras room in the presence of both of them he had refused to do so i am bad to drive he said turning to violet and you had better not try to drive me  why should not you be driven as well as another she answered laughing     chapter lii  the first blow   lord chiltern though he had passed two entire days in the house with violet without renewing his suit had come to loughlinter for the express purpose of doing so and had his plans perfectly fixed in his own mind after breakfast on that last morning he was upstairs with his sister in her own room and immediately made his request to her laura he said go down like a good girl and make violet come up here she stood a moment looking at him and smiled and mind he continued you are not to come back yourself i must have violet alone  but suppose violet will not come young ladies do not generally wait upon young men on such occasions  nobut i rank her so high among young women that i think she will have common sense enough to teach her that after what has passed between us i have a right to ask for an interview and that it may be more conveniently had here than in the wilderness of the house below  whatever may have been the arguments used by her friend violet did come she reached the door all alone and opened it bravely she had promised herself as she came along the passages that she would not pause with her hand on the lock for a moment she had first gone to her own room and as she left it she had looked into the glass with a hurried glance and had then rested for a momentthinking that something should be done that her hair might be smoothed or a ribbon set straight or the chain arranged under her brooch a girl would wish to look well before her lover even when she means to refuse him but her pause was but for an instant and then she went on having touched nothing she shook her head and pressed her hands together and went on quick and opened the dooralmost with a little start violet this is very good of you said lord chiltern standing with his back to the fire and not moving from the spot  laura has told me that you thought i would do as much as this for you and therefore i have done it  thanks dearest it is the old story violet and i am so bad at words  i must have been bad at words too as i have not been able to make you understand  i think i have understood you are always clearspoken and i though i cannot talk am not muddlepated i have understood but while you are single there must be yet hopeunless indeed you will tell me that you have already given yourself to another man  i have not done that  then how can i not hope violet i would if i could tell you all my feelings plainly once twice thrice i have said to myself that i would think of you no more i have tried to persuade myself that i am better single than married  but i am not the only woman  to me you areabsolutely as though there were none other on the face of gods earth i live much alone but you are always with me should you marry any other man it will be the same with me still if you refuse me now i shall go awayand live wildly  oswald what do you mean  i mean that i will go to some distant part of the world where i may be killed or live a life of adventure but i shall do so simply in despair it will not be that i do not know how much better and greater should be the life at home of a man in my position  then do not talk of going  i cannot stay you will acknowledge violet that i have never lied to you i am thinking of you day and night the more indifferent you show yourself to me the more i love you violet try to love me he came up to her and took her by both her hands and tears were in his eyes say you will try to love me  it is not that said violet looking away but still leaving her hands with him  it is not what dear  what you calltrying  it is that you do not wish to try  oswald you are so violent so headstrong i am afraid of youas is everybody why have you not written to your father as we have asked you  i will write to him instantly now before i leave the room and you shall dictate the letter to him by heavens you shall he had dropped her hands when she called him violent but now he took them again and still she permitted it i have postponed it only till i had spoken to you once again  no lord chiltern i will not dictate to you  but will you love me she paused and looked down having even now not withdrawn her hands from him but i do not think he knew how much he had gained you used to love mea little he said  indeedindeed i did  and now is it all changed now  no she said retreating from him  how is it then violet speak to me honestly will you be my wife she did not answer him and he stood for a moment looking at her then he rushed at her and seizing her in his arms kissed her all overher forehead her lips her cheeks then both her hands and then her lips again by g she is my own he said then he went back to the rug before the fire and stood there with his back turned to her violet when she found herself thus deserted retreated to a sofa and sat herself down she had no negative to produce now in answer to the violent assertion which he had pronounced as to his own success it was true she had doubted and doubtedand still doubted but now she must doubt no longer of one thing she was quite sure she could love him as things had now gone she would make him quite happy with assurances on that subject as to that other questionthat fearful question whether or not she could trust himon that matter she had better at present say nothing and think as little perhaps as might be she had taken the jump and therefore why should she not be gracious to him but how was she to be gracious to a lover who stood there with his back turned to her  after the interval of a minute or two he remembered himself and turned round seeing her seated he approached her and went down on both knees close at her feet then he took her hands again for the third time and looked up into her eyes  oswald you on your knees she said  i would not bend to a princess he said to ask for half her throne but i will kneel here all day if you will let me in thanks for the gift of your love i never kneeled to beg for it  this is the man who cannot make speeches  i think i could talk now by the hour with you for a listener  oh but i must talk too  what will you say to me  nothing while you are kneeling it is not natural that you should kneel you are like samson with his locks shorn or hercules with a distaff  is that better he said as he got up and put his arm round her waist  you are in earnest she asked  in earnest i hardly thought that that would be doubted do you not believe me  i do believe you and you will be good  ahi do not know that  try and i will love you so dearly nay i do love you dearly i do i do  say it again  i will say it fifty timestill your ears are weary with itand she did say it to him after her own fashion fifty times  this is a great change he said getting up after a while and walking about the room  but a change for the betteris it not oswald  so much for the better that i hardly know myself in my new joy but violet well have no delaywill we no shillyshallying what is the use of waiting now that its settled  none in the least lord chiltern let us saythis day twelvemonth  you are laughing at me violet  remember sir that the first thing you have to do is to write to your father  he instantly went to the writingtable and took up paper and pen come along he said you are to dictate it but this she refused to do telling him that he must write his letter to his father out of his own head and out of his own heart i cannot write it he said throwing down the pen my blood is in such a tumult that i cannot steady my hand  you must not be so tumultuous oswald or i shall have to live in a whirlwind  oh i shall shake down i shall become as steady as an old stager ill go as quiet in harness byandby as though i had been broken to it a fouryearold i wonder whether laura could not write this letter  i think you should write it yourself oswald  if you bid me i will  bid you indeed as if it was for me to bid you do you not know that in these new troubles you are undertaking you will have to bid me in everything and that i shall be bound to do your bidding does it not seem to be dreadful my wonder is that any girl can ever accept any man  but you have accepted me now  yes indeed  and you repent  no indeed and i will try to do your biddingsbut you must not be rough to me and outrageous and fiercewill you oswald  i will not at any rate be like kennedy is with poor laura  nothat is not your nature  i will do my best dearest and you may at any rate be sure of this that i will love you always so much good of myself if it be good i can say  it is very good she answered the best of all good words and now i must go and as you are leaving loughlinter i will say goodbye when am i to have the honour and felicity of beholding your lordship again  say a nice word to me before i am off violet  iloveyoubetterthan all the world beside and i meanto be your wifesome day are not those twenty nice words  he would not prolong his stay at loughlinter though he was asked to do so both by violet and his sister and though as he confessed himself he had no special business elsewhere it is no use mincing the matter i dont like kennedy and i dont like being in his house he said to violet and then he promised that there should be a party got up at saulsby before the winter was over his plan was to stop that night at carlisle and write to his father from thence your blood perhaps wont be so tumultuous at carlisle said violet he shook his head and went on with his plans he would then go on to london and down to willingford and there wait for his fathers answer there is no reason why i should lose more of the hunting than necessary pray dont lose a day for me said violet as soon as he heard from his father he would do his fathers bidding you will go to saulsby said violet you can hunt at saulsby you know  i will go to jericho if he asks me only you will have to go with me i thought we were to go tobelgium said violet  and so that is settled at last said violet to laura that night  i hope you do not regret it  on the contrary i am as happy as the moments are long  my fine girl  i am happy because i love him i have always loved him you have known that  indeed no  but i have after my fashion i am not tumultuous as he calls himself since he began to make eyes at me when he was nineteen  fancy oswald making eyes  oh he did and mouths too but from the beginning when i was a child i have known that he was dangerous and i have thought that he would pass on and forget me after a while and i could have lived without him nay there have been moments when i thought i could learn to love some one else  poor phineas for instance  we will mention no names mr appledom perhaps more likely he has been my most constant lover and then he would be so safe your brother laura is dangerous he is like the bad ice in the parks where they stick up the poles he has had a pole stuck upon him ever since he was a boy  yesgive a dog a bad name and hang him  remember that i do not love him a bit the less on that accountperhaps the better a sense of danger does not make me unhappy though the threatened evil may be fatal i have entered myself for my forlorn hope and i mean to stick to it now i must go and write to his worship only thinki never wrote a loveletter yet  nothing more shall be said about miss effinghams first loveletter which was no doubt creditable to her head and heart but there were two other letters sent by the same post from loughlinter which shall be submitted to the reader as they will assist the telling of the story one was from lady laura kennedy to her friend phineas finn and the other from violet to her aunt lady baldock no letter was written to lord brentford as it was thought desirable that he should receive the first intimation of what had been done from his son  respecting the letter to phineas which shall be first given lady laura thought it right to say a word to her husband he had been of course told of the engagement and had replied that he could have wished that the arrangement could have been made elsewhere than at his house knowing as he did that lady baldock would not approve of it to this lady laura had made no reply and mr kennedy had condescended to congratulate the brideelect when lady lauras letter to phineas was completed she took care to put it into the letterbox in the presence of her husband i have written to mr finn she said to tell him of this marriage  why was it necessary that he should be told  i think it was due to himfrom certain circumstances  i wonder whether there was any truth in what everybody was saying about their fighting a duel asked mr kennedy his wife made no answer and then he continuedyou told me of your own knowledge that it was untrue  not of my own knowledge robert  yesof your own knowledge then mr kennedy walked away and was certain that his wife had deceived him about the duel there had been a duel and she had known it and yet she had told him that the report was a ridiculous fabrication he never forgot anything he remembered at this moment the words of the falsehood and the look of her face as she told it he had believed her implicitly but he would never believe her again he was one of those men who in spite of their experience of the world of their experience of their own lives imagine that lips that have once lied can never tell the truth  lady lauras letter to phineas was as follows      loughlinter december 28th 186     my dear friend     violet effingham is here and oswald has just left us    it is possible that you may see him as he passes through    london but at any rate i think it best to let you know    immediately that she has accepted himat last if there    be any pang in this to you be sure that i will grieve    for you you will not wish me to say that i regret that    which was the dearest wish of my heart before i knew you    lately indeed i have been torn in two ways you will    understand what i mean and i believe i need say nothing    moreexcept this that it shall be among my prayers that    you may obtain all things that may tend to make you happy    honourable and of high esteem     your most sincere friend     laura kennedy   even though her husband should read the letter there was nothing in that of which she need be ashamed but he did not read the letter he simply speculated as to its contents and inquired within himself whether it would not be for the welfare of the world in general and for the welfare of himself in particular that husbands should demand to read their wives letters  and this was violets letter to her aunt      my dear aunt     the thing has come at last and all your troubles will be    soon overfor i do believe that all your troubles have    come from your unfortunate niece at last i am going to    be married and thus take myself off your hands lord    chiltern has just

lady baldock in her wrath  she is joking said the mild augusta  i believe she wouldjoke if i were going to be buried said lady baldock     chapter liii  showing how phineas bore the blow   when phineas received lady laura kennedys letter he was sitting in his gorgeous apartment in the colonial office it was gorgeous in comparison with the very dingy room at mr lows to which he had been accustomed in his early daysand somewhat gorgeous also as compared with the lodgings he had so long inhabited in mr bunces house the room was large and square and looked out from three windows on to st jamess park there were in it two very comfortable armchairs and a comfortable sofa and the office table at which he sat was of old mahogany shining brightly and seemed to be fitted up with every possible appliance for official comfort this stood near one of the windows so that he could sit and look down upon the park and there was a large round table covered with books and newspapers and the walls of the room were bright with maps of all the colonies and there was one very interesting mapbut not very brightshowing the american colonies as they used to be and there was a little inner closet in which he could brush his hair and wash his hands and in the room adjoining there sator ought to have sat for he was often absent vexing the mind of phineasthe earls nephew his private secretary and it was all very gorgeous often as he looked round upon it thinking of his old bedroom at killaloe of his little garrets at trinity of the dingy chambers in lincolns inn he would tell himself that it was very gorgeous he would wonder that anything so grand had fallen to his lot  the letter from scotland was brought to him in the afternoon having reached london by some daymail from glasgow he was sitting at his desk with a heap of papers before him referring to a contemplated railway from halifax in nova scotia to the foot of the rocky mountains it had become his business to get up the subject and then discuss with his principal lord cantrip the expediency of advising the government to lend a company five million of money in order that this railway might be made it was a big subject and the contemplation of it gratified him it required that he should look forward to great events and exercise the wisdom of a statesman what was the chance of these colonies being swallowed up by those other regionsonce coloniesof which the map that hung in the corner told so eloquent a tale and if so would the five million ever be repaid and if not swallowed up were the colonies worth so great an adventure of national money could they repay it would they do so should they be made to do so mr low who was now a qc and in parliament would not have greater subjects than this before him even if he should come to be solicitor general lord cantrip had specially asked him to get up this matterand he was getting it up sedulously once in nine years the harbour of halifax was blocked up by ice he had just jotted down the fact which was material when lady lauras letter was brought to him he read it and putting it down by his side very gently went back to his maps as though the thing would not so trouble his mind as to disturb his work he absolutely wrote automatically certain words of a note about the harbour after he had received the information a horse will gallop for some scores of yards after his back has been broken before he knows of his great ruinand so it was with phineas finn his back was broken but nevertheless he galloped for a yard or two closed in 186061 for thirteen days then he began to be aware that his back was broken and that the writing of any more notes about the ice in halifax harbour was for the present out of the question i think it best to let you know immediately that she has accepted him these were the words which he read the oftenest then it was all over the game was played out and all his victories were as nothing to him he sat for an hour in his gorgeous room thinking of it and various were the answers which he gave during the time to various messagesbut he would see nobody as for the colonies he did not care if they revolted tomorrow he would have parted with every colony belonging to great britain to have gotten the hand of violet effingham for himself nownow at this moment he told himself with oaths that he had never loved any one but violet effingham  there had been so much to make such a marriage desirable i should wrong my hero deeply were i to say that the weight of his sorrow was occasioned by the fact that he had lost an heiress he would never have thought of looking for violet effingham had he not first learned to love her but as the idea opened itself out to him everything had seemed to be so suitable had miss effingham become his wife the mouths of the lows and of the bunces would have been stopped altogether mr monk would have come to his house as his familiar guest and he would have been connected with half a score of peers a seat in parliament would be simply his proper place and even undersecretaryships of state might soon come to be below him he was playing a great game but hitherto he had played it with so much successwith such wonderful luck that it had seemed to him that all things were within his reach nothing more had been wanting to him than violets hand for his own comfort and violets fortune to support his position and these too had almost seemed to be within his grasp his goddess had indeed refused himbut not with disdain even lady laura had talked of his marriage as not improbable all the world almost had heard of the duel and all the world had smiled and seemed to think that in the real fight phineas finn would be the victorthat the lucky pistol was in his hands it had never occurred to any one to supposeas far as he could seethat he was presuming at all or pushing himself out of his own sphere in asking violet effingham to be his wife nohe would trust his luck would persevere and would succeed such had been his resolution on that very morningand now there had come this letter to dash him to the ground  there were moments in which he declared to himself that he would not believe the letternot that there was any moment in which there was in his mind the slightest spark of real hope but he would tell himself that he would still persevere violet might have been driven to accept that violent man by violent influenceor it might be that she had not in truth accepted him that chiltern had simply so asserted or even if it were so did women never change their minds the manly thing would be to persevere to the end had he not before been successful when success seemed to be as far from him but he could buoy himself up with no real hope even when these ideas were present to his mind he knewhe knew wellat those very moments that his back was broken  some one had come in and lighted the candles and drawn down the blinds while he was sitting there and now as he looked at his watch he found that it was past five oclock he was engaged to dine with madame max goesler at eight and in his agony he halfresolved that he would send an excuse madame max would be full of wrath as she was very particular about her little dinnerpartiesbut what did he care now about the wrath of madame max goesler and yet only this morning he had been congratulating himself among his other successes upon her favour and had laughed inwardly at his own falsenesshis falseness to violet effinghamas he did so he had said something to himself jocosely about lovers perjuries the remembrance of which was now very bitter to him he took up a sheet of notepaper and scrawled an excuse to madame goesler news from the country he said made it impossible that he should go out tonight but he did not send the note at about halfpast five he opened the door of his private secretarys room and found the young man fast asleep with a cigar in his mouth halloa charles he said  all right charles standish was a first cousin of lady lauras and having been in the office before phineas had joined it and being a great favourite with his cousin had of course become the undersecretarys private secretary im all here said charles standish getting up and shaking himself  i am going just tie up those papersexactly as they are i shall be here early tomorrow but i shant want you before twelve good night charles  ta ta said his private secretary who was very fond of his master but not very respectfulunless upon express occasions  then phineas went out and walked across the park but as he went he became quite aware that his back was broken it was not the less broken because he sang to himself little songs to prove to himself that it was whole and sound it was broken and it seemed to him now that he never could become an atlas again to bear the weight of the world upon his shoulders what did anything signify all that he had done had been part of a game which he had been playing throughout and now he had been beaten in his game he absolutely ignored his old passion for lady laura as though it had never been and regarded himself as a model of constancyas a man who had loved not wisely perhaps but much too welland who must now therefore suffer a living death he hated parliament he hated the colonial office he hated his friend mr monk and he especially hated madame max goesler as to lord chilternhe believed that lord chiltern had obtained his object by violence he would see to that yeslet the consequences be what they might he would see to that  he went up by the duke of yorks column and as he passed the athen√¶um he saw his chief lord cantrip standing under the portico talking to a bishop he would have gone on unnoticed had it been possible but lord cantrip came down to him at once i have put your name down here said his lordship  whats the use said phineas who was profoundly indifferent at this moment to all the clubs in london  it cant do any harm you know youll come up in time and if you should get into the ministry theyll let you in at once  ministry ejaculated phineas but lord cantrip took the tone of voice as simply suggestive of humility and suspected nothing of that profound indifference to all ministers and ministerial honours which phineas had intended to express bythebye said lord cantrip putting his arm through that of the undersecretary i wanted to speak to you about the guarantees we shall be in the devils own mess you know and so the secretary of state went on about the rocky mountain railroad and phineas strove hard to bear his burden with his broken back he was obliged to say something about the guarantees and the railway and the frozen harbourand something especially about the difficulties which would be found not in the measures themselves but in the natural pugnacity of the opposition in the fabrication of garments for the national wear the great thing is to produce garments that shall as far as possible defy holepicking it may be and sometimes is the case that garments so fabricated will be good also for wear lord cantrip at the present moment was very anxious and very ingenious in the stopping of holes and he thought that perhaps his undersecretary was too much prone to the indulgence of large philanthropical views without sufficient thought of the holepickers but on this occasion by the time that he reached brookss he had been enabled to convince his undersecretary and though he had always thought well of his undersecretary he thought better of him now than ever he had done phineas during the whole time had been meditating what he could do to lord chiltern when they two should meet could he take him by the throat and smite him i happen to know that broderick is working as hard at the matter as we are said lord cantrip stopping opposite to the club he moved for papers you know at the end of last session now mr broderick was a gentleman in the house looking for promotion in a conservative government and of course would oppose any measure that could be brought forward by the cantripfinn colonial administration then lord cantrip slipped into the club and phineas went on alone  a spark of his old ambition with reference to brookss was the first thing to make him forget his misery for a moment he had asked lord brentford to put his name down and was not sure whether it had been done the threat of mr brodericks opposition had been of no use towards the strengthening of his broken back but the sight of lord cantrip hurrying in at the coveted door did do something a man cant cut his throat or blow his brains out he said to himself after all he must go on and do his work for hearts will break yet brokenly live on thereupon he went home and after sitting for an hour over his own fire and looking wistfully at a little treasure which he hada treasure obtained by some slight fraud at saulsby and which he now chucked into the fire and then instantly again pulled out of it soiled but unscorchedhe dressed himself for dinner and went out to madame max goeslers upon the whole he was glad that he had not sent the note of excuse a man must live even though his heart be broken and living he must dine  madame max goesler was fond of giving little dinners at this period of the year before london was crowded and when her guests might probably not be called away by subsequent social arrangements her number seldom exceeded six or eight and she always spoke of these entertainments as being of the humblest kind she sent out no big cards she preferred to catch her people as though by chance when that was possible dear mr jones mr smith is coming to tell me about some sherry on tuesday will you come and tell me too i daresay you know as much about it and then there was a studious absence of parade the dishes were not very numerous the bill of fare was simply written out once for the mistress and so circulated round the table not a word about the things to be eaten or the things to be drunk was ever spoken at the tableor at least no such word was ever spoken by madame goesler but nevertheless they who knew anything about dinners were aware that madame goesler gave very good dinners indeed phineas finn was beginning to flatter himself that he knew something about dinners and had been heard to assert that the soups at the cottage in park lane were not to be beaten in london but he cared for no soup today as he slowly made his way up madame goeslers staircase  there had been one difficulty in the way of madame goeslers dinnerparties which had required some patience and great ingenuity in its management she must either have ladies or she must not have them there was a great allurement in the latter alternative but she knew well that if she gave way to it all prospect of general society would for her be closedand for ever this had been in the early days of her widowhood in park lane she cared but little for womens society but she knew well that the society of gentlemen without women would not be that which she desired she knew also that she might as effectually crush herself and all her aspirations by bringing to her house indifferent womenwomen lacking something either in character or in position or in talentas by having none at all thus there had been a great difficulty and sometimes she had thought that the thing could not be done at all these english are so stiff so hard so heavy and yet she would not have cared to succeed elsewhere than among the english by degrees however the thing was done her prudence equalled her wit and even suspicious people had come to acknowledge that they could not put their fingers on anything wrong when lady glencora palliser had once dined at the cottage in park lane madame max goesler had told herself that henceforth she did not care what the suspicious people said since that the duke of omnium had almost promised that he would come if she could only entertain the duke of omnium she would have done everything  but there was no duke of omnium there tonight at this time the duke of omnium was of course not in london but lord fawn was there and our old friend laurence fitzgibbon who hadresigned his place at the colonial office and there were mr and mrs bonteen they with our hero made up the party no one doubted for a moment to what source mr bonteen owed his dinner mrs bonteen was goodlooking could talk was sufficiently proper and all that kind of thingand did as well as any other woman at this time of year to keep madame max goesler in countenance there was never any sitting after dinner at the cottage or i should rather say there was never any sitting after madame goesler went so that the two ladies could not weary each other by being alone together mrs bonteen understood quite well that she was not required there to talk to her hostess and was as willing as any woman to make herself agreeable to the gentlemen she might meet at madame goeslers table and thus mr and mrs bonteen not unfrequently dined in park lane  now we have only to wait for that horrible man mr fitzgibbon said madame max goesler as she welcomed phineas he is always late  what a blow for me said phineas  noyou are always in good time but there is a limit beyond which good time ends and being shamefully late at once begins but here he is and then as laurence fitzgibbon entered the room madame goesler rang the bell for dinner  phineas found himself placed between his hostess and mr bonteen and lord fawn was on the other side of madame goesler they were hardly seated at the table before some one stated it as a fact that lord brentford and his son were reconciled now phineas knew or thought that he knew that this could not as yet be the case and indeed such was not the case though the father had already received the sons letter but phineas did not choose to say anything at present about lord chiltern  how odd it is said madame goesler how often you english fathers quarrel with your sons  how often we english sons quarrel with our fathers rather said lord fawn who was known for the respect he had always paid to the fifth commandment  it all comes from entail and primogeniture and oldfashioned english prejudices of that kind said madame goesler lord chiltern is a friend of yours mr finn i think  they are both friends of mine said phineas  ah yes but youyouyou and lord chiltern once did something odd together there was a little mystery was there not  it is very little of a mystery now said fitzgibbon  it was about a ladywas it not said mrs bonteen affecting to whisper to her neighbour  i am not at liberty to say anything on the subject said fitzgibbon but i have no doubt phineas will tell you  i dont believe this about lord brentford said mr bonteen i happen to know that chiltern was down at loughlinter three days ago and that he passed through london yesterday on his way to the place where he hunts the earl is at saulsby he would have gone to saulsby if it were true  it all depends upon whether miss effingham will accept him said mrs bonteen looking over at phineas as she spoke  as there were two of violet effinghams suitors at table the subject was becoming disagreeably personal and the more so as every one of the party knew or surmised something of the facts of the case the cause of the duel at blankenberg had become almost as public as the duel and lord fawns courtship had not been altogether hidden from the public eye he on the present occasion might probably be able to carry himself better than phineas even presuming him to be equally eager in his lovefor he knew nothing of the fatal truth but he was unable to hear mrs bonteens statement with indifference and showed his concern in the matter by his reply any lady will be much to be pitied he said who does that chiltern is the last man in the world to whom i would wish to trust the happiness of a woman for whom i cared  chiltern is a very good fellow said laurence fitzgibbon  just a little wild said mrs bonteen  and never had a shilling in his pocket in his life said her husband  i regard him as simply a madman said lord fawn  i do so wish i knew him said madame max goesler i am fond of madmen and men who havent shillings and who are a little wild could you not bring him here mr finn  phineas did not know what to say or how to open his mouth without showing his deep concern i shall be happy to ask him if you wish it he replied as though the question had been put to him in earnest but i do not see so much of lord chiltern as i used to do  you do not believe that violet effingham will accept him asked mrs bonteen  he paused a moment before he spoke and then made his answer in a deep solemn voicewith a seriousness which he was unable to repress she has accepted him he said  do you mean that you know it said madame goesler  yesi mean that i know it  had anybody told him beforehand that he would openly make this declaration at madame goeslers table he would have said that of all things it was the most impossible he would have declared that nothing would have induced him to speak of violet effingham in his existing frame of mind and that he would have had his tongue cut out before he spoke of her as the promised bride of his rival and now he had declared the whole truth of his own wretchedness and discomfiture he was well aware that all of them there knew why he had fought the duel at blankenbergall that is except perhaps lord fawn and he felt as he made the statement as to lord chiltern that he blushed up to his forehead and that his voice was strange and that he was telling the tale of his own disgrace but when the direct question had been asked him he had been unable to refrain from answering it directly he had thought of turning it off with some jest or affectation of drollery but had failed at the moment he had been unable not to speak the truth  i dont believe a word of it said lord fawnwho also forgot himself  i do believe it if mr finn says so said mrs bonteen who rather liked the confusion she had caused  but who could have told you finn asked mr bonteen  his sister lady laura told me so said phineas  then it must be true said madame goesler  it is quite impossible said lord fawn i think i may say that i know that it is impossible if it were so it would be a most shameful arrangement every shilling she has in the world would be swallowed up now lord fawn in making his proposals had been magnanimous in his offers as to settlements and pecuniary provisions generally  for some minutes after that phineas did not speak another word and the conversation generally was not so brisk and bright as it was expected to be at madame goeslers madame max goesler herself thoroughly understood our heros position and felt for him she would have encouraged no questionings about violet effingham had she thought that they would have led to such a result and now she exerted herself to turn the minds of her guests to other subjects at last she succeeded and after a while too phineas himself was able to talk he drank two or three glasses of wine and dashed away into politics taking the earliest opportunity in his power of contradicting lord fawn very plainly on one or two matters laurence fitzgibbon was of course of opinion that the ministry could not stay in long since he had left the government the ministers had made wonderful mistakes and he spoke of them quite as an enemy might speak and yet fitz said mr bonteen you used to be so staunch a supporter  i have seen the error of my way i can assure you said laurence  i always observe said madame max goesler that when any of you gentlemen resignwhich you usually do on some very trivial matterthe resigning gentleman becomes of all foes the bitterest somebody goes on very well with his friends agreeing most cordially about everything till he finds that his public virtue cannot swallow some little detail and then he resigns or some one perhaps on the other side has attacked him and in the m√™l√©e he is hurt and so he resigns but when he has resigned and made his parting speech full of love and gratitude i know well after that where to look for the bitterest hostility to his late friends yes i am beginning to understand the way in which politics are done in england  all this was rather severe upon laurence fitzgibbon but he was a man of the world and bore it better than phineas had borne his defeat  the dinner taken altogether was not a success and so madame goesler understood lord fawn after he had been contradicted by phineas hardly opened his mouth phineas himself talked rather too much and rather too loudly and mrs bonteen who was well enough inclined to flatter lord fawn contradicted him i made a mistake said madame goesler afterwards in having four members of parliament who all of them were or had been in office i never will have two men in office together again this she said to mrs bonteen my dear madame max said mrs bonteen your resolution ought to be that you will never again have two claimants for the same young lady  in the drawingroom upstairs madame goesler managed to be alone for three minutes with phineas finn and it is as you say my friend she asked her voice was plaintive and soft and there was a look of real sympathy in her eyes phineas almost felt that if they two had been quite alone he could have told her everything and have wept at her feet  yes he said it is so  i never doubted it when you had declared it may i venture to say that i wish it had been otherwise  it is too late now madame goesler a man of course is a fool to show that he has any feelings in such a matter the fact is i heard it just before i came here and had made up my mind to send you an excuse i wish i had now  do not say that mr finn  i have made such an ass of myself  in my estimation you have done yourself honour but if i may venture to give you counsel do not speak of this affair again as though you had been personally concerned in it in the world nowadays the only thing disgraceful is to admit a failure  and i have failed  but you need not admit it mr finn i know i ought not to say as much to you  i rather am deeply indebted to you i will go now madame goesler as i do not wish to leave the house with lord fawn  but you will come and see me soon then phineas promised that he would come soon and felt as he made the promise that he would have an opportunity of talking over his love with his new friend at any rate without fresh shame as to his failure  laurence fitzgibbon went away with phineas and mr bonteen having sent his wife away by herself walked off towards the clubs with lord fawn he was very anxious to have a few words with lord fawn lord fawn had evidently been annoyed by phineas and mr bonteen did not at all love the young undersecretary that fellow has become the most consummate puppy i ever met said he as he linked himself on to the lord monk and one or two others among them have contrived to spoil him altogether  i dont believe a word of what he said about lord chiltern said lord fawn  about his marriage with miss effingham  it would be such an abominable shame to sacrifice the girl said lord fawn only think of it everything is gone the man is a drunkard and i dont believe he is any more reconciled to his father than you are lady laura kennedy must have had some object in saying so  perhaps an invention of finns altogether said mr bonteen those irish fellows are just the men for that kind of thing  a man you know so violent that nobody can hold him said lord fawn thinking of chiltern  and so absurdly conceited said mr bonteen thinking of phineas  a man who has never done anything with all his advantages in the worldand never will  he wont hold his place long said mr bonteen  whom do you mean  phineas finn  oh mr finn i was talking of lord chiltern i believe finn to be a very good sort of a fellow and he is undoubtedly clever they say cantrip likes him amazingly hell do very well but i dont believe a word of this about lord chiltern then mr bonteen felt himself to be snubbed and soon afterwards left lord fawn alone     chapter liv  consolation   on the day following madame goeslers dinner party phineas though he was early at his office was not able to do much work still feeling that as regarded the realities of the world his back was broken he might no doubt go on learning and after a time might be able to exert himself in a perhaps useful but altogether uninteresting kind of way doing his work simply because it was there to be doneas the carter or the tailor does hisand from the same cause knowing that a man must have bread to live but as for ambition and the idea of doing good and the love of work for works sakeas for the elastic springs of delicious and beneficent labourall that was over for him he would have worked from day till night and from night till day and from month till month throughout the year to have secured for violet effingham the assurance that her husbands position was worthy of her own but now he had no motive for such work as this as long as he took the public pay he would earn it and that was all  on the next day things were a little better with him he received a note in the morning from lord cantrip saying that they two were to see the prime minister that evening in order that the whole question of the railway to the rocky mountains might be understood and phineas was driven to his work before the time of the meeting came he had once more lost his own identity in great ideas of colonial welfare and had planned and peopled a mighty region on the red river which should have no sympathy with american democracy when he waited upon mr gresham in the afternoon he said nothing about the mighty region indeed he left it to lord cantrip to explain most of the proposed arrangementsspeaking only a word or two here and there as occasion required but he was aware that he had so far recovered as to be able to save himself from losing ground during the interview  hes about the first irishman weve had that has been worth his salt said mr gresham to his colleague afterwards  that other irishman was a terrible fellow said lord cantrip shaking his head  on the fourth day after his sorrow had befallen him phineas went again to the cottage in park lane and in order that he might not be balked in his search for sympathy he wrote a line to madame goesler to ask if she would be at home i will be at home from five to sixand alonem m g that was the answer from marie max goesler and phineas was of course at the cottage a few minutes after five it is not i think surprising that a man when he wants sympathy in such a calamity as that which had now befallen phineas finn should seek it from a woman women sympathise most effectually with men as men do with women but it is perhaps a little odd that a man when he wants consolation because his heart has been broken always likes to receive it from a pretty woman one would be disposed to think that at such a moment he would be profoundly indifferent to such a matter that no delight could come to him from female beauty and that all he would want would be the softness of a simply sympathetic soul but he generally wants a soft hand as well and an eye that can be bright behind the mutual tear and lips that shall be young and fresh as they express their concern for his sorrow all these things were added to phineas when he went to madame goesler in his grief   i am so glad to see you said madame max  you are very goodnatured to let me come  nobut it is so good of you to trust me but i was sure you would come after what took place the other night i saw that you were pained and i was so sorry for it  i made such a fool of myself  not at all and i thought that you were right to tell them when the question had been asked if the thing was not to be kept a secret it was better to speak it out you will get over it quicker in that way than in any other i have never seen the young lord myself  oh there is nothing amiss about him as to what lord fawn said the half of it is simply exaggeration and the other half is misunderstood  in this country it is so much to be a lord said madame goesler  phineas thought a moment of that matter before he replied all the standish family had been very good to him and violet effingham had been very good it was not the fault of any of them that he was now wretched and backbroken he had meditated much on this and had resolved that he would not even think evil of them i do not in my heart believe that that has had anything to do with it he said  but it has my friendalways i do not know your violet effingham  she is not mine  welli do not know this violet that is not yours i have met her and did not specially admire her but then the tastes of men and women about beauty are never the same but i know she is one that always lives with lords and countesses a girl who always lived with countesses feels it to be hard to settle down as a plain mistress  she has had plenty of choice among all sorts of men it was not the title she would not have accepted chiltern unless she had but what is the use of talking of it  they had known each other long  oh yesas children and the earl desired it of all things  ahthen he arranged it  not exactly nobody could arrange anything for chilternnor as far as that goes for miss effingham they arranged it themselves i fancy  you had asked her  yestwice and she had refused him more than twice i have nothing for which to blame her but yet i had thoughti had thought  she is a jilt then  noi will not let you say that of her she is no jilt but i think she has been strangely ignorant of her own mind what is the use of talking of it madame goesler  noneonly sometimes it is better to speak a word than to keep ones sorrow to oneself  so it isand there is not one in the world to whom i can speak such a word except yourself is not that odd i have sisters but they have never heard of miss effingham and would be quite indifferent  perhaps they have some other favourites  ahwell that does not matter and my best friend here in london is lord chilterns own sister  she knew of your attachment  oh yes  and she told you of miss effinghams engagement was she glad of it  she has always desired the marriage and yet i think she would have been satisfied had it been otherwise but of course her heart must be with her brother i need not have troubled myself to go to blankenberg after all  it was for the best perhaps everybody says you behaved so well  i could not but go as things were then  what if you hadshot him  there would have been an end of everything she would never have seen me after that indeed i should have shot myself next feeling that there was nothing else left for me to do  ahyou english are so peculiar but i suppose it is best not to shoot a man and mr finn there are other ladies in the world prettier than miss violet effingham noof course you will not admit that now just at this moment and for a month or two she is peerless and you will feel yourself to be of all men the most unfortunate but you have the ball at your feet i know no one so young who has got the ball at his feet so well i call it nothing to have the ball at your feet if you are born with it there it is so easy to be a lord if your father is one before youand so easy to marry a pretty girl if you can make her a countess but to make yourself a lord or to be as good as a lord when nothing has been born to youthat i call very much and there are women and pretty women too mr finn who have spirit enough to understand this and to think that the man after all is more important than the lord then she sang the old wellworn verse of the scotch song with wonderful spirit and with a clearness of voice and knowledge of music for which he had hitherto never given her credit      a prince can mak a belted knight       a marquis duke and a that     but an honest mans aboon his might       guid faith he mauna fa that   i did not know that you sung madame goesler  only now and then when something specially requires it and i am very fond of scotch songs i will sing to you now if you like it then she sang the whole songa mans a man for a that she said as she finished even though he cannot get the special bit of painted eves flesh for which his heart has had a craving then she sang again      there are maidens in scotland more lovely by far     who would gladly be bride to the young lochinvar   but young lochinvar got his bride said phineas  take the spirit of the lines mr finn which is true and not the tale as it is told which is probably false i often think that jock of hazledean and young lochinvar too probably lived to repent their bargains we will hope that lord chiltern may not do so  i am sure he never will  that is all right and as for you do you for a while think of your politics and your speeches and your colonies rather than of your love you are at home there and no lord chiltern can rob you of your success and if you are down in the mouth come to me and i will sing you a scotch song and look you the next time i ask you to dinner i will promise you that mrs bonteen shall not be here goodbye she gave him her hand which was very soft and left it for a moment in his and he was consoled  madame goesler when she was alone threw herself on to her chair and began to think of things in these days she would often ask herself what in truth was the object of her ambition and the aim of her life now at this moment she had in her hand a note from the duke of omnium the duke had allowed himself to say something about a photograph which had justified her in writing to himor which she had taken for such justification and the duke had replied he would not he said lose the opportunity of waiting upon her in person which the presentation of the little gift might afford him it would be a great success to have the duke of omnium at her housebut to what would the success reach what was her definite objector had she any in what way could she make herself happy she could not say that she was happy yet the hours with her were too long and the days too many  the duke of omnium should comeif he would and she was quite resolved as to thisthat if the duke did come she would not be afraid of him heavens and earth what would be the feelings of such a woman as her were the world to greet her some fine morning as duchess of omnium then she made up her mind very resolutely on one subject should the duke give her any opportunity she would take a very short time in letting him know what was the extent of her ambition     chapter lv  lord chiltern at saulsby   lord chiltern did exactly as he said he would do he wrote to his father as he passed through carlisle and at once went on to his hunting at willingford but his letter was very stiff and ungainly and it may be doubted whether miss effingham was not wrong in refusing the offer which he had made to her as to the dictation of it he began his letter my lord and did not much improve the style as he went on with it the reader may as well see the whole letter      railway hotel carlisle    december 27 186     my lord     i am now on my way from loughlinter to london and write    this letter to you in compliance with a promise made by    me to my sister and to miss effingham i have asked violet    to be my wife and she has accepted me and they think    that you will be pleased to hear that this has been done    i shall be of course obliged if you will instruct mr    edwards to let me know what you would propose to do in    regard to settlements laura thinks that you will wish to    see both violet and myself at saulsby for myself i can    only say that should you desire me to come i will do    so on receiving your assurance that i shall be treated    neither with fatted calves nor with reproaches i am not    aware that i have deserved either     i am my lord yours affect     chiltern     psmy address will be the bull willingford   that last word in which he halfdeclared himself to be joined in affectionate relations to his father caused him a world of trouble but he could find no term for expressing without a circumlocution which was disagreeable to him exactly that position of feeling towards his father which really belonged to him he would have written yours with affection or yours with deadly enmity or yours with respect or yours with most profound indifference exactly in accordance with the state of his fathers mind if he had only known what was that state he was afraid of going beyond his father in any offer of reconciliation and was firmly fixed in his resolution that he would never be either repentant or submissive in regard to the past if his father had wishes for the future he would comply with them if he could do so without unreasonable inconvenience but he would not give way a single point as to things done and gone if his father should choose to make any reference to them his father must prepare for battle  the earl was of course disgusted by the pertinacious obstinacy of his sons letter and for an hour or two swore to himself that he would not answer it but it is natural that the father should yearn for the son while the sons feeling for the father is of a very much weaker nature here at any rate was that engagement made which he had ever desired and his son had made a step though it was so very unsatisfactory a step towards reconciliation when the old man read the letter a second time he skipped that reference to fatted calves which had been so peculiarly distasteful to him and before the evening had passed he had answered his son as follows      saulsby december 29 186     my dear chiltern     i have received your letter and am truly delighted to hear that dear    violet has accepted you as her husband her fortune will be very    material to you but she herself is better than any fortune you have    long known my opinion of her i shall be proud to welcome her as a    daughter to my house     i shall of course write to her immediately and will endeavour to    settle some early day for her coming here when i have done so i    will write to you again and can only say that i will endeavour to    make saulsby comfortable to you     your affectionate father     brentford     richards the groom is still here you had perhaps better write to    him direct about your horses   by the middle of february arrangements had all been made and violet met her lover at his fathers house she in the meantime had been with her aunt and had undergone a good deal of mild unceasing persecution my dear violet said her aunt to her on her arrival at baddingham speaking with a solemnity that ought to have been terrible to the young lady i do not know what to say to you  say how dyou do aunt said violet  i mean about this engagement said lady baldock with an increase of aweinspiring severity in her voice  say nothing about it at all if you dont like it said violet  how can i say nothing about it how can i be silent or how am i to congratulate you  the least said perhaps the soonest mended and violet smiled as she spoke  that is very well and if i had no duty to perform i would be silent but violet you have been left in my charge if i see you shipwrecked in life i shall ever tell myself that the fault has been partly mine  nay aunt that will be quite unnecessary i will always admit that you did everything in your power tototomake me run straight as the sporting men say  sporting men oh violet  and you know aunt i still hope that i shall be found to have kept on the right side of the posts you will find that poor lord chiltern is not so black as he is painted  but why take anybody that is black at all  i like a little shade in the picture aunt  look at lord fawn  i have looked at him  a young nobleman beginning a career of useful official life that will end in there is no knowing what it may end in  i daresay notbut it never could have begun or ended in my being lady fawn  and mr appledom  poor mr appledom i do like mr appledom but you see aunt i like lord chiltern so much better a young woman will go by her feelings  and yet you refused him a dozen times  i never counted the times aunt but not quite so many as that  the same thing was repeated over and over again during the month that miss effingham remained at baddingham but lady baldock had no power of interfering and violet bore her persecution bravely her future husband was generally spoken of as that violent young man and hints were thrown out as to the personal injuries to which his wife might be possibly subjected but the threatened bride only laughed and spoke of these coming dangers as part of the general lot of married women i daresay if the truth were known my uncle baldock did not always keep his temper she once said now the truth was as violet well knew that my uncle baldock had been dumb as a sheep before the shearers in the hands of his wife and had never been known to do anything improper by those who had been most intimate with him even in his earlier days your uncle baldock miss said the outraged aunt was a nobleman as different in his manner of life from lord chiltern as chalk from cheese but then comes the question which is the cheese said violet lady baldock would not argue the question any further but stalked out of the room  lady laura kennedy met them at saulsby having had something of a battle with her husband before she left her home to do so when she told him of her desire to assist at this reconciliation between her father and brother he replied by pointing out that her first duty was at loughlinter and before the interview was ended had come to express an opinion that that duty was very much neglected she in the meantime had declared that she would go to saulsby or that she would explain to her father that she was forbidden by her husband to do so and i also forbid any such communication said mr kennedy in answer to which lady laura told him that there were some marital commands which she should not consider it to be her duty to obey when matters had come to this pass it may be conceived that both mr kennedy and his wife were very unhappy she had almost resolved that she would take steps to enable her to live apart from her husband and he had begun to consider what course he would pursue if such steps were taken the wife was subject to her husband by the laws both of god and man and mr kennedy was one who thought much of such laws in the meantime lady laura carried her point and went to saulsby leaving her husband to go up to london and begin the session by himself  lady laura and violet were both at saulsby before lord chiltern arrived and many were the consultations which were held between them as to the best mode in which things might be arranged violet was of opinion that there had better be no arrangement that lord chiltern should be allowed to come in and take his fathers hand and sit down to dinnerand that so things should fall into their places lady laura was rather in favour of some scene but the interview had taken place before either of them were able to say a word lord chiltern on his arrival had gone immediately to his father taking the earl very much by surprise and had come off best in the encounter  my lord said he walking up to his father with his hand out i am very glad to come back to saulsby he had written to his sister to say that he would be at saulsby on that day but had named no hour he now appeared between ten and eleven in the morning and his father had as yet made no preparation for himhad arranged no appropriate words he had walked in at the front door and had asked for the earl the earl was in his own morningrooma gloomy room full of dark books and darker furniture and thither lord chiltern had at once gone the two women still were sitting together over the fire in the breakfastroom and knew nothing of his arrival  oswald said his father i hardly expected you so early  i have come early i came across country and slept at birmingham i suppose violet is here  yes she is hereand laura they will be very glad to see you so am i and the father took the sons hand for the second time  thank you sir said lord chiltern looking his father full in the face  i have been very much pleased by this engagement continued the earl  what do you think i must be then said the son laughing i have been at it you know off and on ever so many years and have sometimes thought i was quite a fool not to get it out of my head but i couldnt get it out of my head and now she talks as though it were she who had been in love with me all the time  perhaps she was said the father  i dont believe it in the least she may be a little so now  i hope you mean that she always shall be so  i shant be the worst husband in the world i hope and i am quite sure i shant be the best i will go and see her now i suppose i shall find her somewhere in the house i thought it best to see you first  stop half a moment oswald said the earl and then lord brentford did make something of a shambling speech in which he expressed a hope that they two might for the future live together on friendly terms forgetting the past he ought to have been prepared for the occasion and the speech was poor and shambling but i think that it was more useful than it might have been had it been uttered roundly and with that paternal and almost majestic effect which he would have achieved had he been thoroughly prepared but the roundness and the majesty would have gone against the grain with his son and there would have been a danger of some outbreak as it was lord chiltern smiled and muttered some word about things being all right and then made his way out of the room thats a great deal better than i had hoped he said to himself and it has all come from my going in without being announced but there was still a fear upon him that his father even yet might prepare a speech and speak it to the great peril of their mutual comfort  his meeting with violet was of course pleasant enough now that she had succumbed and had told herself and had told him that she loved him she did not scruple to be as generous as a maiden should be who has acknowledged herself to be conquered and has rendered herself to the conqueror she would walk with him and ride with him and take a lively interest in the performances of all his horses and listen to hunting stories as long as he chose to tell them in all this she was so good and so loving that lady laura was more than once tempted to throw in her teeth her old oftenrepeated assertions that she was not prone to be in lovethat it was not her nature to feel any ardent affection for a man and that therefore she would probably remain unmarried you begrudge me my little bits of pleasure violet said in answer to one such attack nobut it is so odd to see you of all women become so lovelorn i am not lovelorn said violet but i like the freedom of telling him everything and of hearing everything from him and of having him for my own best friend he might go away for twelve months and i should not be unhappy believing as i do that he would be true to me all of which set lady laura thinking whether her friend had not been wiser than she had been she had never known anything of that sort of friendship with her husband which already seemed to be quite established between these two  in her misery one day lady laura told the whole story of her own unhappiness to her brother saying nothing of phineas finnthinking nothing of him as she told her story but speaking more strongly perhaps than she should have done of the terrible dreariness of her life at loughlinter and of her inability to induce her husband to alter it for her sake  do you mean that heilltreats you said the brother with a scowl on his face which seemed to indicate that he would like no task better than that of resenting such illtreatment  he does not beat me if you mean that  is he cruel to you does he use harsh language  he never said a word in his life either to me or as i believe to any other human being that he would think himself bound to regret  what is it then  he simply chooses to have his own way and his way cannot be my way he is hard and dry and just and dispassionate and he wishes me to be the same that is all  i tell you fairly laura as far as i am concerned i never could speak to him he is antipathetic to me but then i am not his wife  i amand i suppose i must bear it  have you spoken to my father  no  or to violet  yes  and what does she say  what can she say she has nothing to say nor have you nor if i am driven to leave him can i make the world understand why i do so to be simply miserable as i am is nothing to the world  i could never understand why you married him  do not be cruel to me oswald  cruel i will stick by you in any way that you wish if you think well of it i will go off to loughlinter tomorrow and tell him that you will never return to him and if you are not safe from him here at saulsby you shall go abroad with us i am sure violet would not object i will not be cruel to you  but in truth neither of lady lauras councillors was able to give her advice that could serve her she felt that she could not leave her husband without other cause than now existed although she felt also that to go back to him was to go back to utter wretchedness and when she saw violet and her brother together there came to her dreams of what might have been her own happiness had she kept herself free from those terrible bonds in which she was now held a prisoner she could not get out of her heart the remembrance of that young man who would have been her lover if she would have let himof whose love for herself she had been aware before she had handed herself over as a bale of goods to her unloved unloving husband she had married mr kennedy because she was afraid that otherwise she might find herself forced to own that she loved that other man who was then a nobodyalmost nobody it was not mr kennedys money that had bought her this woman in regard to money had shown herself to be as generous as the sun but in marrying mr kennedy she had maintained herself in her high position among the first of her own peopleamong the first socially and among the first politically but had she married phineashad she become lady laura finnthere would have been a great descent she could not have entertained the leading men of her party she would not have been on a level with the wives and daughters of cabinet ministers she might indeed have remained unmarried but she knew that had she done sohad she so resolvedthat which she called her fancy would have been too strong for her she would not have remained unmarried at that time it was her fate to be either lady laura kennedy or lady laura finn and she had chosen to be lady laura kennedy to neither violet effingham nor to her brother could she tell one half of the sorrow which afflicted her  i shall go back to loughlinter she said to her brother  do not unless you wish it he answered  i do not wish it but i shall do it mr kennedy is in london now and has been there since parliament met but he will be in scotland again in march and i will go and meet him there i told him that i would do so when i left  but you will go up to london  i suppose so i must do as he tells me of course what i mean is i will try it for another year  if it does not succeed come to us  i cannot say what i will do i would die if i knew how never be a tyrant oswald or at any rate not a cold tyrant and remember this there is no tyranny to a woman like telling her of her duty talk of beating a woman beating might often be a mercy  lord chiltern remained ten days at saulsby and at last did not get away without a few unpleasant words with his fatheror without a few words that were almost unpleasant with his mistress on his first arrival he had told his sister that he should go on a certain day and some intimation to this effect had probably been conveyed to the earl but when his son told him one evening that the postchaise had been ordered for seven oclock the next morning he felt that his son was ungracious and abrupt there were many things still to be said and indeed there had been no speech of any account made at all as yet  that is very sudden said the earl  i thought laura had told you  she has not told me a word lately she may have said something before you came here what is there to hurry you  i thought ten days would be as long as you would care to have me here and as i said that i would be back by the first i would rather not change my plans  you are going to hunt  yesi shall hunt till the end of march  you might have hunted here oswald but the son made no sign of changing his plans and the father seeing that he would not change them became solemn and severe there were a few words which he must say to his sonsomething of a speech that he must makeso he led the way into the room with the dark books and the dark furniture and pointed to a great deep armchair for his sons accommodation but as he did not sit down himself neither did lord chiltern lord chiltern understood very well how great is the advantage of a standing orator over a sitting recipient of his oratory and that advantage he would not give to his father i had hoped to have an opportunity of saying a few words to you about the future said the earl  i think we shall be married in july said lord chiltern  so i have heardbut after that now i do not want to interfere oswald and of course the less so because violets money will to a great degree restore the inroads which have been made upon the property  it will more than restore them altogether  not if her estate be settled on a second son oswald and i hear from lady baldock that that is the wish of her relations  she shall have her own wayas she ought what that way is i do not know i have not even asked about it she asked me and i told her to speak to you  of course i should wish it to go with the family property of course that would be best  she shall have her own wayas far as i am concerned  but it is not about that oswald that i would speak what are your plans of life when you are married  plans of life  yesplans of life i suppose you have some plans i suppose you mean to apply yourself to some useful occupation  i dont know really sir that i am of much use for any purpose lord chiltern laughed as he said this but did not laugh pleasantly  you would not be a drone in the hive always  as far as i can see sir we who call ourselves lords generally are drones  i deny it said the earl becoming quite energetic as he defended his order i deny it utterly i know no class of men who do work more useful or more honest am i a drone have i been so from my youth upwards i have always worked either in the one house or in the other and those of my fellows with whom i have been most intimate have worked also the same career is open to you  you mean politics  of course i mean politics  i dont care for politics i see no difference in parties  but you should care for politics and you should see a difference in parties it is your duty to do so my wish is that you should go into parliament  i cant do that sir  and why not  in the first place sir you have not got a seat to offer me you have managed matters among you in such a way that poor little loughton has been swallowed up if i were to canvass the electors of smotherem i dont think that many would look very sweet on me  there is the county oswald  and whom am i to turn out i should spend four or five thousand pounds and have nothing but vexation in return for it i had rather not begin that game and indeed i am too old for parliament i did not take it up early enough to believe in it  all this made the earl very angry and from these things they went on to worse things when questioned again as to the future lord chiltern scowled and at last declared that it was his idea to live abroad in the summer for his wifes recreation and somewhere down in the shires during the winter for his own he would admit of no purpose higher than recreation and when his father again talked to him of a noblemans duty he said that he knew of no other special duty than that of not exceeding his income then his father made a longer speech than before and at the end of it lord chiltern simply wished him good night its getting late and ive promised to see violet before i go to bed goodbye then he was off and lord brentford was left there standing with his back to the fire  after that lord chiltern had a discussion with violet which lasted nearly half the night and during the discussion she told him more than once that he was wrong such as i am you must take me or leave me he said in anger nay there is no choice now she answered i have taken you and i will stick by youwhether you are right or wrong but when i think you wrong i shall say so he swore to her as he pressed her to his heart that she was the finest grandest sweetest woman that ever the world had produced but still there was present on his palate when he left her the bitter taste of her reprimand     chapter lvi  what the people in marylebone thought   phineas finn when the session began was still hard at work upon his canada bill and in his work found some relief for his broken back he went into the matter with all his energy and before the debate came on knew much more about the seven thousand inhabitants of some hundreds of thousands of square miles at the back of canada than he did of the people of london or of county clare and he found some consolation also in the goodnature of madame goesler whose drawingroom was always open to him he could talk freely now to madame goesler about violet and had even ventured to tell her that once in old days he had thought of loving lady laura standish he spoke of those days as being very old and then he perhaps said some word to her about dear little mary flood jones i think that there was not much in his career of which he did not say something to madame goesler and that he received from her a good deal of excellent advice and encouragement in the direction of his political ambition a man should work she saidand you do work a woman can only look on and admire and long what is there that i can do i can learn to care for these canadians just because you care for them if it was the beavers that you told me of i should have to care for the beavers then phineas of course told her that such sympathy from her was all and all to him but the reader must not on this account suppose that he was untrue in his love to violet effingham his back was altogether broken by his fall and he was quite aware that such was the fact not as yet at least had come to him any remotest idea that a cure was possible  early in march he heard that lady laura was up in town and of course he was bound to go to her the information was given to him by mr kennedy himself who told him that he had been to scotland to fetch her in these days there was an acknowledged friendship between these two but there was no intimacy indeed mr kennedy was a man who was hardly intimate with any other man with phineas he now and then exchanged a few words in the lobby of the house and when they chanced to meet each other they met as friends mr kennedy had no strong wish to see again in his house the man respecting whom he had ventured to caution his wife but he was thoughtful and thinking over it all he found it better to ask him there no one must know that there was any reason why phineas should not come to his house especially as all the world knew that phineas had protected him from the garrotters lady laura is in town now he said you must go and see her before long phineas of course promised that he would go  in these days phineas was beginning to be aware that he had enemiesthough he could not understand why anybody should be his enemy now that violet effingham had decided against him there was poor laurence fitzgibbon indeed whom he had superseded at the colonial office but laurence fitzgibbon to give merit where merit was due felt no animosity against him at all youre welcome me boy youre welcomeas far as yourself goes but as for the party bedad its rotten to the core and wont stand another session mind its i who tell you so and the poor idle irishman in so speaking spoke the truth as well as he knew it but the ratlers and the bonteens were finns bitter foes and did not scruple to let him know that such was the case barrington erle had scruples on the subject and in a certain mildly apologetic way still spoke well of the young man whom he had himself first introduced into political life only four years sincebut there was no earnestness or cordiality in barrington erles manner and phineas knew that his first staunch friend could no longer be regarded as a pillar of support but there was a set of men quite as influentialso phineas thoughtas the busy politicians of the club who were very friendly to him these were men generally of high position of steady characterhard workerswho thought quite as much of what a man did in his office as what he said in the house lords cantrip thrift and fawn were of this classand they were all very courteous to phineas envious men began to say of him that he cared little now for any one of the party who had not a handle to his name and that he preferred to live with lords and lordlings this was hard upon him as the great political ambition of his life was to call mr monk his friend and he would sooner have acted with mr monk than with any other man in the cabinet but though mr monk had not deserted him there had come to be little of late in common between the two his life was becoming that of a parliamentary official rather than that of a politicianwhereas though mr monk was in office his public life was purely political mr monk had great ideas of his own which he intended to hold whether by holding them he might remain in office or be forced out of office and he was indifferent as to the direction which things in this respect might take with him but phineas who had achieved his declared object in getting into place felt that he was almost constrained to adopt the views of others let them be what they might men spoke to him as though his parliamentary career were wholly at the disposal of the governmentas though he were like a proxy in mr greshams pocketwith this difference that when directed to get up and speak on a subject he was bound to do so this annoyed him and he complained to mr monk but mr monk only shrugged his shoulders and told him that he must make his choice he soon discovered mr monks meaning if you choose to make parliament a professionas you have chosenyou can have no right even to think of independence if the country finds you out when you are in parliament and then invites you to office of course the thing is different but the latter is a slow career and probably would not have suited you that was the meaning of what mr monk said to him after all these official and parliamentary honours were greater when seen at a distance than he found them to be now that he possessed them mr low worked ten hours a day and could rarely call a day his own but after all with all this work mr low was less of a slave and more independent than was he phineas finn undersecretary of state the friend of cabinet ministers and member of parliament since his twentyfifth year he began to dislike the house and to think it a bore to sit on the treasury benchhe who a few years since had regarded parliament as the british heaven on earth and who since he had been in parliament had looked at that bench with longing envious eyes laurence fitzgibbon who seemed to have as much to eat and drink as ever and a bed also to lie on could come and go in the house as he pleased since hisresignation  and there was a new trouble coming the reform bill for england had passed but now there was to be another reform bill for ireland let them pass what bill they might this would not render necessary a new irish election till the entire house should be dissolved but he feared that he would be called upon to vote for the abolition of his own boroughand for other points almost equally distasteful to him he knew that he would not be consultedbut would be called upon to vote and perhaps to speak and was certain that if he did so there would be war between him and his constituents lord tulla had already communicated to him his ideas that for certain excellent reasons loughshane ought to be spared but this evil was he hoped a distant one it was generally thought that as the english reform bill had been passed last year and as the irish bill if carried could not be immediately operative the doing of the thing might probably be postponed to the next session  when he first saw lady laura he was struck by the great change in her look and manner she seemed to him to be old and worn and he judged her to be wretchedas she was she had written to him to say that she would be at her fathers house on such and such a morning and he had gone to her there it is of no use your coming to grosvenor place she said i see nobody there and the house is like a prison later in the interview she told him not to come and dine there even though mr kennedy should ask him  and why not he demanded  because everything would be stiff and cold and uncomfortable i suppose you do not wish to make your way into a ladys house if she asks you not there was a sort of smile on her face as she said this but he could perceive that it was a very bitter smile you can easily excuse yourself  yes i can excuse myself  then do so if you are particularly anxious to dine with mr kennedy you can easily do so at your club in the tone of her voice and the words she used she hardly attempted to conceal her dislike of her husband  and now tell me about miss effingham he said  there is nothing for me to tell  yes there ismuch to tell you need not spare me i do not pretend to deny to you that i have been hit hardso hard that i have been nearly knocked down but it will not hurt me now to hear of it all did she always love him  i cannot say i think she did after her own fashion  i sometimes think women would be less cruel he said if they knew how great is the anguish they can cause  has she been cruel to you  i have nothing to complain of but if she loved chiltern why did she not tell him so at once and why  this is complaining mr finn  i will not complain i would not even think of it if i could help it are they to be married soon  in julyso they now say  and where will they live  ah no one can tell i do not think that they agree as yet as to that but if she has a strong wish oswald will yield to it he was always generous  i would not even have had a wishexcept to have her with me  there was a pause for a moment and then lady laura answered him with a touch of scorn in her voiceand with some scorn too in her eyethat is all very well mr finn but the season will not be over before there is some one else  there you wrong me  they tell me that you are already at madame goeslers feet  madame goesler  what matters who it is as long as she is young and pretty and has the interest attached to her of something more than ordinary position when men tell me of the cruelty of women i think that no woman can be really cruel because no man is capable of suffering a woman if she is thrown aside does suffer  do you mean to tell me then that i am indifferent to miss effingham when he thus spoke i wonder whether he had forgotten that he had ever declared to this very woman to whom he was speaking a passion for herself  psha  it suits you lady laura to be harsh to me but you are not speaking your thoughts  then she lost all control of herself and poured out to him the real truth that was in her and whose thoughts did you speak when you and i were on the braes of loughlinter am i wrong in saying that change is easy to you or have i grown to be so old that you can talk to me as though those faraway follies ought to be forgotten was it so long ago talk of love i tell you sir that your heart is one in which love can have no durable hold violet effingham there may be a dozen violets after her and you will be none the worse then she walked away from him to the window and he stood still dumb on the spot that he had occupied you had better go now she said and forget what has passed between us i know that you are a gentleman and that you will forget it the strong idea of his mind when he heard all this was the injustice of her attackof the attack as coming from her who had all but openly acknowledged that she had married a man whom she had not loved because it suited her to escape from a man whom she did love she was reproaching him now for his fickleness in having ventured to set his heart upon another woman when she herself had been so much worse than fickleso profoundly false and yet he could not defend himself by accusing her what would she have had of him what would she have proposed to him had he questioned her as to his future when they were together on the braes of loughlinter would she not have bid him to find some one else whom he could love would she then have suggested to him the propriety of nursing his love for herselffor her who was about to become another mans wifefor her after she should have become another mans wife and yet because he had not done so and because she had made herself wretched by marrying a man whom she did not love she reproached him  he could not tell her of all this so he fell back for his defence on words which had passed between them since the day when they had met on the braes lady laura he said it is only a month or two since you spoke to me as though you wished that violet effingham might be my wife  i never wished it i never said that i wished it there are moments in which we try to give a child any brick on the chimney top for which it may whimper then there was another silence which she was the first to break you had better go she said i know that i have committed myself and of course i would rather be alone  and what would you wish that i should do  do she said what you do can be nothing to me  must we be strangers you and i because there was a time in which we were almost more than friends  i have spoken nothing about myself sironly as i have been drawn to do so by your pretence of being lovesick you can do nothing for menothingnothing what is it possible that you should do for me you are not my father or my brother it is not to be supposed that she wanted him to fall at her feet it is to be supposed that had he done so her reproaches would have been hot and heavy on him but yet it almost seemed to him as though he had no other alternative nohe was not her father or her brothernor could he be her husband and at this very moment as she knew his heart was sore with love for another woman and yet he hardly knew how not to throw himself at her feet and swear that he would return now and for ever to his old passion hopeless sinful degraded as it would be  i wish it were possible for me to do something he said drawing near to her  there is nothing to be done she said clasping her hands together for me nothing i have before me no escape no hope no prospect of relief no place of consolation you have everything before you you complain of a wound you have at least shown that such wounds with you are capable of cure you cannot but feel that when i hear your wailings i must be impatient you had better leave me now if you please  and are we to be no longer friends he asked  as far as friendship can go without intercourse i shall always be your friend  then he went and as he walked down to his office so intent was he on that which had just passed that he hardly saw the people as he met them or was aware of the streets through which his way led him there had been something in the later words which lady laura had spoken that had made him feel almost unconsciously that the injustice of her reproaches was not so great as he had at first felt it to be and that she had some cause for her scorn if her case was such as she had so plainly described it what was his plight as compared with hers he had lost his violet and was in pain there must be much of suffering before him but though violet were lost the world was not all blank before his eyes he had not told himself even in his dreariest moments that there was before him no escape no hope no prospect of relief no place of consolation and then he began to think whether this must in truth be the case with lady laura what if mr kennedy were to die what in such case as that would he do in ten or perhaps in five years time might it not be possible for him to go through the ceremony of falling upon his knees with stiffened joints indeed but still with something left of the ardour of his old love of his oldest love of all  as he was thinking of this he was brought up short in his walk as he was entering the green park beneath the dukes figure by laurence fitzgibbon how dare you not be in your office at such an hour as this finn me boyor at least not in the houseor serving your masters after some fashion said the late undersecretary  so i am ive been on a message to marylebone to find what the people there think about the canadas  and what do they think about the canadas in marylebone  not one man in a thousand cares whether the canadians prosper or fail to prosper they care that canada should not go to the states becausethough they dont love the canadians they do hate the americans thats about the feeling in maryleboneand its astonishing how like the maryleboners are to the rest of the world  dear me what a fellow you are for an undersecretary youve heard the news about little violet  what news  she has quarrelled with chiltern you know  who says so  never mind who says so but they tell me its true take an old friends advice and strike while the irons hot  phineas did not believe what he had heard but though he did not believe it still the tidings set his heart beating he would have believed it less perhaps had he known that laurence had just received the news from mrs bonteen     chapter lvii  the top brick of the chimney   madame max goesler was a lady who knew that in fighting the battles which fell to her lot in arranging the social difficulties which she found in her way in doing the work of the world which came to her share very much more care was necessaryand care too about things apparently triflingthan was demanded by the affairs of people in general and this was not the case so much on account of any special disadvantage under which she laboured as because she was ambitious of doing the very uttermost with those advantages which she possessed her own birth had not been high and that of her husband we may perhaps say had been very low he had been old when she had married him and she had had little power of making any progress till he had left her a widow then she found herself possessed of money certainly of witas she believed and of a something in her personal appearance which as she plainly told herself she might perhaps palm off upon the world as beauty she was a woman who did not flatter herself who did not strongly believe in herself who could even bring herself to wonder that men and women in high position should condescend to notice such a one as her with all her ambition there was a something of genuine humility about her and with all the hardness she had learned there was a touch of womanly softness which would sometimes obtrude itself upon her heart when she found a woman really kind to her she would be very kind in return and though she prized wealth and knew that her money was her only rock of strength she could be lavish with it as though it were dirt  but she was highly ambitious and she played her game with great skill and great caution her doors were not open to all callerswere shut even to some who find but few doors closed against themwere shut occasionally to those whom she most specially wished to see within them she knew how to allure by denying and to make the gift rich by delaying it we are told by the latin proverb that he who gives quickly gives twice but i say that she who gives quickly seldom gives more than half when in the early spring the duke of omnium first knocked at madame max goeslers door he was informed that she was not at home the duke felt very cross as he handed his card out from his dark green broughamon the panel of which there was no blazon to tell the owners rank he was very cross she had told him that she was always at home between four and six on a thursday he had condescended to remember the information and had acted upon itand now she was not at home she was not at home though he had come on a thursday at the very hour she had named to him any duke would have been cross but the duke of omnium was particularly cross nohe certainly would give himself no further trouble by going to the cottage in park lane and yet madame max goesler had been in her own drawingroom while the duke was handing out his card from the brougham below  on the next morning there came to him a note from the cottagesuch a pretty noteso penitent so full of remorseand which was better still so laden with disappointment that he forgave her      my dear duke     i hardly know how to apologise to you after having told    you that i am always at home on thursdays and i was at    home yesterday when you called but i was unwell and i    had told the servant to deny me not thinking how much i    might be losing indeed indeed i would not have given    way to a silly headache had i thought that your grace    would have been here i suppose that now i must not even    hope for the photograph     yours penitently     marie m g   the notepaper was very pretty notepaper hardly scented and yet conveying a sense of something sweet and the monogram was small and new and fantastic without being grotesque and the writing was of that sort which the duke having much experience had learned to likeand there was something in the signature which pleased him so he wrote a reply      dear madame max goesler     i will call again next thursday or if prevented will    let you know     yours faithfully     o   when the green brougham drew up at the door of the cottage on the next thursday madame goesler was at home and had no headache  she was not at all penitent now she had probably studied the subject and had resolved that penitence was more alluring in a letter than when acted in person she received her guest with perfect ease and apologised for the injury done to him in the preceding week with much selfcomplacency i was so sorry when i got your card she said and yet i am so glad now that you were refused  if you were ill said the duke it was better  i was horribly ill to tell the truthas pale as a deaths head and without a word to say for myself i was fit to see no one  then of course you were right  but it flashed upon me immediately that i had named a day and that you had been kind enough to remember it but i did not think you came to london till the march winds were over  the march winds blow everywhere in this wretched island madame goesler and there is no escaping them youth may prevail against them but on me they are so potent that i think they will succeed in driving me out of my country i doubt whether an old man should ever live in england if he can help it  the duke certainly was an old man if a man turned of seventy be oldand he was a man too who did not bear his years with hearty strength he moved slowly and turned his limbs when he did turn them as though the joints were stiff in their sockets but there was nevertheless about him a dignity of demeanour a majesty of person and an upright carriage which did not leave an idea of old age as the first impress on the minds of those who encountered the duke of omnium he was tall and moved without a stoop and though he moved slowly he had learned to seem so to do because it was the proper kind of movement for one so high up in the world as himself and perhaps his tailor did something for him he had not been long under madame max goeslers eyes before she perceived that his tailor had done a good deal for him when he alluded to his own age and to her youth she said some pleasant little word as to the difference between oaktrees and currantbushes and by that time she was seated comfortably on her sofa and the duke was on a chair before herjust as might have been any man who was not a duke  after a little time the photograph was brought forth from his graces pocket that bringing out and giving of photographs with the demand for counter photographs is the most absurd practice of the day i dont think i look very nice do i oh yesvery nice but a little too old and certainly you havent got those spots all over your forehead these are the remarks which on such occasions are the most common it may be said that to give a photograph or to take a photograph without the utterance of some words which would be felt by a bystander to be absurd is almost an impossibility at this moment there was no bystander and therefore the duke and the lady had no need for caution words were spoken that were very absurd madame goesler protested that the dukes photograph was more to her than the photographs of all the world beside and the duke declared that he would carry the ladys picture next to his hearti am afraid he said for ever and ever then he took her hand and pressed it and was conscious that for a man over seventy years of age he did that kind of thing very well  you will come and dine with me duke she said when he began to talk of going  i never dine out  that is just the reason you should dine with me you shall meet nobody you do not wish to meet  i would so much rather see you in this wayi would indeed i do dine out occasionally but it is at big formal parties which i cannot escape without giving offence  and you cannot escape my little not formal partywithout giving offence she looked into his face as she spoke and he knew that she meant it and he looked into hers and thought that her eyes were brighter than any he was in the habit of seeing in these latter days name your own day duke will a sunday suit you  if i must come  you must come as she spoke her eyes sparkled more and more and her colour went and came and she shook her curls till they emitted through the air the same soft feeling of a perfume that her note had produced then her foot peeped out from beneath the black and yellow drapery of her dress and the duke saw that it was perfect and she put out her finger and touched his arm as she spoke her hand was very fair and her fingers were bright with rich gems to men such as the duke a hand to be quite fair should be bright with rich gems you must come she saidnot imploring him now but commanding him  then i will come he answered and a certain sunday was fixed  the arranging of the guests was a little difficulty till madame goesler begged the duke to bring with him lady glencora palliser his nephews wife this at last he agreed to do as the wife of his nephew and heir lady glencora was to the duke all that a woman could be she was everything that was proper as to her own conduct and not obtrusive as to his she did not bore him and yet she was attentive although in her husbands house she was a fierce politician in his house she was simply an attractive woman ah she is very clever the duke once said she adapts herself if she were to go from any one place to any other she would be at home in both and the movement of his graces hand as he spoke seemed to indicate the widest possible sphere for travelling and the widest possible scope for adaptation the dinner was arranged and went off very pleasantly madame goeslers eyes were not quite so bright as they were during that morning visit nor did she touch her guests arm in a manner so alluring she was very quiet allowing her guests to do most of the talking but the dinner and the flowers and the wine were excellent and the whole thing was so quiet that the duke liked it and now you must come and dine with me the duke said as he took his leave a command to that effect will be one which i certainly shall not disobey whispered madame goesler  i am afraid he is going to get fond of that woman these words were spoken early on the following morning by lady glencora to her husband mr palliser  he is always getting fond of some woman and he will to the end said mr palliser  but this madame max goesler is very clever  so they tell me i have generally thought that my uncle likes talking to a fool the best  every man likes a clever woman the best said lady glencora if the clever woman only knows how to use her cleverness  im sure i hope hell be amused said mr palliser innocently a little amusement is all that he cares for now  suppose you were told some day that he was goingto be married said lady glencora  my uncle married  why not he as well as another  and to madame goesler  if he be ever married it will be to some such woman  there is not a man in all england who thinks more of his own position than my uncle said mr palliser somewhat proudlyalmost with a touch of anger  that is all very well plantagenet and true enough in a kind of way but a child will sacrifice all that it has for the top brick of the chimney and old men sometimes become children you would not like to be told some morning that there was a little lord silverbridge in the world now the eldest son of the duke of omnium when the duke of omnium had a son was called the earl of silverbridge and mr palliser when this question was asked him became very pale mr palliser knew well how thoroughly the cunning of the serpent was joined to the purity of the dove in the person of his wife and he was sure that there was cause for fear when she hinted at danger  perhaps you had better keep your eye upon him he said to his wife  and upon her said lady glencora  when madame goesler dined at the dukes house in st jamess square there was a large party and lady glencora knew that there was no need for apprehension then indeed madame goesler was no more than any other guest and the duke hardly spoke to her there was a duchess therethe duchess of st bungay and old lady hartletop who was a dowager marchionessan old lady who pestered the duke very sorelyand madame max goesler received her reward and knew that she was receiving it in being asked to meet these people would not all these names including her own be blazoned to the world in the columns of the next days morning post there was no absolute danger here as lady glencora knew and lady glencora who was tolerant and begrudged nothing to madame max except the one thing was quite willing to meet the lady at such a grand affair as this but the duke even should he become ever so childish a child in his old age still would have that plain green brougham at his command and could go anywhere in that at any hour in the day and then madame goesler was so manifestly a clever woman a duchess of omnium might be said to fillin the estimation at any rate of english peoplethe highest position in the world short of royalty and the reader will remember that lady glencora intended to be a duchess of omnium herselfunless some very unexpected event should intrude itself she intended also that her little boy her fairhaired curlypated boldfaced little boy should be earl of silverbridge when the sand of the old man should have run itself out heavens what a blow would it be should some little wizencheeked halfmonkey baby with black brows and yellow skin be brought forward and shown to her some day as the heir what a blow to herselfand what a blow to all england we cant prevent it if he chooses to do it said her husband who had his budget to bring forward that very night and who in truth cared more for his budget than he did for his heirship at that moment but we must prevent it said lady glencora if i stick to him by the tail of his coat ill prevent it at the time when she thus spoke the dark green brougham had been twice again brought up at the door in park lane  and the brougham was standing there a third time it was may now the latter end of may and the park opposite was beautiful with green things and the air was soft and balmy as it will be sometimes even in may and the flowers in the balcony were full of perfume and the charm of londonwhat london can be to the richwas at its height the duke was sitting in madame goeslers drawingroom at some distance from her for she had retreated the duke had a habit of taking her hand which she never would permit for above a few seconds at such times she would show no anger but would retreat  marie said the duke you will go abroad when the summer is over as an old man he had taken the privilege of calling her marie and she had not forbidden it  yes probably to vienna i have property in vienna you know which must be looked after  do not mind vienna this year come to italy  what in summer duke  the lakes are charming in august i have a villa on como which is empty now and i think i shall go there if you do not know the italian lakes i shall be so happy to show them to you  i know them well my lord when i was young i was on the maggiore almost alone some day i will tell you a history of what i was in those days  you shall tell it me there  no my lord i fear not i have no villa there  will you not accept the loan of mine it shall be all your own while you use it  my ownto deny the right of entrance to its owner  if it so pleases you  it would not please me it would so far from please me that i will never put myself in a position that might make it possible for me to require to do so no duke it behoves me to live in houses of my own women of whom more is known can afford to be your guests  marie i would have no other guest than you  it cannot be so duke  and why not  why not am i to be put to the blush by being made to answer such a question as that because the world would say that the duke of omnium had a new mistress and that madame goesler was the woman do you think that i would be any mans mistresseven yours or do you believe that for the sake of the softness of a summer evening on an italian lake i would give cause to the tongues of the women here to say that i was such a thing you would have me lose all that i have gained by steady years of sober work for the sake of a week or two of dalliance such as that no duke not for your dukedom  how his grace might have got through his difficulty had they been left alone cannot be told for at this moment the door was opened and lady glencora palliser was announced     chapter lviii  rara avis in terris   come and see the country and judge for yourself said phineas  i should like nothing better said mr monk  it has often seemed to me that men in parliament know less about ireland than they do of the interior of africa said phineas  it is seldom that we know anything accurately on any subject that we have not made matter of careful study said mr monk and very often do not do so even then we are very apt to think that we men and women understand one another but most probably you know nothing even of the modes of thought of the man who lives next door to you  i suppose not  there are general laws current in the world as to morality thou shalt not steal for instance that has necessarily been current as a law through all nations but the first man you meet in the street will have ideas about theft so different from yours that if you knew them as you know your own you would say that this law and yours were not even founded on the same principle it is compatible with this mans honesty to cheat you in a matter of horseflesh with that mans in a traffic of railway shares with that other mans as to a womans fortune with a fourths anything may be done for a seat in parliament while the fifth man who stands high among us and who implores his god every sunday to write that law on his heart spends every hour of his daily toil in a system of fraud and is regarded as a pattern of the national commerce  mr monk and phineas were dining together at mr monks house and the elder politician of the two in this little speech had recurred to certain matters which had already been discussed between them mr monk was becoming somewhat sick of his place in the cabinet though he had not as yet whispered a word of his sickness to any living ears and he had begun to pine for the lost freedom of a seat below the gangway he had been discussing political honesty with phineas and hence had come the sermon of which i have ventured to reproduce the concluding denunciations  phineas was fond of such discussions and fond of holding them with mr monkin this matter fluttering like a moth round a candle he would not perceive that as he had made up his mind to be a servant of the public in parliament he must abandon all idea of independent action and unless he did so he could be neither successful as regarded himself or useful to the public whom he served could a man be honest in parliament and yet abandon all idea of independence when he put such questions to mr monk he did not get a direct answer and indeed the question was never put directly but the teaching which he received was ever of a nature to make him uneasy it was always to this effect you have taken up the trade now and seem to be fit for success in it you had better give up thinking about its special honesty and yet mr monk would on an occasion preach to him such a sermon as that which he had just uttered perhaps there is no question more difficult to a mans mind than that of the expediency or inexpediency of scruples in political life whether would a candidate for office be more liable to rejection from a leader because he was known to be scrupulous or because he was known to be the reverse  but putting aside the fourth commandment and all the theories you will come to ireland said phineas  i shall be delighted  i dont live in a castle you know  i thought everybody did live in a castle in ireland said mr monk they seemed to do when i was there twenty years ago but for myself i prefer a cottage  this trip to ireland had been proposed in consequence of certain ideas respecting tenantright which mr monk was beginning to adopt and as to which the minds of politicians were becoming moved it had been all very well to put down fenianism and ribandmen and repealand everything that had been put down in ireland in the way of rebellion for the last seventyfive years england and ireland had been apparently joined together by laws of nature so fixed that even politicians liberal as was mr monkliberal as was mr turnbullcould not trust themselves to think that disunion could be for the good of the irish they had taught themselves that it certainly could not be good for the english but if it was incumbent on england to force upon ireland the maintenance of the union for her own sake and for englands sake because england could not afford independence established so close against her own ribsit was at any rate necessary to englands character that the bride thus bound in a compulsory wedlock should be endowed with all the best privileges that a wife can enjoy let her at least not be a kept mistress let it be bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh if we are to live together in the married state between husband and wife a warm word now and then matters but little if there be a thoroughly good understanding at bottom but let there be that good understanding at bottom what about this protestant church and what about this tenantright mr monk had been asking himself these questions for some time past in regard to the church he had long made up his mind that the establishment in ireland was a crying sin a man had married a woman whom he knew to be of a religion different from his own and then insisted that his wife should say that she believed those things which he knew very well that she did not believe but as mr monk well knew the subject of the protestant endowments in ireland was so difficult that it would require almost more than human wisdom to adjust it it was one of those matters which almost seemed to require the interposition of some higher powerthe coming of some apparently chance eventto clear away the evil as a fire comes and pestilential alleys are removed as a famine comes and men are driven from want and ignorance and dirt to seek new homes and new thoughts across the broad waters as a war comes and slavery is banished from the face of the earth but in regard to tenantright to some arrangement by which a tenant in ireland might be at least encouraged to lay out what little capital he might have in labour or money without being at once called upon to pay rent for that outlay which was his own as well as for the land which was not his ownmr monk thought that it was possible that if a man would look hard enough he might perhaps be able to see his way as to that he had spoken to two of his colleagues on the subject the two men in the cabinet whom he believed to be the most thoroughly honest in their ideas as public servants the duke and mr gresham there was so much to be doneand then so little was known upon the subject i will endeavour to study it said mr monk if you can see your way do said mr greshambut of course we cannot bind ourselves i should be glad to see it named in the queens speech at the beginning of the next session said mr monk that is a long way off as yet said mr gresham laughing who will be in then and who will be out so the matter was disposed of at the time but mr monk did not abandon his idea he rather felt himself the more bound to cling to it because he received so little encouragement what was a seat in the cabinet to him that he should on that account omit a duty he had not taken up politics as a trade he had sat far behind the treasury bench or below the gangway for many a year without owing any man a shillingand could afford to do so again  but it was different with phineas finn as mr monk himself understoodand understanding this he felt himself bound to caution his young friend but it may be a question whether his cautions did not do more harm than good i shall be delighted he said to go over with you in august but i do not think that if i were you i would take up this matter  and why not you dont want to fight the battle singlehanded  no i desire no such glory and would wish to have no better lieutenant than you but you have a subject of which you are really fond which you are beginning to understand and in regard to which you can make yourself useful  you mean this canada business  yesand that will grow to other matters as regards the colonies there is nothing so important to a public man as that he should have his own subjectthe thing which he understands and in respect of which he can make himself really useful  then there comes a change  yesand the man who has half learned how to have a ship built without waste is sent into opposition and is then brought back to look after regiments or perhaps has to take up that beautiful subject a study of the career of india but nevertheless if you have a subject stick to it at any rate as long as it will stick to you  but said phineas if a man takes up his own subject independent of the government no man can drive him from it  and how often does he do anything look at the annual motions which come forward in the hands of private menmaynooth and the ballot for instance it is becoming more and more apparent every day that all legislation must be carried by the government and must be carried in obedience to the expressed wish of the people the truest democracy that ever had a chance of living is that which we are now establishing in great britain  then leave tenantright to the people and the cabinet why should you take it up  mr monk paused a moment or two before he replied if i choose to run amuck there is no reason why you should follow me i am old and you are young i want nothing from politics as a profession and you do moreover you have a congenial subject where you are and need not disturb yourself for myself i tell you in confidence that i cannot speak so comfortably of my own position  we will go and see at any rate said phineas  yes said mr monk we will go and see and thus in the month of may it was settled between them that as soon as the session should be over and the incidental work of his office should allow phineas to pack up and be off they two should start together for ireland phineas felt rather proud as he wrote to his father and asked permission to bring home with him a cabinet minister as a visitor at this time the reputation of phineas at killaloe as well in the minds of the killaloeians generally as in those of the inhabitants of the paternal house stood very high indeed how could a father think that a son had done badly when before he was thirty years of age he was earning ¬£2000 a year and how could a father not think well of a son who had absolutely paid back certain moneys into the paternal coffers the moneys so repaid had not been much but the repayment of any such money at killaloe had been regarded as little short of miraculous the news of mr monks coming flew about the town about the county about the diocese and all people began to say all good things about the old doctors only son mrs finn had long since been quite sure that a real black swan had been sent forth out of her nest and the sisters finn for some time past had felt in all social gatherings they stood quite on a different footing than formerly because of their brother they were asked about in the county and two of them had been staying only last easter with the molonysthe molonys of poldoodie how should a father and a mother and sisters not be grateful to such a son to such a brother to such a veritable black swan out of the nest and as for dear little mary flood jones her eyes became suffused with tears as in her solitude she thought how much out of her reach this swan was flying and yet she took joy in his swanhood and swore that she would love him stillthat she would love him always might he bring home with him to killaloe mr monk the cabinet minister of course he might when mrs finn first heard of this august arrival she felt as though she would like to expend herself in entertaining though but an hour the whole cabinet  phineas during the spring had of course met mr kennedy frequently in and about the house and had become aware that lady lauras husband from time to time made little overtures of civility to himtaking him now and again by the buttonhole walking home with him as far as their joint paths allowed and asking him once or twice to come and dine in grosvenor place these little advances towards a repetition of the old friendship phineas would have avoided altogether had it been possible the invitation to mr kennedys house he did refuse feeling himself positively bound to do so by lady lauras command let the consequences be what they might when he did refuse mr kennedy would assume a look of displeasure and leave him and phineas would hope that the work was done then there would come another encounter and the invitation would be repeated at last about the middle of may there came another note dear finn will you dine with us on wednesday the 28th i give you a long notice because you seem to have so many appointments yours always robert kennedy he had no alternative he must refuse even though double the notice had been given he could only think that mr kennedy was a very obtuse man and one who would not take a hint and hope that he might succeed at last so he wrote an answer not intended to be conciliatory my dear kennedy i am sorry to say that i am engaged on the 28th yours always phineas finn at this period he did his best to keep out of mr kennedys way and would be very cunning in his manoeuvres that they should not be alone together it was difficult as they sat on the same bench in the house and consequently saw each other almost every day of their lives nevertheless he thought that with a little cunning he might prevail especially as he was not unwilling to give so much of offence as might assist his own object but when mr kennedy called upon him at his office the day after he had written the above note he had no means of escape  i am sorry you cannot come to us on the 28th mr kennedy said as soon as he was seated  phineas was taken so much by surprise that all his cunning failed him well yes said he i was very sorryvery sorry indeed  it seems to me finn that you have had some reason for avoiding me of late i do not know that i have done anything to offend you  nothing on earth said phineas  i am wrong then in supposing that anything beyond mere chance has prevented you from coming to my house phineas felt that he was in a terrible difficulty and he felt also that he was being rather illused in being thus crossexamined as to his reasons for not going to a gentlemans dinner he thought that a man ought to be allowed to choose where he would go and where he would not go and that questions such as these were very uncommon mr kennedy was sitting opposite to him looking more grave and more sour than usualand now his own countenance also became a little solemn it was impossible that he should use lady lauras name and yet he must in some way let his persecuting friend know that no further invitation would be of any usethat there was something beyond mere chance in his not going to grosvenor place but how was he to do this the difficulty was so great that he could not see his way out of it so he sat silent with a solemn face mr kennedy then asked him another question which made the difficulty ten times greater has my wife asked you not to come to our house  it was necessary now that he should make a rush and get out of his trouble in some way to tell you the truth kennedy i dont think she wants to see me there  that does not answer my question has she asked you not to come  she said that which left on my mind an impression that she would sooner that i did not come  what did she say  how can i answer such a question as that kennedy is it fair to ask it  quite fairi think  i think it quite unfair and i must decline to answer it i cannot imagine what you expect to gain by crossquestioning me in this way of course no man likes to go to a house if he does not believe that everybody there will make him welcome  you and lady laura used to be great friends  i hope we are not enemies now but things will occur that cause friendships to grow cool  have you quarrelled with her father  with lord brentfordno  or with her brothersince the duel i mean  upon my word and honour i cannot stand this and i will not i have not as yet quarrelled with anybody but i must quarrel with you if you go on in this way it is quite unusual that a man should be put through his facings after such a fashion and i must beg that there may be an end of it  then i must ask lady laura  you can say what you like to your own wife of course i cannot hinder you  upon that mr kennedy formally shook hands with him in token that there was no positive breach between themas two nations may still maintain their alliance though they have made up their minds to hate each other and thwart each other at every turnand took his leave phineas as he sat at his window looking out into the park and thinking of what had passed could not but reflect that disagreeable as mr kennedy had been to him he would probably make himself much more disagreeable to his wife and for himself he thought that he had got out of the scrape very well by the exhibition of a little mock anger     chapter lix  the earls wrath   the reader may remember that a rumour had been conveyed to phineasa rumour indeed which reached him from a source which he regarded as very untrustworthythat violet effingham had quarrelled with her lover he would probably have paid no attention to the rumour beyond that which necessarily attached itself to any tidings as to a matter so full of interest to him had it not been repeated to him in another quarter a bird has told me that your violet effingham has broken with her lover madame goesler said to him one day what bird he asked ah that i cannot tell you but this i will confess to you that these birds which tell us news are seldom very credibleand are often not very creditable you must take a birds word for what it may be worth it is said that they have quarrelled i daresay if the truth were known they are billing and cooing in each others arms at this moment  phineas did not like to be told of their billing and cooingdid not like to be told even of their quarrelling though they were to quarrel it would do him no good he would rather that nobody should mention their names to himso that his back which had been so utterly broken might in process of time get itself cured from what he knew of violet he thought it very improbable that even were she to quarrel with one lover she would at once throw herself into the arms of another and he did feel too that there would be some meanness in taking her were she willing to be so taken but nevertheless these rumours coming to him in this way from different sources almost made it incumbent on him to find out the truth he began to think that his broken back was not curedthat perhaps after all it was not in the way of being cured and was it not possible that there might be explanations then he went to work and built castles in the air so constructed as to admit of the possibility of violet effingham becoming his wife  this had been in april and at that time all that he knew of violet was that she was not yet in london and he thought that he knew the same as to lord chiltern the earl had told him that chiltern was not in town nor expected in town as yet and in saying so had seemed to express displeasure against his son phineas had met lady baldock at some house which he frequented and had been quite surprised to find himself graciously received by the old woman she had said not a word of violet but had spoken of lord chilternmentioning his name in bitter wrath but he is a friend of mine said phineas smiling a friend indeed mr finn i know what sort of a friend i dont believe that you are his friend i am afraid he is not worthy of having any friend phineas did not quite understand from this that lady baldock was signifying to him that badly as she had thought of him as a suitor for her niece she would have preferred himespecially now when people were beginning to speak well of himto that terrible young man who from his youth upwards had been to her a cause of fear and trembling of course it was desirable that violet should marry an elder son and a peers heir all that kind of thing in lady baldocks eyes was most desirable but nevertheless anything was better than lord chiltern if violet would not take mr appledom or lord fawn in heavens name let her take this young man who was kind worthy and steady who was civilised in his manners and would no doubt be amenable in regard to settlements lady baldock had so far fallen in the world that she would have consented to make a bargain with her niecealmost any bargain so long as lord chiltern was excluded phineas did not quite understand all this but when lady baldock asked him to come to berkeley square he perceived that help was being proffered to him where he certainly had not looked for help  he was frequently with lord brentford who talked to him constantly on matters connected with his parliamentary life after having been the intimate friend of the daughter and of the son it now seemed to be his lot to be the intimate friend of the father the earl had constantly discussed with him his arrangements with his son and had lately expressed himself as only half satisfied with such reconciliation as had taken place and phineas could perceive that from day to day the earl was less and less satisfied he would complain bitterly of his soncomplain of his silence complain of his not coming to london complain of his conduct to violet complain of his idle indifference to anything like proper occupation but he had never as yet said a word to show that there had been any quarrel between violet and her lover and phineas had felt that he could not ask the question mr finn said the earl to him one morning as soon as he entered the room i have just heard a story which has almost seemed to me to be incredible the noblemans manner was very stern and the fact that he called his young friend mr finn showed at once that something was wrong  what is it you have heard my lord said phineas  that you and chiltern went overlast year tobelgium and foughta duel there  now it must have been the case that in the set among which they all livedlord brentford and his son and daughter and phineas finnthe old lord was the only man who had not heard of the duel before this it had even penetrated to the dull ears of mr kennedy reminding him as it did so that his wife hadtold him a lie but it was the fact that no rumour of the duel had reached the earl till this morning  it is true said phineas  i have never been so much shocked in my lifenever i had no idea that you had any thought of aspiring to the hand of miss effingham the lords voice as he said this was very stern  as i aspired in vain and as chiltern has been successful that need not now be made a reproach against me  i do not know what to think of it mr finn i am so much surprised that i hardly know what to say i must declare my opinion at once that you behavedvery badly  i do not know how much you know my lord and how much you do not know and the circumstances of the little affair do not permit me to be explicit about them but as you have expressed your opinion so openly you must allow me to express mine and to say that as far as i can judge of my own actions i did not behave badly at all  do you intend to defend duelling sir  no if you mean to tell me that a duel is of itself sinful i have nothing to say i suppose it is my defence of myself merely goes to the manner in which this duel was fought and the fact that i fought it with your son  i cannot conceive how you can have come to my house as my guest and stood upon my interest for my borough when you at the time were doing your very best to interpose yourself between chiltern and the lady whom you so well knew i wished to become his wife phineas was aware that the earl must have been very much moved indeed when he thus permitted himself to speak of his borough he said nothing now however though the earl pausedand then the angry lord went on i must say that there was somethingsomething almost approaching to duplicity in such conduct  if i were to defend myself by evidence lord brentford i should have to go back to exact datesand dates not of facts which i could verify but dates as to my feelings which could not be verifiedand that would be useless i can only say that i believe i know what the honour and truth of a gentleman demandeven to the verge of selfsacrifice and that i have done nothing that ought to place my character as a gentleman in jeopardy if you will ask your son i think he will tell you the same  i have asked him it was he who told me of the duel  when did he tell you my lord  just now this morning thus phineas learned that lord chiltern was at this moment in the houseor at least in london  and did he complain of my conduct  i complain of it sir i complain of it very bitterly i placed the greatest confidence in you especially in regard to my sons affairs and you deceived me the earl was very angry and was more angry from the fact that this young man who had offended him to whom he had given such vital assistance when assistance was needed had used that assistance to its utmost before his sin was found out had phineas still been sitting for loughton so that the earl could have said to him you are now bound to retreat from this borough because you have offended me your patron i think that he would have forgiven the offender and allowed him to remain in his seat there would have been a scene and the earl would have been pacified but now the offender was beyond his reach altogether having used the borough as a most convenient steppingstone over his difficulties and having so used it just at the time when he was committing this sin there was a good fortune about phineas which added greatly to the lords wrath and then to tell the truth he had not that rich consolation for which phineas gave him credit lord chiltern had told him that morning that the engagement between him and violet was at an end you have so preached to her my lord about my duties the son had said to his father that she finds herself obliged to give me your sermons at second hand till i can bear them no longer but of this phineas knew nothing as yet the earl however was so imprudent in his anger that before this interview was over he had told the whole story yesyou deceived me he continued and i can never trust you again  was it for me my lord to tell you of that which would have increased your anger against your own son when he wanted me to fight was i to come like a sneak at school and tell you the story i know what you would have thought of me had i done so and when it was over was i to come and tell you then think what you yourself would have done when you were young and you may be quite sure that i did the same what have i gained he has got all that he wanted and you have also got all that you wantedand i have helped you both lord brentford i can put my hand on my heart and say that i have been honest to you  i have got nothing that i wanted said the earl in his despair  lord chiltern and miss effingham will be man and wife  nothey will not he has quarrelled with her he is so obstinate that she will not bear with him  then it was all true even though the rumours had reached him through laurence fitzgibbon and madame max goesler at any rate my lord that has not been my fault he said after a moments hesitation the earl was walking up and down the room angry with himself at his own mistake in having told the story and not knowing what further to say to his visitor he had been in the habit of talking so freely to phineas about his son that he could hardly resist the temptation of doing so still and yet it was impossible that he could swallow his anger and continue in the same strain my lord said phineas after a while i can assure you that i grieve that you should be grieved i have received so much undeserved favour from your family that i owe you a debt which i can never pay i am sorry that you should be angry with me now but i hope that a time may come when you will think less severely of my conduct  he was about to leave the room when the earl stopped him will you give me your word said the earl that you will think no more of miss effingham phineas stood silent considering how he might answer this proposal resolving that nothing should bring him to such a pledge as that suggested while there was yet a ledge for hope to stand on say that mr finn and i will forgive everything  i cannot acknowledge that i have done anything to be forgiven  say that repeated the earl and everything shall be forgotten  there need be no cause for alarm my lord said phineas you may be sure that miss effingham will not think of me  will you give me your word  no my lordcertainly not you have no right to ask it and the pursuit is open to me as to any other man who may choose to follow it i have hardly a vestige of a hope of success it is barely possible that i should succeed but if it be true that miss effingham be disengaged i shall endeavour to find an opportunity of urging my suit i would give up everything that i have my seat in parliament all the ambition of my life for the barest chance of success when she had accepted your son i desistedof course i have now heard from more sources than one that she or he or both of them have changed their minds if this be so i am free to try again the earl stood opposite to him scowling at him but said nothing good morning my lord  good morning sir  i am afraid it must be goodbye for some long days to come  good morning sir and the earl as he spoke rang the bell then phineas took up his hat and departed  as he walked away his mind filled itself gradually with various ideas all springing from the words which lord brentford had spoken what account had lord chiltern given to his father of the duel our hero was a man very sensitive as to the good opinion of others and in spite of his bold assertion of his own knowledge of what became a gentleman was beyond measure solicitous that others should acknowledge his claim at any rate to that title he thought that he had been generous to lord chiltern and as he went back in his memory over almost every word that had been spoken in the interview that had just passed he fancied that he was able to collect evidence that his antagonist at blankenberg had not spoken ill of him as to the charge of deceit which the earl had made against him he told himself that the earl had made it in anger he would not even think hardly of the earl who had been so good a friend to him but he believed in his heart that the earl had made the accusation out of his wrath and not out of his judgment he cannot think that i have been false to him phineas said to himself but it was very sad to him that he should have to quarrel with all the family of the standishes as he could not but feel that it was they who had put him on his feet it seemed as though he were never to see lady laura again except when they chanced to meet in companyon which occasions he simply bowed to her now the earl had almost turned him out of his house and though there had been to a certain extent a reconciliation between him and lord chiltern he in these days never saw the friend who had once put him upon bonebreaker and nownow that violet effingham was again freehow was it possible to avoid some renewal of enmity between them he would however endeavour to see lord chiltern at once  and then he thought of violetof violet again free of violet as again a possible wife for himself of violet to whom he might address himself at any rate without any scruple as to his own unworthiness everybody concerned and many who were not concerned at all were aware that he had been among her lovers and he thought that he could perceive that those who interested themselves on the subject had regarded him as the only horse in the race likely to run with success against lord chiltern she herself had received his offers without scorn and had always treated him as though he were a favoured friend though not favoured as a lover and now even lady baldock was smiling upon him and asking him to her house as though the redfaced porter in the hall in berkeley square had never been ordered to refuse him a moments admission inside the doors he had been very humble in speaking of his own hopes to the earl but surely there might be a chance what if after all the little strain which he had had in his back was to be cured after such a fashion as this when he got to his lodgings he found a card from lady baldock informing him that lady baldock would be at home on a certain night and that there would be music he could not go to lady baldocks on the night named as it would be necessary that he should be in the housenor did he much care to go there as violet effingham was not in town but he would call and explain and endeavour to curry favour in that way  he at once wrote a note to lord chiltern which he addressed to portman square as you are in town can we not meet come and dine with me at the  club on saturday that was the note after a few days he received the following answer dated from the bull at willingford why on earth should chiltern be staying at the bull at willingford in may      the old shop at w friday     dear phineas     i cant dine with you because i am down here looking    after the cripples and writing a sporting novel they    tell me i ought to do something so i am going to do that    i hope you dont think i turned informer against you in    telling the earl of our pleasant little meeting on the    sands it had become necessary and you are too much of a    man to care much for any truth being told he was terribly    angry both with me and with you but the fact is he is so    blindly unreasonable that one cannot regard his anger i    endeavoured to tell the story truly and so told it    certainly should not have injured you in his estimation    but it did very sorry old fellow and i hope youll get    over it it is a good deal more important to me than to    you     yours     c   there was not a word about violet but then it was hardly to be expected that there should be words about violet it was not likely that a man should write to his rival of his own failure but yet there was a flavour of violet in the letter which would not have been there so phineas thought if the writer had been despondent the pleasant little meeting on the sands had been convened altogether in respect of violet and the telling of the story to the earl must have arisen from discussions about violet lord chiltern must have told his father that phineas was his rival could the rejected suitor have written on such a subject in such a strain to such a correspondent if he had believed his own rejection to be certain but then lord chiltern was not like anybody else in the world and it was impossible to judge of him by ones experience of the motives of others  shortly afterwards phineas did call in berkeley square and was shown up at once into lady baldocks drawingroom the whole aspect of the porters countenance was changed towards him and from this too he gathered good auguries this had surprised him but his surprise was far greater when on entering the room he found violet effingham there alone a little fresh colour came to her face as she greeted him though it cannot be said that she blushed she behaved herself admirably not endeavouring to conceal some little emotion at thus meeting him but betraying none that was injurious to her composure i am so glad to see you mr finn she said my aunt has just left me and will be back directly  he was by no means her equal in his management of himself on the occasion but perhaps it may be acknowledged that his position was the more difficult of the two he had not seen her since her engagement had been proclaimed to the world and now he had heard from a source which was not to be doubted that it had been broken off of course there was nothing to be said on that matter he could not have congratulated her in the one case nor could he either congratulate her or condole with her on the other and yet he did not know how to speak to her as though no such events had occurred i did not know that you were in town he said  i only came yesterday i have been you know at rome with the effinghams and since that i have been but indeed i have been such a vagrant that i cannot tell you of all my comings and goings and youyou are hard at work  oh yesalways  that is right i wish i could be something if it were only a stick in waiting or a doorkeeper it is so good to be something was it some such teaching as this that had jarred against lord chilterns susceptibilities and had seemed to him to be a repetition of his fathers sermons  a man should try to be something said phineas  and a woman must be content to be nothingunless mr mill can pull us through and now tell mehave you seen lady laura  not lately  nor mr kennedy  i sometimes see him in the house the visit to the colonial office of which the reader has been made aware had not at that time as yet been made  i am sorry for all that she said upon which phineas smiled and shook his head i am very sorry that there should be a quarrel between you two  there is no quarrel  i used to think that you and he might do so much for each otherthat is of course if you could make a friend of him  he is a man of whom it is very hard to make a friend said phineas feeling that he was dishonest to mr kennedy in saying so but thinking that such dishonesty was justified by what he owed to lady laura  yeshe is hard and what i call ungenial we wont say anything about himwill we have you seen much of the earl this she asked as though such a question had no reference whatever to lord chiltern  oh dearalas alas  you have not quarrelled with him too  he has quarrelled with me he has heard miss effingham of what happened last year and he thinks that i was wrong  of course you were wrong mr finn  very likely to him i chose to defend myself but i certainly shall not do so to you at any rate you did not think it necessary to quarrel with me  i ought to have done so i wonder why my aunt does not come then she rang the bell  now i have told you all about myself said he you should tell me something of yourself  about me i am like the knifegrinder who had no story to tellnone at least to be told we have all no doubt got our little stories interesting enough to ourselves  but your story miss effingham he said is of such intense interest to me at that moment luckily lady baldock came into the room and phineas was saved from the necessity of making a declaration at a moment which would have been most inopportune  lady baldock was exceedingly gracious to him bidding violet use her influence to persuade him to come to the gathering persuade him to desert his work to come and hear some fiddlers said miss effingham indeed i shall not aunt who can tell but what the colonies might suffer from it through centuries and that such a lapse of duty might drive a province or two into the arms of our mortal enemies  herr moll is coming said lady baldock and so is signor scrubi and pjinskt who they say is the greatest man living on the flageolet have you ever heard pjinskt mr finn phineas never had heard pjinskt and as for herr moll there is nothing equal to him this year at least lady baldock had taken up music this season but all her enthusiasm was unable to shake the conscientious zeal of the young undersecretary of state at such a gathering he would have been unable to say a word in private to violet effingham     chapter lx  madame goeslers politics   it may be remembered that when lady glencora palliser was shown into madame goeslers room madame goesler had just explained somewhat forcibly to the duke of omnium her reasons for refusing the loan of his graces villa at como she had told the duke in so many words that she did not mean to give the world an opportunity of maligning her and it would then have been left to the duke to decide whether any other arrangements might have been made for taking madame goesler to como had he not been interrupted that he was very anxious to take her was certain the green brougham had already been often enough at the door in park lane to make his grace feel that madame goeslers company was very desirablewas perhaps of all things left for his enjoyment the one thing the most desirable lady glencora had spoken to her husband of children crying for the top brick of the chimney now it had come to this that in the eyes of the duke of omnium marie max goesler was the top brick of the chimney she had more wit for him than other womenmore of that sort of wit which he was capable of enjoying she had a beauty which he had learned to think more alluring than other beauty he was sick of fair faces and fat arms and free necks madame goeslers eyes sparkled as other eyes did not sparkle and there was something of the vagueness of mystery in the very blackness and gloss and abundance of her hairas though her beauty was the beauty of some world which he had not yet known and there was a quickness and yet a grace of motion about her which was quite new to him the ladies upon whom the duke had of late most often smiled had been somewhat slowperhaps almost heavythough no doubt graceful withal in his early youth he remembered to have seen somewhere in greece such a houri as was this madame goesler the houri in that case had run off with the captain of a russian vessel engaged in the tallow trade but not the less was there left on his graces mind some dreamy memory of charms which had impressed him very strongly when he was simply a young mr palliser and had had at his command not so convenient a mode of sudden abduction as the russian captains tallow ship pressed hard by such circumstances as these there is no knowing how the duke might have got out of his difficulties had not lady glencora appeared upon the scene  since the future little lord silverbridge had been born the duke had been very constant in his worship of lady glencora and as from year to year a little brother was added thus making the family very strong and stable his acts of worship had increased but with his worship there had come of late something almost of dreadsomething almost of obedience which had made those who were immediately about the duke declare that his grace was a good deal changed for hitherto whatever may have been the dukes weaknesses he certainly had known no master his heir plantagenet palliser had been always subject to him his other relations had been kept at such a distance as hardly to be more than recognised and though his grace no doubt had had his intimacies they who had been intimate with him had either never tried to obtain ascendancy or had failed lady glencora whether with or without a struggle had succeeded and people about the duke said that the duke was much changed mr fothergillwho was his graces man of business and who was not a favourite with lady glencorasaid that he was very much changed indeed finding his grace so much changed mr fothergill had made a little attempt at dictation himself but had receded with fingers very much scorched in the attempt it was indeed possible that the duke was becoming in the slightest degree weary of lady glencoras thraldom and that he thought that madame max goesler might be more tender with him madame max goesler however intended to be tender only on one condition  when lady glencora entered the room madame goesler received her beautifully how lucky that you should have come just when his grace is here she said  i saw my uncles carriage and of course i knew it said lady glencora  then the favour is to him said madame goesler smiling  no indeed i was coming if my word is to be doubted in that point i must insist on having the servant up i must certainly i told him to drive to this door as far back as grosvenor street did i not planty planty was the little lord silverbridge as was to be if nothing unfortunate intervened who was now sitting on his granduncles knee  dou said to the little house in park lane said the boy  yesbecause i forgot the number  and it is the smallest house in park lane so the evidence is complete said madame goesler lady glencora had not cared much for evidence to convince madame goesler but she had not wished her uncle to think that he was watched and hunted down it might be necessary that he should know that he was watched but things had not come to that as yet  how is plantagenet asked the duke  answer for papa said lady glencora to her child  papa is very well but he almost never comes home  he is working for his country said the duke your papa is a busy useful man and cant afford time to play with a little boy as i can  but papa is not a duke  he will be some day and that probably before long my boy he will be a duke quite as soon as he wants to be a duke he likes the house of commons better than the strawberry leaves i fancy there is not a man in england less in a hurry than he is  no indeed said lady glencora  how nice that is said madame goesler  and i aint in a hurry eitheram i mamma said the little future lord silverbridge  you are a wicked little monkey said his granduncle kissing him at this moment lady glencora was no doubt thinking how necessary it was that she should be careful to see that things did turn out in the manner proposedso that people who had waited should not be disappointed and the duke was perhaps thinking that he was not absolutely bound to his nephew by any law of god or man and madame max goesleri wonder whether her thoughts were injurious to the prospects of that handsome boldfaced little boy  lady glencora rose to take her leave first it was not for her to show any anxiety to force the duke out of the ladys presence if the duke were resolved to make a fool of himself nothing that she could do would prevent it but she thought that this little inspection might possibly be of service and that her uncles ardour would be cooled by the interruption to which he had been subjected so she went and immediately afterwards the duke followed her the interruption had at any rate saved him on that occasion from making the highest bid for the pleasure of madame goeslers company at como the duke went down with the little boy in his hand so that there was not an opportunity for a single word of interest between the gentleman and the lady  madame goesler when she was alone seated herself on her sofa tucking her feet up under her as though she were seated somewhere in the east pushed her ringlets back roughly from her face and then placed her two hands to her sides so that her thumbs rested lightly on her girdle when alone with something weighty on her mind she would sit in this form for the hour together resolving or trying to resolve what should be her conduct she did few things without much thinking and though she walked very boldly she walked warily she often told herself that such success as she had achieved could not have been achieved without much caution and yet she was ever discontented with herself telling herself that all that she had done was nothing or worse than nothing what was it all to have a duke and to have lords dining with her to dine with lords or with a duke itself if life were dull with her and the hours hung heavy life with her was dull and the hours did hang heavy and what if she caught this old man and became herself a duchesscaught him by means of his weakness to the inexpressible dismay of all those who were bound to him by ties of bloodwould that make her life happier or her hours less tedious that prospect of a life on the italian lakes with an old man tied to her side was not so charming in her eyes as it was in those of the duke were she to succeed and to be blazoned forth to the world as duchess of omnium what would she have gained  she perfectly understood the motive of lady glencoras visit and thought that she would at any rate gain something in the very triumph of baffling the manoeuvres of so clever a woman let lady glencora throw her √¶gis before the duke and it would be something to carry off his grace from beneath the protection of so thick a shield the very flavour of the contest was pleasing to madame goesler but the victory gained what then would remain to her money she had already position too she had of her own she was free as air and should it suit her at any time to go off to some lake of como in society that would personally be more agreeable to her than that of the duke of omnium there was nothing to hinder her for a moment and then came a smile over her facebut the saddest smileas she thought of one with whom it might be pleasant to look at the colour of italian skies and feel the softness of italian breezes in feigning to like to do this with an old man in acting the raptures of love on behalf of a wornout duke who at the best would scarce believe in her acting there would not be much delight for her she had never yet known what it was to have anything of the pleasure of love she had grown as she often told herself to be a hard cautious selfish successful woman without any interference or assistance from such pleasure might there not be yet time left for her to try it without selfishnesswith an absolute devotion of selfif only she could find the right companion there was one who might be such a companion but the duke of omnium certainly could not be such a one  but to be duchess of omnium after all success in this world is everythingis at any rate the only thing the pleasure of which will endure there was the name of many a woman written in a black list within madame goeslers breastwritten there because of scorn because of rejected overtures because of deep social injury and madame goesler told herself often that it would be a pleasure to her to use the list and to be revenged on those who had illused and scornfully treated her she did not readily forgive those who had injured her as duchess of omnium she thought that probably she might use that list with efficacy lady glencora had treated her well and she had no such feeling against lady glencora as duchess of omnium she would accept lady glencora as her dearest friend if lady glencora would admit it but if it should be necessary that there should be a little duel between them as to which of them should take the duke in hand the duel must of course be fought in a matter so important one woman would of course expect no false sentiment from another she and lady glencora would understand each otherand no doubt respect each other  i have said that she would sit there resolving or trying to resolve there is nothing in the world so difficult as that task of making up ones mind who is there that has not longed that the power and privilege of selection among alternatives should be taken away from him in some important crisis of his life and that his conduct should be arranged for him either this way or that by some divine power if it were possibleby some patriarchal power in the absence of divinityor by chance even if nothing better than chance could be found to do it but no one dares to cast the die and to go honestly by the hazard there must be the actual necessity of obeying the die before even the die can be of any use as it was when madame goesler had sat there for an hour till her legs were tired beneath her she had not resolved it must be as her impulse should direct her when the important moment came there was not a soul on earth to whom she could go for counsel and when she asked herself for counsel the counsel would not come  two days afterwards the duke called again he would come generally on a thursdayearly so that he might be there before other visitors and he had already quite learned that when he was there other visitors would probably be refused admittance how lady glencora had made her way in telling the servant that her uncle was there he had not understood that visit had been made on the thursday but now he came on the saturdayhaving i regret to say sent down some early fruit from his own hothousesor from covent gardenwith a little note on the previous day the grapes might have been pretty well but the note was injudicious there were three lines about the grapes as to which there was some special history the vine having been brought from the garden of some villa in which some illused queen had lived and died and then there was a postscript in one line to say that the duke would call on the following morning i do not think that he had meant to add this when he began his note but then children who want the top brick want it so badly and cry for it so perversely  of course madame goesler was at home but even then she had not made up her mind she had made up her mind only to thisthat he should be made to speak plainly and that she would take time for her reply not even with such a gem as the dukes coronet before her eyes would she jump at it where there was so much doubt there need at least be no impatience  you ran away the other day duke because you could not resist the charm of that little boy she said laughing  he is a dear little boybut it was not that he answered  then what was it your niece carried you off in a whirlwind she was come and gone taking you with her in half a minute  she had disturbed me when i was thinking of something said the duke  things shouldnt be thought ofnot so deeply as that madame goesler was playing with a bunch of his grapes now eating one or two from a small china plate which had stood upon the table and he thought that he had never seen a woman so graceful and yet so natural will you not eat your own grapes with me they are deliciousflavoured with the poor queens sorrows he shook his head knowing that it did not suit his gastric juices to have to deal with fruit eaten at odd times never think duke i am convinced that it does no good it simply means doubting and doubt always leads to error the safest way in the world is to do nothing  i believe so said the duke  much the safest but if you have not sufficient command over yourself to enable you to sit in repose always quiet never committing yourself to the chance of any dangerthen take a leap in the dark or rather many leaps a stumbling horse regains his footing by persevering in his onward course as for moving cautiously that i detest  and yet one must thinkfor instance whether one will succeed or not  take that for granted always remember i do not recommend motion at all repose is my idea of liferepose and grapes  the duke sat for a while silent taking his repose as far as the outer man was concerned looking at his top brick of the chimney as from time to time she ate one of his grapes probably she did not eat above halfadozen of them altogether but he thought that the grapes must have been made for the woman she was so pretty in the eating of them but it was necessary that he should speak at last have you been thinking of coming to como he said  i told you that i never think  but i want an answer to my proposition  i thought i had answered your grace on that question then she put down the grapes and moved herself on her chair so that she sat with her face turned away from him  but a request to a lady may be made twice  oh yes and i am grateful knowing how far it is from your intention to do me any harm and i am somewhat ashamed of my warmth on the other day but still there can be but one answer there are delights which a woman must deny herself let them be ever so delightful  i had thought the duke began and then he stopped himself  your grace was saying that you thought  marie a man at my age does not like to be denied  what man likes to be denied anything by a woman at any age a woman who denies anything is called cruel at onceeven though it be her very soul she had turned round upon him now and was leaning forward towards him from her chair so that he could touch her if he put out his hand  he put out his hand and touched her marie he said will you deny me if i ask  nay my lord how shall i say there is many a trifle i would deny you there is many a great gift i would give you willingly  but the greatest gift of all  my lord if you have anything to say you must say it plainly there never was a woman worse than i am at the reading of riddles  could you endure to live in the quietude of an italian lake with an old man now he touched her again and had taken her hand  no my lordnor with a young onefor all my days but i do not know that age would guide me  then the duke rose and made his proposition in form marie you know that i love you why it is that i at my age should feel so sore a love i cannot say  so sore a love  so sore if it be not gratified marie i ask you to be my wife  duke of omnium this from you  yes from me my coronet is at your feet if you will allow me to raise it i will place it on your brow  then she went away from him and seated herself at a distance after a moment or two he followed her and stood with his arm upon her shoulder you will give me an answer marie  you cannot have thought of this my lord  nay i have thought of it much  and your friends  my dear i may venture to please myself in thisas in everything will you not answer me  certainly not on the spur of the moment my lord think how high is the position you offer me and how immense is the change you propose to me allow me two days and i will answer you by letter i am so fluttered now that i must leave you then he came to her took her hand kissed her brow and opened the door for her     chapter lxi  another duel   it happened that there were at this time certain matters of business to be settled between the duke of omnium and his nephew mr palliser respecting which the latter called upon his uncle on the morning after the duke had committed himself by his offer mr palliser had come by appointment made with mr fothergill the dukes man of business and had expected to meet mr fothergill mr fothergill however was not with the duke and the uncle told the nephew that the business had been postponed then mr palliser asked some question as to the reason of such postponement not meaning much by his questionand the duke after a moments hesitation answered him meaning very much by his answer the truth is plantagenet that it is possible that i may marry and if so this arrangement would not suit me  are you going to be married asked the astonished nephew  it is not exactly thatbut it is possible that i may do so since i proposed this matter to fothergill i have been thinking over it and i have changed my mind it will make but little difference to you and after all you are a far richer man than i am  i am not thinking of money duke said plantagenet palliser  of what then were you thinking  simply of what you told me i do not in the least mean to interfere  i hope not plantagenet  but i could not hear such a statement from you without some surprise whatever you do i hope will tend to make you happy  so much passed between the uncle and the nephew and what the uncle told to the nephew the nephew of course told to his wife he was with her again yesterday said lady glencora for more than an hour and he had been half the morning dressing himself before he went to her  he is not engaged to her or he would have told me said plantagenet palliser  i think he would but there is no knowing at the present moment i have only one doubtwhether to act upon him or upon her  i do not see that you can do good by going to either  well we will see if she be the woman i take her to be i think i could do something with her i have never supposed her to be a bad womannever i will think of it then lady glencora left her husband and did not consult him afterwards as to the course she would pursue he had his budget to manage and his speeches to make the little affair of the duke and madame goesler she thought it best to take into her own hands without any assistance from him what a fool i was she said to herself to have her down there when the duke was at matching  madame goesler when she was left alone felt that now indeed she must make up her mind she had asked for two days the intervening day was a sunday and on the monday she must send her answer she might doubt at any rate for this one nightthe saturday nightand sit playing as it were with the coronet of a duchess in her lap she had been born the daughter of a small country attorney and now a duke had asked her to be his wifeand a duke who was acknowledged to stand above other dukes nothing at any rate could rob her of that satisfaction whatever resolution she might form at last she had by her own resources reached a point of success in remembering which there would always be a keen gratification it would be much to be duchess of omnium but it would be something also to have refused to be a duchess of omnium during that evening that night and the next morning she remained playing with the coronet in her lap she would not go to church what good could any sermon do her while that bauble was dangling before her eyes after churchtime about two oclock phineas finn came to her just at this period phineas would come to her oftensometimes full of a new decision to forget violet effingham altogether at others minded to continue his siege let the hope of success be ever so small he had now heard that violet and lord chiltern had in truth quarrelled and was of course anxious to be advised to continue the siege when he first came in and spoke a word or two in which there was no reference to violet effingham there came upon madame goesler a strong wish to decide at once that she would play no longer with the coronet that the gem was not worth the cost she would be called upon to pay for it there was something in the world better for her than the coronetif only it might be had but within ten minutes he had told her the whole tale about lord chiltern and how he had seen violet at lady baldocksand how there might yet be hope for him what would she advise him to do go home mr finn she said and write a sonnet to her eyebrow see if that will have any effect  ah well it is natural that you should laugh at me but somehow i did not expect it from you  do not be angry with me what i mean is that such little things seem to influence this violet of yours  do they i have not found that they do so  if she had loved lord chiltern she would not have quarrelled with him for a few words if she had loved you she would not have accepted lord chiltern if she loves neither of you she should say so i am losing my respect for her  do not say that madame goesler i respect her as strongly as i love her then madame goesler almost made up her mind that she would have the coronet there was a substance about the coronet that would not elude her grasp  late that afternoon while she was still hesitating there came another caller to the cottage in park lane she was still hesitating feeling that she had as yet another night before her should she be duchess of omnium or not all that she wished to be she could not bebut to be duchess of omnium was within her reach then she began to ask herself various questions would the queen refuse to accept her in her new rank refuse how could any queen refuse to accept her she had not done aught amiss in life there was no slur on her name no stain on her character what though her father had been a small attorney and her first husband a jew banker she had broken no law of god or man had been accused of breaking no law which breaking or which accusation need stand in the way of her being as good a duchess as any other woman she was sitting thinking of this almost angry with herself at the awe with which the proposed rank inspired her when lady glencora was announced to her  madame goesler said lady glencora i am very glad to find you  and i more than equally so to be found said madame goesler smiling with all her grace  my uncle has been with you since i saw you last  oh yesmore than once if i remember right he was here yesterday at any rate  he comes often to you then  not so often as i would wish lady glencora the duke is one of my dearest friends  it has been a quick friendship  yesa quick friendship said madame goesler then there was a pause for some moments which madame goesler was determined that she would not break it was clear to her now on what ground lady glencora had come to her and she was fully minded that if she could bear the full light of the god himself in all his glory she would not allow herself to be scorched by any reflected heat coming from the gods niece she thought she could endure anything that lady glencora might say but she would wait and hear what might be said  i think madame goesler that i had better hurry on to my subject at once said lady glencora almost hesitating as she spoke and feeling that the colour was rushing up to her cheeks and covering her brow of course what i have to say will be disagreeable of course i shall offend you and yet i do not mean it  i shall be offended at nothing lady glencora unless i think that you mean to offend me  i protest that i do not you have seen my little boy  yes indeed the sweetest child god never gave me anything half so precious as that  he is the dukes heir  so i understand  for myself by my honour as a woman i care nothing i am rich and have all that the world can give me for my husband in this matter i care nothing his career he will make for himself and it will depend on no title  why all this to me lady glencora what have i to do with your husbands titles  muchif it be true that there is an idea of marriage between you and the duke of omnium  psha said madame goesler with all the scorn of which she was mistress  it is untrue then asked lady glencora  noit is not untrue there is an idea of such a marriage  and you are engaged to him  noi am not engaged to him  has he asked you  lady glencora i really must say that such a crossquestioning from one lady to another is very unusual i have promised not to be offended unless i thought that you wished to offend me but do not drive me too far  madame goesler if you will tell me that i am mistaken i will beg your pardon and offer to you the most sincere friendship which one woman can give another  lady glencora i can tell you nothing of the kind  then it is to be so and have you thought what you would gain  i have thought much of what i should gainand something also of what i should lose  you have money  yes indeed plentyfor wants so moderate as mine  and position  well yes a sort of position not such as yours lady glencora that if it be not born to a woman can only come to her from a husband she cannot win it for herself  you are free as air going where you like and doing what you like  too free sometimes said madame goesler  and what will you gain by changing all this simply for a title  but for such a title lady glencora it may be little to you to be duchess of omnium but think what it must be to me  and for this you will not hesitate to rob him of all his friends to embitter his future life to degrade him among his peers  degrade him who dares say that i shall degrade him he will exalt me but i shall no whit degrade him you forget yourself lady glencora  ask any one it is not that i despise you if i did would i offer you my hand in friendship but an old man over seventy carrying the weight and burden of such rank as his will degrade himself in the eyes of his fellows if he marries a young woman without rank let her be ever so clever ever so beautiful a duke of omnium may not do as he pleases as may another man  it may be well lady glencora for other dukes and for the daughters and heirs and cousins of other dukes that his grace should try that question i will if you wish it argue this matter with you on many points but i will not allow you to say that i should degrade any man whom i might marry my name is as unstained as your own  i meant nothing of that said lady glencora  for himi certainly would not willingly injure him who wishes to injure a friend and in truth i have so little to gain that the temptation to do him an injury if i thought it one is not strong for your little boy lady glencora i think your fears are premature as she said this there came a smile over her face which threatened to break from control and almost become laughter but if you will allow me to say so my mind will not be turned against this marriage half so strongly by any arguments you can use as by those which i can adduce myself you have nearly driven me into it by telling me i should degrade his house it is almost incumbent on me to prove that you are wrong but you had better leave me to settle the matter in my own bosom you had indeed  after a while lady glencora did leave herto settle the matter within her own bosomhaving no other alternative     chapter lxii  the letter that was sent to brighton   monday morning came and madame goesler had as yet written no answer to the duke of omnium had not lady glencora gone to park lane on the sunday afternoon i think the letter would have been written on that day but whatever may have been the effect of lady glencoras visit it so far disturbed madame goesler as to keep her from her writingtable there was yet another night for thought and then the letter should be written on the monday morning  when lady glencora left madame goesler she went at once to the dukes house it was her custom to see her husbands uncle on a sunday and she would most frequently find him just at this hourbefore he went upstairs to dress for dinner she usually took her boy with her but on this occasion she went alone she had tried what she could do with madame goesler and she found that she had failed she must now make her attempt upon the duke but the duke perhaps anticipating some attack of the kind had fled where is his grace barker said lady glencora to the porter we do not know your ladyship his grace went away yesterday evening with nobody but lapoule lapoule was the dukes french valet lady glencora could only return home and consider in her own mind what batteries might yet be brought to bear upon the duke towards stopping the marriage even after the engagement should have been madeif it were to be made lady glencora felt that such batteries might still be brought up as would not improbably have an effect on a proud weak old man if all other resources failed royalty in some of its branches might be induced to make a request and every august relation in the peerage should interfere the duke no doubt might persevere and marry whom he pleasedif he were strong enough but it requires much personal strengththat standing alone against the wellarmed batteries of all ones friends lady glencora had once tried such a battle on her own behalf and had failed she had wished to be imprudent when she was young but her friends had been too strong for her she had been reduced and kept in order and made to run in a grooveand was now when she sat looking at her little boy with his bold face almost inclined to think that the world was right and that grooves were best but if she had been controlled when she was young so ought the duke to be controlled now that he was old it is all very well for a man or woman to boast that heor shemay do what he likes with his ownor with her own but there are circumstances in which such selfaction is ruinous to so many that coercion from the outside becomes absolutely needed nobody had felt the injustice of such coercion when applied to herself more sharply than had lady glencora but she had lived to acknowledge that such coercion might be proper and was now prepared to use it in any shape in which it might be made available it was all very well for madame goesler to laugh and exclaim psha when lady glencora declared her real trouble but should it ever come to pass that a blackbrowed baby with a yellow skin should be shown to the world as lord silverbridge lady glencora knew that her peace of mind would be gone for ever she had begun the world desiring one thing and had missed it she had suffered much and had then reconciled herself to other hopes if those other hopes were also to be cut away from her the world would not be worth a pinch of snuff to her the duke had fled and she could do nothing today but tomorrow she would begin with her batteries and she herself had done the mischief she had invited this woman down to matching heaven and earththat such a man as the duke should be such a foolthe widow of a jew banker he the duke of omniumand thus to cut away from himself for the rest of his life all honour all peace of mind all the grace of a noble end to a career which if not very noble in itself had received the praise of nobility and to do this for a thin blackbrowed yellowvisaged woman with ringlets and devils eyes and a beard on her upper lipa jewessa creature of whose habits of life and manners of thought they all were absolutely ignorant who drank possibly who might have been a forger for what any one knew an adventuress who had found her way into society by her art and perseveranceand who did not even pretend to have a relation in the world that such a one should have influence enough to intrude herself into the house of omnium and blot the scutcheon and what was worst of allperhaps be the mother of future dukes lady glencora in her anger was very unjust to madame goesler thinking all evil of her accusing her in her mind of every crime denying her all charm all beauty had the duke forgotten himself and his position for the sake of some fair girl with a pink complexion and grey eyes and smooth hair and a father lady glencora thought that she would have forgiven it better it might be that madame goesler would win her way to the coronet but when she came to put it on she should find that there were sharp thorns inside the lining of it not a woman worth the knowing in all london should speak to hernor a man either of those men with whom a duchess of omnium would wish to hold converse she should find her husband rated as a doting fool and herself rated as a scheming female adventuress and it should go hard with lady glencora if the duke were not separated from his new duchess before the end of the first year in her anger lady glencora was very unjust  the duke when he left his house without telling his household whither he was going did send his address tothe top brick of the chimney his note which was delivered at madame goeslers house late on the sunday evening was as followsi am to have your answer on monday i shall be at brighton send it by a private messenger to the bedford hotel there i need not tell you with what expectation with what hope with what fear i shall await ito poor old man he had run through all the pleasures of life too quickly and had not much left with which to amuse himself at length he had set his eyes on a top brick and being tired of everything else wanted it very sorely poor old man how should it do him any good even if he got it madame goesler when she received the note sat with it in her hand thinking of his great want and he would be tired of his new plaything after a month she said to herself but she had given herself to the next morning and she would not make up her mind that night she would sleep once more with the coronet of a duchess within her reach she did do so and woke in the morning with her mind absolutely in doubt when she walked down to breakfast all doubt was at an end the time had come when it was necessary that she should resolve and while her maid was brushing her hair for her she did make her resolution  what a thing it is to be a great lady said the maid who may probably have reflected that the duke of omnium did not come here so often for nothing  what do you mean by that lotta  the women i know madame talk so much of their countesses and ladyships and duchesses i would never rest till i had a title in this country if i were a ladyand rich and beautiful  and can the countesses and the ladyships and the duchesses do as they please  ah madamei know not that  but i know that will do lotta now leave me then madame goesler had made up her mind but i do not know whether that doubt as to having her own way had much to do with it as the wife of an old man she would probably have had much of her own way immediately after breakfast she wrote her answer to the duke which was as follows      park lane monday     my dear duke of omnium     i find so great a difficulty in expressing myself to your    grace in a written letter that since you left me i have    never ceased to wish that i had been less nervous less    doubting and less foolish when you were present with me    here in my room i might then have said in one word what    will take so many awkward words to explain     great as is the honour you propose to confer on me rich    as is the gift you offer me i cannot accept it i cannot    be your graces wife i may almost say that i knew it    was so when you parted from me but the surprise of the    situation took away from me a part of my judgment and    made me unable to answer you as i should have done my    lord the truth is that i am not fit to be the wife of    the duke of omnium i should injure you and though i    should raise myself in name i should injure myself in    character but you must not think because i say this    that there is any reason why i should not be an honest    mans wife there is none i have nothing on my conscience    which i could not tell youor to another man nothing    that i need fear to tell to all the world indeed my    lord there is nothing to tell but thisthat i am not    fitted by birth and position to be the wife of the duke of    omnium you would have to blush for me and that no man    shall ever have to do on my account     i will own that i have been ambitious too ambitious and    have been pleased to think that one so exalted as you are    one whose high position is so rife in the eyes of all men    should have taken pleasure in my company i will confess    to a foolish womans silly vanity in having wished to be    known to be the friend of the duke of omnium i am like    the other moths that flutter near the light and have their    wings burned but i am wiser than they in this that    having been scorched i know that i must keep my distance    you will easily believe that a woman such as i am does    not refuse to ride in a carriage with your graces arms on    the panels without a regret i am no philosopher i do not    pretend to despise the rich things of the world or the    high things according to my way of thinking a woman ought    to wish to be duchess of omniumbut she ought to wish    also to be able to carry her coronet with a proper grace    as madame goesler i can live even among my superiors at    my ease as your graces wife i should be easy no longer    nor would your grace     you will think perhaps that what i write is heartless    that i speak altogether of your rank and not at all of    the affection you have shown me or of that which i might    possibly bear towards you i think that when the first    flush of passion is over in early youth men and women    should strive to regulate their love as they do their    other desires by their reason i could love your grace    fondly as your wife if i thought it well for your grace    or for myself that we should be man and wife as i think    it would be ill for both of us i will restrain that    feeling and remember your grace ever with the purest    feeling of true friendship     before i close this letter i must utter a word of    gratitude in the kind of life which i have led as a    widow a life which has been very isolated as regards    true fellowship it has been my greatest effort to obtain    the good opinion of those among whom i have attempted to    make my way i may perhaps own to you now that i have    had many difficulties a woman who is alone in the world    is ever regarded with suspicion in this country a woman    with a foreign name with means derived from foreign    sources with a foreign history is specially suspected    i have striven to live that down and i have succeeded    but in my wildest dreams i never dreamed of such success    as thisthat the duke of omnium should think me the    worthiest of the worthy you may be sure that i am not    ungratefulthat i never will be ungrateful and i trust    it will not derogate from your opinion of my worth that    i have known what was due to your graces highness     i have the honour to be    my lord duke    your most obliged and faithful servant     marie max goesler   how many unmarried women in england are there would do the same she said to herself as she folded the paper and put it into an envelope and sealed the cover the moment that the letter was completed she sent it off as she was directed to send it so that there might be no possibility of repentance and subsequent hesitation she had at last made up her mind and she would stand by the making she knew that there would come moments in which she would deeply regret the opportunity that she had lostthe chance of greatness that she had flung away from her but so would she have often regretted it also had she accepted the greatness her position was one in which there must be regret let her decision have been what it might but she had decided and the thing was done she would still be freemarie max goeslerunless in abandoning her freedom she would obtain something that she might in truth prefer to it when the letter was gone she sat disconsolate at the window of an upstairs room in which she had written thinking much of the coronet much of the name much of the rank much of that position in society which she had flattered herself she might have won for herself as duchess of omnium by her beauty her grace and her wit it had not been simply her ambition to be a duchess without further aim or object she had fancied that she might have been such a duchess as there is never another so that her fame might have been great throughout europe as a woman charming at all points and she would have had friends thenreal friends and would not have lived alone as it was now her fate to do and she would have loved her ducal husband old though he was and stiff with pomp and ceremony she would have loved him and done her best to add something of brightness to his life it was indeed true that there was one whom she loved better but of what avail was it to love a man who when he came to her would speak to her of nothing but of the charms which he found in another woman  she had been sitting thus at her window with a book in her hand at which she never looked gazing over the park which was now beautiful with its may verdure when on a sudden a thought struck her lady glencora palliser had come to her trying to enlist her sympathy for the little heir behaving indeed not very well as madame goesler had thought but still with an earnest purpose which was in itself good she would write to lady glencora and put her out of her misery perhaps there was some feeling of triumph in her mind as she returned to the desk from which her epistle had been sent to the dukenot of that triumph which would have found its gratification in boasting of the offer that had been made to her but arising from a feeling that she could now show the proud mother of the boldfaced boy that though she would not pledge herself to any woman as to what she might do or not do she was nevertheless capable of resisting such a temptation as would have been irresistible to many of the dukes offer to her she would have spoken to no human being had not this woman shown that the dukes purpose was known at least to her and now in her letter she would write no plain word of that offer she would not state in words intelligible to any one who might read that the duke had offered her his hand and his coronet but she would write so that lady glencora should understand her and she would be careful that there should be no word in the letter to make lady glencora think that she supposed herself to be unfit for the rank offered to her she had been very humble in what she had written to the duke but she would not be at all humble in what she was about to write to the mother of the boldfaced boy and this was the letter when it was written      my dear lady glencora     i venture to send you a line to put you out of your    miseryfor you were very miserable when you were so good    as to come here yesterday your dear little boy is safe    from meand what is more to the purpose so are you and    your husbandand your uncle whom in truth i love you    asked me a downright question which i did not then choose    to answer by a downright answer the downright answer was    not at that time due to you it has since been given and    as i like you too well to wish you to be in torment i    send you a line to say that i shall never be in the way of    you or your boy     and now dear lady glencora one word more should it    ever again appear to you to be necessary to use your zeal    for the protection of your husband or your child do not    endeavour to dissuade a woman by trying to make her think    that she by her alliance would bring degradation into    any house or to any man if there could have been an    argument powerful with me to make me do that which you    wished to prevent it was the argument which you used but    my own comfort and the happiness of another person whom    i value almost as much as myself were too important to    be sacrificed even to a womans revenge i take mine by    writing to you and telling you that i am better and more    rational and wiser than you took me to be     if after this you choose to be on good terms with me i    shall be happy to be your friend i shall want no further    revenge you owe me some little apology but whether you    make it or not i will be contented and will never do    more than ask whether your darlings prospects are still    safe there are more women than one in the world you    know and you must not consider yourself to be out of the    wood because you have escaped from a single danger if    there arise another come to me and we will consult    together     dear lady glencora yours always sincerely     marie m g   there was a thing or two besides which she longed to say laughing as she thought of them but she refrained and her letter when finished was as it is given above  on the day following lady glencora was again in park lane when she first read madame goeslers letter she felt herself to be annoyed and angry but her anger was with herself rather than with her correspondent ever since her last interview with the woman whom she had feared she had been conscious of having been indiscreet all her feelings had been too violent and it might well have been that she should have driven this woman to do the very thing that she was so anxious to avoid you owe me some little apology madame goesler had said it was trueand she would apologise undue pride was not a part of lady glencoras character indeed there was not enough of pride in her composition she had been quite ready to hate this woman and to fight her on every point as long as the danger existed but she was equally willing to take the woman to her heart now that the danger was over apologise of course she would apologise and she would make a friend of the woman if the woman wished it but she would not have the woman and the duke at matching together again lest after all there might be a mistake she did not show madame goeslers letter to her husband or tell him anything of the relief she had received he had cared but little for the danger thinking more of his budget than of the danger and would be sufficiently at his ease if he heard no more rumours of his uncles marriage lady glencora went to park lane early on the tuesday morning but she did not take her boy with her she understood that madame goesler might perhaps indulge in a little gentle raillery at the childs expense and the mother felt that this might be borne the more easily if the child were not present  i have come to thank you for your letter madame goesler said lady glencora before she sat down  oh come ye in peace here or come ye in war or to dance at our bridal said madame goesler standing up from her chair and laughing as she sang the lines  certainly not to dance at your bridal said lady glencora  alas no you have forbidden the banns too effectually for that and i sit here wearing the willow all alone why shouldnt i be allowed to get married as well as another woman i wonder i think you have been very hard upon me among you but sit down lady glencora at any rate you come in peace  certainly in peace and with much admirationand a great deal of love and affection and all that kind of thing if you will only accept it  i shall be too proud lady glencorafor the dukes sake if for no other reason  and i have to make my apology  it was made as soon as your carriage stopped at my door with friendly wheels of course i understand i can know how terrible it all was to youeven though the dear little plantagenet might not have been in much danger fancy what it would be to disturb the career of a plantagenet i am far too well read in history i can assure you  i said a word for which i am sorry and which i should not have said  never mind the word after all it was a true word i do not hesitate to say so now myself though i will allow no other woman to say itand no man either i should have degraded himand disgraced him madame goesler now had dropped the bantering tone which she had assumed and was speaking in sober earnest i for myself have nothing about me of which i am ashamed i have no history to hide no story to be brought to light to my discredit but i have not been so born or so placed by circumstances as make me fit to be the wife of the duke of omnium i should not have been happy you know  you want nothing dear madame goesler you have all that society can give you  i do not know about that i have much given to me by society but there are many things that i wanta brightfaced little boy for instance to go about with me in my carriage why did you not bring him lady glencora  i came out in my penitential sheet and when one goes in that guise one goes alone i had half a mind to walk  you will bring him soon  oh yes he was very anxious to know the other day who was the beautiful lady with the black hair  you did not tell him that the beautiful lady with the black hair was a possible aunt was a possible but we will not think any more of things so horrible  i told him nothing of my fears you may be sure  some day when i am a very old woman and when his father is quite an old duke and when he has a dozen little boys and girls of his own you will tell him the story then he will reflect what a madman his greatuncle must have been to have thought of making a duchess out of such a wizened old woman as that  they parted the best of friends but lady glencora was still of opinion that if the lady and the duke were to be brought together at matching or elsewhere there might still be danger     chapter lxiii  showing how the duke stood his ground   mr low the barrister who had given so many lectures to our friend phineas finn lectures that ought to have been useful was now himself in the house of commons having reached it in the legitimate course of his profession at a certain point of his career supposing his career to have been sufficiently prosperous it becomes natural to a barrister to stand for some constituency and natural for him also to form his politics at that period of his life with a view to his further advancement looking as he does so carefully at the age and standing of the various candidates for high legal office when a man has worked as mr low had worked he begins to regard the bench wistfully and to calculate the profits of a two years run in the attorneygeneralship it is the way of the profession and thus a proper and sufficient number of real barristers finds its way into the house mr low had been angry with phineas because he being a barrister had climbed into it after another fashion having taken up politics not in the proper way as an assistance to his great profession but as a profession in itself mr low had been quite sure that his pupil had been wrong in this and that the error would at last show itself to his pupils cost and mrs low had been more sure than mr low having not unnaturally been jealous that a young whippersnapper of a pupilas she had once called phineasshould become a parliament man before her husband who had worked his way up gallantly in the usual course she would not give way a jot even nownot even when she heard that phineas was going to marry this and that heiress for at this period of his life such rumours were afloat about him originating probably in his hopes as to violet effingham and his intimacy with madame goesler oh heiresses said mrs low i dont believe in heiresses money till i see it three or four hundred a year is a great fortune for a woman but it dont go far in keeping a house in london and when a woman has got a little money she generally knows how to spend it he has begun at the wrong end and they who do that never get themselves right at the last  at this time phineas had become somewhat of a fine gentleman which made mrs low the more angry with him he showed himself willing enough to go to mrs lows house but when there he seemed to her to give himself airs i think that she was unjust to him and that it was natural that he should not bear himself beneath her remarks exactly as he had done when he was nobody he had certainly been very successful he was always listened to in the house and rarely spoke except on subjects which belonged to him or had been allotted to him as part of his business he lived quite at his ease with people of the highest rankand those of his own mode of life who disliked him did so simply because they regarded with envy his too rapid rise he rode upon a pretty horse in the park and was careful in his dress and had about him an air of comfortable wealth which mrs low thought he had not earned when her husband told her of his sufficient salary she would shake her head and express her opinion that a good time was coming by which she perhaps meant to imply a belief that a time was coming in which her husband would have a salary much better than that now enjoyed by phineas and much more likely to be permanent the radicals were not to have office for ever and when they were gone what then i dont suppose he saves a shilling said mrs low how can he keeping a horse in the park and hunting down in the country and living with lords i shouldnt wonder if he isnt found to be over head and ears in debt when things come to be looked into mrs low was fond of an assured prosperity of money in the funds and was proud to think that her husband lived in a house of his own ¬£19 10s groundrent to the portman estate is what we pay mr bunce she once said to that gallant radical and that comes of beginning at the right end mr low had nothing when he began the world and i had just what made us decent the day we married but he began at the right end and let things go as they may he cant get a fall mr bunce and mrs low though they differed much in politics sympathised in reference to phineas  i never believes maam in nobody doing any good by getting a place said mr bunce of course i dont mean judges and them like which must be but when a young man has ever so much a year for sitting in a big room down at whitehall and reading a newspaper with his feet up on a chair i dont think it honest whether hes a parliament man or whether he aint whence mr bunce had got his notions as to the way in which officials at whitehall pass their time i cannot say but his notions are very common notions the british world at large is slow to believe that the great british housekeeper keeps no more cats than what kill mice  mr low who was now frequently in the habit of seeing phineas at the house had somewhat changed his opinions and was not so eager in condemning phineas as was his wife he had begun to think that perhaps phineas had shown some knowledge of his own aptitudes in the career which he had sought and was aware at any rate that his late pupil was somebody in the house of commons a man will almost always respect him whom those around him respect and will generally look up to one who is evidently above himself in his own daily avocation now phineas was certainly above mr low in parliamentary reputation he sat on a front bench he knew the leaders of parties he was at home amidst the forms of the house he enjoyed something of the prestige of government power and he walked about familiarly with the sons of dukes and the brothers of earls in a manner which had its effect even on mr low seeing these things mr low could not maintain his old opinion as stoutly as did his wife it was almost a privilege to mr low to be intimate with phineas finn how then could he look down upon him  he was surprised therefore one day when phineas discussed the matter with him fully phineas had asked him what would be his chance of success if even now he were to give up politics and take to the bar as the means of earning his livelihood you would have uphill work at first as a matter of course said mr low  but it might be done i suppose to have been in office would not be fatal to me  no not fatal nothing of the kind need be fatal men have succeeded and have sat on the bench afterwards who did not begin till they were past forty you would have to live down a prejudice created against yourself that is all the attorneys do not like barristers who are anything else but barristers  the attorneys are very arbitrary i know said phineas  yesand there would be this against youthat it is so difficult for a man to go back to the verdure and malleability of pupildom who has once escaped from the necessary humility of its conditions you will find it difficult to sit and wait for business in a vicechancellors court after having had vicechancellors or men as big as vicechancellors to wait upon you  i do not think much of that  but others would think of it and you would find that there were difficulties but you are not thinking of it in earnest  yes in earnest  why so i should have thought that every day had removed you further and further from any such idea  the ground im on at present is so slippery  well yes i can understand that but yet it is less slippery than it used to be  ahyou do not exactly see what if i were to lose my seat  you are safe at least for the next four years i should say  ahno one can tell and suppose i took it into my head to differ from the government  you must not do that you have put yourself into a boat with these men and you must remain in the boat i should have thought all that was easy to you  it is not so easy as it seems the very necessity of sitting still in the boat is in itself irksomevery irksome and then there comes some crisis in which a man cannot sit still  is there any such crisis at hand now  i cannot say thatbut i am beginning to find that sitting still is very disagreeable to me when i hear those fellows below having their own way and saying just what they like it makes me furious there is robson he tried office for a couple of years and has broken away and now by george there is no man they think so much of as they do of robson he is twice the man he was when he sat on the treasury bench  he is a man of fortuneis he not  i suppose so of course he is because he lives he never earns anything his wife had money  my dear finn that makes all the difference when a man has means of his own he can please himself do you marry a wife with money and then you may kick up your heels and do as you like about the colonial office when a man hasnt money of course he must fit himself to the circumstances of a profession  though his profession may require him to be dishonest  i did not say that  but i say it my dear low a man who is ready to vote black white because somebody tells him is dishonest never mind old fellow i shall pull through i daresay dont go and tell your wife all this or shell be harder upon me than ever when she sees me after that mr low began to think that his wifes judgment in this matter had been better than his own  robson could do as he liked because he had married a woman with money phineas told himself that that game was also open to him he too might marry money violet effingham had moneyquite enough to make him independent were he married to her and madame goesler had moneyplenty of money and an idea had begun to creep upon him that madame goesler would take him were he to offer himself but he would sooner go back to the bar as the lowest pupil sooner clean boots for barristersso he told himselfthan marry a woman simply because she had money than marry any other woman as long as there was a chance that violet might be won but it was very desirable that he should know whether violet might be won or not it was now july and everybody would be gone in another month before august would be over he was to start for ireland with mr monk and he knew that words would be spoken in ireland which might make it indispensable for him to be at any rate able to throw up his office in these days he became more anxious than he used to be about miss effinghams fortune  he had never spoken as yet to lord brentford since the day on which the earl had quarrelled with him nor had he ever been at the house in portman square lady laura he met occasionally and had always spoken to her she was gracious to him but there had been no renewal of their intimacy rumours had reached him that things were going badly with her and her husband but when men repeated such rumours in his presence he said little or nothing on the subject it was not for him at any rate to speak of lady lauras unhappiness lord chiltern he had seen once or twice during the last month and they had met cordially as friends of course he could ask no question from lord chiltern as to violet but he did learn that his friend had again patched up some reconciliation with his father he has quarrelled with me you know said phineas  i am very sorry but what could i do as things went i was obliged to tell him  do not suppose for a moment that i am blaming you it is no doubt much better that he should know it all  and it cannot make much difference to you i should say  one doesnt like to quarrel with those who have been kind to one said phineas  but it isnt your doing hell come right again after a time when i can get my own affairs settled you may be sure ill do my best to bring him round but whats the reason you never see laura now  whats the reason that everything goes awry said phineas bitterly  when i mentioned your name to kennedy the other day he looked as black as thunder but it is not odd that any one should quarrel with him i cant stand him do you know i sometimes think that laura will have to give it up then there will be another mess in the family  this was all very well as coming from lord chiltern but there was no word about violet and phineas did not know how to get a word from any one lady laura could have told him everything but he could not go to lady laura he did go to lady baldocks house as often as he thought he could with propriety and occasionally he saw violet but he could do no more than see her and the days and weeks were passing by and the time was coming in which he would have to go away and be with her no more the end of the season which was always to other mento other working men such as our heroa period of pleasurable anticipation to him was a time of sadness in which he felt that he was not exactly like to or even equal to the men with whom he lived in london in the old days in which he was allowed to go to loughlinter or to saulsby when all men and women were going to their loughlinters and their saulsbys it was very well with him but there was something melancholy to him in his yearly journey to ireland he loved his father and mother and sisters as well as do other men but there was a falling off in the manner of his life which made him feel that he had been in some sort out of his own element in london he would have liked to have shot grouse at loughlinter or pheasants at saulsby or to have hunted down at willingfordor better still to have made love to violet effingham wherever violet effingham might have placed herself but all this was closed to him now and there would be nothing for him but to remain at killaloe or to return to his work in downing street from august to february mr monk indeed was going with him for a few weeks but even this association did not make up for that sort of society which he would have preferred  the session went on very quietly the question of the irish reform bill was postponed till the next year which was a great thing gained he carried his bill about the canada railway with sundry other small bills appertaining to it through the house in a manner which redounded infinitely to his credit there was just enough of opposition to give a zest to the work and to make the affair conspicuous among the affairs of the year as his chief was in the other house the work fell altogether into his hands so that he came to be conspicuous among undersecretaries it was only when he said a word to any leaders of his party about other mattersabout irish tenantright for instance which was beginning to loom very large that he found himself to be snubbed but there was no room for action this year in reference to irish tenantright and therefore any deep consideration of that discomfort might be legitimately postponed if he did by chance open his mouth on the subject to mr monk even mr monk discouraged him  in the early days of july when the weather was very hot and people were beginning to complain of the thames and members were becoming thirsty after grouse and the remaining days of parliamentary work were being counted up there came to him newsnews that was soon known throughout the fashionable worldthat the duke of omnium was going to give a garden party at a certain villa residence on the banks of the thames above richmond it was to be such a garden party as had never been seen before and it would be the more remarkable because the duke had never been known to do such a thing the villa was called the horns and had indeed been given by the duke to lady glencora on her marriage but the party was to be the dukes party and the horns with all its gardens conservatories lawns shrubberies paddocks boathouses and boats was to be made bright and beautiful for the occasion scores of workmen were about the place through the three first weeks of july the world at large did not at all know why the duke was doing so unwonted a thingwhy he should undertake so new a trouble but lady glencora knew and madame goesler shrewdly guessed the riddle when madame goeslers unexpected refusal had reached his grace he felt that he must either accept the ladys refusal or persevere after a days consideration he resolved that he would accept it the top brick of the chimney was very desirable but perhaps it might be well that he should endeavour to live without it then accepting this refusal he must either stand his ground and bear the blowor he must run away to that villa at como or elsewhere the running away seemed to him at first to be the better or at least the more pleasant course but at last he determined that he would stand his ground and bear the blow therefore he gave his garden party at the horns  who was to be invited before the first week in july was over many a bosom in london was fluttering with anxiety on that subject the duke in giving his short word of instruction to lady glencora made her understand that he would wish her to be particular in her invitations her royal highness the princess and his royal highness the prince had both been so gracious as to say that they would honour his f√™te the duke himself had made out a short list with not more than a dozen names lady glencora was employed to select the real crowdthe five hundred out of the ten thousand who were to be blessed on the dukes own private list was the name of madame goesler lady glencora understood it all when madame goesler got her card she thought that she understood it too and she thought also that the duke was behaving in a gallant way  there was no doubt much difficulty about the invitations and a considerable amount of illwill was created and they who considered themselves entitled to be asked and were not asked were full of wrath against their more fortunate friends instead of being angry with the duke or with lady glencora who had neglected them it was soon known that lady glencora was the real dispenser of the favours and i fancy that her ladyship was tired of her task before it was completed the party was to take place on wednesday the 27th of july and before the day had come men and women had become so hardy in the combat that personal applications were made with unflinching importunity and letters were written to lady glencora putting forward this claim and that claim with a piteous clamour no that is too bad lady glencora said to her particular friend mrs grey when a letter came from mrs bonteen stating all that her husband had ever done towards supporting mr palliser in parliamentand all that he ever would do she shant have it even though she could put plantagenet into a minority tomorrow  mrs bonteen did not get a card and when she heard that phineas finn had received one her wrath against phineas was very great he was an irish adventurer and she regretted deeply that mr bonteen had ever interested himself in bringing such an upstart forward in the world of politics but as mr bonteen never had done anything towards bringing phineas forward there was not much cause for regret on this head phineas however got his card and of course accepted the invitation  the grounds were opened at four there was to be an early dinner out in tents at five and after dinner men and women were to walk about or dance or make loveor hay as suited them the haycocks however were ready prepared while it was expected that they should bring the love with them phineas knowing that he should meet violet effingham took a great deal with him ready made  for an hour and a half lady glencora kept her position in a saloon through which the guests passed to the grounds and to every comer she imparted the information that the duke was on the lawnto every comer but one to madame goesler she said no such word so glad to see you my dear she said as she pressed her friends hand if i am not killed by this work ill make you out again byandby then madame goesler passed on and soon found herself amidst a throng of acquaintance after a few minutes she saw the duke seated in an armchair close to the riverbank and she bravely went up to him and thanked him for the invitation the thanks are due to you for gracing our entertainment said the duke rising to greet her there were a dozen people standing round and so the thing was done without difficulty at that moment there came a notice that their royal highnesses were on the ground and the duke of course went off to meet them there was not a word more spoken between the duke and madame goesler on that afternoon  phineas did not come till latetill seven when the banquet was over i think he was right in this as the banqueting in tents loses in comfort almost more than it gains in romance a small picnic may be very well and the distance previously travelled may give to a dinner on the ground the seeming excuse of necessity frail human nature must be supportedand human nature having gone so far in pursuit of the beautiful is entitled to what best support the unaccustomed circumstances will allow therefore out with the cold pies out with the salads and the chickens and the champagne since no better may be let us recruit human nature sitting upon this moss and forget our discomforts in the glory of the verdure around us and dear mary seeing that the cushion from the waggonet is small and not wishing to accept the too generous offer that she should take it all for her own use will admit a contact somewhat closer than the ordinary chairs of a diningroom render necessary that in its way is very wellbut i hold that a banquet on narrow tables in a tent is displeasing  phineas strolled into the grounds when the tent was nearly empty and when lady glencora almost sinking beneath her exertions was taking rest in an inner room the duke at this time was dining with their royal highnesses and three or four others specially selected very comfortably within doors out of doors the world had begun to danceand the world was beginning to say that it would be much nicer to go and dance upon the boards inside as soon as possible for though of all parties a garden party is the nicest everybody is always anxious to get out of the garden as quick as may be a few ardent lovers of suburban picturesque effect were sitting beneath the haycocks and four forlorn damsels were vainly endeavouring to excite the sympathy of manly youth by playing croquet in a corner i am not sure however that the lovers beneath the haycocks and the players at croquet were not actors hired by lady glencora for the occasion  phineas had not been long on the lawn before he saw lady laura kennedy she was standing with another lady and barrington erle was with them so you have been successful said barrington greeting him  successful in what  in what in getting a ticket i have had to promise three tidewaiterships and to give deep hints about a bishopric expected to be vacant before i got in but what matters success pays for everything my only trouble now is how im to get back to london  lady laura shook hands with phineas and then as he was passing on followed him for a step and whispered a word to him mr finn she said if you are not going yet come back to me presently i have something to say to you i shall not be far from the river and shall stay here for about an hour  phineas said that he would and then went on not knowing exactly where he was going he had one desireto find violet effingham but when he should find her he could not carry her off and sit with her beneath a haycock     chapter lxiv  the horns   while looking for violet effingham phineas encountered madame goesler among a crowd of people who were watching the adventurous embarkation of certain daring spirits in a pleasureboat there were watermen there in the dukes livery ready to take such spirits down to richmond or up to teddington lock and many daring spirits did take such tripsto the great peril of muslins ribbons and starch to the peril also of ornamental summer white garments so that when the thing was over the boats were voted to have been a bore  are you going to venture said phineas to the lady  i should like it of all things if i were not afraid for my clothes will you come  i was never good upon the water i should be seasick to a certainty they are going down beneath the bridge too and we should be splashed by the steamers i dont think my courage is high enough thus phineas excused himself being still intent on prosecuting his search for violet  then neither will i said madame goesler one dash from a peccant oar would destroy the whole symmetry of my dress look that green young lady has already been sprinkled  but the blue young gentleman has been sprinkled also said phineas and they will be happy in a joint baptism then they strolled along the river path together and were soon alone you will be leaving town soon madame goesler  almost immediately  and where do you go  ohto vienna i am there for a couple of months every year minding my business i wonder whether you would know me if you saw mesometimes sitting on a stool in a countinghouse sometimes going about among old houses settling what must be done to save them from tumbling down i dress so differently at such times and talk so differently and look so much older that i almost fancy myself to be another person  is it a great trouble to you  noi rather like it it makes me feel that i do something in the world  do you go alone  quite alone i take a german maid with me and never speak a word to any one else on the journey  that must be very bad said phineas  yes it is the worst of it but then i am so much accustomed to be alone you see me in society and in society only and therefore naturally look upon me as one of a gregarious herd but i am in truth an animal that feeds alone and lives alone take the hours of the year all through and i am a solitary during fourfifths of them and what do you intend to do  i go to ireland  home to your own people how nice i have no people to go to i have one sister who lives with her husband at riga she is my only relation and i never see her  but you have thousands of friends in england  yesas you see themand she turned and spread out her hands towards the crowded lawn which was behind them what are such friends worth what would they do for me  i do not know that the duke would do much said phineas laughing  madame goesler laughed also the duke is not so bad she said the duke would do as much as any one else i wont have the duke abused  he may be your particular friend for what i know said phineas  ahno i have no particular friend and were i to wish to choose one i should think the duke a little above me  oh yesand too stiff and too old and too pompous and too cold and too makebelieve and too gingerbread  mr finn  the duke is all buckram you know  then why do you come to his house  to see you madame goesler  is that true mr finn  yesit is true in its way one goes about to meet those whom one likes not always for the pleasure of the hosts society i hope i am not wrong because i go to houses at which i like neither the host nor the hostess phineas as he said this was thinking of lady baldock to whom of late he had been exceedingly civilbut he certainly did not like lady baldock  i think you have been too hard upon the duke of omnium do you know him well  personally certainly not do you does anybody  i think he is a gracious gentleman said madame goesler and though i cannot boast of knowing him well i do not like to hear him called buckram i do not think he is buckram it is not very easy for a man in his position to live so as to please all people he has to maintain the prestige of the highest aristocracy in europe  look at his nephew who will be the next duke and who works as hard as any man in the country will he not maintain it better what good did the present man ever do  you believe only in motion mr finnand not at all in quiescence an express train at full speed is grander to you than a mountain with heaps of snow i own that to me there is something glorious in the dignity of a man too high to do anythingif only he knows how to carry that dignity with a proper grace i think that there should be breasts made to carry stars  stars which they have never earned said phineas  ahwell we will not fight about it go and earn your star and i will say that it becomes you better than any glitter on the coat of the duke of omnium this she said with an earnestness which he could not pretend not to notice or not to understand i too may be able to see that the express train is really greater than the mountain  though for your own life you would prefer to sit and gaze upon the snowy peaks  nothat is not so for myself i would prefer to be of use somewhereto some one if it were possible i strive sometimes  and i am sure successfully  never mind i hate to talk about myself you and the duke are fair subjects for conversation you as the express train who will probably do your sixty miles an hour in safety but may possibly go down a bank with a crash  certainly i may said phineas  and the duke as the mountain which is fixed in its stateliness short of the power of some earthquake which shall be grander and more terrible than any earthquake yet known here we are at the house again i will go in and sit down for a while  if i leave you madame goesler i will say goodbye till next winter  i shall be in town again before christmas you know you will come and see me  of course i will  and then this love trouble of course will be overone way or the otherwill it not  ahwho can say  faint heart never won fair lady but your heart is never faint farewell  then he left her up to this moment he had not seen violet and yet he knew that she was to be there she had herself told him that she was to accompany lady laura whom he had already met lady baldock had not been invited and had expressed great animosity against the duke in consequence she had gone so far as to say that the duke was a man at whose house a young lady such as her niece ought not to be seen but violet had laughed at this and declared her intention of accepting the invitation go she had said of course i shall go i should have broken my heart if i could not have got there phineas therefore was sure that she must be in the place he had kept his eyes ever on the alert and yet he had not found her and now he must keep his appointment with lady laura kennedy so he went down to the path by the river and there he found her seated close by the waters edge her cousin barrington erle was still with her but as soon as phineas joined them erle went away i had told him said lady laura that i wished to speak to you and he stayed with me till you came there are worse men than barrington a great deal  i am sure of that  are you and he still friends mr finn  i hope so i do not see so much of him as i did when i had less to do  he says that you have got into altogether a different set  i dont know that i have gone as circumstances have directed me but i have certainly not intended to throw over so old and good a friend as barrington erle  ohhe does not blame you he tells me that you have found your way among what he calls the working men of the party and he thinks you will do very wellif you can only be patient enough we all expected a different line from you you knowmore of words and less of deeds if i may say somore of liberal oratory and less of government action but i do not doubt that you are right  i think that i have been wrong said phineas i am becoming heartily sick of officialities  that comes from the fickleness about which papa is so fond of quoting his latin the ox desires the saddle the charger wants to plough  and which am i  your career may combine the dignity of the one with the utility of the other at any rate you must not think of changing now have you seen mr kennedy lately she asked the question abruptly showing that she was anxious to get to the matter respecting which she had summoned him to her side and that all that she had said hitherto had been uttered as it were in preparation of that subject  seen him yes i see him daily but we hardly do more than speak  why not phineas stood for a moment in silence hesitating why is it that he and you do not speak  how can i answer that question lady laura  do you know any reason sit down or if you please i will get up and walk with you he tells me that you have chosen to quarrel with him and that i have made you do so he says that you have confessed to him that i have asked you to quarrel with him  he can hardly have said that  but he has said itin so many words do you think that i would tell you such a story falsely  is he here now  nohe is not here he would not come i came alone  is not miss effingham with you  noshe is to come with my father later she is here no doubt now but answer my question mr finnunless you find that you cannot answer it what was it that you did say to my husband  nothing to justify what he has told you  do you mean to say that he has spoken falsely  i mean to use no harsh wordbut i think that mr kennedy when troubled in his spirit looks at things gloomily and puts meaning upon words which they should not bear  and what has troubled his spirit  you must know that better than i can do lady laura i will tell you all that i can tell you he invited me to his house and i would not go because you had forbidden me then he asked me some questions about you did i refuse because of youor of anything that you had said if i remember right i told him that i did fancy that you would not be glad to see meand that therefore i would rather stay away what was i to say  you should have said nothing  nothing with him would have been worse than what i did say remember that he asked me the question pointblank and that no reply would have been equal to an affirmation i should have confessed that his suggestion was true  he could not then have twitted me with your words  if i have erred lady laura and brought any sorrow on you i am indeed grieved  it is all sorrow there is nothing but sorrow i have made up my mind to leave him  oh lady laura  it is very badbut not so bad i think as the life i am now leading he has accused me of what do you think he says that you are my lover  he did not say thatin those words  he said it in words which made me feel that i must part from him  and how did you answer him  i would not answer him at all if he had come to me like a mannot accusing me but asking mei would have told him everything and what was there to tell i should have broken my faith to you in speaking of that scene at loughlinter but women always tell such stories to their husbands when their husbands are good to them and true and just and it is well that they should be told but to mr kennedy i can tell nothing he does not believe my word  not believe you lady laura  no because i did not blurt out to him all that story about your foolish duelbecause i thought it best to keep my brothers secret as long as there was a secret to be kept he told me that i hadlied to him  whatwith that word  yeswith that very word he is not particular about his words when he thinks it necessary to express himself strongly and he has told me since that because of that he could never believe me again how is it possible that a woman should live with such a man but why did she come to him with this storyto him whom she had been accused of entertaining as a loverto him who of all her friends was the last whom she should have chosen as the recipient for such a tale phineas as he thought how he might best answer her with what words he might try to comfort her could not but ask himself this question the moment that the word was out of his mouth she went on to say i resolved that i would tell you the accusation is against you as it is against me and is equally false to both i have written to him and there is my letter  but you will see him again  noi will go to my fathers house i have already arranged it mr kennedy has my letter by this time and i go from hence home with my father  do you wish that i should read the letter  yescertainly i wish that you should read it should i ever meet him again i shall tell him that you saw it  they were now standing close upon the rivers bank at a corner of the grounds and though the voices of people sounded near to them they were alone phineas had no alternative but to read the letter which was as follows      after what you have said to me it is impossible that i    should return to your house i shall meet my father at the    duke of omniums and have already asked him to give me an    asylum it is my wish to remain wherever he may be either    in town or in the country should i change my purpose in    this and change my residence i will not fail to let you    know where i go and what i propose to do you i think must    have forgotten that i was your wife but i will never    forget it     you have accused me of having a lover you cannot have    expected that i should continue to live with you after    such an accusation for myself i cannot understand how    any man can have brought himself to bring such a charge    against his wife even had it been true the accusation    should not have been made by your mouth to my ears     that it is untrue i believe you must be as well aware as    i am myself how intimate i was with mr finn and what    were the limits of my intimacy with him you knew before    i married you after our marriage i encouraged his    friendship till i found that there was something in    it that displeased youand after learning that i    discouraged it you have said that he is my lover but    you have probably not defined for yourself that word very    clearly you have felt yourself slighted because his name    has been mentioned with praiseand your jealousy has    been wounded because you have thought that i have regarded    him as in some way superior to yourself you have never    really thought that he was my loverthat he spoke words    to me which others might not hear that he claimed from    me aught that a wife may not give that he received aught    which a friend should not receive the accusation has been    a cowards accusation     i shall be at my fathers tonight and tomorrow i will    get you to let my servant bring to me such things as are    my ownmy clothes namely and desk and a few books    she will know what i want i trust you may be happier    without a wife than ever you have been with me i have    felt almost daily since we were married that you were a    man who would have been happier without a wife than with    one     yours affectionately     laura kennedy   it is at any rate true she said when phineas had read the letter  true doubtless it is true said phineas except that i do not suppose he was ever really angry with me or jealous or anything of the sortbecause i got on well it seems absurd even to think it  there is nothing too absurd for some men i remember your telling me that he was weak and poor and unworthy i remember your saying so when i first thought that he might become my husband i wish i had believed you when you told me so i should not have made such a shipwreck of myself as i have done that is all i had to say to you after what has passed between us i did not choose that you should hear how i was separated from my husband from any lips but my own i will go now and find papa do not come with me i prefer being alone then he was left standing by himself looking down upon the river as it glided by how would it have been with both of them if lady laura had accepted him three years ago when she consented to join her lot with that of mr kennedy and had rejected him as he stood he heard the sound of music from the house and remembered that he had come there with the one sole object of seeing violet effingham he had known that he would meet lady laura and it had been in his mind to break through that law of silence which she had imposed upon him and once more to ask her to assist himto implore her for the sake of their old friendship to tell him whether there might yet be for him any chance of success but in the interview which had just taken place it had been impossible for him to speak a word of himself or of violet to her in her great desolation he could address himself on no other subject than that of her own misery but not the less when she was talking to him of her own sorrow of her regret that she had not listened to him when in years past he had spoken slightingly of mr kennedy was he thinking of violet effingham mr kennedy had certainly mistaken the signs of things when he had accused his wife by saying that phineas was her lover phineas had soon got over that early feeling and as far as he himself was concerned had never regretted lady lauras marriage  he remained down by the water for a few minutes giving lady laura time to escape and then he wandered across the grounds towards the house it was now about nine oclock and though there were still many walking about the grounds the crowd of people were in the rooms the musicians were ranged out on a verandah so that their music might have been available for dancing within or without but the dancers had found the boards pleasanter than the lawn and the dukes garden party was becoming a mere ball with privilege for the dancers to stroll about the lawn between the dances and in this respect the fun was better than at a ballthat let the engagements made for partners be what they might they could always be broken with ease no lady felt herself bound to dance with a cavalier who was displeasing to her and some gentlemen were left sadly in the lurch phineas felt himself to be very much in the lurch even after he had discovered violet effingham standing up to dance with lord fawn  he bided his time patiently and at last he found his opportunity would she dance with him she declared that she intended to dance no more and that she had promised to be ready to return home with lord brentford before ten oclock i have pledged myself not to be after ten she said laughing then she put her hand upon his arm and they stepped out upon the terrace together have you heard anything she asked him almost in a whisper  yes he said i have heard what you mean i have heard it all  is it not dreadful  i fear it is the best thing she can do she has never been happy with him  but to be accused after that fashionby her husband said violet one can hardly believe it in these days and of all women she is the last to deserve such accusation  the very last said phineas feeling that the subject was one upon which it was not easy for him to speak  i cannot conceive to whom he can have alluded said violet then phineas began to understand that violet had not heard the whole story but the difficulty of speaking was still very great  it has been the result of ungovernable temper he said  but a man does not usually strive to dishonour himself because he is in a rage and this man is incapable of rage he must be cursed with one of those dark gloomy minds in which love always leads to jealousy she will never return to him  one cannot say in many respects it would be better that she should said phineas  she will never return to him repeated violetnever would you advise her to do so  how can i say if one were called upon for advice one would think so much before one spoke  i would notnot for a minute what to be accused of that how are a man and woman to live together after there have been such words between them poor laura what a terrible end to all her high hopes do you not grieve for her  they were now at some distance from the house and phineas could not but feel that chance had been very good to him in giving him his opportunity she was leaning on his arm and they were alone and she was speaking to him with all the familiarity of old friendship i wonder whether i may change the subject said he and ask you a word about yourself  what word she said sharply  i have heard  what have you heard  simply thisthat you are not now as you were six months ago your marriage was then fixed for june  it has been unfixed since then she said  yesit has been unfixed i know it miss effingham you will not be angry with me if i say that when i heard it was so something of a hopeno i must not call it a hopesomething that longed to form itself into hope returned to my breast and from that hour to this has been the only subject on which i have cared to think  lord chiltern is your friend mr finn  he is so and i do not think that i have ever been untrue to my friendship for him  he says that no man has ever had a truer friend he will swear to that in all companies and i when it was allowed to me to swear with him swore it too as his friend let me tell you one thingone thing which i would never tell to any other manone thing which i know i may tell you in confidence you are a gentleman and will not break my confidence  i think i will not  i know you will not because you are a gentleman i told lord chiltern in the autumn of last year that i loved him and i did love him i shall never have the same confession to make to another man that he and i are not nowon those loving termswhich once existed can make no difference in that a woman cannot transfer her heart there have been things which have made me feelthat i was perhaps mistakenin saying that i would behis wife but i said so and cannot now give myself to another here is lord brentford and we will join him there was lord brentford with lady laura on his arm very gloomyresolving on what way he might be avenged on the man who had insulted his daughter he took but little notice of phineas as he resumed his charge of miss effingham but the two ladies wished him good night  good night lady laura said phineas standing with his hat in his handgood night miss effingham then he was alonequite alone would it not be well for him to go down to the bottom of the garden and fling himself into the quiet river so that there might be an end of him or would it not be better still that he should create for himself some quiet river of life away from london away from politics away from lords and titled ladies and fashionable squares and the parties given by dukes and the disappointments incident to a small man in attempting to make for himself a career among big men there had frequently been in the mind of this young man an idea that there was something almost false in his own positionthat his life was a pretence and that he would ultimately be subject to that ruin which always comes sooner or later on things which are false and now as he wandered alone about lady glencoras gardens this feeling was very strong within his bosom and robbed him altogether of the honour and glory of having been one of the duke of omniums guests     chapter lxv  the cabinet minister at killaloe   phineas did not throw himself into the river from the dukes garden and was ready in spite of violet effingham to start for ireland with mr monk at the end of the first week in august the close of that season in london certainly was not a happy period of his life violet had spoken to him after such a fashion that he could not bring himself not to believe her she had given him no hint whether it was likely or unlikely that she and lord chiltern would be reconciled but she had convinced him that he could not be allowed to take lord chilterns place a woman cannot transfer her heart she had said phineas was well aware that many women do transfer their hearts but he had gone to this woman too soon after the wrench which her love had received he had been too sudden with his proposal for a transfer and the punishment for such ill judgment must be that success would now be impossible to him and yet how could he have waited feeling that miss effingham if she were at all like other girls whom he had known might have promised herself to some other lover before she would return within his reach in the succeeding spring but she was not like some other girls ahhe knew that now and repented him of his haste  but he was ready for mr monk on the 7th of august and they started together something less than twenty hours took them from london to killaloe and during four or five of those twenty hours mr monk was unfitted for any conversation by the uncomfortable feelings incidental to the passage from holyhead to kingstown nevertheless there was a great deal of conversation between them during the journey mr monk had almost made up his mind to leave the cabinet it is sad to me to have to confess it he said but the truth is that my old rival turnbull is right a man who begins his political life as i began mine is not the man of whom a minister should be formed i am inclined to think that ministers of government require almost as much education in their trade as shoemakers or tallowchandlers i doubt whether you can make a good public servant of a man simply because he has got the ear of the house of commons  then you mean to say said phineas that we are altogether wrong from beginning to end in our way of arranging these things  i do not say that at all look at the men who have been leading statesmen since our present mode of government was formedfrom the days in which it was forming itself say from walpole down and you will find that all who have been of real use had early training as public servants  are we never to get out of the old groove  not if the groove is good said mr monk those who have been efficient as ministers sucked in their efficacy with their mothers milk lord brock did so and lord de terrier and mr mildmay they seated themselves in office chairs the moment they left college mr gresham was in office before he was eightandtwenty the duke of st bungay was at work as a private secretary when he was threeandtwenty you luckily for yourself have done the same  and regret it every hour of my life  you have no cause for regret but it is not so with me if there be any man unfitted by his previous career for office it is he who has become or who has endeavoured to become a popular politicianan exponent if i may say so of public opinion as far as i can see office is offered to such men with one view onlythat of clipping their wings  and of obtaining their help  it is the same thing help from turnbull would mean the withdrawal of all power of opposition from him he could not give other help for any long term as the very fact of his accepting power and patronage would take from him his popular leadership the masses outside require to have their minister as the queen has hers but the same man cannot be minister to both if the peoples minister chooses to change his master and to take the queens shilling something of temporary relief may be gained by government in the fact that the other place will for a time be vacant but there are candidates enough for such places and the vacancy is not a vacancy long of course the crown has this pull that it pays wages and the people do not  i do not think that that influenced you said phineas  it did not influence me to you i will make bold to state so much positively though it would be foolish perhaps to do so to others i did not go for the shilling though i am so poor a man that the shilling is more to me than it would be to almost any man in the house i took the shilling much doubting but guided in part by this that i was ashamed of being afraid to take it they told memr mildmay and the dukethat i could earn it to the benefit of the country i have not earned it and the country has not been benefitedunless it be for the good of the country that my voice in the house should be silenced if i believe that i ought to hold my tongue without taking a salary for holding it i have made a mistake my friend such mistakes made at my time of life cannot be wholly rectified but being convinced of my error i must do the best in my power to put myself right again  there was a bitterness in all this to phineas himself of which he could not but make plaint to his companion the truth is he said that a man in office must be a slave and that slavery is distasteful  there i think you are wrong if you mean that you cannot do joint work with other men altogether after your own fashion the same may be said of all work if you had stuck to the bar you must have pleaded your causes in conformity with instructions from the attorneys  i should have been guided by my own lights in advising those attorneys  i cannot see that you suffer anything that ought to go against the grain with you you are beginning young and it is your first adopted career with me it is otherwise if by my telling you this i shall have led you astray i shall regret my openness with you could i begin again i would willingly begin as you began  it was a great day in killaloe that on which mr monk arrived with phineas at the doctors house in london perhaps a bishop inspires more awe than a cabinet minister in killaloe where a bishop might be seen walking about every day the mitred dignitary of the church though much loved was thought of i fear but lightly whereas a cabinet minister coming to stay in the house of a townsman was a thing to be wondered at to be talked about to be afraid of to be a fruitful source of conversation for a year to come there were many in killaloe especially among the elder ladies who had shaken their heads and expressed the saddest doubts when young phineas finn had first become a parliament man and though by degrees they had been half brought round having been driven to acknowledge that he had been wonderfully successful as a parliament man still they had continued to shake their heads among themselves and to fear something in the futureuntil he appeared at his old home leading a cabinet minister by the hand there was such assurance in this that even old mrs callaghan at the brewery gave way and began to say all manner of good things and to praise the doctors luck in that he had a son gifted with parts so excellent there was a great desire to see the cabinet minister in the flesh to be with him when he ate and drank to watch the gait and countenance of the man and to drink water from this fountain of state lore which had been so wonderfully brought among them by their young townsman mrs finn was aware that it behoved her to be chary of her invitations but the lady from the brewery had said such good things of mrs finns black swan that she carried her point and was invited to meet the cabinet minister at dinner on the day after his arrival  mrs flood jones and her daughter were invited also to be of the party when phineas had been last at killaloe mrs flood jones as the reader may remember had remained with her daughter at floodboroughfeeling it to be her duty to keep her daughter away from the danger of an unrequited attachment but it seemed that her purpose was changed now or that she no longer feared the dangerfor both mary and her mother were now again living in killaloe and mary was at the doctors house as much as ever  a day or two before the coming of the god and the demigod to the little town barbara finn and her friend had thus come to understand each other as they walked along the shannon side i am sure my dear that he is engaged to nobody said barbara finn  and i am sure my dear said mary that i do not care whether he is or is not  what do you mean mary  i mean what i say why should i care five years ago i had a foolish dream and now i am awake again think how old i have got to be  yesyou are twentythree what has that to do with it  it has this to do with itthat i am old enough to know better mamma and i quite understand each other she used to be angry with him but she has got over all that foolishness now it always made me so vexedthe idea of being angry with a man becausebecause you know one cant talk about it it is so foolish but that is all over now  do you mean to say you dont care for him mary do you remember what you used to swear to me less than two years ago  i remember it all very well and i remember what a goose i was as for caring for him of course i dobecause he is your brother and because i have known him all my life but if he were going to be married tomorrow you would see that it would make no difference to me  barbara finn walked on for a couple of minutes in silence before she replied mary she said at last i dont believe a word of it  very wellthen all that i shall ask of you is that we may not talk about him any more mamma believes it and that is enough for me nevertheless they did talk about phineas during the whole of that day and very often talked about him afterwards as long as mary remained at killaloe  there was a large dinner party at the doctors on the day after mr monks arrival the bishop was not there though he was on terms sufficiently friendly with the doctors family to have been invited on so grand an occasion but he was not there because mrs finn was determined that she would be taken out to dinner by a cabinet minister in the face of all her friends she was aware that had the bishop been there she must have taken the bishops arm and though there would have been glory in that the other glory was more to her taste it was the first time in her life that she had ever seen a cabinet minister and i think that she was a little disappointed at finding him so like other middleaged gentlemen she had hoped that mr monk would have assumed something of the dignity of his position but he assumed nothing now the bishop though he was a very mild man did assume something by the very facts of his apron and kneebreeches  i am sure sir it is very good of you to come and put up with our humble way of living said mrs finn to her guest as they sat down at table and yet she had resolved that she would not make any speech of the kindthat she would condescend to no apologythat she would bear herself as though a cabinet minister dined with her at least once a year but when the moment came she broke down and made this apology with almost abject meekness and then hated herself because she had done so  my dear madam said mr monk i live myself so much like a hermit that your house is a palace of luxury to me then he felt that he had made a foolish speech and he also hated himself he found it very difficult to talk to his hostess upon any subject until by chance he mentioned his young friend phineas then her tongue was unloosed your son madam he said is going with me to limerick and back to dublin it is a shame i know taking him so soon away from home but i should not know how to get on without him  oh mr monk it is such a blessing for him and such an honour for us that you should be so good to him then the mother spoke out all her past fears and all her present hopes and acknowledged the great glory which it was to her to have a son sitting in parliament holding an office with a stately name and a great salary and blessed with the friendship of such a man as mr monk after that mr monk got on better with her  i dont know any young man said he in whose career i have taken so strong an interest  he was always good said mrs finn with a tear forcing itself into the corner of each eye i am his mother and of course i ought not to say sonot in this way but it is true mr monk and then the poor lady was obliged to raise her handkerchief and wipe away the drops  phineas on this occasion had taken out to dinner the mother of his devoted mary mrs flood jones what a pleasure it must be to the doctor and mrs finn to see you come back in this way said mrs flood jones  with all my bones unbroken said he laughing  yes with all your bones unbroken you know phineas when we first heard that you were to sit in parliament we were afraid that you might break a rib or twosince you choose to talk about the breaking of bones  yes i know everybody thought i should come to grief but nobody felt so sure of it as i did myself  but you have not come to grief  i am not out of the wood yet you know mrs flood jones there is plenty of possibility for grief in my way still  as far as i can understand it you are out of the wood all that your friends here want to see now is that you should marry some nice english girl with a little money if possible rumours have reached us you know  rumours always lie said phineas  sometimes they do of course and i am not going to ask any indiscreet questions but that is what we all hope mary was saying only the other day that if you were once married we should all feel quite safe about you and you know we all take the most lively interest in your welfare it is not every day that a man from county clare gets on as you have done and therefore we are bound to think of you thus mrs flood jones signified to phineas finn that she had forgiven him the thoughtlessness of his early youtheven though there had been something of treachery in that thoughtlessness to her own daughter and showed him also that whatever marys feelings might have been once they were not now of a nature to trouble her of course you will marry said mrs flood jones  i should think very likely not said phineas who perhaps looked farther into the mind of the lady than the lady intended  oh do said the lady every man should marry as soon as he can and especially a man in your position  when the ladies met together in the drawingroom after dinner it was impossible but that they should discuss mr monk there was mrs callaghan from the brewery there and old lady blood of bloodstonewho on ordinary occasions would hardly admit that she was on diningout terms with any one in killaloe except the bishop but who had found it impossible to decline to meet a cabinet ministerand there was mrs stackpoole from sixmiletown a faraway cousin of the finns who hated lady blood with a true provincial hatred  i dont see anything particularly uncommon in him after all said lady blood  i think he is very nice indeed said mrs flood jones  so very quiet my dear and just like other people said mrs callaghan meaning to pronounce a strong eulogium on the cabinet minister  very like other people indeed said lady blood  and what would you expect lady blood said mrs stackpoole men and women in london walk upon two legs just as they do in ennis now lady blood herself had been born and bred in ennis whereas mrs stackpoole had come from limerick which is a much more considerable town and therefore there was a satire in this allusion to the habits of the men of ennis which lady blood understood thoroughly  my dear mrs stackpoole i know how the people walk in london quite as well as you do lady blood had once passed three months in london while sir patrick had been alive whereas mrs stackpoole had never done more than visit the metropolis for a day or two  oh no doubt said mrs stackpoole but i never can understand what it is that people expect i suppose mr monk ought to have come with his stars on the breast of his coat to have pleased lady blood  my dear mrs stackpoole cabinet ministers dont have stars said lady blood  i never said they did said mrs stackpoole  he is so nice and gentle to talk to said mrs finn you may say what you will but men who are high up do very often give themselves airs now i must say that this friend of my sons does not do anything of that kind  not the least said mrs callaghan  quite the contrary said mrs stackpoole  i dare say he is a wonderful man said lady blood all i say is that i didnt hear anything wonderful come out of his mouth and as for people in ennis walking on two legs i have seen donkeys in limerick doing just the same thing now it was well known that mrs stackpoole had two sons living in limerick as to neither of whom was it expected that he would set the shannon on fire after this little speech there was no further mention of mr monk as it became necessary that all the goodnature of mrs finn and all the tact of mrs flood jones and all the energy of mrs callaghan should be used to prevent the raging of an internecine battle between mrs stackpoole and lady blood     chapter lxvi  victrix   mr monks holiday programme allowed him a week at killaloe and from thence he was to go to limerick and from limerick to dublin in order that at both places he might be entertained at a public dinner and make a speech about tenantright foreseeing that phineas might commit himself if he attended these meetings mr monk had counselled him to remain at killaloe but phineas had refused to subject himself to such cautious abstinence mr monk had come to ireland as his friend and he would see him through his travels i shall not probably be asked to speak said phineas and if i am asked i need not say more than a few words and what if i did speak out  you might find it disadvantageous to you in london  i must take my chance of that i am not going to tie myself down for ever and ever for the sake of being undersecretary to the colonies mr monk said very much to him on the subjectwas constantly saying very much to him about it but in spite of all that mr monk said phineas did make the journey to limerick and dublin  he had not since his arrival at killaloe been a moment alone with mary flood jones till the evening before he started with mr monk she had kept out of his way successfully though she had constantly been with him in company and was beginning to plume herself on the strength and valour of her conduct but her selfpraise had in it nothing of joy and her glory was very sad of course she would care for him no moremore especially as it was so very evident that he cared not at all for her but the very fact of her keeping out of his way made her acknowledge to herself that her position was very miserable she had declared to her mother that she might certainly go to killaloe with safetythat it would be better for her to put herself in the way of meeting him as an old friendthat the idea of the necessity of shutting herself up because of his approach was the one thing that gave her real pain therefore her mother had brought her to killaloe and she had met him but her fancied security had deserted her and she found herself to be miserable hoping for something she did not know what still dreaming of possibilities feeling during every moment of his presence with her that some special conduct was necessary on her part she could not make further confession to her mother and ask to be carried back to floodborough but she knew that she was very wretched at killaloe  as for phineas he had felt that his old friend was very cold to him he was in that humour with reference to violet effingham which seemed especially to require consolation he knew now that all hope was over there violet effingham could never be his wife even were she not to marry lord chiltern for the next five years she would not during those five years marry any other man such was our heros conviction and suffering under this conviction he was in want of the comfort of feminine sympathy had mary known all this and had it suited her to play such a part i think she might have had phineas at her feet before he had been a week at home but she had kept aloof from him and had heard nothing of his sorrows as a natural consequence of this phineas was more in love with her than ever  on the evening before he started with mr monk for limerick he managed to be alone with her for a few minutes barbara may probably have assisted in bringing about this arrangement and had perhaps been guilty of some treacherysisters in such circumstances will sometimes be very treacherous to their friends i feel sure however that mary herself was quite innocent of any guile in the matter mary phineas said to her suddenly it seems to me that you have avoided me purposely ever since i have been at home she smiled and blushed and stammered and said nothing has there been any reason for it mary  no reason at all that i know of she said  we used to be such great friends  that was before you were a great man phineas it must necessarily be different now you know so many people now and people of such a different sort that of course i fall a little into the background  when you talk in that way mary i know that you are laughing at me  indeed indeed i am not  i believe there is no one in the whole world he said after a pause whose friendship is more to me than yours is i think of it so often mary say that when we come back it shall be between us as it used to be then he put out his hand for hers and she could not help giving it to him of course there will be people he said who talk nonsense and one cannot help it but i will not put up with it from you  i did not mean to talk nonsense phineas then there came some one across them and the conversation was ended but the sound of his voice remained on her ears and she could not help but remember that he had declared that her friendship was dearer to him than the friendship of any one else  phineas went with mr monk first to limerick and then to dublin and found himself at both places to be regarded as a hero only second to the great hero at both places the one subject of debate was tenantrightcould anything be done to make it profitable for men with capital to put their capital into irish land the fertility of the soil was questioned by no onenor the sufficiency of external circumstances such as railroads and the likenor the abundance of labournor even security for the wealth to be produced the only difficulty was in this that the men who were to produce the wealth had no guarantee that it would be theirs when it was created in england and elsewhere such guarantees were in existence might it not be possible to introduce them into ireland that was the question which mr monk had in hand and in various speeches which he made both before and after the dinners given to him he pledged himself to keep it well in hand when parliament should meet of course phineas spoke also it was impossible that he should be silent when his friend and leader was pouring out his eloquence of course he spoke and of course he pledged himself something like the old pleasures of the debating society returned to him as standing upon a platform before a listening multitude he gave full vent to his words in the house of commons of late he had been so cabined cribbed and confined by office as to have enjoyed nothing of this indeed from the commencement of his career he had fallen so thoroughly into the decorum of government ways as to have missed altogether the delights of that wild irresponsible oratory of which mr monk had spoken to him so often he had envied men below the gangway who though supporting the government on main questions could get up on their legs whenever the house was full enough to make it worth their while and say almost whatever they pleased there was that mr robson who literally did say just what came uppermost and the thing that came uppermost was often illnatured often unbecoming the gravity of the house was always startling but men listened to him and liked him to speak but mr robson hadmarried a woman with money oh whywhy had not violet effingham been kinder to him he might even yet perhaps marry a woman with money but he could not bring himself to do so unless he loved her  the upshot of the dublin meeting was that he also positively pledged himself to support during the next session of parliament a bill advocating tenantright i am sorry you went so far as that mr monk said to him almost as soon as the meeting was over they were standing on the pier at kingstown and mr monk was preparing to return to england  and why not i as far as you  because i had thought about it and i do not think that you have i am prepared to resign my office tomorrow and directly that i can see mr gresham and explain to him what i have done i shall offer to do so  he wont accept your resignation  he must accept it unless he is prepared to instruct the irish secretary to bring in such a bill as i can support  i shall be exactly in the same boat  but you ought not to be in the same boatnor need you my advice to you is to say nothing about it till you get back to london and then speak to lord cantrip tell him that you will not say anything on the subject in the house but that in the event of there being a division you hope to be allowed to vote as on an open question it may be that i shall get greshams assent and if so we shall be all right if i do not and if they choose to make it a point with you you must resign also  of course i shall said phineas  but i do not think they will you have been too useful and they will wish to avoid the weakness which comes to a ministry from changing its team goodbye my dear fellow and remember thismy last word of advice to you is to stick by the ship i am quite sure it is a career which will suit you i did not begin it soon enough  phineas was rather melancholy as he returned alone to killaloe it was all very well to bid him stick to the ship and he knew as well as any one could tell him how material the ship was to him but there are circumstances in which a man cannot stick to his shipcannot stick at least to this special government ship he knew that whither mr monk went in this session he must follow he had considerable hope that when mr monk explained his purpose to the prime minister the prime minister would feel himself obliged to give way in that case phineas would not only be able to keep his office but would have such an opportunity of making a speech in parliament as circumstances had never yet given to him when he was again at home he said nothing to his father or to the killaloeians as to the danger of his position of what use would it be to make his mother and sisters miserable or to incur the useless counsels of the doctor they seemed to think his speech at dublin very fine and were never tired of talking of what mr monk and phineas were going to do but the idea had not come home to them that if mr monk or phineas chose to do anything on their own account they must give up the places which they held under the crown  it was september when phineas found himself back at killaloe and he was due to be at his office in london in november the excitement of mr monks company was now over and he had nothing to do but to receive pouches full of official papers from the colonial office and study all the statistics which came within his reach in reference to the proposed new law for tenantright in the meantime mary was still living with her mother at killaloe and still kept herself somewhat aloof from the man she loved how could it be possible for him not to give way in such circumstances as those  one day he found himself talking to her about himself and speaking to her of his own position with more frankness than he ever used with his own family he had begun by reminding her of that conversation which they had had before he went away with mr monk and by reminding her also that she had promised to return to her old friendly ways with him  nay phineas there was no promise she said  and are we not to be friends  i only say that i made no particular promise of course we are friends we have always been friends  what would you say if you heard that i had resigned my office and given up my seat he asked of course she expressed her surprise almost her horror at such an idea and then he told her everything it took long in the telling because it was necessary that he should explain to her the working of the system which made it impossible for him as a member of the government to entertain an opinion of his own  and do you mean that you would lose your salary she asked  certainly i should  would not that be very dreadful  he laughed as he acknowledged that it would be dreadful it is very dreadful mary to have nothing to eat and drink but what is a man to do would you recommend me to say that black is white  i am sure you will never do that  you see mary it is very nice to be called by a big name and to have a salary and it is very comfortable to be envied by ones friends and enemiesbut there are drawbacks there is this especial drawback then he paused for a moment before he went on  what especial drawback phineas  a man cannot do what he pleases with himself how can a man marry so circumstanced as i am  she hesitated for a moment and then she answered hima man may be very happy without marrying i suppose  he also paused for many moments before he spoke again and she then made a faint attempt to escape from him but before she succeeded he had asked her a question which arrested her i wonder whether you would listen to me if i were to tell you a history of course she listened and the history he told her was the tale of his love for violet effingham  and she has money of her own mary asked  yesshe is rich she has a large fortune  then mr finn you must seek some one else who is equally blessed  mary that is untruethat is illnatured you do not mean that say that you do not mean it you have not believed that i loved miss effingham because she was rich  but you have told me that you could love no one who is not rich  i have said nothing of the kind love is involuntary it does not often run in a yoke with prudence i have told you my history as far as it is concerned with violet effingham i did love her very dearly  did love her mr finn  yesdid love her is there any inconstancy in ceasing to love when one is not loved is there inconstancy in changing ones love and in loving again  i do not know said mary to whom the occasion was becoming so embarrassing that she no longer was able to reply with words that had a meaning in them  if there be dear i am inconstant he paused but of course she had not a syllable to say i have changed my love but i could not speak of a new passion till i had told the story of that which has passed away you have heard it all now mary can you try to love me after that it had come at lastthe thing for which she had been ever wishing it had come in spite of her imprudence and in spite of her prudence when she had heard him to the end she was not a whit angry with himshe was not in the least aggrievedbecause he had been lost to her in his love for this miss effingham while she had been so nearly lost by her love for him for women such episodes in the lives of their lovers have an excitement which is almost pleasurable whereas each man is anxious to hear his lady swear that until he appeared upon the scene her heart had been fancy free mary upon the whole had liked the storyhad thought that it had been finely told and was well pleased with the final catastrophe but nevertheless she was not prepared with her reply have you no answer to give me mary he said looking up into her eyes i am afraid that he did not doubt what would be her answeras it would be good that all lovers should do you must vouchsafe me some word mary  when she essayed to speak she found that she was dumb she could not get her voice to give her the assistance of a single word she did not cry but there was a motion as of sobbing in her throat which impeded all utterance she was as happy as earthas heaven could make her but she did not know how to tell him that she was happy and yet she longed to tell it that he might know how thankful she was to him for his goodness he still sat looking at her and now by degrees he had got her hand in his mary he said will you be my wifemy own wife  when half an hour had passed they were still together and now she had found the use of her tongue do whatever you like best she said i do not care which you do if you came to me tomorrow and told me you had no income it would make no difference though to love you and to have your love is all the world to methough it makes all the difference between misery and happinessi would sooner give up that than be a clog on you then he took her in his arms and kissed her oh phineas she said i do love you so entirely  my own one  yes your own one but if you had known it always never mind now you are my ownare you not  indeed yes dearest  oh what a thing it is to be victorious at last  what on earth are you two doing here these two hours together said barbara bursting into the room  what are we doing said phineas  yeswhat are you doing  nothing in particular said mary  nothing at all in particular said phineas only thisthat we have engaged ourselves to marry each other it is quite a trifleis it not mary  oh barbara said the joyful girl springing forward into her friends arms i do believe i am the happiest creature on the face of this earth     chapter lxvii  jobs comforters   before phineas had returned to london his engagement with mary flood jones was known to all his family was known to mrs flood jones and was indeed known generally to all killaloe that other secret of his which had reference to the probability of his being obliged to throw up his office was known only to mary herself he thought that he had done all that honour required of him in telling her of his position before he had proposedso that she might on that ground refuse him if she were so minded and yet he had known very well that such prudence on her part was not to be expected if she loved him of course she would say so when she was asked and he had known that she loved him there may be delay mary he said to her as he was going nay there must be delay if i am obliged to resign  i do not care a straw for delay if you will be true to me she said  do you doubt my truth dearest  not in the least i will swear by it as the one thing that is truest in the world  you may dearest and if this should come to pass i must go to work and put my shoulder to the wheel and earn an income for you by my old profession before i can make you my wife with such a motive before me i know that i shall earn an income and thus they parted mary though of course she would have preferred that her future husband should remain in his high office that he should be a member of parliament and an undersecretary of state admitted no doubt into her mind to disturb her happiness and phineas though he had many misgivings as to the prudence of what he had done was not the less strong in his resolution of constancy and endurance he would throw up his position resign his seat and go to work at the bar instantly if he found that his independence as a man required him to do so and above all let come what might he would be true to mary flood jones  december was half over before he saw lord cantrip yesyes said lord cantrip when the undersecretary began to tell his story i saw what you were about i wish i had been at your elbow  if you knew the country as i know it you would be as eager about it as i am  then i can only say that i am very glad that i do not know the country as you know it you see finn its my idea that if a man wants to make himself useful he should stick to some special kind of work with you its a thousand pities that you should not do so  you think then i ought to resign  i dont say anything about that as you wish it of course ill speak to gresham monk i believe has resigned already  he has written to me and told me so said phineas  i always felt afraid of him for your sake finn mr monk is a clever man and as honest a man as any in the house but i always thought that he was a dangerous friend for you however we will see i will speak to gresham after christmas there is no hurry about it  when parliament met the first great subject of interest was the desertion of mr monk from the ministry he at once took his place below the gangway sitting as it happened exactly in front of mr turnbull and there he made his explanation some one opposite asked a question whether a certain right honourable gentleman had not left the cabinet then mr gresham replied that to his infinite regret his right honourable friend who lately presided at the board of trade had resigned and he went on to explain that this resignation had according to his ideas been quite unnecessary his right honourable friend entertained certain ideas about irish tenantright as to which he himself and his right honourable friend the secretary for ireland could not exactly pledge themselves to be in unison with him but he had thought that the motion might have rested at any rate over this session then mr monk explained making his first great speech on irish tenantright he found himself obliged to advocate some immediate measure for giving security to the irish farmer and as he could not do so as a member of the cabinet he was forced to resign the honour of that position he said something also as to the great doubt which had ever weighed on his own mind as to the inexpediency of a man at his time of life submitting himself for the first time to the trammels of office this called up mr turnbull who took the opportunity of saying that he now agreed cordially with his old friend for the first time since that old friend had listened to the blandishments of the ministerial seducer and that he welcomed his old friend back to those independent benches with great satisfaction in this way the debate was very exciting nothing was said which made it then necessary for phineas to get upon his legs or to declare himself but he perceived that the time would rapidly come in which he must do so mr gresham though he strove to speak with gentle words was evidently very angry with the late president of the board of trade and moreover it was quite clear that a bill would be introduced by mr monk himself which mr gresham was determined to oppose if all this came to pass and there should be a close division phineas felt that his fate would be sealed when he again spoke to lord cantrip on the subject the secretary of state shrugged his shoulders and shook his head i can only advise you said lord cantrip to forget all that took place in ireland if you will do so nobody else will remember it as if it were possible to forget such things he said in the letter which he wrote to mary that night of course i shall go now if it were not for your sake i should not in the least regret it  he had been with madame goesler frequently in the winter and had discussed with her so often the question of his official position that she had declared that she was coming at last to understand the mysteries of an english cabinet i think you are quite right my friend she saidquite right whatyou are to be in parliament and say that this black thing is white or that this white thing is black because you like to take your salary that cannot be honest then when he came to talk to her of moneythat he must give up parliament itself if he gave up his placeshe offered to lend him money why should you not treat me as a friend she said when he pointed out to her that there would never come a time in which he could pay such money back she stamped her foot and told him that he had better leave her you have high principle she said but not principle sufficiently high to understand that this thing could be done between you and me without disgrace to either of us then phineas assured her with tears in his eyes that such an arrangement was impossible without disgrace to him  but he whispered to this new friend no word of the engagement with his dear irish mary his irish life he would tell himself was a thing quite apart and separate from his life in england he said not a word about mary flood jones to any of those with whom he lived in london why should he feeling as he did that it would so soon be necessary that he should disappear from among them about miss effingham he had said much to madame goesler she had asked him whether he had abandoned all hope that affair then is over she had said  yesit is all over now  and she will marry the redheaded violent lord  heaven knows i think she will but she is exactly the girl to remain unmarried if she takes it into her head that the man she likes is in any way unfitted for her  does she love this lord  oh yesthere is no doubt of that and phineas as he made this acknowledgment seemed to do so without much inward agony of soul when he had been last in london he could not speak of violet and lord chiltern together without showing that his misery was almost too much for him  at this time he received some counsel from two friends one was laurence fitzgibbon and the other was barrington erle laurence had always been true to him after a fashion and had never resented his intrusion at the colonial office phineas me boy he said if all this is thrue youre about up a tree  it is true that i shall support monks motion  then me boy youre up a tree as far as office goes a place like that niver suited me because you see that poker of a young lord expected so much of a man but you dont mind that kind of thing and i thought you were as snug as snug  troubles will come you see laurence  bedad yes its all throubles i think sometimes but youve a way out of all your throubles  what way  pop the question to madame max the moneys all thrue you know  i dont doubt the money in the least said phineas  and its my belief shell take you without a second word anyways thry it phinny my boy thats my advice phineas so far agreed with his friend laurence that he thought it possible that madame goesler might accept him were he to propose marriage to her he knew of course that that mode of escape from his difficulties was out of the question for him but he could not explain this to laurence fitzgibbon  i am sorry to hear that you have taken up a bad cause said barrington erle to him  it is a pityis it not  and the worst of it is that youll sacrifice yourself and do no good to the cause i never knew a man break away in this fashion and not feel afterwards that he had done it all for nothing  but what is a man to do barrington he cant smother his convictions  convictions there is nothing on earth that im so much afraid of in a young member of parliament as convictions there are ever so many rocks against which men get broken one man cant keep his temper another cant hold his tongue a third cant say a word unless he has been priming himself half a session a fourth is always thinking of himself and wanting more than he can get a fifth is idle and wont be there when hes wanted a sixth is always in the way a seventh lies so that you never can trust him ive had to do with them all but a fellow with convictions is the worst of all  i dont see how a fellow is to help himself said phineas when a fellow begins to meddle with politics they will come  why cant you grow into them gradually as your betters and elders have done before you it ought to be enough for any man when he begins to know that hes a liberal he understands which side of the house hes to vote and who is to lead him whats the meaning of having a leader to a party if its not that do you think that you and mr monk can go and make a government between you  whatever i think im sure he doesnt  im not so sure of that but look here phineas i dont care two straws about monks going i always thought that mildmay and the duke were wrong when they asked him to join i knew hed go over the tracesunless indeed he took his money and did nothing for it which is the way with some of those radicals i look upon him as gone  he has gone  the devil go along with him as you say in ireland but dont you be such a fool as to ruin yourself for a crotchet of monks it isnt too late yet for you to hold back to tell you the truth gresham has said a word to me about it already he is most anxious that you should stay but of course you cant stay and vote against us  of course i cannot  i look upon you you know as in some sort my own child ive tried to bring other fellows forward who seemed to have something in them but i have never succeeded as i have with you youve hit the thing off and have got the ball at your foot upon my honour in the whole course of my experience i have never known such good fortune as yours  and i shall always remember how it began barrington said phineas who was greatly moved by the energy and solicitude of his friend  but for gods sake dont go and destroy it all by such mad perversity as this they mean to do something next session morrison is going to take it up sir walter morrison was at this time secretary for ireland but of course we cant let a fellow like monk take the matter into his own hands just when he pleases i call it dd treachery  monk is no traitor barrington  men will have their own opinions about that its generally understood that when a man is asked to take a seat in the cabinet he is expected to conform with his colleagues unless something very special turns up but i am speaking of you now and not of monk you are not a man of fortune you cannot afford to make ducks and drakes you are excellently placed and you have plenty of time to hark back if youll only listen to reason all that irish stump balderdash will never be thrown in your teeth by us if you will just go on as though it had never been uttered  phineas could only thank his friend for his advice which was at least disinterested and was good of its kind and tell him that he would think of it he did think of it very much he almost thought that were it to do again he would allow mr monk to go upon his tour alone and keep himself from the utterance of anything that so good a judge as erle could call stump balderdash as he sat in his armchair in his room at the colonial office with despatchboxes around him and official papers spread before himfeeling himself to be one of those who in truth managed and governed the affairs of this great nation feeling also that if he relinquished his post now he could never regain ithe did wish that he had been a little less in love with independence a little quieter in his boastings that no official considerations should ever silence his tongue but all this was too late now he knew that his skin was not thick enough to bear the arrows of those archers who would bend their bows against him if he should now dare to vote against mr monks motion his own party might be willing to forgive and forget but there would be others who would read those reports and would appear in the house with the odious telltale newspapers in their hands  then he received a letter from his father some goodnatured person had enlightened the doctor as to the danger in which his son was placing himself dr finn who in his own profession was a very excellent and wellinstructed man had been so ignorant of parliamentary tactics as to have been proud at his sons success at the irish meetings he had thought that phineas was carrying on his trade as a public speaker with proper energy and continued success he had cared nothing himself for tenantright and had acknowledged to mr monk that he could not understand in what it was that the farmers were wronged but he knew that mr monk was a cabinet minister and he thought that phineas was earning his salary then there came some one who undeceived him and the paternal bosom of the doctor was dismayed i dont mean to interfere he said in his letter but i can hardly believe that you really intend to resign your place yet i am told that you must do so if you go on with this matter my dear boy pray think about it i cannot imagine you are disposed to lose all that you have won for nothing mary also wrote to him mrs finn had been talking to her and mary had taught herself to believe that after the many sweet conversations she had had with a man so high in office as phineas she really did understand something about the british government mrs finn had interrogated mary and mary had been obliged to own that it was quite possible that phineas would be called upon to resign  but why my dear heaven and earth resign two thousand a year  that he may maintain his independence said mary proudly  fiddlestick said mrs finn how is he to maintain you or himself either if he goes on in that way i shouldnt wonder if he didnt get himself all wrong even now then mrs finn began to cry and mary could only write to her lover pointing out to him how very anxious all his friends were that he should do nothing in a hurry but what if the thing were done already phineas in his great discomfort went to seek further counsel from madame goesler of all his counsellors madame goesler was the only one who applauded him for what he was about to do  but after all what is it you give up mr gresham may be out tomorrow and then where will be your place  there does not seem to be much chance of that at present  who can tell of course i do not understandbut it was only the other day when mr mildmay was there and only the day before that when lord de terrier was there and again only the day before that when lord brock was there phineas endeavoured to make her understand that of the four prime ministers whom she had named three were men of the same party as himself under whom it would have suited him to serve i would not serve under any man if i were an english gentleman in parliament said madame goesler  what is a poor fellow to do said phineas laughing  a poor fellow need not be a poor fellow unless he likes said madame goesler immediately after this phineas left her and as he went along the street he began to question himself whether the prospects of his own darling mary were at all endangered by his visits to park lane and to reflect what sort of a blackguard he would bea blackguard of how deep a dyewere he to desert mary and marry madame max goesler then he also asked himself as to the nature and quality of his own political honesty if he were to abandon mary in order that he might maintain his parliamentary independence after all if it should ever come to pass that his biography should be written his biographer would say very much more about the manner in which he kept his seat in parliament than of the manner in which he kept his engagement with miss mary flood jones half a dozen people who knew him and her might think ill of him for his conduct to mary but the world would not condemn him and when he thundered forth his liberal eloquence from below the gangway as an independent member having the fortune of his charming wife to back him giving excellent dinners at the same time in park lane would not the world praise him very loudly  when he got to his office he found a note from lord brentford inviting him to dine in portman square     chapter lxviii  the joint attack   the note from lord brentford surprised our hero not a little he had had no communication with the earl since the day on which he had been so savagely scolded about the duel when the earl had plainly told him that his conduct had been as bad as it could be phineas had not on that account become at all ashamed of his conduct in reference to the duel but he had conceived that any reconciliation between him and the earl had been out of the question now there had come a civillyworded invitation asking him to dine with the offended nobleman the note had been written by lady laura but it had purported to come from lord brentford himself he sent back word to say that he should be happy to have the honour of dining with lord brentford  parliament at this time had been sitting nearly a month and it was already march phineas had heard nothing of lady laura and did not even know that she was in london till he saw her handwriting he did not know that she had not gone back to her husband and that she had remained with her father all the winter at saulsby he had also heard that lord chiltern had been at saulsby all the world had been talking of the separation of mr kennedy from his wife one half of the world declaring that his wife if not absolutely false to him had neglected all her duties and the other half asserting that mr kennedys treatment of his wife had been so bad that no woman could possibly have lived with him there had even been a rumour that lady laura had gone off with a lover from the duke of omniums garden party and some indiscreet tongue had hinted that a certain unmarried undersecretary of state was missing at the same time but lord chiltern upon this had shown his teeth with so strong a propensity to do some real biting that no one had ventured to repeat that rumour its untruth was soon established by the fact that lady laura kennedy was living with her father at saulsby of mr kennedy phineas had as yet seen nothing since he had been up in town that gentleman though a member of the cabinet had not been in london at the opening of the session nor had he attended the cabinet meetings during the recess it had been stated in the newspapers that he was ill and stated in private that he could not bear to show himself since his wife had left him at last however he came to london and phineas saw him in the house then when the first meeting of the cabinet was summoned after his return it became known that he also had resigned his office there was nothing said about his resignation in the house he had resigned on the score of illhealth and that very worthy peer lord mount thistle formerly sir marmaduke morecombe came back to the duchy of lancaster in his place a prime minister sometimes finds great relief in the possession of a serviceable stick who can be made to go in and out as occasion may require only it generally happens that the stick will expect some reward when he is made to go out lord mount thistle immediately saw his way to a viscounts coronet when he was once more summoned to the august councils of the ministers  a few days after this had been arranged in the interval between lord brentfords invitation and lord brentfords dinner phineas encountered mr kennedy so closely in one of the passages of the house that it was impossible that they should not speak to each other unless they were to avoid each other as people do who have palpably quarrelled phineas saw that mr kennedy was hesitating and therefore took the bull by the horns he greeted his former friend in a friendly fashion shaking him by the hand and then prepared to pass on but mr kennedy though he had hesitated at first now detained his brother member finn he said if you are not engaged i should like to speak to you for a moment phineas was not engaged and allowed himself to be led out arminarm by the late chancellor of the duchy into westminster hall of course you know what a terrible thing has happened to me said mr kennedy  yesi have heard of it said phineas  everybody has heard of it that is one of the terrible cruelties of such a blow  all those things are very bad of course i was very much grievedbecause you have both been intimate friends of mine  yesyes we were do you ever see her now  not since last julyat the dukes party you know  ah yes the morning of that day was the last on which i spoke to her it was then she left me  i am going to dine with lord brentford tomorrow and i dare say she will be there  yesshe is in town i saw her yesterday in her fathers carriage i think that she had no cause to leave me  of course i cannot say anything about that  i think she had no cause to leave me phineas as he heard this could not but remember all that lady laura had told himself and thought that no woman had ever had a better reason for leaving her husband there were things i did not like and i said so  i suppose that is generally the way replied phineas  but surely a wife should listen to a word of caution from her husband  i fancy they never like it said phineas  but are we all of us to have all that we like i have not found it so or would it be good for us if we had then he paused but as phineas had no further remark to make he continued speaking after they had walked about a third of the length of the hall it is not of my own comfort i am thinking now so much as of her name and her future conduct of course it will in every sense be best for her that she should come back to her husbands roof  well yesperhaps it would said phineas  has she not accepted that lot for better or for worse said mr kennedy solemnly  but incompatibility of temper you know is alwaysalways supposed you understand me  it is my intention that she should come back to me i do not wish to make any legal demandat any rate not as yet will you consent to be the bearer of a message from me both to herself and to the earl  now it seemed to phineas that of all the messengers whom mr kennedy could have chosen he was the most unsuited to be a mercury in this causenot perceiving that he had been so selected with some craft in order that lady laura might understand that the accusation against her was at any rate withdrawn which had named phineas as her lover he paused again before he answered of course he said i should be most willing to be of service if it were possible but i do not see how i can speak to the earl about it though i am going to dine with him i dont know why he has asked mefor he and i are on very bad terms he heard that stupid story about the duel and has not spoken to me since  i heard that too said mr kennedy frowning blackly as he remembered his wifes duplicity  everybody heard of it but it has made such a difference between him and me that i dont think i can meddle send for lord chiltern and speak to him  speak to chiltern never he would probably strike me on the head with his club  call on the earl yourself  i did and he would not see me  write to him  i did and he sent back my letter unopened  write to her  i didand she answered me saying only thus indeed indeed it cannot be so but it must be so the laws of god require it and the laws of man permit it i want some one to point out that to them more softly than i could do if i were simply to write to that effect to the earl of course i cannot write again the conference ended by a promise from phineas that he would if possible say a word to lady laura  when he was shown into lord brentfords drawingroom he found not only lady laura there but her brother lord brentford was not in the room barrington erle was there and so also were lord and lady cantrip  is not your father going to be here he said to lady laura after their first greeting  we live in that hope said she and do not at all know why he should be late what has become of him oswald  he came in with me half an hour ago and i suppose he does not dress as quickly as i do said lord chiltern upon which phineas immediately understood that the father and the son were reconciled and he rushed to the conclusion that violet and her lover would also soon be reconciled if such were not already the case he felt some remnant of a soreness that it should be so as a man feels where his headache has been when the real ache itself has left him then the host came in and made his apologies chiltern kept me standing about he said till the east wind had chilled me through and through the only charm i recognise in youth is that it is impervious to the east wind phineas felt quite sure now that violet and her lover were reconciled and he had a distinct feeling of the place where the ache had been dear violet but after all violet lacked that sweet clinging feminine softness which made mary flood jones so preeminently the most charming of her sex the earl when he had repeated his general apology especially to lady cantrip who was the only lady present except his daughter came up to our hero and shook him kindly by the hand he took him up to one of the windows and then addressed him in a voice of mock solemnity  stick to the colonies young man he said and never meddle with foreign affairsespecially not at blankenberg  never again my lordnever again  and leave all questions of firearms to be arranged between the horse guards and the war office i have heard a good deal about it since i saw you and i retract a part of what i said but a duel is a foolish thinga very foolish thing comehere is dinner and the earl walked off with lady cantrip and lord cantrip walked off with lady laura barrington erle followed and phineas had an opportunity of saying a word to his friend lord chiltern as they went down together  its all right between you and your father  yesafter a fashion there is no knowing how long it will last he wants me to do three things and i wont do any one of them  what are the three  to go into parliament to be an owner of sheep and oxen and to hunt in his own county i should never attend the first i should ruin myself with the second and i should never get a run in the third but there was not a word said about his marriage  there were only seven who sat down to dinner and the six were all people with whom phineas was or had been on most intimate terms lord cantrip was his official chief and since that connection had existed between them lady cantrip had been very gracious to him she quite understood the comfort which it was to her husband to have under him as his representative in the house of commons a man whom he could thoroughly trust and like and therefore she had used her womans arts to bind phineas to her lord in more than mere official bondage she had tried her skill also upon laurence fitzgibbonbut altogether in vain he had eaten her dinners and accepted her courtesies and had given for them no return whatever but phineas had possessed a more grateful mind and had done all that had been required of himhad done all that had been required of him till there had come that terrible absurdity in ireland i knew very well what sort of things would happen when they brought such a man as mr monk into the cabinet lady cantrip had said to her husband  but though the party was very small and though the guests were all his intimate friends phineas suspected nothing special till an attack was made upon him as soon as the servants had left the room this was done in the presence of the two ladies and no doubt had been preconcerted there was lord cantrip there who had already said much to him and barrington erle who had said more even than lord cantrip lord brentford himself a member of the cabinet opened the attack by asking whether it was actually true that mr monk meant to go on with his motion barrington erle asserted that mr monk positively would do so and gresham will oppose it asked the earl of course he will said barrington of course he will said lord cantrip i know what i should think of him if he did not said lady cantrip he is the last man in the world to be forced into a thing said lady laura then phineas knew pretty well what was coming on him  lord brentford began again by asking how many supporters mr monk would have in the house that depends upon the amount of courage which the conservatives may have said barrington erle if they dare to vote for a thoroughly democratic measure simply for the sake of turning us out it is quite on the cards that they may succeed but of our own people asked lord cantrip you had better inquire that of phineas finn said barrington and then the attack was made  our hero had a bad half hour of it though many words were said which must have gratified him much they all wanted to keep himso lord cantrip declared except one or two whom i could name and who are particularly anxious to wear his shoes said barrington thinking that certain reminiscences of phineas with regard to mr bonteen and others might operate as strongly as any other consideration to make him love his place lord brentford declared that he could not understand itthat he should find himself lost in amazement if such a man as his young friend allowed himself to be led into the outer wilderness by such an ignisfatuus of light as this lord cantrip laid down the unwritten traditional law of government officials very plainly a man in officein an office which really imposed upon him as much work as he could possibly do with credit to himself or his causewas dispensed from the necessity of a conscience with reference to other matters it was for sir walter morrison to have a conscience about irish tenantright as no doubt he hadjust as phineas finn had a conscience about canada and jamaica and the cape barrington erle was very strong about parties in general and painted the comforts of official position in glowing colours but i think that the two ladies were more efficacious than even their male relatives in the arguments which they used we have been so happy to have you among us said lady cantrip looking at him with beseeching almost loving eyes mr finn knows said lady laura that since he first came into parliament i have always believed in his success and i have been very proud to see it we shall weep over him as over a fallen angel if he leaves us said lady cantrip i wont say that i will weep said lady laura but i do not know anything of the kind that would so truly make me unhappy  what was he to say in answer to applications so flattering and so pressing he would have said nothing had that been possible but he felt himself obliged to reply he replied very weaklyof course not justifying himself but declaring that as he had gone so far he must go further he must vote for the measure now both his chief and barrington erle proved or attempted to prove that he was wrong in this of course he would not speak on the measure and his vote for his party would probably be allowed to pass without notice one or two newspapers might perhaps attack him but what public man cared for such attacks as those his whole party would hang by him and in that he would find ample consolation phineas could only say that he would think of itand this he said in so irresolute a tone of voice that all the men then present believed that he was gained the two ladies however were of a different opinion in spite of anything that anybody may say he will do what he thinks right when the time comes said laura to her father afterwards but then lady laura had been in love with himwas perhaps almost in love with him still im afraid he is a mule said lady cantrip to her husband hes a good mule up a hill with a load on his back said his lordship but with a mule there always comes a time when you cant manage him said lady cantrip but lady cantrip had never been in love with phineas  phineas found a moment before he left lord brentfords house to say a word to lady laura as to the commission that had been given to him it can never be said lady laura shudderingnever never never  you are not angry with me for speaking  oh nonot if he told you  he made me promise that i would  tell him it cannot be tell him that if he has any instruction to send me as to what he considers to be my duty i will endeavour to comply if that duty can be done apart i will recognize him so far because of my vow but not even for the sake of my vow will i endeavour to live with him his presence would kill me  when phineas repeated this or as much of this as he judged to be necessary to mr kennedy a day or two afterwards that gentleman replied that in such case he would have no alternative but to seek redress at law i have done nothing to my wife said he of which i need be ashamed it will be sad no doubt to have all our affairs bandied about in court and made the subject of comment in newspapers but a man must go through that or worse than that in the vindication of his rights and for the performance of his duty to his maker that very day mr kennedy went to his lawyer and desired that steps might be taken for the restitution to him of his conjugal rights     chapter lxix  the temptress   mr monks bill was read the first time before easter and phineas finn still held his office he had spoken to the prime minister once on the subject and had been surprised at that gentlemans courtesyfor mr gresham had the reputation of being unconciliatory in his manners and very prone to resent anything like desertion from that allegiance which was due to himself as the leader of his party you had better stay where you are and take no step that may be irretrievable till you have quite made up your mind said mr gresham  i fear i have made up my mind said phineas  nothing can be done till after easter replied the great man and there is no knowing how things may go then i strongly recommend you to stay with us if you can do this it will be only necessary that you shall put your resignation in lord cantrips hands before you speak or vote against us see monk and talk it over with him mr gresham possibly imagined that mr monk might be moved to abandon his bill when he saw what injury he was about to do  at this time phineas received the following letter from his darling mary      floodborough thursday     dearest phineas     we have just got home from killaloe and mean to remain    here all through the summer after leaving your sisters    this house seems so desolate but i shall have the more    time to think of you i have been reading tennyson as you    told me and i fancy that i could in truth be a mariana    here if it were not that i am so quite certain that you    will comeand that makes all the difference in the world    in a moated grange last night i sat at the window and    tried to realise what i should feel if you were to tell me    that you did not want me and i got myself into such an    ecstatic state of mock melancholy that i cried for half an    hour but when one has such a real living joy at the back    of ones romantic melancholy tears are very pleasant    they water and do not burn     i must tell you about them all at killaloe they certainly    are very unhappy at the idea of your resigning your    father says very little but i made him own that to act    as you are acting for the sake of principle is very grand    i would not leave him till he had said so and he did say    it dear mrs finn does not understand it as well but    she will do so she complains mostly for my sake and    when i tell her that i will wait twenty years if it is    necessary she tells me i do not know what waiting means    but i willand will be happy and will never really    think myself a mariana dear dear dear phineas indeed    i wont the girls are half sad and half proud but i am    wholly proud and know that you are doing just what you    ought to do i shall think more of you as a man who might    have been a prime minister than if you were really sitting    in the cabinet like lord cantrip as for mamma i cannot    make her quite understand it she merely says that no    young man who is going to be married ought to resign    anything dear mammasometimes she does say such odd    things     you told me to tell you everything and so i have i    talk to some of the people here and tell them what they    might do if they had tenantright one old fellow mike    duffertyi dont know whether you remember himasked    if he would have to pay the rent all the same when i said    certainly he would then he shook his head but as you    said once when we want to do good to people one has no    right to expect that they should understand it it is like    baptizing little infants     i got both your notesseven words in one mr    undersecretary and nine in the other but the one little    word at the end was worth a whole sheet full of common    words how nice it is to write letters without paying    postage and to send them about the world with a grand    name in the corner when barney brings me one he always    looks as if he didnt know whether it was a love letter    or an order to go to botany bay if he saw the inside of    them how short they are i dont think hed think much of    you as a lover nor yet as an undersecretary     but i think ever so much of you as bothi do indeed    and i am not scolding you a bit as long as i can have two    or three dear sweet loving words i shall be as happy as    a queen ah if you knew it all but you never can know    it all a man has so many other things to learn that he    cannot understand it     goodbye dear dear dearest man whatever you do i shall    be quite sure you have done the best     ever your own with all the love of her heart     mary f jones   this was very nice such a man as was phineas finn always takes a delight which he cannot express even to himself in the receipt of such a letter as this there is nothing so flattering as the warm expression of the confidence of a womans love and phineas thought that no woman ever expressed this more completely than did his mary dear dearest mary as for giving her up as for treachery to one so trusting so sweet so well beloved that was out of the question but nevertheless the truth came home to him more clearly day by day that he of all men was the last who ought to have given himself up to such a passion for her sake he ought to have abstained so he told himself now for her sake he ought to have kept aloof from herand for his own sake he ought to have kept aloof from mr monk that very day with marys letter in his pocket he went to the livery stables and explained that he would not keep his horse any longer there was no difficulty about the horse mr howard macleod of the treasury would take him from that very hour phineas as he walked away uttered a curse upon mr howard macleod mr howard macleod was just beginning the glory of his life in london and he phineas finn was bringing his to an end  with marys letter in his pocket he went up to portman square he had again got into the habit of seeing lady laura frequently and was often with her brother who now again lived at his fathers house a letter had reached lord brentford through his lawyer in which a demand was made by mr kennedy for the return of his wife she was quite determined that she would never go back to him and there had come to her a doubt whether it would not be expedient that she should live abroad so as to be out of the way of persecution from her husband lord brentford was in great wrath and lord chiltern had once or twice hinted that perhaps he had better see mr kennedy the amenities of such an interview as this would be had up to the present day been postponed and in a certain way phineas had been used as a messenger between mr kennedy and his wifes family  i think it will end she said in my going to dresden and settling myself there papa will come to me when parliament is not sitting  it will be very dull  dull what does dulness amount to when one has come to such a pass as this when one is in the ruck of fortune to be dull is very bad but when misfortune comes simple dulness is nothing it sounds almost like relief  it is so hard that you should be driven away she did not answer him for a while and he was beginning to think of his own case also was it not hard that he too should be driven away it is odd enough that we should both be going at the same time  but you will not go  i think i shall i have resolved upon thisthat if i give up my place i will give up my seat too i went into parliament with the hope of office and how can i remain there when i shall have gained it and then have lost it  but you will stay in london mr finn  i think not after all that has come and gone i should not be happy here and i should make my way easier and on cheaper terms in dublin my present idea is that i shall endeavour to make a practice over in my own country it will be hard work beginning at the bottomwill it not  and so unnecessary  ah lady lauraif it only could be avoided but it is of no use going through all that again  how much we would both of us avoid if we could only have another chance said lady laura if i could only be as i was before i persuaded myself to marry a man whom i never loved what a paradise the earth would be to me with me all regrets are too late  and with me as much so  no mr finn even should you resign your office there is no reason why you should give up your seat  simply that i have no income to maintain me in london  she was silent for a few moments during which she changed her seat so as to come nearer to him placing herself on a corner of a sofa close to the chair on which he was seated i wonder whether i may speak to you plainly she said  indeed you may  on any subject  yeson any subject  i trust you have been able to rid your bosom of all remembrances of violet effingham  certainly not of all remembrances lady laura  of all hope then  i have no such hope  and of all lingering desires  well yesand of all lingering desires i know now that it cannot be your brother is welcome to her  ahof that i know nothing he with his perversity has estranged her but i am sure of thisthat if she do not marry him she will marry no one but it is not on account of him that i speak he must fight his own battles now  i shall not interfere with him lady laura  then why should you not establish yourself by a marriage that will make place a matter of indifference to you i know that it is within your power to do so phineas put his hand up to his breastcoat pocket and felt that marys letterher precious letterwas there safe it certainly was not in his power to do this thing which lady laura recommended to him but he hardly thought that the present was a moment suitable for explaining to her the nature of the impediment which stood in the way of such an arrangement he had so lately spoken to lady laura with an assurance of undying constancy of his love for miss effingham that he could not as yet acknowledge the force of another passion he shook his head by way of reply i tell you that it is so she said with energy  i am afraid not  go to madame goesler and ask her hear what she will say  madame goesler would laugh at me no doubt  psha you do not think so you know that she would not laugh and are you the man to be afraid of a womans laughter i think not  again he did not answer her at once and when he did speak the tone of his voice was altered what was it you said of yourself just now  what did i say of myself  you regretted that you had consented to marry a manwhom you did not love  why should you not love her and it is so different with a man a woman is wretched if she does not love her husband but i fancy that a man gets on very well without any such feeling she cannot domineer over you she cannot expect you to pluck yourself out of your own soil and begin a new growth altogether in accordance with the laws of her own it was that which mr kennedy did  i do not for a moment think that she would take me if i were to offer myself  try her said lady laura energetically such trials cost you but littlewe both of us know that still he said nothing of the letter in his pocket it is everything that you should go on now that you have once begun i do not believe in you working at the bar you cannot do it a man who has commenced life as you have done with the excitement of politics who has known what it is to take a prominent part in the control of public affairs cannot give it up and be happy at other work make her your wife and you may resign or remain in office just as you choose office will be much easier to you than it is now because it will not be a necessity let me at any rate have the pleasure of thinking that one of us can remain herethat we need not both fall together  still he did not tell her of the letter in his pocket he felt that she moved himthat she made him acknowledge to himself how great would be the pity of such a failure as would be his he was quite as much alive as she could be to the fact that work at the bar either in london or in dublin would have no charms for him now the prospect of such a life was very dreary to him even with the comfort of marys love such a life would be very dreary to him and then he knewhe thought that he knewthat were he to offer himself to madame goesler he would not in truth be rejected she had told him that if poverty was a trouble to him he need be no longer poor of course he had understood this her money was at his service if he should choose to stoop and pick it up and it was not only money that such a marriage would give him he had acknowledged to himself more than once that madame goesler was very lovely that she was clever attractive in every way and as far as he could see blessed with a sweet temper she had a position too in the world that would help him rather than mar him what might he not do with an independent seat in the house of commons and as joint owner of the little house in park lane of all careers which the world could offer to a man the pleasantest would then be within his reach you appear to me as a tempter he said at last to lady laura  it is unkind of you to say that and ungrateful i would do anything on earth in my power to help you  nevertheless you are a tempter  i know how it ought to have been she said in a low voice i know very well how it ought to have been i should have kept myself free till that time when we met on the braes of loughlinter and then all would have been well with us  i do not know how that might have been said phineas hoarsely  you do not know but i know of course you have stabbed me with a thousand daggers when you have told me from time to time of your love for violet you have been very cruelneedlessly cruel men are so cruel but for all that i have known that i could have kept youhad it not been too late when you spoke to me will you not own as much as that  of course you would have been everything to me i should never have thought of violet then  that is the only kind word you have said to me from that day to this i try to comfort myself in thinking that it would have been so but all that is past and gone and done i have had my romance and you have had yours as you are a man it is natural that you should have been disturbed by a double imageit is not so with me  and yet you can advise me to offer marriage to a womana woman whom i am to seek merely because she is rich  yesi do so advise you you have had your romance and must now put up with reality why should i so advise you but for the interest that i have in you your prosperity will do me no good i shall not even be here to see it i shall hear of it only as so many a woman banished out of england hears a distant misunderstood report of what is going on in the country she has left but i still have regard enoughi will be bold and knowing that you will not take it amiss will say love enough for youto feel a desire that you should not be shipwrecked since we first took you in hand between us barrington and i i have never swerved in my anxiety on your behalf when i resolved that it would be better for us both that we should be only friends i did not swerve when you would talk to me so cruelly of your love for violet i did not swerve when i warned you from loughlinter because i thought there was danger i did not swerve when i bade you not to come to me in london because of my husband i did not swerve when my father was hard upon you i did not swerve then i would not leave him till he was softened when you tried to rob oswald of his love and i thought you would succeedfor i did think soi did not swerve i have ever been true to you and now that i must hide myself and go away and be seen no more i am true still  lauradearest laura he exclaimed  ah no she said speaking with no touch of anger but all in sorrowit must not be like that there is no room for that nor do you mean it i do not think so ill of you but there may not be even words of affection between usonly such as i may speak to make you know that i am your friend  you are my friend he said stretching out his hand to her as he turned away his face you are my friend indeed  then do as i would have you do  he put his hand into his pocket and had the letter between his fingers with the purport of showing it to her but at the moment the thought occurred to him that were he to do so then indeed he would be bound for ever he knew that he was bound for everbound for ever to his own mary but he desired to have the privilege of thinking over such bondage once more before he proclaimed it even to his dearest friend he had told her that she tempted him and she stood before him now as a temptress but lest it might be possible that she should not tempt in vainthat letter in his pocket must never be shown to her in that case lady laura must never hear from his lips the name of mary flood jones  he left her without any assured purposewithout that is the assurance to her of any fixed purpose there yet wanted a week to the day on which mr monks bill was to be reador not to be readthe second time and he had still that interval before he need decide he went to his club and before he dined he strove to write a line to marybut when he had the paper before him he found that it was impossible to do so though he did not even suspect himself of an intention to be false the idea that was in his mind made the effort too much for him he put the paper away from him and went down and eat his dinner  it was a saturday and there was no house in the evening he had remained in portman square with lady laura till near seven oclock and was engaged to go out in the evening to a gathering at mrs greshams house everybody in london would be there and phineas was resolved that as long as he remained in london he would be seen at places where everybody was seen he would certainly be at mrs greshams gathering but there was an hour or two before he need go home to dress and as he had nothing to do he went down to the smokingroom of his club the seats were crowded but there was one vacant and before he had looked about him to scrutinise his neighbourhood he found that he had placed himself with bonteen on his right hand and ratler on his left there were no two men in all london whom he more thoroughly disliked but it was too late for him to avoid them now  they instantly attacked him first on one side and then on the other so i am told you are going to leave us said bonteen  who can have been illnatured enough to whisper such a thing replied phineas  the whispers are very loud i can tell you said ratler i think i know already pretty nearly how every man in the house will vote and i have not got your name down on the right side  change it for heavens sake said phineas  i will if youll tell me seriously that i may said ratler  my opinion is said bonteen that a man should be known either as a friend or foe i respect a declared foe  know me as a declared foe then said phineas and respect me  thats all very well said ratler but it means nothing ive always had a sort of fear about you finn that you would go over the traces some day of course its a very grand thing to be independent  the finest thing in the world said bonteen only so dd useless  but a man shouldnt be independent and stick to the ship at the same time you forget the trouble you cause and how you upset all calculations  i hadnt thought of the calculations said phineas  the fact is finn said bonteen you are made of clay too fine for office ive always found it has been so with men from your country you are the grandest horses in the world to look at out on a prairie but you dont like the slavery of harness  and the sound of a whip over our shoulders sets us kickingdoes it not ratler  i shall show the list to gresham tomorrow said ratler and of course he can do as he pleases but i dont understand this kind of thing  dont you be in a hurry said bonteen ill bet you a sovereign finn votes with us yet theres nothing like being a little coy to set off a girls charms ill bet you a sovereign ratler that finn goes out into the lobby with you and me against monks bill  phineas not being able to stand any more of this most unpleasant raillery got up and went away the club was distasteful to him and he walked off and sauntered for a while about the park he went down by the duke of yorks column as though he were going to his office which of course was closed at this hour but turned round when he got beyond the new public buildingsbuildings which he was never destined to use in their completed stateand entered the gates of the enclosure and wandered on over the bridge across the water as he went his mind was full of thought could it be good for him to give up everything for a fair face he swore to himself that of all women whom he had ever seen mary was the sweetest and the dearest and the best if it could be well to lose the world for a woman it would be well to lose it for her violet with all her skill and all her strength and all her grace could never have written such a letter as that which he still held in his pocket the best charm of a woman is that she should be soft and trusting and generous and who ever had been more soft more trusting and more generous than his mary of course he would be true to her though he did lose the world  but to yield such a triumph to the ratlers and bonteens whom he left behind himto let them have their will over himto know that they would rejoice scurrilously behind his back over his downfall the feeling was terrible to him the last words which bonteen had spoken made it impossible to him now not to support his old friend mr monk it was not only what bonteen had said but that the words of mr bonteen so plainly indicated what would be the words of all the other bonteens he knew that he was weak in this he knew that had he been strong he would have allowed himself to be guidedif not by the firm decision of his own spiritby the counsels of such men as mr gresham and lord cantrip and not by the sarcasms of the bonteens and ratlers of official life but men who sojourn amidst savagery fear the mosquito more than they do the lion he could not bear to think that he should yield his blood to such a one as bonteen  and he must yield his blood unless he could vote for mr monks motion and hold his ground afterwards among them all in the house of commons he would at any rate see the session out and try a fall with mr bonteen when they should be sitting on different benchesif ever fortune should give him an opportunity and in the meantime what should he do about madame goesler what a fate was his to have the handsomest woman in london with thousands and thousands a year at his disposal forso he now swore to himselfmadame goesler was the handsomest woman in london as mary flood jones was the sweetest girl in the world  he had not arrived at any decision so fixed as to make him comfortable when he went home and dressed for mrs greshams party and yet he knewhe thought that he knew that he would be true to mary flood jones     chapter lxx  the prime ministers house   the rooms and passages and staircases at mrs greshams house were very crowded when phineas arrived there men of all shades of politics were there and the wives and daughters of such men and there was a streak of royalty in one of the saloons and a whole rainbow of foreign ministers with their stars and two blue ribbons were to be seen together on the first landingplace with a stout lady between them carrying diamonds enough to load a pannier everybody was there phineas found that even lord chiltern was come as he stumbled across his friend on the first footground that he gained in his ascent towards the rooms halloayou here said phineas yes by george said the other but i am going to escape as soon as possible ive been trying to make my way up for the last hour but could never get round that huge promontory there laura was more persevering is kennedy here phineas whispered i do not know said chiltern but she was determined to run the chance  a little higher upfor phineas was blessed with more patience than lord chiltern possessedhe came upon mr monk so you are still admitted privately said phineas  oh dear yesand we have just been having a most friendly conversation about you what a man he is he knows everything he is so accurate so just in the abstractand in the abstract so generous  he has been very generous to me in detail as well as in abstract said phineas  ah yes i am not thinking of individuals exactly his want of generosity is to large massesto a party to classes to a people whereas his generosity is for mankind at large he assumes the god affects to nod and seems to shake the spheres but i have nothing against him he has asked me here tonight and has talked to me most familiarly about ireland  what do you think of your chance of a second reading asked phineas  what do you think of ityou hear more of those things than i do  everybody says it will be a close division  i never expected it said mr monk  nor i till i heard what daubeny said at the first reading they will all vote for the bill en massehating it in their hearts all the time  let us hope they are not so bad as that  it is the way with them always they do all our work for ussailing either on one tack or the other that is their use in creation that when we split among ourselves as we always do they come in and finish our job for us it must be unpleasant for them to be always doing that which they always say should never be done at all  wherever the gift horse may come from i shall not look it in the mouth said mr monk there is only one man in the house whom i hope i may not see in the lobby with me and that is yourself  the question is decided now said phineas  and how is it decided  phineas could not tell his friend that a question of so great magnitude to him had been decided by the last sting which he had received from an insect so contemptible as mr bonteen but he expressed the feeling as well as he knew how to express it oh i shall be with you i know what you are going to say and i know how good you are but i could not stand it men are beginning already to say things which almost make me get up and kick them if i can help it i will give occasion to no man to hint anything to me which can make me be so wretched as i have been today pray do not say anything more my idea is that i shall resign tomorrow  then i hope that we may fight the battle side by side said mr monk giving him his hand  we will fight the battle side by side replied phineas  after that he pushed his way still higher up the stairs having no special purpose in view not dreaming of any such success as that of reaching his host or hostessmerely feeling that it should be a point of honour with him to make a tour through the rooms before he descended the stairs the thing he thought was to be done with courage and patience and this might probably be the last time in his life that he would find himself in the house of a prime minister just at the turn of the balustrade at the top of the stairs he found mr gresham in the very spot on which mr monk had been talking with him very glad to see you said mr gresham you i find are a persevering man with a genius for getting upwards  like the sparks said phineas  not quite so quickly said mr gresham  but with the same assurance of speedy loss of my little light  it did not suit mr gresham to understand this so he changed the subject have you seen the news from america  yes i have seen it but do not believe it said phineas  ah you have such faith in a combination of british colonies properly backed in downing street as to think them strong against a world in arms in your place i should hold to the same doctrinehold to it stoutly  and you do now i hope mr gresham  wellyesi am not downhearted but i confess to a feeling that the world would go on even though we had nothing to say to a single province in north america but that is for your private ear you are not to whisper that in downing street then there came up somebody else and phineas went on upon his slow course he had longed for an opportunity to tell mr gresham that he could go to downing street no more but such opportunity had not reached him  for a long time he found himself stuck close by the side of miss fitzgibbonmiss aspasia fitzgibbonwho had once relieved him from terrible pecuniary anxiety by paying for him a sum of money which was due by him on her brothers account its a very nice thing to be here but one does get tired of it said miss fitzgibbon  very tired said phineas  of course it is a part of your duty mr finn you are on your promotion and are bound to be here when i asked laurence to come he said there was nothing to be got till the cards were shuffled again  theyll be shuffled very soon said phineas  whatever colour comes up youll hold trumps i know said the lady some hands always hold trumps he could not explain to miss fitzgibbon that it would never again be his fate to hold a single trump in his hand so he made another fight and got on a few steps farther  he said a word as he went to half a dozen friendsas friends went with him he was detained for five minutes by lady baldock who was very gracious and very disagreeable she told him that violet was in the room but where she did not know she is somewhere with lady laura i believe and really mr finn i do not like it lady baldock had heard that phineas had quarrelled with lord brentford but had not heard of the reconciliation really i do not like it i am told that mr kennedy is in the house and nobody knows what may happen  mr kennedy is not likely to say anything  one cannot tell and when i hear that a woman is separated from her husband i always think that she must have been imprudent it may be uncharitable but i think it is most safe so to consider  as far as i have heard the circumstances lady laura was quite right said phineas  it may be so gentlemen will always take the ladys partof course but i should be very sorry to have a daughter separated from her husbandvery sorry  phineas who had nothing now to gain from lady baldocks favour left her abruptly and went on again he had a great desire to see lady laura and violet together though he could hardly tell himself why he had not seen miss effingham since his return from ireland and he thought that if he met her alone he could hardly have talked to her with comfort but he knew that if he met her with lady laura she would greet him as a friend and speak to him as though there were no cause for embarrassment between them but he was so far disappointed that he suddenly encountered violet alone she had been leaning on the arm of lord baldock and phineas saw her cousin leave her but he would not be such a coward as to avoid her especially as he knew that she had seen him oh mr finn she said do you see that  see what  look there is mr kennedy we had heard that it was possible and laura made me promise that i would not leave her phineas turned his head and saw mr kennedy standing with his back bolt upright against a doorpost with his brow as black as thunder she is just opposite to him where he can see her said violet pray take me to her he will think nothing of you because i know that you are still friends with both of them i came away because lord baldock wanted to introduce me to lady mouser you know he is going to marry miss mouser  phineas not caring much about lord baldock and miss mouser took violets hand upon his arm and very slowly made his way across the room to the spot indicated there they found lady laura alone sitting under the upastree influence of her husbands gaze there was a concourse of people between them and mr kennedy did not seem inclined to make any attempt to lessen the distance but lady laura had found it impossible to move while she was under her husbands eyes  mr finn she said could you find oswald i know he is here  he has gone said phineas i was speaking to him downstairs  you have not seen my father he said he would come  i have not seen him but i will search  noit will do no good i cannot stay his carriage is there i knowwaiting for me phineas immediately started off to have the carriage called and promised to return with as much celerity as he could use as he went making his way much quicker through the crowd than he had done when he had no such object for haste he purposely avoided the door by which mr kennedy had stood it would have been his nearest way but his present service he thought required that he should keep aloof from the man but mr kennedy passed through the door and intercepted him in his path  is she going he asked  well yes i dare say she may before long i shall look for lord brentfords carriage byandby  tell her she need not go because of me i shall not return i shall not annoy her here it would have been much better that a woman in such a plight should not have come to such an assembly  you would not wish her to shut herself up  i would wish her to come back to the home that she has left and if there be any law in the land she shall be made to do so you tell her that i say so then mr kennedy fought his way down the stairs and phineas finn followed in his wake  about half an hour afterwards phineas returned to the two ladies with tidings that the carriage would be at hand as soon as they could be below did he see you said lady laura  yes he followed me  and did he speak to you  yeshe spoke to me  and what did he say and then in the presence of violet phineas gave the message he thought it better that it should be given and were he to decline to deliver it now it would never be given whether there be law in the land to protect me or whether there be none i will never live with him said lady laura is a woman like a head of cattle that she can be fastened in her crib by force i will never live with him though all the judges of the land should decide that i must do so  phineas thought much of all this as he went to his solitary lodgings after all was not the world much better with him than it was with either of those two wretched married beings and why he had not at any rate as yet sacrificed for money or social gains any of the instincts of his nature he had been fickle foolish vain uncertain and perhaps covetousbut as yet he had not been false then he took out marys last letter and read it again     chapter lxxi  comparing notes   it would perhaps be difficult to decidebetween lord chiltern and miss effinghamwhich had been most wrong or which had been nearest to the right in the circumstances which had led to their separation the old lord wishing to induce his son to undertake work of some sort and feeling that his own efforts in this direction were worse than useless had closeted himself with his intended daughterinlaw and had obtained from her a promise that she would use her influence with her lover of course i think it right that he should do something violet had said and he will if you bid him replied the earl violet expressed a great doubt as to this willingness of obedience but nevertheless she promised to do her best and she did her best lord chiltern when she spoke to him knit his brows with an apparent ferocity of anger which his countenance frequently expressed without any intention of ferocity on his part he was annoyed but was not savagely disposed to violet as he looked at her however he seemed to be very savagely disposed what is it you would have me do he said  i would have you choose some occupation oswald  what occupation what is it that you mean ought i to be a shoemaker  not that by preference i should say but that if you please when her lover had frowned at her violet had resolvedhad strongly determined with inward assertions of her own rightsthat she would not be frightened by him  you are talking nonsense violet you know that i cannot be a shoemaker  you may go into parliament  i neither can nor would i if i could i dislike the life  you might farm  i cannot afford it  you mightmight do anything you ought to do something you know that you ought you know that your father is right in what he says  that is easily asserted violet but it would i think be better that you should take my part than my fathers if it be that you intend to be my wife  you know that i intend to be your wife but would you wish that i should respect my husband  and will you not do so if you marry me he asked  then violet looked into his face and saw that the frown was blacker than ever the great mark down his forehead was deeper and more like an ugly wound than she had ever seen it and his eyes sparkled with anger and his face was red as with fiery wrath if it was so with him when she was no more than engaged to him how would it be when they should be man and wife at any rate she would not fear himnot now at least no oswald she said if you resolve upon being an idle man i shall not respect you it is better that i should tell you the truth  a great deal better he said  how can i respect one whose whole life will bewill be  will be what he demanded with a loud shout  oswald you are very rough with me  what do you say that my life will be  then she again resolved that she would not fear him it will be discreditable she said  it shall not discredit you he replied i will not bring disgrace on one i have loved so well violet after what you have said we had better part she was still proud still determined and they did part though it nearly broke her heart to see him leave her she bid him go she hated herself afterwards for her severity to him but nevertheless she would not submit to recall the words which she had spoken she had thought him to be wrong and so thinking had conceived it to be her duty and her privilege to tell him what she thought but she had no wish to lose himno wish not to be his wife even though he should be as idle as the wind she was so constituted that she had never allowed him or any other man to be master of her hearttill she had with a full purpose given her heart away the day before she had resolved to give it to one man she might i think have resolved to give it to another love had not conquered her but had been taken into her service nevertheless she could not now rid herself of her servant when she found that his services would stand her no longer in good stead she parted from lord chiltern with an assent with an assured brow and with much dignity in her gait but as soon as she was alone she was a prey to remorse she had declared to the man who was to have been her husband that his life was discreditableand of course no man would bear such language had lord chiltern borne it he would not have been worthy of her love  she herself told lady laura and lord brentford what had occurredand had told lady baldock also lady baldock had of course triumphedand violet sought her revenge by swearing that she would regret for ever the loss of so inestimable a gentleman then why have you given him up my dear demanded lady baldock because i found that he was too good for me said violet it may be doubtful whether lady baldock was not justified when she declared that her niece was to her a care so harassing that no aunt known in history had ever been so troubled before  lord brentford had fussed and fumed and had certainly made things worse he had quarrelled with his son and then made it up and then quarrelled againswearing that the fault must all be attributed to chilterns stubbornness and chilterns temper latterly however by lady lauras intervention lord brentford and his son had again been reconciled and the earl endeavoured manfully to keep his tongue from disagreeable words and his face from evil looks when his son was present they will make it up lady laura had said if you and i do not attempt to make it up for them if we do they will never come together the earl was convinced and did his best but the task was very difficult to him how was he to keep his tongue off his son while his son was daily saying things of which any fatherany such father as lord brentfordcould not but disapprove lord chiltern professed to disbelieve even in the wisdom of the house of lords and on one occasion asserted that it must be a great comfort to any prime minister to have three or four old women in the cabinet the father when he heard this tried to rebuke his son tenderly strove even to be jocose it was the one wish of his heart that violet effingham should be his daughterinlaw but even with this wish he found it very hard to keep his tongue off lord chiltern  when lady laura discussed the matter with violet violet would always declare that there was no hope the truth is she said on the morning of that day on which they both went to mrs greshams that though we like each otherlove each other if you choose to say sowe are not fit to be man and wife  and why not fit  we are too much alike each is too violent too headstrong and too masterful  you as the woman ought to give way said lady laura  but we do not always do just what we ought  i know how difficult it is for me to advise seeing to what a pass i have brought myself  do not say that dearor rather do say it for we have both of us brought ourselves to what you call a passto such a pass that we are like to be able to live together and discuss it for the rest of our lives the difference is i take it that you have not to accuse yourself and that i have  i cannot say that i have not to accuse myself said lady laura i do not know that i have done much wrong to mr kennedy since i married him but in marrying him i did him a grievous wrong  and he has avenged himself  we will not talk of vengeance i believe he is wretched and i know that i amand that has come of the wrong that i have done  i will make no man wretched said violet  do you mean that your mind is made up against oswald  i mean that and i mean much more i say that i will make no man wretched your brother is not the only man who is so weak as to be willing to run the hazard  there is lord fawn  yes there is lord fawn certainly perhaps i should not do him much harm but then i should do him no good  and poor phineas finn  yesthere is mr finn i will tell you something laura the only man i ever saw in the world whom i have thought for a moment that it was possible that i should likelike enough to love as my husbandexcept your brother was mr finn  and now  ohnow of course that is over said violet  it is over  quite over is he not going to marry madame goesler i suppose all that is fixed by this time i hope she will be good to him and gracious and let him have his own way and give him his tea comfortably when he comes up tired from the house for i confess that my heart is a little tender towards phineas still i should not like to think that he had fallen into the hands of a female philistine  i do not think he will marry madame goesler  why not  i can hardly tell youbut i do not think he will and you loved him onceeh violet  not quite that my dear it has been difficult with me to love the difficulty with most girls i fancy is not to love mr finn when i came to measure him in my mind was not small but he was never quite tall enough one feels oneself to be a sort of recruiting sergeant going about with a standard of inches mr finn was just half an inch too short he lacks something in individuality he is a little too much a friend to everybody  shall i tell you a secret violet  if you please dear though i fancy it is one i know already  he is the only man whom i ever loved said lady laura  but it was too late when you learned to love him said violet  it was too late when i was so sure of it as to wish that i had never seen mr kennedy i felt it coming on me and i argued with myself that such a marriage would be bad for us both at that moment there was trouble in the family and i had not a shilling of my own  you had paid it for oswald  at any rate i had nothingand he had nothing how could i have dared to think even of such a marriage  did he think of it laura  i suppose he did  you know he did did you not tell me before  wellyes he thought of it i had come to some foolish halfsentimental resolution as to friendship believing that he and i could be knit together by some adhesion of fraternal affection that should be void of offence to my husband and in furtherance of this he was asked to loughlinter when i went there just after i had accepted robert he came down and i measured him too as you have done i measured him and i found that he wanted nothing to come up to the height required by my standard i think i knew him better than you did  very possiblybut why measure him at all when such measurement was useless  can one help such things he came to me one day as i was sitting up by the linter you remember the place where it makes its first leap  i remember it very well  so do i robert had shown it me as the fairest spot in all scotland  and there this lover of ours sang his song to you  i do not know what he told me then but i know that i told him that i was engaged and i felt when i told him so that my engagement was a sorrow to me and it has been a sorrow from that day to this  and the hero phineashe is still dear to you  dear to me  yes you would have hated me had he become my husband and you will hate madame goesler when she becomes his wife  not in the least i am no dog in the manger i have even gone so far as almost to wish at certain moments that you should accept him  and why  because he has wished it so heartily  one can hardly forgive a man for such speedy changes said violet  was i not to forgive himi who had turned myself away from him with a fixed purpose the moment that i found that he had made a mark upon my heart i could not wipe off the mark and yet i married was he not to try to wipe off his mark  it seems that he wiped it off very quicklyand since that he has wiped off another mark one doesnt know how many marks he has wiped off they are like the innkeepers score which he makes in chalk a damp cloth brings them all away and leaves nothing behind  what would you have  there should be a little notch on the stickto remember by said violet not that i complain you know i cannot complain as i was not notched myself  you are silly violet  in not having allowed myself to be notched by this great champion  a man like mr finn has his life to deal withto make the most of it and to divide it between work pleasure duty ambition and the rest of it as best he may if he have any softness of heart it will be necessary to him that love should bear a part in all these interests but a man will be a fool who will allow love to be the master of them all he will be one whose mind is so illbalanced as to allow him to be the victim of a single wish even in a woman passion such as that is evidence of weakness and not of strength  it seems then laura that you are weak  and if i am does that condemn him he is a man if i judge him rightly who will be constant as the sun when constancy can be of service  you mean that the future mrs finn will be secure  that is what i meanand that you or i had either of us chosen to take his name might have been quite secure we have thought it right to refuse to do so  and how many more i wonder  you are unjust and unkind violet so unjust and unkind that it is clear to me he has just gratified your vanity and has never touched your heart what would you have had him do when i told him that i was engaged  i suppose that mr kennedy would not have gone to blankenberg with him  violet  that seems to be the proper thing to do but even that does not adjust things finallydoes it then some one came upon them and the conversation was brought to an end     chapter lxxii  madame goeslers generosity   when phineas finn left mr greshams house he had quite resolved what he would do on the next morning he would tell lord cantrip that his resignation was a necessity and that he would take that noblemans advice as to resigning at once or waiting till the day on which mr monks irish bill would be read for the second time  my dear finn i can only say that i deeply regret it said lord cantrip  so do i i regret to leave office which i likeand which indeed i want i regret specially to leave this office as it has been a thorough pleasure to me and i regret above all to leave you but i am convinced that monk is right and i find it impossible not to support him  i wish that mr monk was at bath said lord cantrip  phineas could only smile and shrug his shoulders and say that even though mr monk were at bath it would not probably make much difference when he tendered his letter of resignation lord cantrip begged him to withdraw it for a day or two he would he said speak to mr gresham the debate on the second reading of mr monks bill would not take place till that day week and the resignation would be in time if it was tendered before phineas either spoke or voted against the government so phineas went back to his room and endeavoured to make himself useful in some work appertaining to his favourite colonies  that conversation had taken place on a friday and on the following sunday early in the day he left his rooms after a late breakfasta prolonged breakfast during which he had been studying tenantright statistics preparing his own speech and endeavouring to look forward into the future which that speech was to do so much to influenceand turned his face towards park lane there had been a certain understanding between him and madame goesler that he was to call in park lane on this sunday morning and then declare to her what was his final resolve as to the office which he held it is simply to bid her adieu he said to himself for i shall hardly see her again and yet as he took off his morning easy coat and dressed himself for the streets and stood for a moment before his lookingglass and saw that his gloves were fresh and that his boots were properly polished i think there was a care about his person which he would have hardly taken had he been quite assured that he simply intended to say goodbye to the lady whom he was about to visit but if there were any such conscious feeling he administered to himself an antidote before he left the house on returning to the sittingroom he went to a little desk from which he took out the letter from mary which the reader has seen and carefully perused every word of it she is the best of them all he said to himself as he refolded the letter and put it back into his desk i am not sure that it is well that a man should have any large number from whom to select a best as in such circumstances he is so very apt to change his judgment from hour to hour the qualities which are the most attractive before dinner sometimes become the least so in the evening  the morning was warm and he took a cab it would not do that he should speak even his last farewell to such a one as madame goesler with all the heat and dust of a long walk upon him having been so careful about his boots and gloves he might as well use his care to the end madame goesler was a very pretty woman who spared herself no trouble in making herself as pretty as nature would allow on behalf of those whom she favoured with her smiles and to such a lady some special attention was due by one who had received so many of her smiles as had phineas and he felt too that there was something special in this very visit it was to be made by appointment and there had come to be an understanding between them that phineas should tell her on this occasion what was his resolution with reference to his future life i think that he had been very wise in fortifying himself with a further glance at our dear marys letter before he trusted himself within madame goeslers door  yesmadame goesler was at home the door was opened by madame goeslers own maid who smiling explained that the other servants were all at church phineas had become sufficiently intimate at the cottage in park lane to be on friendly terms with madame goeslers own maid and now made some little halffamiliar remark as to the propriety of his visit during church time madame will not refuse to see you i am thinking said the girl who was a german and she is alone asked phineas alone yesof course she is alone who should be with her now then she took him up into the drawingroom but when there he found that madame goesler was absent she shall be down directly said the girl i shall tell her who is here and she will come  it was a very pretty room it may almost be said that there could be no prettier room in all london it looked out across certain small private gardenswhich were as bright and gay as money could make them when brought into competition with london smokeright on to the park outside and inside the window flowers and green things were so arranged that the room itself almost looked as though it were a bower in a garden and everything in that bower was rich and rare and there was nothing there which annoyed by its rarity or was distasteful by its richness the seats though they were costly as money could buy were meant for sitting and were comfortable as seats there were books for reading and the means of reading them two or three gems of english art were hung upon the walls and could be seen backwards and forwards in the mirrors and there were precious toys lying here and there about the roomtoys very precious but placed there not because of their price but because of their beauty phineas already knew enough of the art of living to be aware that the woman who had made that room what it was had charms to add a beauty to everything she touched what would such a life as his want if graced by such a companionsuch a life as his might be if the means which were hers were at his command it would want one thing he thoughtthe selfrespect which he would lose if he were false to the girl who was trusting him with such sweet trust at home in ireland  in a very few minutes madame goesler was with him and though he did not think about it he perceived that she was bright in her apparel that her hair was as soft as care could make it and that every charm belonging to her had been brought into use for his gratification he almost told himself that he was there in order that he might ask to have all those charms bestowed upon himself he did not know who had lately come to park lane and been a suppliant for the possession of those rich endowments but i wonder whether they would have been more precious in his eyes had he known that they had so moved the heart of the great duke as to have induced him to lay his coronet at the ladys feet i think that had he known that the lady had refused the coronet that knowledge would have enhanced the value of the prize  i am so sorry to have kept you waiting she said as she gave him her hand i was an owl not to be ready for you when you told me that you would come  nobut a bird of paradise to come to me so sweetly and at an hour when all the other birds refuse to show the feather of a single wing  and youyou feel like a naughty boy do you not in thus coming out on a sunday morning  do you feel like a naughty girl  yesjust a little so i do not know that i should care for everybody to hear that i received visitorsor worse still a visitorat this hour on this day but then it is so pleasant to feel oneself to be naughty there is a bohemian flavour of picnic about it which though it does not come up to the rich gusto of real wickedness makes one fancy that one is on the border of that delightful region in which there is none of the constraint of customwhere men and women say what they like and do what they like  it is pleasant enough to be on the borders said phineas  that is just it of course decency morality and propriety all made to suit the eye of the public are the things which are really delightful we all know that and live accordinglyas well as we can i do at least  and do not i madame goesler  i know nothing about that mr finn and want to ask no questions but if you do i am sure you agree with me that you often envy the improper peoplethe bohemiansthe people who dont trouble themselves about keeping any laws except those for breaking which they would be put into nasty unpleasant prisons i envy them oh how i envy them  but you are free as air  the most cabined cribbed and confined creature in the world i have been fighting my way up for the last four years and have not allowed myself the liberty of one flirtationnot often even the recreation of a natural laugh and now i shouldnt wonder if i dont find myself falling back a year or two just because i have allowed you to come and see me on a sunday morning when i told lotta that you were coming she shook her head at me in dismay but now that you are here tell me what you have done  nothing as yet madame goesler  i thought it was to have been settled on friday  it was settledbefore friday indeed as i look back at it all now i can hardly tell when it was not settled it is impossible and has been impossible that i should do otherwise i still hold my place madame goesler but i have declared that i shall give it up before the debate comes on  it is quite fixed  quite fixed my friend  and what next madame goesler as she thus interrogated him was leaning across towards him from the sofa on which she was placed with both her elbows resting on a small table before her we all know that look of true interest which the countenance of a real friend will bear when the welfare of his friend is in question there are doubtless some who can assume it without feelingas there are actors who can personate all the passions but in ordinary life we think that we can trust such a face and that we know the true look when we see it phineas as he gazed into madame goeslers eyes was sure that the lady opposite him was not acting she at least was anxious for his welfare and was making his cares her own what next said she repeating her words in a tone that was somewhat hurried  i do not know that there will be any next as far as public life is concerned there will be no next for me madame goesler  that is out of the question she said you are made for public life  then i shall be untrue to my making i fear but to speak plainly  yes speak plainly i want to understand the reality  the reality is this i shall keep my seat to the end of the session as i think i may be of use after that i shall give it up  resign that too she said in a tone of chagrin  the chances are i think that there will be another dissolution if they hold their own against mr monks motion then they will pass an irish reform bill after that i think they must dissolve  and you will not come forward again  i cannot afford it  psha some five hundred pounds or so  and besides that i am well aware that my only chance at my old profession is to give up all idea of parliament the two things are not compatible for a beginner at the law i know it now and have bought my knowledge by a bitter experience  and where will you live  in dublin probably  and you will dowill do what  anything honest in a barristers way that may be brought to me i hope that i may never descend below that  you will stand up for all the blackguards and try to make out that the thieves did not steal  it may be that that sort of work may come in my way  and you will wear a wig and try to look wise  the wig is not universal in ireland madame goesler  and you will wrangle as though your very soul were in it for somebodys twenty pounds  exactly  you have already made a name in the greatest senate in the world and have governed other countries larger than your own  noi have not done that i have governed no country  i tell you my friend that you cannot do it it is out of the question men may move forward from little work to big work but they cannot move back and do little work when they have had tasks which were really great i tell you mr finn that the house of parliament is the place for you to work in it is the only placethat and the abodes of ministers am not i your friend who tell you this  i know that you are my friend  and will you not credit me when i tell you this what do you fear that you should run away you have no wifeno children what is the coming misfortune that you dread she paused a moment as though for an answer and he felt that now had come the time in which it would be well that he should tell her of his engagement with his own mary she had received him very playfully but now within the last few minutes there had come upon her a seriousness of gesture and almost a solemnity of tone which made him conscious that he should in no way trifle with her she was so earnest in her friendship that he owed it to her to tell her everything but before he could think of the words in which his tale should be told she had gone on with her quick questions is it solely about money that you fear she said  it is simply that i have no income on which to live  have i not offered you money  but madame goesler you who offer it would yourself despise me if i took it  noi do deny it as she said thisnot loudly but with much emphasisshe came and stood before him where he was sitting and as he looked at her he could perceive that there was a strength about her of which he had not been aware she was stronger larger more robust physically than he had hitherto conceived i do deny it she said money is neither god nor devil that it should make one noble and another vile it is an accident and if honestly possessed may pass from you to me or from me to you without a stain you may take my dinner from me if i give it you my flowers my friendship mymymy everything but my money explain to me the cause of the phenomenon if i give to you a thousand pounds now this moment and you take it you are basebut if i leave it you in my willand dieyou take it and are not base explain to me the cause of that  you have not said it quite all said phineas hoarsely  what have i left unsaid if i have left anything unsaid do you say the rest  it is because you are a woman and young and beautiful that no man may take wealth from your hands  oh it is that  it is that partly  if i were a man you might take it though i were young and beautiful as the morning  nopresents of money are always bad they stain and load the spirit and break the heart  and specially when given by a womans hand  it seems so to me but i cannot argue of it do not let us talk of it any more  nor can i argue i cannot argue but i can be generousvery generous i can deny myself for my friendcan even lower myself in my own esteem for my friend i can do more than a man can do for a friend you will not take money from my hand  no madame goesleri cannot do that  take the hand then first when it and all that it holds are your own you can help yourself as you list so saying she stood before him with her right hand stretched out towards him  what man will say that he would not have been tempted or what woman will declare that such temptation should have had no force the very air of the room in which she dwelt was sweet in his nostrils and there hovered around her an halo of grace and beauty which greeted all his senses she invited him to join his lot to hers in order that she might give to him all that was needed to make his life rich and glorious how would the ratlers and the bonteens envy him when they heard of the prize which had become his the cantrips and the greshams would feel that he was a friend doubly valuable if he could be won back and mr monk would greet him as a fitting allyan ally strong with the strength which he had before wanted with whom would he not be equal whom need he fear who would not praise him the story of his poor mary would be known only in a small village out beyond the channel the temptation certainly was very strong  but he had not a moment in which to doubt she was standing there with her face turned from him but with her hand still stretched towards him of course he took it what man so placed could do other than take a womans hand  my friend he said  i will be called friend by you no more she said you must call me marie your own marie or you must never call me by any name again which shall it be sir he paused a moment holding her hand and she let it lie there for an instant while she listened but still she did not look at him speak to me tell me which shall it be still he paused speak to me tell me she said again  it cannot be as you have hinted to me he said at last his words did not come louder than a low whisper but they were plainly heard and instantly the hand was withdrawn  cannot be she exclaimed then i have betrayed myself  nomadame goesler  sir i say yes if you will allow me i will leave you you will i know excuse me if i am abrupt to you then she strode out of the room and was no more seen of the eyes of phineas finn  he never afterwards knew how he escaped out of that room and found his way into park lane in after days he had some memory that he remained there he knew not how long standing on the very spot on which she had left him and that at last there grew upon him almost a fear of moving a dread lest he should be heard an inordinate desire to escape without the sound of a footfall without the clicking of a lock everything in that house had been offered to him he had refused it all and then felt that of all human beings under the sun none had so little right to be standing there as he his very presence in that drawingroom was an insult to the woman whom he had driven from it  but at length he was in the street and had found his way across piccadilly into the green park then as soon as he could find a spot apart from the sunday world he threw himself upon the turf and tried to fix his thoughts upon the thing that he had done his first feeling i think was one of pure and unmixed disappointmentof disappointment so bitter that even the vision of his own mary did not tend to comfort him how great might have been his success and how terrible was his failure had he taken the womans hand and her money had he clenched his grasp on the great prize offered to him his misery would have been ten times worse the first moment that he would have been away from her then indeedit being so that he was a man with a heart within his breastthere would have been no comfort for him in his outlooks on any side but even now when he had done rightknowing well that he had done righthe found that comfort did not come readily within his reach     chapter lxxiii  amantium ir√¶   miss effinghams life at this time was not the happiest in the world her lines as she once said to her friend lady laura were not laid for her in pleasant places her residence was still with her aunt and she had come to find that it was almost impossible any longer to endure lady baldock and quite impossible to escape from lady baldock in former days she had had a dream that she might escape and live alone if she chose to be alone that she might be independent in her life as a man is independent if she chose to live after that fashion that she might take her own fortune in her own hand as the law certainly allowed her to do and act with it as she might please but latterly she had learned to understand that all this was not possible for her though one law allowed it another law disallowed it and the latter law was at least as powerful as the former and then her present misery was enhanced by the fact that she was now banished from the second home which she had formerly possessed hitherto she had always been able to escape from lady baldock to the house of her friend but now such escape was out of the question lady laura and lord chiltern lived in the same house and violet could not live with them  lady baldock understood all this and tortured her niece accordingly it was not premeditated torture the aunt did not mean to make her nieces life a burden to her and so intending systematically work upon a principle to that effect lady baldock no doubt desired to do her duty conscientiously but the result was torture to poor violet and a strong conviction on the mind of each of the two ladies that the other was the most unreasonable being in the world  the aunt in these days had taken it into her head to talk of poor lord chiltern this arose partly from a belief that the quarrel was final and that therefore there would be no danger in aggravating violet by this expression of pitypartly from a feeling that it would be better that her niece should marry lord chiltern than that she should not marry at alland partly perhaps from the general principle that as she thought it right to scold her niece on all occasions this might be best done by taking an opposite view of all questions to that taken by the niece to be scolded violet was supposed to regard lord chiltern as having sinned against her and therefore lady baldock talked of poor lord chiltern as to the other lovers she had begun to perceive that their conditions were hopeless her daughter augusta had explained to her that there was no chance remaining either for phineas or for lord fawn or for mr appledom i believe she will be an old maid on purpose to bring me to my grave said lady baldock when therefore lady baldock was told one day that lord chiltern was in the house and was asking to see miss effingham she did not at once faint away and declare that they would all be murderedas she would have done some months since she was perplexed by a double duty if it were possible that violet should relent and be reconciled then it would be her duty to save violet from the claws of the wild beast but if there was no such chance then it would be her duty to poor lord chiltern to see that he was not treated with contumely and illhumour  does she know that he is here lady baldock asked her daughter  not yet mamma  oh dear oh dear i suppose she ought to see him she has given him so much encouragement  i suppose she will do as she pleases mamma  augusta how can you talk in that way am i to have no control in my own house it was however soon apparent to her that in this matter she was to have no control  lord chiltern is downstairs said violet coming into the room abruptly  so augusta tells me sit down my dear  i cannot sit down auntnot just now i have sent down to say that i would be with him in a minute he is the most impatient soul alive and i must not keep him waiting  and you mean to see him  certainly i shall see him said violet as she left the room  i wonder that any woman should ever take upon herself the charge of a niece said lady baldock to her daughter in a despondent tone as she held up her hands in dismay in the meantime violet had gone downstairs with a quick step and had then boldly entered the room in which her lover was waiting to receive her  i have to thank you for coming to me violet said lord chiltern there was still in his face something of savageryan expression partly of anger and partly of resolution to tame the thing with which he was angry violet did not regard the anger half so keenly as she did that resolution of taming an angry lord she thought she could endure but she could not bear the idea of being tamed by any one  why should i not come she said of course i came when i was told that you were here i do not think that there need be a quarrel between us because we have changed our minds  such changes make quarrels said he  it shall not do so with me unless you choose that it shall said violet why should we be enemieswe who have known each other since we were children my dearest friends are your father and your sister why should we be enemies  i have come to ask you whether you think that i have illused you  illused me certainly not has any one told you that i have accused you  no one has told me so  then why do you ask me  because i would not have you think soif i could help it i did not intend to be rough with you when you told me that my life was disreputable  oh oswald do not let us go back to that what good will it do  but you said so  i think not  i believe that that was your wordthe harshest word that you could use in all the language  i did not mean to be harsh if i used it i will beg your pardon only let there be an end of it as we think so differently about life in general it was better that we should not be married but that is settled and why should we go back to words that were spoken in haste and which are simply disagreeable  i have come to know whether it is settled  certainly you settled it yourself oswald i told you what i thought myself bound to tell you perhaps i used language which i should not have used then you told me that i could not be your wifeand i thought you were right quite right  i was wrong quite wrong he said impetuously so wrong that i can never forgive myself if you do not relent i was such a fool that i cannot forgive myself my folly i had known before that i could not live without you and when you were mine i threw you away for an angry word  it was not an angry word she said  say it again and let me have another chance to answer it  i think i said that idleness was notrespectable or something like that taken out of a copybook probably but you are a man who do not like rebukes even out of copybooks a man so thinskinned as you are must choose for himself a wife with a softer tongue than mine  i will choose none other he said but still he was savage in his tone and in his gestures i made my choice long since as you know well enough i do not change easily i cannot change in this violet say that you will be my wife once more and i will swear to work for you like a coalheaver  my wish is that my husbandshould i ever have oneshould work not exactly as a coalheaver  come violet he saidand now the look of savagery departed from him and there came a smile over his face which however had in it more of sadness than of hope or joytreat me fairlyor rather treat me generously if you can i do not know whether you ever loved me much  very muchyears ago when you were a boy  but not since if it be so i had better go love on one side only is a poor affair at best  a very poor affair  it is better to bear anything than to try and make out life with that some of you women never want to love any one  that was what i was saying of myself to laura but the other day with some women it is so easy with others it is so difficult that perhaps it never comes to them  and with you  oh with me but it is better in these matters to confine oneself to generalities if you please i will not describe myself personally were i to do so doubtless i should do it falsely  you love no one else violet  that is my affair my lord  by heavens and it is mine too tell me that you do and i will go away and leave you at once i will not ask his name and i will trouble you no more if it is not so and if it is possible that you should forgive me  forgive you when have i been angry with you  answer me my question violet  i will not answer you your questionnot that one  what question will you answer  any that may concern yourself and myself none that may concern other people  you told me once that you loved me  this moment i told you that i did soyears ago  but now  that is another matter  violet do you love me now  that is a pointblank question at any rate she said  and you will answer it  i must answer iti suppose  well then  oh oswald what a fool you are love you of course i love you if you can understand anything you ought to know that i have never loved any one elsethat after what has passed between us i never shall love any one else i do love you there whether you throw me away from you as you did the other daywith great scorn mind youor come to me with sweet beautiful promises as you do now i shall love you all the same i cannot be your wife if you will not have me can i when you run away in your tantrums because i quote something out of the copybook i cant run after you it would not be pretty but as for loving you if you doubt that i tell you you are afool as she spoke the last words she pouted out her lips at him and when he looked into her face he saw that her eyes were full of tears he was standing now with his arm round her waist so that it was not easy for him to look into her face  i am a fool he said  yesyou are but i dont love you the less on that account  i will never doubt it again  nodo not and for me i will not say another word whether you choose to heave coals or not you shall do as you please i meant to be very wisei did indeed  you are the grandest girl that ever was made  i do not want to be grand at all and i never will be wise any more only do not frown at me and look savage then she put up her hand to smooth his brow i am half afraid of you still you know there that will do now let me go that i may tell my aunt during the last two months she has been full of pity for poor lord chiltern  it has been poor lord chiltern with a vengeance said he  but now that we have made it up she will be horrified again at all your wickednesses you have been a turtle dove latelynow you will be an ogre again but oswald you must not be an ogre to me  as soon as she could get quit of her lover she did tell her tale to lady baldock you have accepted him again said her aunt holding up her hands yesi have accepted him again replied violet then the responsibility must be on your own shoulders said her aunt i wash my hands of it that evening when she discussed the matter with her daughter lady baldock spoke of violet and lord chiltern as though their intended marriage were the one thing in the world which she most deplored     chapter lxxiv  the beginning of the end   the day of the debate had come and phineas finn was still sitting in his room at the colonial office but his resignation had been sent in and accepted and he was simply awaiting the coming of his successor about noon his successor came and he had the gratification of resigning his armchair to mr bonteen it is generally understood that gentlemen leaving offices give up either seals or a portfolio phineas had been put in possession of no seal and no portfolio but there was in the room which he had occupied a special armchair and this with much regret he surrendered to the use and comfort of mr bonteen there was a glance of triumph in his enemys eyes and an exultation in the tone of his enemys voice which were very bitter to him so you are really going said mr bonteen well i dare say it is all very proper i dont quite understand the thing myself but i have no doubt you are right it isnt easy to understand is it said phineas trying to laugh but mr bonteen did not feel the intended satire and poor phineas found it useless to attempt to punish the man he hated he left him as quickly as he could and went to say a few words of farewell to his late chief  goodbye finn said lord cantrip it is a great trouble to me that we should have to part in this way  and to me also my lord i wish it could have been avoided  you should not have gone to ireland with so dangerous a man as mr monk but it is too late to think of that now  the milk is spilt is it not  but these terrible rendings asunder never last very long said lord cantrip unless a man changes his opinions altogether how many quarrels and how many reconciliations we have lived to see i remember when gresham went out of office because he could not sit in the same room with mr mildmay and yet they became the fastest of political friends there was a time when plinlimmon and the duke could not stable their horses together at all and dont you remember when palliser was obliged to give up his hopes of office because he had some bee in his bonnet i think however that the bee in mr pallisers bonnet to which lord cantrip was alluding made its buzzing audible on some subject that was not exactly political we shall have you back again before long i dont doubt men who can really do their work are too rare to be left long in the comfort of the benches below the gangway this was very kindly said and phineas was flattered and comforted he could not however make lord cantrip understand the whole truth for him the dream of a life of politics was over for ever he had tried it and had succeeded beyond his utmost hopes but in spite of his success the ground had crumbled to pieces beneath his feet and he knew that he could never recover the niche in the worlds gallery which he was now leaving  that same afternoon he met mr gresham in one of the passages leading to the house and the prime minister put his arm through that of our hero as they walked together into the lobby i am sorry that we are losing you said mr gresham  you may be sure that i am sorry to be so lost said phineas  these things will occur in political life said the leader but i think that they seldom leave rancour behind them when the purpose is declared and when the subject of disagreement is marked and understood the defalcation which creates angry feeling is that which has to be endured without previous warningwhen a man votes against his partyor a set of men from private pique or from some cause which is never clear phineas when he heard this knew well how terribly this very man had been harassed and driven nearly wild by defalcation exactly of that nature which he was attempting to describe no doubt you and mr monk think you are right continued mr gresham  we have given strong evidence that we think so said phineas we give up our places and we are both of us very poor men  i think you are wrong you know not so much in your views on the question itselfwhich to tell the truth i hardly understand as yet  we will endeavour to explain them  and will do so very clearly no doubt but i think that mr monk was wrong in desiring as a member of a government to force a measure which whether good or bad the government as a body does not desire to initiateat any rate just now  and therefore he resigned said phineas  of course but it seems to me that he failed to comprehend the only way in which a great party can act together if it is to do any service in this country dont for a moment think that i am blaming him or you  i am nobody in this matter said phineas  i can assure you mr finn that we have not regarded you in that light and i hope that the time may come when we may be sitting together again on the same bench  neither on the treasury bench nor on any other in that house was he to sit again after this fashion that was the trouble which was crushing his spirit at this moment and not the loss of his office he knew that he could not venture to think of remaining in london as a member of parliament with no other income than that which his father could allow him even if he could again secure a seat in parliament when he had first been returned for loughshane he had assured his friends that his duty as a member of the house of commons would not be a bar to his practice in the courts he had now been five years a member and had never once made an attempt at doing any part of a barristers work he had gone altogether into a different line of life and had been most successfulso successful that men told him and women more frequently than men that his career had been a miracle of success but there had been as he had well known from the first this drawback in the new profession which he had chosen that nothing in it could be permanent they who succeed in it may probably succeed again but then the success is intermittent and there may be years of hard work in opposition to which unfortunately no pay is assigned it is almost imperative as he now found that they who devote themselves to such a profession should be men of fortune when he had commenced his workat the period of his first return for loughshanehe had had no thought of mending his deficiency in this respect by a rich marriage nor had it ever occurred to him that he would seek a marriage for that purpose such an idea would have been thoroughly distasteful to him there had been no stain of premeditated mercenary arrangement upon him at any time but circumstances had so fallen out with him that as he won his spurs in parliament as he became known and was placed first in one office and then in another prospects of love and money together were opened to him and he ventured on leaving mr low and the law behind himbecause these prospects were so alluring then had come mr monk and mary flood jonesand everything around him had collapsed  everything around him had collapsedwith however a terrible temptation to him to inflate his sails again at the cost of his truth and his honour the temptation would have affected him not at all had madame goesler been ugly stupid or personally disagreeable but she was he thought the most beautiful woman he had ever seen the most witty and in many respects the most charming she had offered to give him everything that she had so to place him in the world that opposition would be more pleasant to him than office to supply every want and had done so in a manner that had gratified all his vanity but he had refused it all because he was bound to the girl at floodborough my readers will probably say that he was not a true man unless he could do this without a regret when phineas thought of it all there were many regrets  but there was at the same time a resolve on his part that if any man had ever loved the girl he promised to love he would love mary flood jones a thousand times he had told himself that she had not the spirit of lady laura or the bright wit of violet effingham or the beauty of madame goesler but mary had charms of her own that were more valuable than them all was there one among the three who had trusted him as she trusted himor loved him with the same satisfied devotion there were regrets regrets that were heavy on his heartfor london and parliament and the clubs and downing street had become dear to him he liked to think of himself as he rode in the park and was greeted by all those whose greeting was the most worth having there were regretssad regrets but the girl whom he loved better than the parks and the clubsbetter even than westminster and downing street should never know that they had existed  these thoughts were running through his mind even while he was listening to mr monk as he propounded his theory of doing justice to ireland this might probably be the last great debate in which phineas would be able to take a part and he was determined that he would do his best in it he did not intend to speak on this day if as was generally supposed the house would be adjourned before a division could be obtained but he would remain on the alert and see how the thing went he had come to understand the forms of the place and was as welltrained a young member of parliament as any there he had been quick at learning a lesson that is not easily learned and knew how things were going and what were the proper moments for this question or that form of motion he could anticipate a countout understood the tone of mens minds and could read the gestures of the house it was very little likely that the debate should be over tonight he knew that and as the present time was the evening of tuesday he resolved at once that he would speak as early as he could on the following thursday what a pity it was that with one who had learned so much all his learning should be in vain  at about two oclock he himself succeeded in moving the adjournment of the debate this he did from a seat below the gangway to which he had removed himself from the treasury bench then the house was up and he walked home with mr monk mr monk since he had been told positively by phineas that he had resolved upon resigning his office had said nothing more of his sorrow at his friends resolve but had used him as one political friend uses another telling him all his thoughts and all his hopes as to this new measure of his and taking counsel with him as to the way in which the fight should be fought together they had counted over the list of members marking these men as supporters those as opponents and another set now more important than either as being doubtful from day to day those who had been written down as doubtful were struck off that third list and put in either the one or the other of those who were either supporters or opponents and their different modes of argument were settled between these two allied orators how one should take this line and the other that to mr monk this was very pleasant he was quite assured now that opposition was more congenial to his spirit and more fitting for him than office there was no doubt to him as to his future sitting in parliament let the result of this contest be what it might the work which he was now doing was the work for which he had been training himself all his life while he had been forced to attend cabinet councils from week to week he had been depressed now he was exultant phineas seeing and understanding all this said but little to his friend of his own prospects as long as this pleasant battle was raging he could fight in it shoulder to shoulder with the man he loved after that there would be a blank  i do not see how we are to fail to have a majority after daubenys speech tonight said mr monk as they walked together down parliament street through the bright moonlight  he expressly said that he only spoke for himself said phineas  but we know what that means he is bidding for office and of course those who want office with him will vote as he votes we have already counted those who would go into office but they will not carry the whole party  it will carry enough of them  there are forty or fifty men on his side of the house and as many perhaps on ours said mr monk who have no idea of any kind on any bill and who simply follow the bell whether into this lobby or that argument never touches them they do not even look to the result of a division on their own interests as the making of any calculation would be laborious to them their party leader is to them a pope whom they do not dream of doubting i never can quite make up my mind whether it is good or bad that there should be such men in parliament  men who think much want to speak often said phineas  exactly soand of speaking members god knows that we have enough and i suppose that these purblind sheep do have some occult weight that is salutary they enable a leader to be a leader and even in that way they are useful we shall get a division on thursday  i understand that gresham has consented to that  so ratler told me palliser is to speak and barrington erle and they say that robson is going to make an onslaught specially on me we shall get it over by one oclock  and if we beat them asked phineas  it will depend on the numbers everybody who has spoken to me about it seems to think that they will dissolve if there be a respectable majority against them  of course he will dissolve said phineas speaking of mr gresham what else can he do  he is very anxious to carry his irish reform bill first if he can do so goodnight phineas i shall not be down tomorrow as there is nothing to be done come to me on thursday and we will go to the house together  on the wednesday phineas was engaged to dine with mr low there was a dinner party in bedford square and phineas met halfadozen barristers and their wivesmen to whom he had looked up as successful pundits in the law some five or six years ago but who since that time had almost learned to look up to him and now they treated him with that courteousness of manner which success in life always begets there was a judge there who was very civil to him and the judges wife whom he had taken down to dinner was very gracious to him the judge had got his prize in life and was therefore personally indifferent to the fate of ministers but the judges wife had a brother who wanted a county court from lord de terrier and it was known that phineas was giving valuable assistance towards the attainment of this object i do think that you and mr monk are so right said the judges wife phineas who understood how it came to pass that the judges wife should so cordially approve his conduct could not help thinking how grand a thing it would be for him to have a county court for himself  when the guests were gone he was left alone with mr and mrs low and remained awhile with them there having been an understanding that they should have a last chat together over the affairs of our hero do you really mean that you will not stand again asked mrs low  i do mean it i may say that i cannot do so my father is hardly so well able to help me as he was when i began this game and i certainly shall not ask him for money to support a canvass  its a thousand pities said mrs low  i really had begun to think that you would make it answer said mr low  in one way i have made it answer for the last three years i have lived upon what i have earned and i am not in debt but now i must begin the world again i am afraid i shall find the drudgery very hard  it is hard no doubt said the barrister who had gone through it all and was now reaping the fruits of it but i suppose you have not forgotten what you learned  who can say i dare say i have but i did not mean the drudgery of learning so much as the drudgery of looking after workof expecting briefs which perhaps will never come i am thirty years old now you know  are you indeed said mrs lowwho knew his age to a day how the time passes im sure i hope youll get on mr finn i do indeed  i am sure he will if he puts his shoulder to it said mr low  neither the lawyer nor his wife repeated any of those sententious admonitions which had almost become rebukes and which had been so common in their mouths the fall with which they had threatened phineas finn had come upon him and they were too generous to remind him of their wisdom and sagacity indeed when he got up to take his leave mrs low who probably might not see him again for years was quite affectionate in her manners to him and looked as if she were almost minded to kiss him as she pressed his hand we will come and see you she said when you are master of the rolls in dublin  we shall see him before then thundering at us poor tories in the house said mr low he will be back again sooner or later and so they parted     chapter lxxv  p p c   on the thursday morning before phineas went to mr monk a gentleman called upon him at his lodgings phineas requested the servant to bring up the gentlemans name but tempted perhaps by a shilling the girl brought up the gentleman instead it was mr quintus slide from the office of the banner of the people  mr finn said quintus with his hand extended i have come to offer you the calumet of peace phineas certainly desired no such calumet but to refuse a mans hand is to declare active war after a fashion which men do not like to adopt except on deliberation he had never cared a straw for the abuse which mr slide had poured upon him and now he gave his hand to the man of letters but he did not sit down nor did he offer a seat to mr slide i know that as a man of sense who knows the world you will accept the calumet of peace continued mr slide  i dont know why i should be asked particularly to accept war or peace said phineas  well mr finni dont often quote the bible but those who are not for us must be against us you will agree to that now that youve freed yourself from the iniquities of that sink of abomination in downing street i look upon you as a man again  upon my word you are very kind  as a man and also a brother i suppose you know that ive got the banner into my own ands now phineas was obliged to explain that he had not hitherto been made acquainted with this great literary and political secret oh dear yes altogether so weve got rid of old rusty as i used to call him he wouldnt go the pace and so we stripped him hes doing the west of england art journal now and he angs out down at bristol  i hope hell succeed mr slide  hell earn his wages hes a man who will always earn his wages but nothing more well now mr finn i will just offer you one word of apology for our little severities  pray do nothing of the kind  indeed i shall dooty is dooty there was some things printed which were a little rough but if one isnt a little rough there aint no flavour of course i wrote em you know my and i dare say  i only remember that there was some throwing of mud  just so but mud dont break any bones does it when you turned against us i had to be down on you and i was down upon youthats just about all of it now youre coming among us again and so i come to you with a calumet of peace  but i am not coming among you  yes you are finn and bringing monk with you it was now becoming very disagreeable and phineas was beginning to perceive that it would soon be his turn to say something rough now ill tell you what my proposition is if youll do us two leaders a week through the session you shall have a cheque for ¬£16 on the last day of every month if thats not honester money than what you got in downing street my name is not quintus slide  mr slide said phineasand then he paused  if we are to come to business drop the mister it makes things go so much easier  we are not to come to business and i do not want things to go easy i believe you said some things of me in your newspaper that were very scurrilous  what of that if you mind that sort of thing  i did not regard it in the least you are quite welcome to continue it i dont doubt but you will continue it but you are not welcome to come here afterwards  do you mean to turn me out  just that you printed a heap of lies  lies mr finn did you say lies sir  i said lieslieslies and phineas walked over at him as though he were going to pitch him instantly out of the window you may go and write as many more as you like it is your trade and you must do it or starve but do not come to me again then he opened the door and stood with it in his hand  very well sir i shall know how to punish this  exactly but if you please youll go and do your punishment at the office of the bannerunless you like to try it here you want to kick me and spit at me but you will prefer to do it in print  yes sir said quintus slide i shall prefer to do it in printthough i must own that the temptation to adopt the manual violence of a ruffian is great very great very great indeed but he resisted the temptation and walked down the stairs concocting his article as he went  mr quintus slide did not so much impede the business of his day but what phineas was with mr monk by two and in his place in the house when prayers were read at four as he sat in his place conscious of the work that was before him listening to the presentation of petitions and to the formal reading of certain notices of motions which with the asking of sundry questions occupied over half an hour he looked back and remembered accurately his own feelings on a certain night on which he had intended to get up and address the house the ordeal before him had then been so terrible that it had almost obliterated for the moment his senses of hearing and of sight he had hardly been able to perceive what had been going on around him and had vainly endeavoured to occupy himself in recalling to his memory the words which he wished to pronounce when the time for pronouncing them had come he had found himself unable to stand upon his legs he smiled as he recalled all this in his memory waiting impatiently for the moment in which he might rise his audience was assured to him now and he did not fear it his opportunity for utterance was his own and even the speaker could not deprive him of it during these minutes he thought not at all of the words that he was to say he had prepared his matter but had prepared no words he knew that words would come readily enough to him and that he had learned the task of turning his thoughts quickly into language while standing with a crowd of listeners around himas a practised writer does when seated in his chair there was no violent beating at his heart now no dimness of the eyes no feeling that the ground was turning round under his feet if only those weary vain questions would get themselves all asked so that he might rise and begin the work of the night then there came the last thought as the house was hushed for his rising what was the good of it all when he would never have an opportunity of speaking there again  but not on that account would he be slack in his endeavour now he would be listened to once at least not as a subaltern of the government but as the owner of a voice prominent in opposition to the government he had been taught by mr monk that that was the one place in the house in which a man with a power of speaking could really enjoy pleasure without alloy he would make the trialonce if never again things had so gone with him that the rostrum was his own and a house crammed to overflowing was there to listen to him he had given up his place in order that he might be able to speak his mind and had become aware that many intended to listen to him while he spoke he had observed that the rows of strangers were thick in the galleries that peers were standing in the passages and that over the reporters head the ribbons of many ladies were to be seen through the bars of their cage yesfor this once he would have an audience  he spoke for about an hour and while he was speaking he knew nothing about himself whether he was doing it well or ill something of himself he did say soon after he had commencednot quite beginning with it as though his mind had been laden with the matter he had he said found himself compelled to renounce his happy allegiance to the first lord of the treasury and to quit the pleasant company in which humble as had been his place he had been allowed to sit and act by his unfortunate conviction in this great subject he had been told he said that it was a misfortune in itself for one so young as he to have convictions but his irish birth and irish connection had brought this misfortune of his country so closely home to him that he had found the task of extricating himself from it to be impossible of what further he said speaking on that terribly unintelligible subject a tenantright proposed for irish farmers no english reader will desire to know much irish subjects in the house of commons are interesting or are dull are debated before a crowded audience composed of all who are leaders in the great world of london or before empty benches in accordance with the importance of the moment and the character of the debate for us now it is enough to know that to our hero was accorded that attention which orators lovewhich will almost make an orator if it can be assured a full house with a promise of big type on the next morning would wake to eloquence the propounder of a canadian grievance or the mover of an indian budget  phineas did not stir out of the house till the division was over having agreed with mr monk that they two would remain through it all and hear everything that was to be said mr gresham had already spoken and to mr palliser was confided the task of winding up the argument for the government mr robson spoke also greatly enlivening the tedium of the evening and to mr monk was permitted the privilege of a final reply at two oclock the division came and the ministry were beaten by a majority of twentythree and now said mr monk as he again walked home with phineas the pity is that we are not a bit nearer tenantright than we were before  but we are nearer to it  in one sense yes such a debate and such a majority will make men think but nothink is too high a word as a rule men dont think but it will make them believe that there is something in it many who before regarded legislation on the subject as chimerical will now fancy that it is only dangerous or perhaps not more than difficult and so in time it will come to be looked on as among the things possible then among the things probableand so at last it will be ranged in the list of those few measures which the country requires as being absolutely needed that is the way in which public opinion is made  it is no loss of time said phineas to have taken the first great step in making it  the first great step was taken long ago said mr monktaken by men who were looked upon as revolutionary demagogues almost as traitors because they took it but it is a great thing to take any step that leads us onwards  two days after this mr gresham declared his intention of dissolving the house because of the adverse division which had been produced by mr monks motion but expressed a wish to be allowed to carry an irish reform bill through parliament before he did so he explained how expedient this would be but declared at the same time that if any strong opposition were made he would abandon the project his intention simply was to pass with regard to ireland a measure which must be passed soon and which ought to be passed before a new election took place the bill was ready and should be read for the first time on the next night if the house were willing the house was willing though there were very many recalcitrant irish members the irish members made loud opposition and then twitted mr gresham with his promise that he would not go on with his bill if opposition were made but nevertheless he did go on and the measure was hurried through the two houses in a week our hero who still sat for loughshane but who was never to sit for loughshane again gave what assistance he could to the government and voted for the measure which deprived loughshane for ever of its parliamentary honours  and very dirty conduct i think it was said lord tulla when he discussed the subject with his agent after being put in for the borough twice almost free of expense it was very dirty it never occurred to lord tulla that a member of parliament might feel himself obliged to vote on such a subject in accordance with his judgment  this irish reform bill was scrambled through the two houses and then the session was over the session was over and they who knew anything of the private concerns of mr phineas finn were aware that he was about to return to ireland and did not intend to reappear on the scene which had known him so well for the last five years i cannot tell you how sad it makes me said mr monk  and it makes me sad too said phineas i try to shake off the melancholy and tell myself from day to day that it is unmanly but it gets the better of me just at present  i feel quite certain that you will come back among us again said mr monk  everybody tells me so and yet i feel quite certain that i shall never come backnever come back with a seat in parliament as my old tutor low has told me scores of times i began at the wrong end here i am thirty years of age and i have not a shilling in the world and i do not know how to earn one  only for me you would still be receiving ever so much a year and all would be pleasant said mr monk  but how long would it have lasted the first moment that daubeny got the upper hand i should have fallen lower than i have fallen now if not this year it would have been the next my only comfort is in thisthat i have done the thing myself and have not been turned out to the very last however mr monk continued to express his opinion that phineas would come back declaring that he had known no instance of a young man who had made himself useful in parliament and then had been allowed to leave it in early life  among those of whom he was bound to take a special leave the members of the family of lord brentford were of course the foremost he had already heard of the reconciliation of miss effingham and lord chiltern and was anxious to offer his congratulation to both of them and it was essential to him that he should see lady laura to her he wrote a line saying how much he hoped that he should be able to bid her adieu and a time was fixed for his coming at which she knew that she would meet him alone but as chance ruled it he came upon the two lovers together and then remembered that he had hardly ever before been in the same room with both of them at the same time  oh mr finn what a beautiful speech you made i read every word of it said violet  and i didnt even look at it old fellow said chiltern getting up and putting his arm on the others shoulder in a way that was common with him when he was quite intimate with the friend near him  laura went down and heard it said violet i could not do that because i was tied to my aunt you cant conceive how dutiful i am during this last month  and is it to be in a month chiltern said phineas  she says so she arranges everythingin concert with my father when i threw up the sponge i simply asked for a long day a long day my lord i said but my father and violet between them refused me any mercy  you do not believe him said violet  not a word if i did he would want to see me on the coast of flanders again i dont doubt i have come to congratulate you both  thank you mr finn said violet taking his hand with hearty kindness i should not have been quite happy without one nice word from you  i shall try and make the best of it said chiltern but i say youll come over and ride bonebreaker again hes down there at the bull and ive taken a little box close by i cant stand the governors county for hunting  and will your wife go down to willingford  of course she will and ride to hounds a great deal closer than i can ever do mind you come and if theres anything in the stable fit to carry you you shall have it  then phineas had to explain that he had come to bid them farewell and that it was not at all probable that he should ever be able to see willingford again in the hunting season i dont suppose that i shall make either of you quite understand it but i have got to begin again the chances are that i shall never see another foxhound all my life  not in ireland exclaimed lord chiltern  not unless i should have to examine one as a witness i have nothing before me but downright hard work and a great deal of that must be done before i can hope to earn a shilling  but you are so clever said violet of course it will come quickly  i do not mean to be impatient about it nor yet unhappy said phineas only hunting wont be much in my line  and will you leave london altogether violet asked  altogether i shall stick to one clubbrookss but i shall take my name off all the others  what a deuce of a nuisance said lord chiltern  i have no doubt you will be very happy said violet and youll be a lord chancellor in no time but you wont go quite yet  next sunday  you will return you must be here for our weddingindeed you must i will not be married unless you do  even this however was impossible he must go on sunday and must return no more then he made his little farewell speech which he could not deliver without some awkward stuttering he would think of her on the day of her marriage and pray that she might be happy and he would send her a little trifle before he went which he hoped she would wear in remembrance of their old friendship  she shall wear it whatever it is or ill know the reason why said chiltern  hold your tongue you rough bear said violet of course ill wear it and of course ill think of the giver i shall have many presents but few that i will think of so much then phineas left the room with his throat so full that he could not speak another word  he is still brokenhearted about you said the favoured lover as soon as his rival had left the room  it is not that said violet he is brokenhearted about everything the whole world is vanishing away from him i wish he could have made up his mind to marry that german woman with all the money it must be understood however that phineas had never spoken a word to any one as to the offer which the german woman had made to him  it was on the morning of the sunday on which he was to leave london that he saw lady laura he had asked that it might be so in order that he might then have nothing more upon his mind he found her quite alone and he could see by her eyes that she had been weeping as he looked at her remembering that it was not yet six years since he had first been allowed to enter that room he could not but perceive how very much she was altered in appearance then she had been threeandtwenty and had not looked to be a day older now she might have been taken to be nearly forty so much had her troubles preyed upon her spirit and eaten into the vitality of her youth so you have come to say goodbye she said smiling as she rose to meet him  yes lady laurato say goodbye not for ever i hope but probably for long  no not for ever at any rate we will not think so then she paused but he was silent sitting with his hat dangling in his two hands and his eyes fixed upon the floor do you know mr finn she continued that sometimes i am very angry with myself about you  then it must be because you have been too kind to me  it is because i fear that i have done much to injure you from the first day that i knew youdo you remember when we were talking here in this very room about the beginning of the reform billfrom that day i wished that you should come among us and be one of us  i have been with you to my infinite satisfactionwhile it lasted  but it has not lasted and now i fear that it has done you harm  who can say whether it has been for good or evil but of this i am sure you will be certainthat i am very grateful to you for all the goodness you have shown me then again he was silent  she did not know what it was that she wanted but she did desire some expression from his lips that should be warmer than an expression of gratitude an expression of loveof existing loveshe would have felt to be an insult and would have treated it as such indeed she knew that from him no such insult could come but she was in that morbid melancholy state of mind which requires the excitement of more than ordinary sympathy even though that sympathy be all painful and i think that she would have been pleased had he referred to the passion for herself which he had once expressed if he would have spoken of his love and of her mistake and have made some halfsuggestion as to what might have been their lives had things gone differentlythough she would have rebuked him even for thatstill it would have comforted her but at this moment though he remembered much that had passed between them he was not even thinking of the braes of linter all that had taken place four years agoand there had been so many other things since which had moved him even more than that you have heard what i have arranged for myself she said at last  your father has told me that you are going to dresden  yeshe will accompany mecoming home of course for parliament it is a sad breakup is it not but the lawyer says that if i remain here i may be subject to very disagreeable attempts from mr kennedy to force me to go back again it is odd is it not that he should not understand how impossible it is  he means to do his duty  i believe so but he becomes more stern every day to those who are with him and then why should i remain here what is there to tempt me as a woman separated from her husband i cannot take an interest in those things which used to charm me i feel that i am crushed and quelled by my position even though there is no disgrace in it  no disgrace certainly said phineas  but i am nobodyor worse than nobody  and i also am going to be a nobody said phineas laughing  ah you are a man and will get over it and you have many years before you will begin to be growing old i am growing old already yes i am i feel it and know it and see it a woman has a fine game to play but then she is so easily bowled out and the term allowed to her is so short  a mans allowance of time may be short too said phineas  but he can try his hand again then there was another pause i had thought mr finn that you would have married she said in her very lowest voice  you knew all my hopes and fears about that  i mean that you would have married madame goesler  what made you think that lady laura  because i saw that she liked you and because such a marriage would have been so suitable she has all that you want you know what they say of her now  what do they say  that the duke of omnium offered to make her his wife and that she refused him for your sake  there is nothing that people wont saynothing on earth said phineas then he got up and took his leave of her he also wanted to part from her with some special expression of affection but he did not know how to choose his words he had wished that some allusion should be made not to the braes of linter but to the close confidence which had so long existed between them but he found that the language to do this properly was wanting to him had the opportunity arisen he would have told her now the whole story of mary flood jones but the opportunity did not come and he left her never having mentioned the name of his mary or having hinted at his engagement to any one of his friends in london it is better so he said to himself my life in ireland is to be a new life and why should i mix two things together that will be so different  he was to dine at his lodgings and then leave them for good at eight oclock he had packed up everything before he went to portman square and he returned home only just in time to sit down to his solitary mutton chop but as he sat down he saw a small note addressed to himself lying on the table among the crowd of books letters and papers of which he had still to make disposal it was a very small note in an envelope of a peculiar tint of pink and he knew the handwriting well the blood mounted all over his face as he took it up and he hesitated for a moment before he opened it it could not be that the offer should be repeated to him slowly hardly venturing at first to look at the enclosure he opened it and the words which it contained were as follows      i learn that you are going today and i write a word    which you will receive just as you are departing it is to    say merely thisthat when i left you the other day i was    angry not with you but with myself let me wish you all    good wishes and that prosperity which i know you will    deserve and which i think you will win     yours very truly     m m g     sunday morning   should he put off his journey and go to her this very evening and claim her as his friend the question was asked and answered in a moment of course he would not go to her were he to do so there would be only one possible word for him to say and that word should certainly never be spoken but he wrote to her a reply shorter even than her own short note      thanks dear friend i do not doubt but that you and i    understand each other thoroughly and that each trusts the    other for good wishes and honest intentions     always yours     p f     i write these as i am starting   when he had written this he kept it till the last moment in his hand thinking that he would not send it but as he slipped into the cab he gave the note to his late landlady to post  at the station bunce came to him to say a word of farewell and mrs bunce was on his arm  well done mr finn well done said bunce i always knew there was a good drop in you  you always told me i should ruin myself in parliament and so i have said phineas  not at all it takes a deal to ruin a man if hes got the right sperrit ive better hopes of you now than ever i had in the old days when you used to be looking out for government placeand mr monk has tried that too i thought he would find the iron too heavy for him god bless you mr finn said mrs bunce with her handkerchief up to her eyes theres not one of em i ever had as lodgers ive cared about half as much as i did for you then they shook hands with him through the window and the train was off     chapter lxxvi  conclusion   we are told that it is a bitter moment with the lord mayor when he leaves the mansion house and becomes once more alderman jones of no 75 bucklersbury lord chancellors going out of office have a great fall though they take pensions with them for their consolation and the president of the united states when he leaves the glory of the white house and once more becomes a simple citizen must feel the change severely but our hero phineas finn as he turned his back upon the scene of his many successes and prepared himself for permanent residence in his own country was i think in a worse plight than any of the reduced divinities to whom i have alluded they at any rate had known that their fall would come he like icarus had flown up towards the sun hoping that his wings of wax would bear him steadily aloft among the gods seeing that his wings were wings of wax we must acknowledge that they were very good but the celestial lights had been too strong for them and now having lived for five years with lords and countesses with ministers and orators with beautiful women and men of fashion he must start again in a little lodging in dublin and hope that the attorneys of that litigious city might be good to him on his journey home he made but one resolution he would make the change or attempt to make it with manly strength during his last month in london he had allowed himself to be sad depressed and melancholy there should be an end of all that now nobody at home should see that he was depressed and mary his own mary should at any rate have no cause to think that her love and his own engagement had ever been the cause to him of depression did he not value her love more than anything in the world a thousand times he told himself that he did  she was there in the old house at killaloe to greet him her engagement was an affair known to all the county and she had no idea that it would become her to be coy in her love she was in his arms before he had spoken to his father and mother and had made her little speech to himvery inaudibly indeedwhile he was covering her sweet face with kisses oh phineas i am so proud of you and i think you are so right and i am so glad you have done it again he covered her face with kisses could he ever have had such satisfaction as this had he allowed madame goeslers hand to remain in his  on the first night of his arrival he sat for an hour downstairs with his father talking over his plans he felthe could not but feelthat he was not the hero now that he had been when he was last at killaloewhen he had come thither with a cabinet minister under his wing and yet his father did his best to prevent the growth of any such feeling the old doctor was not quite as well off as he had been when phineas first started with his high hopes for london since that day he had abandoned his profession and was now living on the fruits of his lifes labour for the last two years he had been absolved from the necessity of providing an income for his son and had probably allowed himself to feel that no such demand upon him would again be made now however it was necessary that he should do so could his son manage to live on two hundred ayear there would then be four hundred ayear left for the wants of the family at home phineas swore that he could fight his battle on a hundred and fifty and they ended the argument by splitting the difference he had been paying exactly the same sum of money for the rooms he had just left in london but then while he held those rooms his income had been two thousand ayear tenantright was a very fine thing but could it be worth such a fall as this  and about dear mary said the father  i hope it may not be very long said phineas  i have not spoken to her about it but your mother says that mrs flood jones is very averse to a long engagement  what can i do she would not wish me to marry her daughter with no other income than an allowance made by you  your mother says that she has some idea that you and she might live togetherthat if they let floodborough you might take a small house in dublin remember phineas i am not proposing it myself  then phineas bethought himself that he was not even yet so low in the world that he need submit himself to terms dictated to him by mrs flood jones i am glad that you do not propose it sir  why so phineas  because i should have been obliged to oppose the plan even if it had come from you mothersinlaw are never a comfort in a house  i never tried it myself said the doctor  and i never will try it i am quite sure that mary does not expect any such thing and that she is willing to wait if i can shorten the term of waiting by hard work i will do so the decision to which phineas had come on this matter was probably made known to mrs flood jones after some mild fashion by old mrs finn nothing more was said to phineas about a joint household but he was quite able to perceive from the manner of the lady towards him that his proposed motherinlaw wished him to understand that he was treating her daughter very badly what did it signify none of them knew the story of madame goesler and of course none of them would know it none of them would ever hear how well he had behaved to his little mary  but mary did know it all before he left her to go up to dublin the two lovers allowed themselvesor were allowed by their elders one week of exquisite bliss together and during this week phineas told her i think everything he told her everything as far as he could do so without seeming to boast of his own successes how is a man not to tell such tales when he has on his arm close to him a girl who tells him her little everything of life and only asks for his confidence in return and then his secrets are so precious to her and so sacred that he feels as sure of her fidelity as though she were a very goddess of faith and trust and the temptation to tell is so great for all that he has to tell she loves him the better and still the better a man desires to win a virgin heart and is happy to knowor at least to believethat he has won it with a woman every former rival is an added victim to the wheels of the triumphant chariot in which she is sitting all these has he known and loved culling sweets from each of them but now he has come to me and i am the sweetest of them all and so mary was taught to believe of laura and of violet and of madame goeslerthat though they had had charms to please her lover had never been so charmed as he was now while she was hanging to his breast and i think that she was right in her belief during those lovely summer evening walks along the shores of lough derg phineas was as happy as he had ever been at any moment of his life  i shall never be impatientnever she said to him on the last evening all i want is that you should write to me  i shall want more than that mary  then you must come down and see me when you do come they will be happy happy days for me but of course we cannot be married for the next twenty years  say forty mary  i will say anything that you likeyou will know what i mean just as well and phineas i must tell you one thingthough it makes me sad to think of it and will make me sad to speak of it  i will not have you sad on our last night mary  i must say it i am beginning to understand how much you have given up for me  i have given up nothing for you  if i had not been at killaloe when mr monk was here and if we had nothad notoh dear if i had not loved you so very much you might have remained in london and that lady would have been your wife  never said phineas stoutly  would she not she must not be your wife now phineas i am not going to pretend that i will give you up  that is unkind mary  oh well you may say what you please if that is unkind i am unkind it would kill me to lose you  had he done right how could there be a doubt about it how could there be a question about it which of them had loved him or was capable of loving him as mary loved him what girl was ever so sweet so gracious so angelic as his own mary he swore to her that he was prouder of winning her than of anything he had ever done in all his life and that of all the treasures that had ever come in his way she was the most precious she went to bed that night the happiest girl in all connaught although when she parted from him she understood that she was not to see him again till christmaseve  but she did see him again before the summer was over and the manner of their meeting was in this wise immediately after the passing of that scrambled irish reform bill parliament as the reader knows was dissolved this was in the early days of june and before the end of july the new members were again assembled at westminster this session late in summer was very terrible but it was not very long and then it was essentially necessary there was something of the years business which must yet be done and the country would require to know who were to be the ministers of the government it is not needed that the reader should be troubled any further with the strategy of one political leader or of another or that more should be said of mr monk and his tenantright the house of commons had offended mr gresham by voting in a majority against him and mr gresham had punished the house of commons by subjecting it to the expense and nuisance of a new election all this is constitutional and rational enough to englishmen though it may be unintelligible to strangers the upshot on the present occasion was that the ministers remained in their places and that mr monks bill though it had received the substantial honour of a second reading passed away for the present into the limbo of abortive legislation  all this would not concern us at all nor our poor hero much were it not that the great men with whom he had been for two years so pleasant a colleague remembered him with something of affectionate regret whether it began with mr gresham or with lord cantrip i will not sayor whether mr monk though now a political enemy may have said a word that brought about the good deed be that as it may just before the summer session was brought to a close phineas received the following letter from lord cantrip      downing street august 4 186     my dear mr finn     mr gresham has been talking to me and we both think    that possibly a permanent government appointment may be    acceptable to you we have no doubt that should this be    the case your services would be very valuable to the    country there is a vacancy for a poorlaw inspector at    present in ireland whose residence i believe should be    in cork the salary is a thousand ayear should the    appointment suit you mr gresham will be most happy to    nominate you to the office let me have a line at your    early convenience     believe me     most sincerely yours     cantrip   he received the letter one morning in dublin and within three hours he was on his route to killaloe of course he would accept the appointment but he would not even do that without telling mary of his new prospect of course he would accept the appointment though he had been as yet barely two months in dublin though he had hardly been long enough settled to his work to have hoped to be able to see in which way there might be a vista open leading to success still he had fancied that he had seen that success was impossible he did not know how to beginand men were afraid of him thinking that he was unsteady arrogant and prone to failure he had not seen his way to the possibility of a guinea  a thousand ayear said mary flood jones opening her eyes wide with wonder at the golden future before them  it is nothing very great for a perpetuity said phineas  oh phineas surely a thousand ayear will be very nice  it will be certain said phineas and then we can be married tomorrow  but i have been making up my mind to wait ever so long said mary  then your mind must be unmade said phineas  what was the nature of the reply to lord cantrip the reader may imagine and thus we will leave our hero an inspector of poor houses in the county of cork
