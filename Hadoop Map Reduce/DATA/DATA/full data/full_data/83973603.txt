83973603	de profundis      suffering is one very long moment  we cannot divide it by seasons we can only record its moods and chronicle their return  with us time itself does not progress  it revolves  it seems to circle round one centre of pain  the paralysing immobility of a life every circumstance of which is regulated after an unchangeable pattern so that we eat and drink and lie down and pray or kneel at least for prayer according to the inflexible laws of an iron formula this immobile quality that makes each dreadful day in the very minutest detail like its brother seems to communicate itself to those external forces the very essence of whose existence is ceaseless change  of seedtime or harvest of the reapers bending over the corn or the grape gatherers threading through the vines of the grass in the orchard made white with broken blossoms or strewn with fallen fruit of these we know nothing and can know nothing  for us there is only one season the season of sorrow  the very sun and moon seem taken from us  outside the day may be blue and gold but the light that creeps down through the thicklymuffled glass of the small ironbarred window beneath which one sits is grey and niggard  it is always twilight in ones cell as it is always twilight in ones heart and in the sphere of thought no less than in the sphere of time motion is no more  the thing that you personally have long ago forgotten or can easily forget is happening to me now and will happen to me again to morrow  remember this and you will be able to understand a little of why i am writing and in this manner writing     a week later i am transferred here  three more months go over and my mother dies  no one knew how deeply i loved and honoured her  her death was terrible to me but i once a lord of language have no words in which to express my anguish and my shame  she and my father had bequeathed me a name they had made noble and honoured not merely in literature art archaeology and science but in the public history of my own country in its evolution as a nation  i had disgraced that name eternally  i had made it a low byword among low people  i had dragged it through the very mire  i had given it to brutes that they might make it brutal and to fools that they might turn it into a synonym for folly what i suffered then and still suffer is not for pen to write or paper to record  my wife always kind and gentle to me rather than that i should hear the news from indifferent lips travelled ill as she was all the way from genoa to england to break to me herself the tidings of so irreparable so irremediable a loss  messages of sympathy reached me from all who had still affection for me  even people who had not known me personally hearing that a new sorrow had broken into my life wrote to ask that some expression of their condolence should be conveyed to me     three months go over  the calendar of my daily conduct and labour that hangs on the outside of my cell door with my name and sentence written upon it tells me that it is may     prosperity pleasure and success may be rough of grain and common in fibre but sorrow is the most sensitive of all created things  there is nothing that stirs in the whole world of thought to which sorrow does not vibrate in terrible and exquisite pulsation  the thin beatenout leaf of tremulous gold that chronicles the direction of forces the eye cannot see is in comparison coarse  it is a wound that bleeds when any hand but that of love touches it and even then must bleed again though not in pain  where there is sorrow there in holy ground  some day people will realise what that means  they will know nothing of life till they doand natures like his can realise it  when i was brought down from my prison to the court of bankruptcy between two policemenwaited in the long dreary corridor that before the whole crowd whom an action so sweet and simple hushed into silence he might gravely raise his hat to me as handcuffed and with bowed head i passed him by  men have gone to heaven for smaller things than that  it was in this spirit and with this mode of love that the saints knelt down to wash the feet of the poor or stooped to kiss the leper on the cheek  i have never said one single word to him about what he did  i do not know to the present moment whether he is aware that i was even conscious of his action  it is not a thing for which one can render formal thanks in formal words  i store it in the treasurehouse of my heart  i keep it there as a secret debt that i am glad to think i can never possibly repay  it is embalmed and kept sweet by the myrrh and cassia of many tears  when wisdom has been profitless to me philosophy barren and the proverbs and phrases of those who have sought to give me consolation as dust and ashes in my mouth the memory of that little lovely silent act of love has unsealed for me all the wells of pity made the desert blossom like a rose and brought me out of the bitterness of lonely exile into harmony with the wounded broken and great heart of the world  when people are able to understand not merely how beautiful s action was but why it meant so much to me and always will mean so much then perhaps they will realise how and in what spirit they should approach me     the poor are wise more charitable more kind more sensitive than we are  in their eyes prison is a tragedy in a mans life a misfortune a casuality something that calls for sympathy in others  they speak of one who is in prison as of one who is in trouble simply  it is the phrase they always use and the expression has the perfect wisdom of love in it  with people of our own rank it is different  with us prison makes a man a pariah  i and such as i am have hardly any right to air and sun  our presence taints the pleasures of others  we are unwelcome when we reappear  to revisit the glimpses of the moon is not for us  our very children are taken away  those lovely links with humanity are broken  we are doomed to be solitary while our sons still live  we are denied the one thing that might heal us and keep us that might bring balm to the bruised heart and peace to the soul in pain     i must say to myself that i ruined myself and that nobody great or small can be ruined except by his own hand  i am quite ready to say so  i am trying to say so though they may not think it at the present moment this pitiless indictment i bring without pity against myself  terrible as was what the world did to me what i did to myself was far more terrible still  i was a man who stood in symbolic relations to the art and culture of my age  i had realised this for myself at the very dawn of my manhood and had forced my age to realise it afterwards  few men hold such a position in their own lifetime and have it so acknowledged  it is usually discerned if discerned at all by the historian or the critic long after both the man and his age have passed away  with me it was different  i felt it myself and made others feel it  byron was a symbolic figure but his relations were to the passion of his age and its weariness of passion  mine were to something more noble more permanent of more vital issue of larger scope  the gods had given me almost everything  but i let myself be lured into long spells of senseless and sensual ease  i amused myself with being a flaneur a dandy a man of fashion  i surrounded myself with the smaller natures and the meaner minds  i became the spendthrift of my own genius and to waste an eternal youth gave me a curious joy  tired of being on the heights i deliberately went to the depths in the search for new sensation  what the paradox was to me in the sphere of thought perversity became to me in the sphere of passion  desire at the end was a malady or a madness or both  i grew careless of the lives of others  i took pleasure where it pleased me and passed on  i forgot that every little action of the common day makes or unmakes character and that therefore what one has done in the secret chamber one has some day to cry aloud on the housetop  i ceased to be lord over myself  i was no longer the captain of my soul and did not know it  i allowed pleasure to dominate me  i ended in horrible disgrace  there is only one thing for me now absolute humility  i have lain in prison for nearly two years  out of my nature has come wild despair an abandonment to grief that was piteous even to look at terrible and impotent rage bitterness and scorn anguish that wept aloud misery that could find no voice sorrow that was dumb  i have passed through every possible mood of suffering  better than wordsworth himself i know what wordsworth meant when he said     suffering is permanent obscure and dark    and has the nature of infinity  but while there were times when i rejoiced in the idea that my sufferings were to be endless i could not bear them to be without meaning  now i find hidden somewhere away in my nature something that tells me that nothing in the whole world is meaningless and suffering least of all that something hidden away in my nature like a treasure in a field is humility  it is the last thing left in me and the best the ultimate discovery at which i have arrived the startingpoint for a fresh development  it has come to me right out of myself so i know that it has come at the proper time  it could not have come before nor later  had any one told me of it i would have rejected it  had it been brought to me i would have refused it  as i found it i want to keep it  i must do so  it is the one thing that has in it the elements of life of a new life vita nuova for me  of all things it is the strangest  one cannot acquire it except by surrendering everything that one has  it is only when one has lost all things that one knows that one possesses it  now i have realised that it is in me i see quite clearly what i ought to do in fact must do  and when i use such a phrase as that i need not say that i am not alluding to any external sanction or command  i admit none  i am far more of an individualist than i ever was  nothing seems to me of the smallest value except what one gets out of oneself  my nature is seeking a fresh mode of selfrealisation  that is all i am concerned with  and the first thing that i have got to do is to free myself from any possible bitterness of feeling against the world  i am completely penniless and absolutely homeless  yet there are worse things in the world than that  i am quite candid when i say that rather than go out from this prison with bitterness in my heart against the world i would gladly and readily beg my bread from door to door  if i got nothing from the house of the rich i would get something at the house of the poor  those who have much are often greedy those who have little always share  i would not a bit mind sleeping in the cool grass in summer and when winter came on sheltering myself by the warm closethatched rick or under the penthouse of a great barn provided i had love in my heart  the external things of life seem to me now of no importance at all  you can see to what intensity of individualism i have arrivedor am arriving rather for the journey is long and where i walk there are thorns  of course i know that to ask alms on the highway is not to be my lot and that if ever i lie in the cool grass at nighttime it will be to write sonnets to the moon  when i go out of prison r will be waiting for me on the other side of the big ironstudded gate and he is the symbol not merely of his own affection but of the affection of many others besides  i believe i am to have enough to live on for about eighteen months at any rate so that if i may not write beautiful books i may at least read beautiful books and what joy can be greater  after that i hope to be able to recreate my creative faculty  but were things different had i not a friend left in the world were there not a single house open to me in pity had i to accept the wallet and ragged cloak of sheer penury as long as i am free from all resentment hardness and scorn i would be able to face the life with much more calm and confidence than i would were my body in purple and fine linen and the soul within me sick with hate  and i really shall have no difficulty  when you really want love you will find it waiting for you  i need not say that my task does not end there  it would be comparatively easy if it did  there is much more before me  i have hills far steeper to climb valleys much darker to pass through  and i have to get it all out of myself  neither religion morality nor reason can help me at all  morality does not help me  i am a born antinomian  i am one of those who are made for exceptions not for laws  but while i see that there is nothing wrong in what one does i see that there is something wrong in what one becomes  it is well to have learned that  religion does not help me  the faith that others give to what is unseen i give to what one can touch and look at  my gods dwell in temples made with hands and within the circle of actual experience is my creed made perfect and complete too complete it may be for like many or all of those who have placed their heaven in this earth i have found in it not merely the beauty of heaven but the horror of hell also  when i think about religion at all i feel as if i would like to found an order for those who cannot believe the confraternity of the faithless one might call it where on an altar on which no taper burned a priest in whose heart peace had no dwelling might celebrate with unblessed bread and a chalice empty of wine  every thing to be true must become a religion and agnosticism should have its ritual no less than faith  it has sown its martyrs it should reap its saints and praise god daily for having hidden himself from man  but whether it be faith or agnosticism it must be nothing external to me  its symbols must be of my own creating  only that is spiritual which makes its own form  if i may not find its secret within myself i shall never find it if i have not got it already it will never come to me  reason does not help me  it tells me that the laws under which i am convicted are wrong and unjust laws and the system under which i have suffered a wrong and unjust system  but somehow i have got to make both of these things just and right to me  and exactly as in art one is only concerned with what a particular thing is at a particular moment to oneself so it is also in the ethical evolution of ones character  i have got to make everything that has happened to me good for me  the plank bed the loathsome food the hard ropes shredded into oakum till ones fingertips grow dull with pain the menial offices with which each day begins and finishes the harsh orders that routine seems to necessitate the dreadful dress that makes sorrow grotesque to look at the silence the solitude the shameeach and all of these things i have to transform into a spiritual experience  there is not a single degradation of the body which i must not try and make into a spiritualising of the soul  i want to get to the point when i shall be able to say quite simply and without affectation that the two great turningpoints in my life were when my father sent me to oxford and when society sent me to prison  i will not say that prison is the best thing that could have happened to me for that phrase would savour of too great bitterness towards myself i would sooner say or hear it said of me that i was so typical a child of my age that in my perversity and for that perversitys sake i turned the good things of my life to evil and the evil things of my life to good  what is said however by myself or by others matters little  the important thing the thing that lies before me the thing that i have to do if the brief remainder of my days is not to be maimed marred and incomplete is to absorb into my nature all that has been done to me to make it part of me to accept it without complaint fear or reluctance the supreme vice is shallowness  whatever is realised is right  when first i was put into prison some people advised me to try and forget who i was  it was ruinous advice  it is only by realising what i am that i have found comfort of any kind  now i am advised by others to try on my release to forget that i have ever been in a prison at all  i know that would be equally fatal  it would mean that i would always be haunted by an intolerable sense of disgrace and that those things that are meant for me as much as for anybody elsethe beauty of the sun and moon the pageant of the seasons the music of daybreak and the silence of great nights the rain falling through the leaves or the dew creeping over the grass and making it silverwould all be tainted for me and lose their healing power and their power of communicating joy  to regret ones own experiences is to arrest ones own development  to deny ones own experiences is to put a lie into the lips of ones own life  it is no less than a denial of the soul  for just as the body absorbs things of all kinds things common and unclean no less than those that the priest or a vision has cleansed and converts them into swiftness or strength into the play of beautiful muscles and the moulding of fair flesh into the curves and colours of the hair the lips the eye so the soul in its turn has its nutritive functions also and can transform into noble moods of thought and passions of high import what in itself is base cruel and degrading nay more may find in these its most august modes of assertion and can often reveal itself most perfectly through what was intended to desecrate or destroy  the fact of my having been the common prisoner of a common gaol i must frankly accept and curious as it may seem one of the things i shall have to teach myself is not to be ashamed of it  i must accept it as a punishment and if one is ashamed of having been punished one might just as well never have been punished at all  of course there are many things of which i was convicted that i had not done but then there are many things of which i was convicted that i had done and a still greater number of things in my life for which i was never indicted at all  and as the gods are strange and punish us for what is good and humane in us as much as for what is evil and perverse i must accept the fact that one is punished for the good as well as for the evil that one does  i have no doubt that it is quite right one should be  it helps one or should help one to realise both and not to be too conceited about either  and if i then am not ashamed of my punishment as i hope not to be i shall be able to think and walk and live with freedom  many men on their release carry their prison about with them into the air and hide it as a secret disgrace in their hearts and at length like poor poisoned things creep into some hole and die  it is wretched that they should have to do so and it is wrong terribly wrong of society that it should force them to do so  society takes upon itself the right to inflict appalling punishment on the individual but it also has the supreme vice of shallowness and fails to realise what it has done  when the mans punishment is over it leaves him to himself that is to say it abandons him at the very moment when its highest duty towards him begins  it is really ashamed of its own actions and shuns those whom it has punished as people shun a creditor whose debt they cannot pay or one on whom they have inflicted an irreparable an irremediable wrong  i can claim on my side that if i realise what i have suffered society should realise what it has inflicted on me and that there should be no bitterness or hate on either side  of course i know that from one point of view things will be made different for me than for others must indeed by the very nature of the case be made so  the poor thieves and outcasts who are imprisoned here with me are in many respects more fortunate than i am  the little way in grey city or green field that saw their sin is small to find those who know nothing of what they have done they need go no further than a bird might fly between the twilight and the dawn but for me the world is shrivelled to a handsbreadth and everywhere i turn my name is written on the rocks in lead  for i have come not from obscurity into the momentary notoriety of crime but from a sort of eternity of fame to a sort of eternity of infamy and sometimes seem to myself to have shown if indeed it required showing that between the famous and the infamous there is but one step if as much as one  still in the very fact that people will recognise me wherever i go and know all about my life as far as its follies go i can discern something good for me  it will force on me the necessity of again asserting myself as an artist and as soon as i possibly can  if i can produce only one beautiful work of art i shall be able to rob malice of its venom and cowardice of its sneer and to pluck out the tongue of scorn by the roots  and if life be as it surely is a problem to me i am no less a problem to life  people must adopt some attitude towards me and so pass judgment both on themselves and me  i need not say i am not talking of particular individuals  the only people i would care to be with now are artists and people who have suffered those who know what beauty is and those who know what sorrow is nobody else interests me  nor am i making any demands on life  in all that i have said i am simply concerned with my own mental attitude towards life as a whole and i feel that not to be ashamed of having been punished is one of the first points i must attain to for the sake of my own perfection and because i am so imperfect  then i must learn how to be happy  once i knew it or thought i knew it by instinct  it was always springtime once in my heart  my temperament was akin to joy  i filled my life to the very brim with pleasure as one might fill a cup to the very brim with wine  now i am approaching life from a completely new standpoint and even to conceive happiness is often extremely difficult for me  i remember during my first term at oxford reading in paters renaissancethat book which has had such strange influence over my lifehow dante places low in the inferno those who wilfully live in sadness and going to the college library and turning to the passage in the divine comedy where beneath the dreary marsh lie those who were sullen in the sweet air saying for ever and ever through their sighs     tristi fummo    nell aer dolce che dal sol sallegra  i knew the church condemned accidia but the whole idea seemed to me quite fantastic just the sort of sin i fancied a priest who knew nothing about real life would invent  nor could i understand how dante who says that sorrow remarries us to god could have been so harsh to those who were enamoured of melancholy if any such there really were  i had no idea that some day this would become to me one of the greatest temptations of my life  while i was in wandsworth prison i longed to die  it was my one desire when after two months in the infirmary i was transferred here and found myself growing gradually better in physical health i was filled with rage  i determined to commit suicide on the very day on which i left prison  after a time that evil mood passed away and i made up my mind to live but to wear gloom as a king wears purple never to smile again to turn whatever house i entered into a house of mourning to make my friends walk slowly in sadness with me to teach them that melancholy is the true secret of life to maim them with an alien sorrow to mar them with my own pain  now i feel quite differently  i see it would be both ungrateful and unkind of me to pull so long a face that when my friends came to see me they would have to make their faces still longer in order to show their sympathy or if i desired to entertain them to invite them to sit down silently to bitter herbs and funeral baked meats  i must learn how to be cheerful and happy  the last two occasions on which i was allowed to see my friends here i tried to be as cheerful as possible and to show my cheerfulness in order to make them some slight return for their trouble in coming all the way from town to see me  it is only a slight return i know but it is the one i feel certain that pleases them most  i saw r for an hour on saturday week and i tried to give the fullest possible expression of the delight i really felt at our meeting  and that in the views and ideas i am here shaping for myself i am quite right is shown to me by the fact that now for the first time since my imprisonment i have a real desire for life  there is before me so much to do that i would regard it as a terrible tragedy if i died before i was allowed to complete at any rate a little of it  i see new developments in art and life each one of which is a fresh mode of perfection  i long to live so that i can explore what is no less than a new world to me  do you want to know what this new world is  i think you can guess what it is  it is the world in which i have been living  sorrow then and all that it teaches one is my new world  i used to live entirely for pleasure  i shunned suffering and sorrow of every kind  i hated both  i resolved to ignore them as far as possible to treat them that is to say as modes of imperfection  they were not part of my scheme of life  they had no place in my philosophy  my mother who knew life as a whole used often to quote to me goethes lineswritten by carlyle in a book he had given her years ago and translated by him i fancy also     who never ate his bread in sorrow    who never spent the midnight hours    weeping and waiting for the morrow    he knows you not ye heavenly powers  they were the lines which that noble queen of prussia whom napoleon treated with such coarse brutality used to quote in her humiliation and exile they were the lines my mother often quoted in the troubles of her later life  i absolutely declined to accept or admit the enormous truth hidden in them  i could not understand it  i remember quite well how i used to tell her that i did not want to eat my bread in sorrow or to pass any night weeping and watching for a more bitter dawn  i had no idea that it was one of the special things that the fates had in store for me that for a whole year of my life indeed i was to do little else  but so has my portion been meted out to me and during the last few months i have after terrible difficulties and struggles been able to comprehend some of the lessons hidden in the heart of pain clergymen and people who use phrases without wisdom sometimes talk of suffering as a mystery  it is really a revelation  one discerns things one never discerned before  one approaches the whole of history from a different standpoint  what one had felt dimly through instinct about art is intellectually and emotionally realised with perfect clearness of vision and absolute intensity of apprehension  i now see that sorrow being the supreme emotion of which man is capable is at once the type and test of all great art  what the artist is always looking for is the mode of existence in which soul and body are one and indivisible in which the outward is expressive of the inward in which form reveals  of such modes of existence there are not a few youth and the arts preoccupied with youth may serve as a model for us at one moment at another we may like to think that in its subtlety and sensitiveness of impression its suggestion of a spirit dwelling in external things and making its raiment of earth and air of mist and city alike and in its morbid sympathy of its moods and tones and colours modern landscape art is realising for us pictorially what was realised in such plastic perfection by the greeks  music in which all subject is absorbed in expression and cannot be separated from it is a complex example and a flower or a child a simple example of what i mean but sorrow is the ultimate type both in life and art  behind joy and laughter there may be a temperament coarse hard and callous  but behind sorrow there is always sorrow  pain unlike pleasure wears no mask  truth in art is not any correspondence between the essential idea and the accidental existence it is not the resemblance of shape to shadow or of the form mirrored in the crystal to the form itself it is no echo coming from a hollow hill any more than it is a silver well of water in the valley that shows the moon to the moon and narcissus to narcissus  truth in art is the unity of a thing with itself the outward rendered expressive of the inward the soul made incarnate the body instinct with spirit  for this reason there is no truth comparable to sorrow  there are times when sorrow seems to me to be the only truth  other things may be illusions of the eye or the appetite made to blind the one and cloy the other but out of sorrow have the worlds been built and at the birth of a child or a star there is pain  more than this there is about sorrow an intense an extraordinary reality  i have said of myself that i was one who stood in symbolic relations to the art and culture of my age  there is not a single wretched man in this wretched place along with me who does not stand in symbolic relation to the very secret of life  for the secret of life is suffering  it is what is hidden behind everything  when we begin to live what is sweet is so sweet to us and what is bitter so bitter that we inevitably direct all our desires towards pleasures and seek not merely for a month or twain to feed on honeycomb but for all our years to taste no other food ignorant all the while that we may really be starving the soul  i remember talking once on this subject to one of the most beautiful personalities i have ever known a woman whose sympathy and noble kindness to me both before and since the tragedy of my imprisonment have been beyond power and description one who has really assisted me though she does not know it to bear the burden of my troubles more than any one else in the whole world has and all through the mere fact of her existence through her being what she ispartly an ideal and partly an influence a suggestion of what one might become as well as a real help towards becoming it a soul that renders the common air sweet and makes what is spiritual seem as simple and natural as sunlight or the sea one for whom beauty and sorrow walk hand in hand and have the same message on the occasion of which i am thinking i recall distinctly how i said to her that there was enough suffering in one narrow london lane to show that god did not love man and that wherever there was any sorrow though but that of a child in some little garden weeping over a fault that it had or had not committed the whole face of creation was completely marred  i was entirely wrong  she told me so but i could not believe her  i was not in the sphere in which such belief was to be attained to now it seems to me that love of some kind is the only possible explanation of the extraordinary amount of suffering that there is in the world  i cannot conceive of any other explanation  i am convinced that there is no other and that if the world has indeed as i have said been built of sorrow it has been built by the hands of love because in no other way could the soul of man for whom the world was made reach the full stature of its perfection  pleasure for the beautiful body but pain for the beautiful soul  when i say that i am convinced of these things i speak with too much pride  far off like a perfect pearl one can see the city of god  it is so wonderful that it seems as if a child could reach it in a summers day  and so a child could  but with me and such as me it is different one can realise a thing in a single moment but one loses it in the long hours that follow with leaden feet  it is so difficult to keep heights that the soul is competent to gain  we think in eternity but we move slowly through time and how slowly time goes with us who lie in prison i need not tell again nor of the weariness and despair that creep back into ones cell and into the cell of ones heart with such strange insistence that one has as it were to garnish and sweep ones house for their coming as for an unwelcome guest or a bitter master or a slave whose slave it is ones chance or choice to be  and though at present my friends may find it a hard thing to believe it is true none the less that for them living in freedom and idleness and comfort it is more easy to learn the lessons of humility than it is for me who begin the day by going down on my knees and washing the floor of my cell  for prison life with its endless privations and restrictions makes one rebellious  the most terrible thing about it is not that it breaks ones hearthearts are made to be brokenbut that it turns ones heart to stone  one sometimes feels that it is only with a front of brass and a lip of scorn that one can get through the day at all  and he who is in a state of rebellion cannot receive grace to use the phrase of which the church is so fondso rightly fond i dare sayfor in life as in art the mood of rebellion closes up the channels of the soul and shuts out the airs of heaven  yet i must learn these lessons here if i am to learn them anywhere and must be filled with joy if my feet are on the right road and my face set towards the gate which is called beautiful though i may fall many times in the mire and often in the mist go astray  this new life as through my love of dante i like sometimes to call it is of course no new life at all but simply the continuance by means of development and evolution of my former life  i remember when i was at oxford saying to one of my friends as we were strolling round magdalens narrow birdhaunted walks one morning in the year before i took my degree that i wanted to eat of the fruit of all the trees in the garden of the world and that i was going out into the world with that passion in my soul  and so indeed i went out and so i lived  my only mistake was that i confined myself so exclusively to the trees of what seemed to me the sunlit side of the garden and shunned the other side for its shadow and its gloom  failure disgrace poverty sorrow despair suffering tears even the broken words that come from lips in pain remorse that makes one walk on thorns conscience that condemns self abasement that punishes the misery that puts ashes on its head the anguish that chooses sackcloth for its raiment and into its own drink puts gallall these were things of which i was afraid  and as i had determined to know nothing of them i was forced to taste each of them in turn to feed on them to have for a season indeed no other food at all  i dont regret for a single moment having lived for pleasure  i did it to the full as one should do everything that one does  there was no pleasure i did not experience  i threw the pearl of my soul into a cup of wine  i went down the primrose path to the sound of flutes  i lived on honeycomb  but to have continued the same life would have been wrong because it would have been limiting  i had to pass on  the other half of the garden had its secrets for me also  of course all this is foreshadowed and prefigured in my books  some of it is in the happy prince some of it in the young king notably in the passage where the bishop says to the kneeling boy is not he who made misery wiser than thou art a phrase which when i wrote it seemed to me little more than a phrase a great deal of it is hidden away in the note of doom that like a purple thread runs through the texture of dorian gray in the critic as artist it is set forth in many colours in the soul of man it is written down and in letters too easy to read it is one of the refrains whose recurring motifs make salome so like a piece of music and bind it together as a ballad in the prose poem of the man who from the bronze of the image of the pleasure that liveth for a moment has to make the image of the sorrow that abideth for ever it is incarnate  it could not have been otherwise  at every single moment of ones life one is what one is going to be no less than what one has been  art is a symbol because man is a symbol  it is if i can fully attain to it the ultimate realisation of the artistic life  for the artistic life is simply selfdevelopment humility in the artist is his frank acceptance of all experiences just as love in the artist is simply the sense of beauty that reveals to the world its body and its soul  in marius the epicurean pater seeks to reconcile the artistic life with the life of religion in the deep sweet and austere sense of the word  but marius is little more than a spectator an ideal spectator indeed and one to whom it is given to contemplate the spectacle of life with appropriate emotions which wordsworth defines as the poets true aim yet a spectator merely and perhaps a little too much occupied with the comeliness of the benches of the sanctuary to notice that it is the sanctuary of sorrow that he is gazing at  i see a far more intimate and immediate connection between the true life of christ and the true life of the artist and i take a keen pleasure in the reflection that long before sorrow had made my days her own and bound me to her wheel i had written in the soul of man that he who would lead a christlike life must be entirely and absolutely himself and had taken as my types not merely the shepherd on the hillside and the prisoner in his cell but also the painter to whom the world is a pageant and the poet for whom the world is a song  i remember saying once to andre gide as we sat together in some paris cafe that while metaphysics had but little real interest for me and morality absolutely none there was nothing that either plato or christ had said that could not be transferred immediately into the sphere of art and there find its complete fulfilment  nor is it merely that we can discern in christ that close union of personality with perfection which forms the real distinction between the classical and romantic movement in life but the very basis of his nature was the same as that of the nature of the artistan intense and flamelike imagination  he realised in the entire sphere of human relations that imaginative sympathy which in the sphere of art is the sole secret of creation  he understood the leprosy of the leper the darkness of the blind the fierce misery of those who live for pleasure the strange poverty of the rich  some one wrote to me in trouble when you are not on your pedestal you are not interesting  how remote was the writer from what matthew arnold calls the secret of jesus  either would have taught him that whatever happens to another happens to oneself and if you want an inscription to read at dawn and at nighttime and for pleasure or for pain write up on the walls of your house in letters for the sun to gild and the moon to silver whatever happens to oneself happens to another  christs place indeed is with the poets  his whole conception of humanity sprang right out of the imagination and can only be realised by it  what god was to the pantheist man was to him  he was the first to conceive the divided races as a unity  before his time there had been gods and men and feeling through the mysticism of sympathy that in himself each had been made incarnate he calls himself the son of the one or the son of the other according to his mood  more than any one else in history he wakes in us that temper of wonder to which romance always appeals  there is still something to me almost incredible in the idea of a young galilean peasant imagining that he could bear on his own shoulders the burden of the entire world all that had already been done and suffered and all that was yet to be done and suffered the sins of nero of caesar borgia of alexander vi and of him who was emperor of rome and priest of the sun the sufferings of those whose names are legion and whose dwelling is among the tombs oppressed nationalities factory children thieves people in prison outcasts those who are dumb under oppression and whose silence is heard only of god and not merely imagining this but actually achieving it so that at the present moment all who come in contact with his personality even though they may neither bow to his altar nor kneel before his priest in some way find that the ugliness of their sin is taken away and the beauty of their sorrow revealed to them  i had said of christ that he ranks with the poets  that is true  shelley and sophocles are of his company  but his entire life also is the most wonderful of poems  for pity and terror there is nothing in the entire cycle of greek tragedy to touch it  the absolute purity of the protagonist raises the entire scheme to a height of romantic art from which the sufferings of thebes and pelops line are by their very horror excluded and shows how wrong aristotle was when he said in his treatise on the drama that it would be impossible to bear the spectacle of one blameless in pain  nor in aeschylus nor dante those stern masters of tenderness in shakespeare the most purely human of all the great artists in the whole of celtic myth and legend where the loveliness of the world is shown through a mist of tears and the life of a man is no more than the life of a flower is there anything that for sheer simplicity of pathos wedded and made one with sublimity of tragic effect can be said to equal or even approach the last act of christs passion the little supper with his companions one of whom has already sold him for a price the anguish in the quiet moonlit garden the false friend coming close to him so as to betray him with a kiss the friend who still believed in him and on whom as on a rock he had hoped to build a house of refuge for man denying him as the bird cried to the dawn his own utter loneliness his submission his acceptance of everything and along with it all such scenes as the high priest of orthodoxy rending his raiment in wrath and the magistrate of civil justice calling for water in the vain hope of cleansing himself of that stain of innocent blood that makes him the scarlet figure of history the coronation ceremony of sorrow one of the most wonderful things in the whole of recorded time the crucifixion of the innocent one before the eyes of his mother and of the disciple whom he loved the soldiers gambling and throwing dice for his clothes the terrible death by which he gave the world its most eternal symbol and his final burial in the tomb of the rich man his body swathed in egyptian linen with costly spices and perfumes as though he had been a kings son  when one contemplates all this from the point of view of art alone one cannot but be grateful that the supreme office of the church should be the playing of the tragedy without the shedding of blood the mystical presentation by means of dialogue and costume and gesture even of the passion of her lord and it is always a source of pleasure and awe to me to remember that the ultimate survival of the greek chorus lost elsewhere to art is to be found in the servitor answering the priest at mass  yet the whole life of christso entirely may sorrow and beauty be made one in their meaning and manifestationis really an idyll though it ends with the veil of the temple being rent and the darkness coming over the face of the earth and the stone rolled to the door of the sepulchre one always thinks of him as a young bridegroom with his companions as indeed he somewhere describes himself as a shepherd straying through a valley with his sheep in search of green meadow or cool stream as a singer trying to build out of the music the walls of the city of god or as a lover for whose love the whole world was too small  his miracles seem to me to be as exquisite as the coming of spring and quite as natural  i see no difficulty at all in believing that such was the charm of his personality that his mere presence could bring peace to souls in anguish and that those who touched his garments or his hands forgot their pain or that as he passed by on the highway of life people who had seen nothing of lifes mystery saw it clearly and others who had been deaf to every voice but that of pleasure heard for the first time the voice of love and found it as musical as apollos lute or that evil passions fled at his approach and men whose dull unimaginative lives had been but a mode of death rose as it were from the grave when he called them or that when he taught on the hillside the multitude forgot their hunger and thirst and the cares of this world and that to his friends who listened to him as he sat at meat the coarse food seemed delicate and the water had the taste of good wine and the whole house became full of the odour and sweetness of nard  renan in his vie de jesusthat gracious fifth gospel the gospel according to st thomas one might call itsays somewhere that christs great achievement was that he made himself as much loved after his death as he had been during his lifetime  and certainly if his place is among the poets he is the leader of all the lovers  he saw that love was the first secret of the world for which the wise men had been looking and that it was only through love that one could approach either the heart of the leper or the feet of god  and above all christ is the most supreme of individualists  humility like the artistic acceptance of all experiences is merely a mode of manifestation  it is mans soul that christ is always looking for  he calls it gods kingdom and finds it in every one  he compares it to little things to a tiny seed to a handful of leaven to a pearl  that is because one realises ones soul only by getting rid of all alien passions all acquired culture and all external possessions be they good or evil  i bore up against everything with some stubbornness of will and much rebellion of nature till i had absolutely nothing left in the world but one thing  i had lost my name my position my happiness my freedom my wealth  i was a prisoner and a pauper  but i still had my children left  suddenly they were taken away from me by the law  it was a blow so appalling that i did not know what to do so i flung myself on my knees and bowed my head and wept and said the body of a child is as the body of the lord i am not worthy of either  that moment seemed to save me  i saw then that the only thing for me was to accept everything since thencurious as it will no doubt soundi have been happier  it was of course my soul in its ultimate essence that i had reached  in many ways i had been its enemy but i found it waiting for me as a friend  when one comes in contact with the soul it makes one simple as a child as christ said one should be  it is tragic how few people ever possess their souls before they die nothing is more rare in any man says emerson than an act of his own  it is quite true  most people are other people  their thoughts are some one elses opinions their lives a mimicry their passions a quotation  christ was not merely the supreme individualist but he was the first individualist in history  people have tried to make him out an ordinary philanthropist or ranked him as an altruist with the scientific and sentimental  but he was really neither one nor the other  pity he has of course for the poor for those who are shut up in prisons for the lowly for the wretched but he has far more pity for the rich for the hard hedonists for those who waste their freedom in becoming slaves to things for those who wear soft raiment and live in kings houses riches and pleasure seemed to him to be really greater tragedies than poverty or sorrow  and as for altruism who knew better than he that it is vocation not volition that determines us and that one cannot gather grapes of thorns or figs from thistles  to live for others as a definite selfconscious aim was not his creed  it was not the basis of his creed  when he says forgive your enemies it is not for the sake of the enemy but for ones own sake that he says so and because love is more beautiful than hate  in his own entreaty to the young man sell all that thou hast and give to the poor it is not of the state of the poor that he is thinking but of the soul of the young man the soul that wealth was marring  in his view of life he is one with the artist who knows that by the inevitable law of selfperfection the poet must sing and the sculptor think in bronze and the painter make the world a mirror for his moods as surely and as certainly as the hawthorn must blossom in spring and the corn turn to gold at harvest time and the moon in her ordered wanderings change from shield to sickle and from sickle to shield  but while christ did not say to men live for others he pointed out that there was no difference at all between the lives of others and ones own life  by this means he gave to man an extended a titan personality since his coming the history of each separate individual is or can be made the history of the world  of course culture has intensified the personality of man  art has made us myriadminded  those who have the artistic temperament go into exile with dante and learn how salt is the bread of others and how steep their stairs they catch for a moment the serenity and calm of goethe and yet know but too well that baudelaire cried to god     o seigneur donnez moi la force et le courage    de contempler mon corps et mon coeur sans degout  out of shakespeares sonnets they draw to their own hurt it may be the secret of his love and make it their own they look with new eyes on modern life because they have listened to one of chopins nocturnes or handled greek things or read the story of the passion of some dead man for some dead woman whose hair was like threads of fine gold and whose mouth was as a pomegranate  but the sympathy of the artistic temperament is necessarily with what has found expression  in words or in colours in music or in marble behind the painted masks of an aeschylean play or through some sicilian shepherds pierced and jointed reeds the man and his message must have been revealed  to the artist expression is the only mode under which he can conceive life at all  to him what is dumb is dead  but to christ it was not so with a width and wonder of imagination that fills one almost with awe he took the entire world of the inarticulate the voiceless world of pain as his kingdom and made of himself its eternal mouthpiece  those of whom i have spoken who are dumb under oppression and whose silence is heard only of god he chose as his brothers  he sought to become eyes to the blind ears to the deaf and a cry in the lips of those whose tongues had been tied  his desire was to be to the myriads who had found no utterance a very trumpet through which they might call to heaven  and feeling with the artistic nature of one to whom suffering and sorrow were modes through which he could realise his conception of the beautiful that an idea is of no value till it becomes incarnate and is made an image he made of himself the image of the man of sorrows and as such has fascinated and dominated art as no greek god ever succeeded in doing  for the greek gods in spite of the white and red of their fair fleet limbs were not really what they appeared to be  the curved brow of apollo was like the suns disc crescent over a hill at dawn and his feet were as the wings of the morning but he himself had been cruel to marsyas and had made niobe childless  in the steel shields of athenas eyes there had been no pity for arachne the pomp and peacocks of hera were all that was really noble about her and the father of the gods himself had been too fond of the daughters of men  the two most deeply suggestive figures of greek mythology were for religion demeter an earth goddess not one of the olympians and for art dionysus the son of a mortal woman to whom the moment of his birth had proved also the moment of her death  but life itself from its lowliest and most humble sphere produced one far more marvellous than the mother of proserpina or the son of semele  out of the carpenters shop at nazareth had come a personality infinitely greater than any made by myth and legend and one strangely enough destined to reveal to the world the mystical meaning of wine and the real beauties of the lilies of the field as none either on cithaeron or at enna had ever done  the song of isaiah he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him had seemed to him to prefigure himself and in him the prophecy was fulfilled  we must not be afraid of such a phrase  every single work of art is the fulfilment of a prophecy for every work of art is the conversion of an idea into an image  every single human being should be the fulfilment of a prophecy for every human being should be the realisation of some ideal either in the mind of god or in the mind of man  christ found the type and fixed it and the dream of a virgilian poet either at jerusalem or at babylon became in the long progress of the centuries incarnate in him for whom the world was waiting  to me one of the things in history the most to be regretted is that the christs own renaissance which has produced the cathedral at chartres the arthurian cycle of legends the life of st francis of assisi the art of giotto and dantes divine comedy was not allowed to develop on its own lines but was interrupted and spoiled by the dreary classical renaissance that gave us petrarch and raphaels frescoes and palladian architecture and formal french tragedy and st pauls cathedral and popes poetry and everything that is made from without and by dead rules and does not spring from within through some spirit informing it but wherever there is a romantic movement in art there somehow and under some form is christ or the soul of christ  he is in romeo and juliet in the winters tale in provencal poetry in the ancient mariner in la belle dame sans merci and in chattertons ballad of charity  we owe to him the most diverse things and people  hugos les miserables baudelaires fleurs du mal the note of pity in russian novels verlaine and verlaines poems the stained glass and tapestries and the quattrocento work of burnejones and morris belong to him no less than the tower of giotto lancelot and guinevere tannhauser the troubled romantic marbles of michael angelo pointed architecture and the love of children and flowersfor both of which indeed in classical art there was but little place hardly enough for them to grow or play in but which from the twelfth century down to our own day have been continually making their appearances in art under various modes and at various times coming fitfully and wilfully as children as flowers are apt to do spring always seeming to one as if the flowers had been in hiding and only came out into the sun because they were afraid that grown up people would grow tired of looking for them and give up the search and the life of a child being no more than an april day on which there is both rain and sun for the narcissus  it is the imaginative quality of christs own nature that makes him this palpitating centre of romance  the strange figures of poetic drama and ballad are made by the imagination of others but out of his own imagination entirely did jesus of nazareth create himself  the cry of isaiah had really no more to do with his coming than the song of the nightingale has to do with the rising of the moonno more though perhaps no less  he was the denial as well as the affirmation of prophecy  for every expectation that he fulfilled there was another that he destroyed  in all beauty says bacon there is some strangeness of proportion and of those who are born of the spiritof those that is to say who like himself are dynamic forceschrist says that they are like the wind that bloweth where it listeth and no man can tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth  that is why he is so fascinating to artists  he has all the colour elements of life mystery strangeness pathos suggestion ecstasy love  he appeals to the temper of wonder and creates that mood in which alone he can be understood  and to me it is a joy to remember that if he is of imagination all compact the world itself is of the same substance  i said in dorian gray that the great sins of the world take place in the brain but it is in the brain that everything takes place  we know now that we do not see with the eyes or hear with the ears  they are really channels for the transmission adequate or inadequate of sense impressions  it is in the brain that the poppy is red that the apple is odorous that the skylark sings  of late i have been studying with diligence the four prose poems about christ  at christmas i managed to get hold of a greek testament and every morning after i had cleaned my cell and polished my tins i read a little of the gospels a dozen verses taken by chance anywhere  it is a delightful way of opening the day  every one even in a turbulent ill disciplined life should do the same  endless repetition in and out of season has spoiled for us the freshness the naivete the simple romantic charm of the gospels  we hear them read far too often and far too badly and all repetition is antispiritual  when one returns to the greek it is like going into a garden of lilies out of some narrow and dark house  and to me the pleasure is doubled by the reflection that it is extremely probable that we have the actual terms the ipsissima verba used by christ  it was always supposed that christ talked in aramaic  even renan thought so  but now we know that the galilean peasants like the irish peasants of our own day were bilingual and that greek was the ordinary language of intercourse all over palestine as indeed all over the eastern world  i never liked the idea that we knew of christs own words only through a translation of a translation  it is a delight to me to think that as far as his conversation was concerned charmides might have listened to him and socrates reasoned with him and plato understood him that he really said greek text that when he thought of the lilies of the field and how they neither toil nor spin his absolute expression was greek text and that his last word when he cried out my life has been completed has reached its fulfilment has been perfected was exactly as st john tells us it was greek textno more  while in reading the gospelsparticularly that of st john himself or whatever early gnostic took his name and mantlei see the continual assertion of the imagination as the basis of all spiritual and material life i see also that to christ imagination was simply a form of love and that to him love was lord in the fullest meaning of the phrase  some six weeks ago i was allowed by the doctor to have white bread to eat instead of the coarse black or brown bread of ordinary prison fare  it is a great delicacy  it will sound strange that dry bread could possibly be a delicacy to any one  to me it is so much so that at the close of each meal i carefully eat whatever crumbs may be left on my tin plate or have fallen on the rough towel that one uses as a cloth so as not to soil ones table and i do so not from hungeri get now quite sufficient foodbut simply in order that nothing should be wasted of what is given to me  so one should look on love  christ like all fascinating personalities had the power of not merely saying beautiful things himself but of making other people say beautiful things to him and i love the story st mark tells us about the greek woman who when as a trial of her faith he said to her that he could not give her the bread of the children of israel answered him that the little dogsgreek text little dogs it should be renderedwho are under the table eat of the crumbs that the children let fall  most people live for love and admiration  but it is by love and admiration that we should live  if any love is shown us we should recognise that we are quite unworthy of it  nobody is worthy to be loved  the fact that god loves man shows us that in the divine order of ideal things it is written that eternal love is to be given to what is eternally unworthy or if that phrase seems to be a bitter one to bear let us say that every one is worthy of love except him who thinks that he is  love is a sacrament that should be taken kneeling and domine non sum dignus should be on the lips and in the hearts of those who receive it  if ever i write again in the sense of producing artistic work there are just two subjects on which and through which i desire to express myself one is christ as the precursor of the romantic movement in life the other is the artistic life considered in its relation to conduct  the first is of course intensely fascinating for i see in christ not merely the essentials of the supreme romantic type but all the accidents the wilfulnesses even of the romantic temperament also  he was the first person who ever said to people that they should live flowerlike lives  he fixed the phrase  he took children as the type of what people should try to become  he held them up as examples to their elders which i myself have always thought the chief use of children if what is perfect should have a use  dante describes the soul of a man as coming from the hand of god weeping and laughing like a little child and christ also saw that the soul of each one should be a guisa di fanciulla che piangendo e ridendo pargoleggia  he felt that life was changeful fluid active and that to allow it to be stereotyped into any form was death  he saw that people should not be too serious over material common interests that to be unpractical was to be a great thing that one should not bother too much over affairs  the birds didnt why should man  he is charming when he says take no thought for the morrow is not the soul more than meat is not the body more than raiment  a greek might have used the latter phrase  it is full of greek feeling  but only christ could have said both and so summed up life perfectly for us  his morality is all sympathy just what morality should be  if the only thing that he ever said had been her sins are forgiven her because she loved much it would have been worth while dying to have said it  his justice is all poetical justice exactly what justice should be  the beggar goes to heaven because he has been unhappy  i cannot conceive a better reason for his being sent there  the people who work for an hour in the vineyard in the cool of the evening receive just as much reward as those who have toiled there all day long in the hot sun  why shouldnt they  probably no one deserved anything  or perhaps they were a different kind of people  christ had no patience with the dull lifeless mechanical systems that treat people as if they were things and so treat everybody alike for him there were no laws there were exceptions merely as if anybody or anything for that matter was like aught else in the world  that which is the very keynote of romantic art was to him the proper basis of natural life  he saw no other basis  and when they brought him one taken in the very act of sin and showed him her sentence written in the law and asked him what was to be done he wrote with his finger on the ground as though he did not hear them and finally when they pressed him again looked up and said let him of you who has never sinned be the first to throw the stone at her  it was worth while living to have said that  like all poetical natures he loved ignorant people  he knew that in the soul of one who is ignorant there is always room for a great idea  but he could not stand stupid people especially those who are made stupid by education people who are full of opinions not one of which they even understand a peculiarly modern type summed up by christ when he describes it as the type of one who has the key of knowledge cannot use it himself and does not allow other people to use it though it may be made to open the gate of gods kingdom  his chief war was against the philistines  that is the war every child of light has to wage philistinism was the note of the age and community in which he lived  in their heavy inaccessibility to ideas their dull respectability their tedious orthodoxy their worship of vulgar success their entire preoccupation with the gross materialistic side of life and their ridiculous estimate of themselves and their importance the jews of jerusalem in christs day were the exact counterpart of the british philistine of our own  christ mocked at the whited sepulchre of respectability and fixed that phrase for ever  he treated worldly success as a thing absolutely to be despised  he saw nothing in it at all  he looked on wealth as an encumbrance to a man  he would not hear of life being sacrificed to any system of thought or morals  he pointed out that forms and ceremonies were made for man not man for forms and ceremonies  he took sabbatarianism as a type of the things that should be set at nought  the cold philanthropies the ostentatious public charities the tedious formalisms so dear to the middleclass mind he exposed with utter and relentless scorn  to us what is termed orthodoxy is merely a facile unintelligent acquiescence but to them and in their hands it was a terrible and paralysing tyranny  christ swept it aside he showed that the spirit alone was of value  he took a keen pleasure in pointing out to them that though they were always reading the law and the prophets they had not really the smallest idea of what either of them meant  in opposition to their tithing of each separate day into the fixed routine of prescribed duties as they tithe mint and rue he preached the enormous importance of living completely for the moment  those whom he saved from their sins are saved simply for beautiful moments in their lives  mary magdalen when she sees christ breaks the rich vase of alabaster that one of her seven lovers had given her and spills the odorous spices over his tired dusty feet and for that one moments sake sits for ever with ruth and beatrice in the tresses of the snowwhite rose of paradise  all that christ says to us by the way of a little warning is that every moment should be beautiful that the soul should always be ready for the coming of the bridegroom always waiting for the voice of the lover philistinism being simply that side of mans nature that is not illumined by the imagination  he sees all the lovely influences of life as modes of light the imagination itself is the world of light  the world is made by it and yet the world cannot understand it that is because the imagination is simply a manifestation of love and it is love and the capacity for it that distinguishes one human being from another  but it is when he deals with a sinner that christ is most romantic in the sense of most real  the world had always loved the saint as being the nearest possible approach to the perfection of god  christ through some divine instinct in him seems to have always loved the sinner as being the nearest possible approach to the perfection of man  his primary desire was not to reform people any more than his primary desire was to a relieve suffering  to turn an interesting thief into a tedious honest man was not his aim  he would have thought little of the prisoners aid society and other modern movements of the kind  the conversion of a publican into a pharisee would not have seemed to him a great achievement  but in a manner not yet understood of the world he regarded sin and suffering as being in themselves beautiful holy things and modes of perfection  it seems a very dangerous idea  it isall great ideas are dangerous that it was christs creed admits of no doubt  that it is the true creed i dont doubt myself  of course the sinner must repent  but why  simply because otherwise he would be unable to realise what he had done  the moment of repentance is the moment of initiation  more than that it is the means by which one alters ones past  the greeks thought that impossible  they often say in their gnomic aphorisms even the gods cannot alter the past  christ showed that the commonest sinner could do it that it was the one thing he could do  christ had he been asked would have saidi feel quite certain about itthat the moment the prodigal son fell on his knees and wept he made his having wasted his substance with harlots his swine herding and hungering for the husks they ate beautiful and holy moments in his life  it is difficult for most people to grasp the idea  i dare say one has to go to prison to understand it  if so it may be worth while going to prison  there is something so unique about christ  of course just as there are false dawns before the dawn itself and winter days so full of sudden sunlight that they will cheat the wise crocus into squandering its gold before its time and make some foolish bird call to its mate to build on barren boughs so there were christians before christ  for that we should be grateful  the unfortunate thing is that there have been none since  i make one exception st francis of assisi  but then god had given him at his birth the soul of a poet as he himself when quite young had in mystical marriage taken poverty as his bride and with the soul of a poet and the body of a beggar he found the way to perfection not difficult  he understood christ and so he became like him  we do not require the liber conformitatum to teach us that the life of st francis was the true imitatio christi a poem compared to which the book of that name is merely prose  indeed that is the charm about christ when all is said he is just like a work of art  he does not really teach one anything but by being brought into his presence one becomes something  and everybody is predestined to his presence  once at least in his life each man walks with christ to emmaus  as regards the other subject the relation of the artistic life to conduct it will no doubt seem strange to you that i should select it people point to reading gaol and say that is where the artistic life leads a man  well it might lead to worse places  the more mechanical people to whom life is a shrewd speculation depending on a careful calculation of ways and means always know where they are going and go there  they start with the ideal desire of being the parish beadle and in whatever sphere they are placed they succeed in being the parish beadle and no more  a man whose desire is to be something separate from himself to be a member of parliament or a successful grocer or a prominent solicitor or a judge or something equally tedious invariably succeeds in being what he wants to be  that is his punishment  those who want a mask have to wear it  but with the dynamic forces of life and those in whom those dynamic forces become incarnate it is different  people whose desire is solely for selfrealisation never know where they are going  they cant know in one sense of the word it is of course necessary as the greek oracle said to know oneself that is the first achievement of knowledge  but to recognise that the soul of a man is unknowable is the ultimate achievement of wisdom  the final mystery is oneself  when one has weighed the sun in the balance and measured the steps of the moon and mapped out the seven heavens star by star there still remains oneself who can calculate the orbit of his own soul  when the son went out to look for his fathers asses he did not know that a man of god was waiting for him with the very chrism of coronation and that his own soul was already the soul of a king  i hope to live long enough and to produce work of such a character that i shall be able at the end of my days to say yes this is just where the artistic life leads a man  two of the most perfect lives i have come across in my own experience are the lives of verlaine and of prince kropotkin both of them men who have passed years in prison the first the one christian poet since dante the other a man with a soul of that beautiful white christ which seems coming out of russia  and for the last seven or eight months in spite of a succession of great troubles reaching me from the outside world almost without intermission i have been placed in direct contact with a new spirit working in this prison through man and things that has helped me beyond any possibility of expression in words so that while for the first year of my imprisonment i did nothing else and can remember doing nothing else but wring my hands in impotent despair and say what an ending what an appalling ending now i try to say to myself and sometimes when i am not torturing myself do really and sincerely say what a beginning what a wonderful beginning  it may really be so  it may become so  if it does i shall owe much to this new personality that has altered every mans life in this place  you may realise it when i say that had i been released last may as i tried to be i would have left this place loathing it and every official in it with a bitterness of hatred that would have poisoned my life  i have had a year longer of imprisonment but humanity has been in the prison along with us all and now when i go out i shall always remember great kindnesses that i have received here from almost everybody and on the day of my release i shall give many thanks to many people and ask to be remembered by them in turn  the prison style is absolutely and entirely wrong  i would give anything to be able to alter it when i go out  i intend to try  but there is nothing in the world so wrong but that the spirit of humanity which is the spirit of love the spirit of the christ who is not in churches may make it if not right at least possible to be borne without too much bitterness of heart  i know also that much is waiting for me outside that is very delightful from what st francis of assisi calls my brother the wind and my sister the rain lovely things both of them down to the shopwindows and sunsets of great cities  if i made a list of all that still remains to me i dont know where i should stop for indeed god made the world just as much for me as for any one else  perhaps i may go out with something that i had not got before  i need not tell you that to me reformations in morals are as meaningless and vulgar as reformations in theology  but while to propose to be a better man is a piece of unscientific cant to have become a deeper man is the privilege of those who have suffered  and such i think i have become  if after i am free a friend of mine gave a feast and did not invite me to it i should not mind a bit  i can be perfectly happy by myself  with freedom flowers books and the moon who could not be perfectly happy besides feasts are not for me any more  i have given too many to care about them  that side of life is over for me very fortunately i dare say  but if after i am free a friend of mine had a sorrow and refused to allow me to share it i should feel it most bitterly  if he shut the doors of the house of mourning against me i would come back again and again and beg to be admitted so that i might share in what i was entitled to share in  if he thought me unworthy unfit to weep with him i should feel it as the most poignant humiliation as the most terrible mode in which disgrace could be inflicted on me  but that could not be i have a right to share in sorrow and he who can look at the loveliness of the world and share its sorrow and realise something of the wonder of both is in immediate contact with divine things and has got as near to gods secret as any one can get  perhaps there may come into my art also no less than into my life a still deeper note one of greater unity of passion and directness of impulse  not width but intensity is the true aim of modern art  we are no longer in art concerned with the type  it is with the exception that we have to do  i cannot put my sufferings into any form they took i need hardly say  art only begins where imitation ends but something must come into my work of fuller memory of words perhaps of richer cadences of more curious effects of simpler architectural order of some aesthetic quality at any rate  when marsyas was torn from the scabbard of his limbsdella vagina della membre sue to use one of dantes most terrible tacitean phraseshe had no more song the greek said  apollo had been victor the lyre had vanquished the reed  but perhaps the greeks were mistaken i hear in much modern art the cry of marsyas  it is bitter in baudelaire sweet and plaintive in lamartine mystic in verlaine  it is in the deferred resolutions of chopins music  it is in the discontent that haunts burnejoness women  even matthew arnold whose song of callicles tells of the triumph of the sweet persuasive lyre and the famous final victory in such a clear note of lyrical beauty has not a little of it in the troubled undertone of doubt and distress that haunts his verses neither goethe nor wordsworth could help him though he followed each in turn and when he seeks to mourn for thyrsis or to sing of the scholar gipsy it is the reed that he has to take for the rendering of his strain  but whether or not the phrygian faun was silent i cannot be  expression is as necessary to me as leaf and blossoms are to the black branches of the trees that show themselves above the prison walls and are so restless in the wind  between my art and the world there is now a wide gulf but between art and myself there is none  i hope at least that there is none  to each of us different fates are meted out  my lot has been one of public infamy of long imprisonment of misery of ruin of disgrace but i am not worthy of itnot yet at any rate  i remember that i used to say that i thought i could bear a real tragedy if it came to me with purple pall and a mask of noble sorrow but that the dreadful thing about modernity was that it put tragedy into the raiment of comedy so that the great realities seemed commonplace or grotesque or lacking in style  it is quite true about modernity  it has probably always been true about actual life  it is said that all martyrdoms seemed mean to the looker on  the nineteenth century is no exception to the rule  everything about my tragedy has been hideous mean repellent lacking in style our very dress makes us grotesque  we are the zanies of sorrow we are clowns whose hearts are broken  we are specially designed to appeal to the sense of humour  on november 13th 1895 i was brought down here from london  from two oclock till halfpast two on that day i had to stand on the centre platform of clapham junction in convict dress and handcuffed for the world to look at  i had been taken out of the hospital ward without a moments notice being given to me  of all possible objects i was the most grotesque  when people saw me they laughed  each train as it came up swelled the audience  nothing could exceed their amusement  that was of course before they knew who i was as soon as they had been informed they laughed still more  for half an hour i stood there in the grey november rain surrounded by a jeering mob  for a year after that was done to me i wept every day at the same hour and for the same space of time  that is not such a tragic thing as possibly it sounds to you  to those who are in prison tears are a part of every days experience  a day in prison on which one does not weep is a day on which ones heart is hard not a day on which ones heart is happy  well now i am really beginning to feel more regret for the people who laughed than for myself  of course when they saw me i was not on my pedestal i was in the pillory  but it is a very unimaginative nature that only cares for people on their pedestals  a pedestal may be a very unreal thing  a pillory is a terrific reality  they should have known also how to interpret sorrow better  i have said that behind sorrow there is always sorrow  it were wiser still to say that behind sorrow there is always a soul  and to mock at a soul in pain is a dreadful thing  in the strangely simple economy of the world people only get what they give and to those who have not enough imagination to penetrate the mere outward of things and feel pity what pity can be given save that of scorn  i write this account of the mode of my being transferred here simply that it should be realised how hard it has been for me to get anything out of my punishment but bitterness and despair  i have however to do it and now and then i have moments of submission and acceptance  all the spring may be hidden in the single bud and the low ground nest of the lark may hold the joy that is to herald the feet of many rosered dawns  so perhaps whatever beauty of life still remains to me is contained in some moment of surrender abasement and humiliation  i can at any rate merely proceed on the lines of my own development and accepting all that has happened to me make myself worthy of it  people used to say of me that i was too individualistic  i must be far more of an individualist than ever i was  i must get far more out of myself than ever i got and ask far less of the world than ever i asked indeed my ruin came not from too great individualism of life but from too little  the one disgraceful unpardonable and to all time contemptible action of my life was to allow myself to appeal to society for help and protection  to have made such an appeal would have been from the individualist point of view bad enough but what excuse can there ever be put forward for having made it  of course once i had put into motion the forces of society society turned on me and said have you been living all this time in defiance of my laws and do you now appeal to those laws for protection  you shall have those laws exercised to the full  you shall abide by what you have appealed to  the result is i am in gaol  certainly no man ever fell so ignobly and by such ignoble instruments as i did  the philistine element in life is not the failure to understand art charming people such as fishermen shepherds ploughboys peasants and the like know nothing about art and are the very salt of the earth  he is the philistine who upholds and aids the heavy cumbrous blind mechanical forces of society and who does not recognise dynamic force when he meets it either in a man or a movement  people thought it dreadful of me to have entertained at dinner the evil things of life and to have found pleasure in their company  but then from the point of view through which i as an artist in life approach them they were delightfully suggestive and stimulating  the danger was half the excitement    my business as an artist was with ariel  i set myself to wrestle with caliban     a great friend of minea friend of ten years standingcame to see me some time ago and told me that he did not believe a single word of what was said against me and wished me to know that he considered me quite innocent and the victim of a hideous plot  i burst into tears at what he said and told him that while there was much amongst the definite charges that was quite untrue and transferred to me by revolting malice still that my life had been full of perverse pleasures and that unless he accepted that as a fact about me and realised it to the full i could not possibly be friends with him any more or ever be in his company  it was a terrible shock to him but we are friends and i have not got his friendship on false pretences  emotional forces as i say somewhere in intentions are as limited in extent and duration as the forces of physical energy  the little cup that is made to hold so much can hold so much and no more though all the purple vats of burgundy be filled with wine to the brim and the treaders stand kneedeep in the gathered grapes of the stony vineyards of spain there is no error more common than that of thinking that those who are the causes or occasions of great tragedies share in the feelings suitable to the tragic mood no error more fatal than expecting it of them  the martyr in his shirt of flame may be looking on the face of god but to him who is piling the faggots or loosening the logs for the blast the whole scene is no more than the slaying of an ox is to the butcher or the felling of a tree to the charcoal burner in the forest or the fall of a flower to one who is mowing down the grass with a scythe  great passions are for the great of soul and great events can be seen only by those who are on a level with them        i know of nothing in all drama more incomparable from the point of view of art nothing more suggestive in its subtlety of observation than shakespeares drawing of rosencrantz and guildenstern  they are hamlets college friends  they have been his companions  they bring with them memories of pleasant days together  at the moment when they come across him in the play he is staggering under the weight of a burden intolerable to one of his temperament  the dead have come armed out of the grave to impose on him a mission at once too great and too mean for him  he is a dreamer and he is called upon to act  he has the nature of the poet and he is asked to grapple with the common complexity of cause and effect with life in its practical realisation of which he knows nothing not with life in its ideal essence of which he knows so much he has no conception of what to do and his folly is to feign folly brutus used madness as a cloak to conceal the sword of his purpose the dagger of his will but the hamlet madness is a mere mask for the hiding of weakness  in the making of fancies and jests he sees a chance of delay  he keeps playing with action as an artist plays with a theory  he makes himself the spy of his proper actions and listening to his own words knows them to be but words words words  instead of trying to be the hero of his own history he seeks to be the spectator of his own tragedy  he disbelieves in everything including himself and yet his doubt helps him not as it comes not from scepticism but from a divided will  of all this guildenstern and rosencrantz realise nothing  they bow and smirk and smile and what the one says the other echoes with sickliest intonation  when at last by means of the play within the play and the puppets in their dalliance hamlet catches the conscience of the king and drives the wretched man in terror from his throne guildenstern and rosencrantz see no more in his conduct than a rather painful breach of court etiquette  that is as far as they can attain to in the contemplation of the spectacle of life with appropriate emotions  they are close to his very secret and know nothing of it  nor would there be any use in telling them  they are the little cups that can hold so much and no more  towards the close it is suggested that caught in a cunning spring set for another they have met or may meet with a violent and sudden death  but a tragic ending of this kind though touched by hamlets humour with something of the surprise and justice of comedy is really not for such as they  they never die  horatio who in order to report hamlet and his cause aright to the unsatisfied     absents him from felicity a while    and in this harsh world draws his breath in pain  dies but guildenstern and rosencrantz are as immortal as angelo and tartuffe and should rank with them  they are what modern life has contributed to the antique ideal of friendship  he who writes a new de amicitia must find a niche for them and praise them in tusculan prose they are types fixed for all time  to censure them would show a lack of appreciation  they are merely out of their sphere that is all  in sublimity of soul there is no contagion  high thoughts and high emotions are by their very existence isolated        i am to be released if all goes well with me towards the end of may and hope to go at once to some little seaside village abroad with r and m  the sea as euripides says in one of his plays about iphigeneia washes away the stains and wounds of the world  i hope to be at least a month with my friends and to gain peace and balance and a less troubled heart and a sweeter mood  i have a strange longing for the great simple primeval things such as the sea to me no less of a mother than the earth  it seems to me that we all look at nature too much and live with her too little  i discern great sanity in the greek attitude  they never chattered about sunsets or discussed whether the shadows on the grass were really mauve or not  but they saw that the sea was for the swimmer and the sand for the feet of the runner  they loved the trees for the shadow that they cast and the forest for its silence at noon  the vineyarddresser wreathed his hair with ivy that he might keep off the rays of the sun as he stooped over the young shoots and for the artist and the athlete the two types that greece gave us they plaited with garlands the leaves of the bitter laurel and of the wild parsley which else had been of no service to men  we call ours a utilitarian age and we do not know the uses of any single thing  we have forgotten that water can cleanse and fire purify and that the earth is mother to us all  as a consequence our art is of the moon and plays with shadows while greek art is of the sun and deals directly with things  i feel sure that in elemental forces there is purification and i want to go back to them and live in their presence  of course to one so modern as i am enfant de mon siecle merely to look at the world will be always lovely  i tremble with pleasure when i think that on the very day of my leaving prison both the laburnum and the lilac will be blooming in the gardens and that i shall see the wind stir into restless beauty the swaying gold of the one and make the other toss the pale purple of its plumes so that all the air shall be arabia for me  linnaeus fell on his knees and wept for joy when he saw for the first time the long heath of some english upland made yellow with the tawny aromatic brooms of the common furze and i know that for me to whom flowers are part of desire there are tears waiting in the petals of some rose  it has always been so with me from my boyhood  there is not a single colour hidden away in the chalice of a flower or the curve of a shell to which by some subtle sympathy with the very soul of things my nature does not answer  like gautier i have always been one of those pour qui le monde visible existe  still i am conscious now that behind all this beauty satisfying though it may be there is some spirit hidden of which the painted forms and shapes are but modes of manifestation and it is with this spirit that i desire to become in harmony  i have grown tired of the articulate utterances of men and things  the mystical in art the mystical in life the mystical in nature this is what i am looking for  it is absolutely necessary for me to find it somewhere  all trials are trials for ones life just as all sentences are sentences of death and three times have i been tried  the first time i left the box to be arrested the second time to be led back to the house of detention the third time to pass into a prison for two years  society as we have constituted it will have no place for me has none to offer but nature whose sweet rains fall on unjust and just alike will have clefts in the rocks where i may hide and secret valleys in whose silence i may weep undisturbed  she will hang the night with stars so that i may walk abroad in the darkness without stumbling and send the wind over my footprints so that none may track me to my hurt she will cleanse me in great waters and with bitter herbs make me whole
