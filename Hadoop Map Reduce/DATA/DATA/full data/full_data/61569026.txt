61569026	mosses from an old manse                        by nathaniel hawthorne                            fire worship    it is a great revolution in social and domestic life and no less so in the life of a secluded student this almost universal exchange of the open fireplace for the cheerless and ungenial stove  on such a morning as now lowers around our old gray parsonage i miss the bright face of my ancient friend who was wont to dance upon the hearth and play the part of more familiar sunshine  it is sad to turn from the cloudy sky and sombre landscape from yonder hill with its crown of rusty black pines the foliage of which is so dismal in the absence of the sun that bleak pastureland and the broken surface of the potatofield with the brown clods partly concealed by the snowfall of last night the swollen and sluggish river with iceincrusted borders dragging its bluishgray stream along the verge of our orchard like a snake half torpid with the coldit is sad to turn from an outward scene of so little comfort and find the same sullen influences brooding within the precincts of my study  where is that brilliant guest that quick and subtle spirit whom prometheus lured from heaven to civilize mankind and cheer them in their wintry desolation that comfortable inmate whose smile during eight months of the year was our sufficient consolation for summers lingering advance and early flight alas blindly inhospitable grudging the food that kept him cheery and mercurial we have thrust him into an iron prison and compel him to smoulder away his life on a daily pittance which once would have been too scanty for his breakfast  without a metaphor we now make our fire in an airtight stove and supply it with some half a dozen sticks of wood between dawn and nightfall  i never shall be reconciled to this enormity  truly may it be said that the world looks darker for it  in one way or another here and there and all around us the inventions of mankind are fast blotting the picturesque the poetic and the beautiful out of human life the domestic fire was a type of all these attributes and seemed to bring might and majesty and wild nature and a spiritual essence into our in most home and yet to dwell with us in such friendliness that its mysteries and marvels excited no dismay  the same mild companion that smiled so placidly in our faces was he that comes roaring out of aetna and rushes madly up the sky like a fiend breaking loose from torment and fighting for a place among the upper angels  he it is too that leaps from cloud to cloud amid the crashing thunderstorm it was he whom the gheber worshipped with no unnatural idolatry and it was he who devoured london and moscow and many another famous city and who loves to riot through our own dark forests and sweep across our prairies and to whose ravenous maw it is said the universe shall one day be given as a final feast meanwhile he is the great artisan and laborer by whose aid men are enabled to build a world within a world or at least to smooth down the rough creation which nature flung to it  he forges the mighty anchor and every lesser instrument he drives the steamboat and drags the railcar and it was hethis creature of terrible might and so manysided utility and allcomprehensive destructivenessthat used to be the cheerful homely friend of our wintry days and whom we have made the prisoner of this iron cage  how kindly he was and though the tremendous agent of change yet bearing himself with such gentleness so rendering himself a part of all lifelong and agecoeval associations that it seemed as if he were the great conservative of nature  while a man was true to the fireside so long would he be true to country and law to the god whom his fathers worshipped to the wife of his youth and to all things else which instinct or religion has taught us to consider sacred  with how sweet humility did this elemental spirit perform all needful offices for the household in which he was domesticated he was equal to the concoction of a grand dinner yet scorned not to roast a potato or toast a bit of cheese  how humanely did he cherish the schoolboys icy fingers and thaw the old mans joints with a genial warmth which almost equalled the glow of youth  and how carefully did he dry the cowhide boots that had trudged through mud and snow and the shaggy outside garment stiff with frozen sleet taking heed likewise to the comfort of the faithful dog who had followed his master through the storm  when did he refuse a coal to light a pipe or even a part of his own substance to kindle a neighbors fire  and then at twilight when laborer or scholar or mortal of whatever age sex or degree drew a chair beside him and looked into his glowing face how acute how profound how comprehensive was his sympathy with the mood of each and all  he pictured forth their very thoughts  to the youthful he showed the scenes of the adventurous life before them to the aged the shadows of departed love and hope and if all earthly things had grown distasteful he could gladden the fireside muser with golden glimpses of a better world  and amid this varied communion with the human soul how busily would the sympathizer the deep moralist the painter of magic pictures be causing the teakettle to boil  nor did it lessen the charm of his soft familiar courtesy and helpfulness that the mighty spirit were opportunity offered him would run riot through the peaceful house wrap its inmates in his terrible embrace and leave nothing of them save their whitened bones  this possibility of mad destruction only made his domestic kindness the more beautiful and touching  it was so sweet of him being endowed with such power to dwell day after day and one long lonesome night after another on the dusky hearth only now and then betraying his wild nature by thrusting his red tongue out of the chimneytop  true he had done much mischief in the world and was pretty certain to do more but his warm heart atoned for all  he was kindly to the race of man and they pardoned his characteristic imperfections  the good old clergyman my predecessor in this mansion was well acquainted with the comforts of the fireside  his yearly allowance of wood according to the terms of his settlement was no less than sixty cords  almost an annual forest was converted from sound oak logs into ashes in the kitchen the parlor and this little study where now an unworthy successor not in the pastoral office but merely in his earthly abode sits scribbling beside an airtight stove  i love to fancy one of those fireside days while the good man a contemporary of the revolution was in his early prime some fiveandsixty years ago  before sunrise doubtless the blaze hovered upon the gray skirts of night and dissolved the frostwork that had gathered like a curtain over the small windowpanes  there is something peculiar in the aspect of the morning fireside a fresher brisker glare the absence of that mellowness which can be produced only by halfconsumed logs and shapeless brands with the white ashes on them and mighty coals the remnant of treetrunks that the hungry elements have gnawed for hours  the morning hearth too is newly swept and the brazen andirons well brightened so that the cheerful fire may see its face in them surely it was happiness when the pastor fortified with a substantial breakfast sat down in his armchair and slippers and opened the whole body of divinity or the commentary on job or whichever of his old folios or quartos might fall within the range of his weekly sermons  it must have been his own fault if the warmth and glow of this abundant hearth did not permeate the discourse and keep his audience comfortable in spite of the bitterest northern blast that ever wrestled with the churchsteeple he reads while the heat warps the stiff covers of the volume he writes without numbness either in his heart or fingers and with unstinted hand he throws fresh sticks of wood upon the fire  a parishioner comes in  with what warmth of benevolencehow should he be otherwise than warm in any of his attributesdoes the minister bid him welcome and set a chair for him in so close proximity to the hearth that soon the guest finds it needful to rub his scorched shins with his great red hands  the melted snow drips from his steaming boots and bubbles upon the hearth  his puckered forehead unravels its entanglement of crisscross wrinkles  we lose much of the enjoyment of fireside heat without such an opportunity of marking its genial effect upon those who have been looking the inclement weather in the face  in the course of the day our clergyman himself strides forth perchance to pay a round of pastoral visits or it may he to visit his mountain of a woodpile and cleave the monstrous logs into billets suitable for the fire he returns with fresher life to his beloved hearth  during the short afternoon the western sunshine comes into the study and strives to stare the ruddy blaze out of countenance but with only a brief triumph soon to be succeeded by brighter glories of its rival  beautiful it is to see the strengthening gleam the deepening light that gradually casts distinct shadows of the human figure the table and the highbacked chairs upon the opposite wall and at length as twilight comes on replenishes the room with living radiance and makes life all rosecolor  afar the wayfarer discerns the flickering flame as it dances upon the windows and hails it as a beaconlight of humanity reminding him in his cold and lonely path that the world is not all snow and solitude and desolation  at eventide probably the study was peopled with the clergymans wife and family and children tumbled themselves upon the hearthrug and grave puss sat with her back to the fire or gazed with a semblance of human meditation into its fervid depths seasonably the plenteous ashes of the day were raked over the mouldering brands and from the heap came jets of flame and an incense of nightlong smoke creeping quietly up the chimney  heaven forgive the old clergyman  in his later life when for almost ninety winters he had been gladdened by the firelightwhen it had gleamed upon him from infancy to extreme age and never without brightening his spirits as well as his visage and perhaps keeping him alive so longhe had the heart to brick up his chimneyplace and bid farewell to the face of his old friend forever why did he not take an eternal leave of the sunshine too his sixty cords of wood had probably dwindled to a far less ample supply in modern times and it is certain that the parsonage had grown crazy with time and tempest and pervious to the cold but still it was one of the saddest tokens of the decline and fall of open fireplaces that the gray patriarch should have deigned to warm himself at an airtight stove  and i likewisewho have found a home in this ancient owlsnest since its former occupant took his heavenward flighti to my shame have put up stoves in kitchen and parlor and chamber wander where you will about the house not a glimpse of the earthborn heavenaspiring fiend of etnahim that sports in the thunderstorm the idol of the ghebers the devourer of cities the forestrioter and prairiesweeper the future destroyer of our earth the old chimneycorner companion who mingled himself so sociably with household joys and sorrowsnot a glimpse of this mighty and kindly one will greet your eyes  he is now an invisible presence  there is his iron cage  touch it and he scorches your fingers  he delights to singe a garment or perpetrate any other little unworthy mischief for his temper is ruined by the ingratitude of mankind for whom he cherished such warmth of feeling and to whom he taught all their arts even that of making his own prisonhouse  in his fits of rage he puffs volumes of smoke and noisome gas through the crevices of the door and shakes the iron walls of his dungeon so as to overthrow the ornamental urn upon its summit  we tremble lest he should break forth amongst us  much of his time is spent in sighs burdened with unutterable grief and long drawn through the funnel he amuses himself too with repeating all the whispers the moans and the louder utterances or tempestuous howls of the wind so that the stove becomes a microcosm of the aerial world  occasionally there are strange combinations of soundsvoices talking almost articulately within the hollow chest of ironinsomuch that fancy beguiles me with the idea that my firewood must have grown in that infernal forest of lamentable trees which breathed their complaints to dante  when the listener is half asleep he may readily take these voices for the conversation of spirits and assign them an intelligible meaning  anon there is a pattering noisedrip drip dripas if a summer shower were falling within the narrow circumference of the stove  these barren and tedious eccentricities are all that the airtight stove can bestow in exchange for the invaluable moral influences which we have lost by our desertion of the open fireplace  alas is this world so very bright that we can afford to choke up such a domestic fountain of gladsomeness and sit down by its darkened source without being conscious of a gloom  it is my belief that social intercourse cannot long continue what it has been now that we have subtracted from it so important and vivifying an element as firelight  the effects will be more perceptible on our children and the generations that shall succeed them than on ourselves the mechanism of whose life may remain unchanged though its spirit be far other than it was the sacred trust of the household fire has been transmitted in unbroken succession from the earliest ages and faithfully cherished in spite of every discouragement such as the curfew law of the norman conquerors until in these evil days physical science has nearly succeeded in extinguishing it  but we at least have our youthful recollections tinged with the glow of the hearth and our lifelong habits and associations arranged on the principle of a mutual bond in the domestic fire  therefore though the sociable friend be forever departed yet in a degree he will be spiritually present with us and still more will the empty forms which were once full of his rejoicing presence continue to rule our manners  we shall draw our chairs together as we and our forefathers have been wont for thousands of years back and sit around some blank and empty corner of the room babbling with unreal cheerfulness of topics suitable to the homely fireside  a warmth from the pastfrom the ashes of bygone years and the rakedup embers of long agowill sometimes thaw the ice about our hearts but it must be otherwise with our successors  on the most favorable supposition they will be acquainted with the fireside in no better shape than that of the sullen stove and more probably they will have grown up amid furnace heat in houses which might be fancied to have their foundation over the infernal pit whence sulphurous steams and unbreathable exhalations ascend through the apertures of the floor  there will be nothing to attract these poor children to one centre  they will never behold one another through that peculiar medium of vision the ruddy gleam of blazing wood or bituminous coalwhich gives the human spirit so deep an insight into its fellows and melts all humanity into one cordial heart of hearts  domestic life if it may still be termed domestic will seek its separate corners and never gather itself into groups the easy gossip the merry yet unambitious jest the lifelike practical discussion of real matters in a casual way the soul of truth which is so often incarnated in a simple fireside wordwill disappear from earth conversation will contract the air of debate and all mortal intercourse be chilled with a fatal frost  in classic times the exhortation to fight pro axis et focis for the altars and the hearths was considered the strongest appeal that could be made to patriotism  and it seemed an immortal utterance for all subsequent ages and people have acknowledged its force and responded to it with the full portion of manhood that nature had assigned to each  wisely were the altar and the hearth conjoined in one mighty sentence for the hearth too had its kindred sanctity religion sat down beside it not in the priestly robes which decorated and perhaps disguised her at the altar but arrayed in a simple matrons garb and uttering her lessons with the tenderness of a mothers voice and heart  the holy hearth  if any earthly and material thing or rather a divine idea embodied in brick and mortar might be supposed to possess the permanence of moral truth it was this  all revered it  the man who did not put off his shoes upon this holy ground would have deemed it pastime to trample upon the altar  it has been our task to uproot the hearth  what further reform is left for our children to achieve unless they overthrow the altar too  and by what appeal hereafter when the breath of hostile armies may mingle with the pure cold breezes of our country shall we attempt to rouse up native valor  fight for your hearths  there will be none throughout the land  fight for your stoves  not i in faith  if in such a cause i strike a blow it shall be on the invaders part and heaven grant that it may shatter the abomination all to pieces
