was blissfully and completely ignorant of the fact stood at the door of fate he was a little out of breath and his silk hat was reclining at the back of his head in his mouth was a large cigar which he felt certain was going to disagree with him but he smoked it because it had been presented to him a few minutes ago by the client upon whom he was in attendance he had rather deepset blue eyes which might have been attractive but for a certain keenness in their outlook which was in a sense indicative of the methods and character of the young man himself a pale characterless face a straggling sandy moustache and an earnest not to say convincing manner he was dressed in such garments as the headclerk of messrs waddington  forbes thirdrate auctioneers and house agents might have been expected to select he dangled a bunch of keys in his hand  if this house dont suit you sir he declared confidently why there isnt one in the whole westend that will thats my opinion anyway theres nothing in our books to compare with it for value and accommodation we nearly let it last week to lord leconside but her ladyshipshe came round with me herselfdecided that it was just a trifle too large as a matter of fact sir this energetic young man went on confidentially the governor insisted upon a deposit and it didnt seem to be exactly convenient it isnt always these people with titles whove got the money that we find out in our business sir as quickly as anybody as for the steam heating you were talking about mr lynn why thats all very well for new york he continued persuasively but over here the climate doesnt call for ityou can take it from me that it doesnt indeed mr lynn i have the letting in my hands of as many houses as most people and you can take it from me sir as the direct result of my experience that over here they wont have itwont have it at any price sir most unhealthy we find it and always produces a rare crop of colds and coughs unknown to those that are used to an honest coal fire its all a matter of climate sir after all isnt it  the young man paused to take breath his client who had been listening attentively in gloomy but not unappreciative silence removed his cigar from his mouth he was a middleaged american with a wife and daughters on their way over from new york and his business was to take a house before they arrived it wasnt a job he liked but he was making the best of it this young man appealed to his sense of business  say he remarked approvingly youve learned how to talk in your trade  stimulated by this encouragement alfred burton clapped on his hat a little more securely took a long breath and went at it again  why im giving myself a rest this morning sir he declared i havent troubled to tell you more than the bare facts this house doesnt need any talking aboutdoesnt need a word said about it her ladyships last words to us werelady idlemay you know the owner of the housemr waddington and mr burton she saidshe was speaking to us both for the governor always introduces me to clients as being the one who does most of the lettingmr waddington and mr burton she said if a tenant comes along whom you think id like to have living in my rooms and using my furniture breathing my air so to speak why go ahead and let the house rents being shockingly low just now with agricultural depression and what not but sooner than not let it to gentlepeople ill do without the money her ladyship declared now youre just the sort of tenant shed like to have here im quite sure of that mr lynn i should take a pleasure in bringing you two together  mr lynn grunted he was perfectly well aware that the house would seem more desirable to his wife and daughters from the very fact that it belonged to a lady anybody he was perfectly well aware also that his companion had suspected this the consideration of these facts left him however unaffected he was disposed if anything to admire the cleverness of the young man who had realized an outside asset  well ive seen pretty well all over it he remarked ill go back to the office with you anyhow and have a word with mr waddington by the way whats that room behind you  the young man glanced carelessly around at the door of the room of fate and down at the bunch of keys which he held in his hand he even chuckled as he replied  i was going to mention the matter of that room sir he replied because if perfectly agreeable to the tenant her ladyship would like to keep it locked up  locked up mr lynn repeated and why  regular queer story sir the young man declared confidentially the late earl was a great traveller in the east as you may have heard and he was always poking about in some ruined city or other in the desert and picking up things and making discoveries well last time he came home from abroad he brought with him an old egyptian or arabi dont know which he was but he was brownsettled him down in this roomin his own house mindand wouldnt have him disturbed or interfered with not at any price well the old chap worked here night and day at some sort of writing and then naturally enough what with not having the sort of grub he liked and never going outside the doors he croaked  he what mr lynn interposed  he died the young man explained it was just about the time that the earl was ill himself his lordship gave orders that the body was to be buried and the room locked up in case the old chaps heirs should come along seems hed brought a few odd things of his own overnothing whatever of any value anyway those were lord idlemays wishes and the room has been locked up ever since  mr lynn was interested  no objection to our just looking inside i suppose  none whatever the young man declared promptly i was going to have a peep myself here goes  he fitted the key in the lock and pushed the door open mr lynn took one step forward and drew back hurriedly  thanks he said thatll do ive seen all i wantand smelt  mr alfred burton fortunately or unfortunately was possessed of less sensitive nasal organs and an indomitable curiosity the room was dark and stuffy and a wave of pungent odor swept out upon them with the opening of the door nevertheless he did not immediately close it  one moment he muttered peering inside ill just look around and see that everything is in order  he crossed the threshold and passed into the room it was certainly a curious apartment the walls were hung not with paper at all but with rugs of some oriental material which had the effect of still further increasing the gloom there were neither chairs nor tablesno furniture at all in fact of any account but in the furthest corner was a great pile of cushions and on the floor by the side a plain strip of sandalwood covered with a purple cloth on which were several squareshaped sheets of paper a brass inkstand and a bundle of quill pens on the extreme corner of this strip of wood which seemed to have been used as a writing desk by some one reclining upon the cushions was the strangest article of all alfred burton stared at it with wideopen eyes it was a tiny plant growing out of a smallsized flowerpot with real green leaves and a cluster of queer little brown fruit hanging down from among them  jiminy the clerk exclaimed i say mr lynn sir  but mr lynn had gone off to pace the diningroom once more burton moved slowly forward and stooped down over the cushions he took up the sheets of paper which lay upon the slab of sandalwood they were covered with wholly indecipherable characters save for the last page only and there even as he stood with it in his fingers he saw underneath the concluding paragraph of those unintelligible hieroglyphics a few words of faintly traced english laboriously printed probably a translation he struck a match and read them slowly out to himself   it is finished the nineteenth generation has triumphed he who shall eat of the brown fruit of this tree shall see the things of life and death as they are he who shall eat the translation concluded abruptly mr alfred burton removed his silk hat and reflectively scratched his head  queer sort of joker he must have been he remarked to himself i wonder what he was getting at  his eyes fell upon the little tree he felt the earth in the pot it was quite dry yet the tree itself was fresh and green  here goes for a brown bean he continued and plucked one  even then while he held it in his fingers he hesitated  dont suppose it will do me any harm he muttered doubtfully  there was naturally no reply mr alfred burton laughed uneasily to himself the shadows of the room and its curious perfume were a trifle disconcerting  risk it anyway he concluded here goes he raised the little brown fruitwhich did indeed somewhat resemble a beanto his mouth and swallowed it he found it quite tasteless but the deed was no sooner done than he was startled by a curious buzzing in his ears and a momentary but peculiar lapse of memory he sat and looked around him like a man who has been asleep and suddenly awakened in unfamiliar surroundings then the sound of his clients voice suddenly recalled him to himself he started up and peered through the gloom  whos there he asked sharply  say young man i am waiting for you when youre quite ready mr lynn remarked from the threshold queer sort of atmosphere in there isnt it  mr alfred burton came slowly out and locked the door of the room even then he was dimly conscious that something had happened to him he hated the musty odor of the place the dusty unswept hall and the general air of desertion he wanted to get out into the street and he hurried his client toward the front door as soon as he had locked up he breathed a little sigh of relief  what a delicious soft wind he exclaimed removing his unsightly hat really i think that when we get a sunny day like this april is almost our most beautiful month  mr lynn stared at his companion who was now slowly descending the steps  say about this house he began i guess id better take it it may not be exactly what i want but it seems to me to be about as near as anything i am likely to find well go round to the office right away and fix things up  mr alfred burton shook his head doubtfully  i dont think i would take it if i were you mr lynn he said  mr lynn stopped short upon the pavement and looked at his companion in amazement the latter had the air of one very little interested in the subject of conversation he was watching approvingly a barrowful of lilac and other spring flowers being wheeled along by a flowerseller in the middle of the road  what an exquisite perfume the young man murmured enthusiastically doesnt it remind you mr lynn of a beautiful garden somewhere right away in the countryone of those oldfashioned gardens you know with narrow paths where you have to push your way through the flowers and where there are always great beds of pink and white stocks near the box edges and do you noticean accident of coursebut what a delicate blend of color the lilac and those yellow jonquils make  i cant smell anything the american declared a little impatiently and i dont know as i want to just now i am here to talk business if you dont mind  in one moment burton replied excuse me for one moment if you please  he hastened across the street and returned a moment or two later with a bunch of violets in his hand mr lynn watched him partly in amazement partly in disapproval there seemed to be very little left of the smart businesslike young man whose methods only a short time ago had commanded his unwilling admiration mr alfred burtons expression had undergone a complete change his eyes had lost their calculating twinkle his mouth had softened a pleasant but somewhat abstracted smile had taken the place of his forced amiability  you will forgive me wont you he said as he regained the pavement i really havent smelt violets before this year spring comes upon us londoners so suddenly  about that house now the american insisted a little sharply  certainly burton replied removing his eyes unwillingly from the passing barrow i really dont think you had better take it mr lynn you see it is not generally known but there is no doubt that lord idlemay had typhoid fever there  typhoid mr lynn exclaimed incredulously  his companion nodded  two of the servants were down with it as well he continued we implored lady idlemay when she offered us the letting of the house to have the drains put in thorough order but when we got the estimate out for her she absolutely declined to tell you the truth the best agents had all refused under the circumstances to have the house upon their books at all that is why we got the letting of it  mr lynn removed the cigar from his mouth for a moment there was a slight frown upon his forehead he was puzzled  say youre not getting at me for any reason are you he demanded  my dear sir burton protested eagerly i am simply doing my duty and telling you the truth the house is not in a fit state to be let to any onecertainly not to a man with a family if you will permit me to say so you are not going the right way to secure a suitable house you simply walked into our office because you saw the sign up and listened to anything the governor had to say we havent any westend houses at all upon our books it isnt our business unfortunately miller  sons or roscoes are the best people no one would even come to see you at idlemay house much less stay with youthe place has such a bad reputation  then will you be good enough to just explain to me why you were cracking it up like blazes only a few minutes ago mr lynn demanded indignantly i nearly took the darned place  mr burton shook his head penitently  i am afraid that i cannot explain sir he confessed to tell you the truth i do not understand in the least how i could have brought myself to be so untruthful i am only thankful that no harm has been done  they had reached the corner of the street in which the offices of messrs waddington  forbes were situated mr lynn came to a full stop  i cant see but what we might just as well part here young man he declared theres no use in my coming to your office after what youve told me  not the slightest mr burton admitted frankly in fact you are better away mr waddington would certainly try to persuade you to take the house if youll accept my advice sir you will go to miller  sons in st jamess place they have all the best houses on their books and they are almost certain to find something to suit you  mr lynn gazed once more at his companion curiously  say im not quite sure that i can size you up even now he said at first i thought that you were a rare little hustler right on the job i was set against that house and yet you almost persuaded me into taking it whats come over you anyway  mr burton shook his head dubiously  i am afraid that it is no use asking me he replied for i really dont quite know myself  mr lynn still lingered the longer he looked at his companion the more he appreciated the subtle change of demeanor and language which had certainly transformed mr alfred burton  it was after you came out of that little room he continued meditatively where that oriental fellow had been shut up the more i think of it the odder it seems you were as perky as mustard when you went in and youve been sort of dazed ever since you came out  mr burton lifted his hat  good day sir he said i trust that you will find a residence to suit you  mr lynn strolled off with a puzzled frown upon his forehead and alfred burton with a slight gesture of aversion pushed open the swinging doors which led into the offices of messrs waddington  forbes    chapter ii  a transformation  burton stood for a moment upon the threshold of the office looking around him a new and peculiar distaste for these familiar surroundings seemed suddenly to have sprung into life for the first time he realized the intense ugliness of this scene of his daily labors the long desk inksplashed and decrepit was covered with untidy piles of papers some of them thick with dust the walls were hung with seedylooking files and an array of tattered bills there were cobwebs in every corner gaps in the linoleum floorcovering in front of the officeboya youth about fourteen years of age who represented the remaining clerical staff of the establishmentwere pinned up several illustrations cut out from comic cuts the police news and various other publications of a similar order as burton looked around him his distaste grew it seemed impossible that he had ever existed for an hour amid such an environment the prospect of the future was suddenly hugely distasteful  very slowly he changed his coat and climbed on to his worn horsehair stool without exchanging his usual facetious badinage with the remaining member of the staff the officeboy who had thought of something good to say rather resented his silence it forced him into taking the initiative a position which placed him from the first at a disadvantage  any luck with the yank mr burton he inquired with anxious civility  burton shook his head  none at all he confessed he wouldnt have anything to do with the house  has any one been letting on to him about it do you think  i dont think so burton replied i dont think any one else has mentioned it to him at all he seems to be a complete stranger here  couldnt have been quite at your best could you mr burton sir not your usual bright and eloquent self eh  the boy grinned and then ducked expecting a missile none came however alfred burton was in a very puzzled state of mind and he neither showed nor indeed felt any resentment he turned and faced his subordinate  i really dont know clarkson he admitted i am sure that i was quite polite and i showed him everything he wished to see but of course i had to tell him the truth about the place  the what young clarkson inquired in a mystified tone  the truth burton repeated  wot yer mean  about the typhoid and that burton explained mildly  the officeboy pondered for a moment then he slowly opened a ledger drew a daybook towards him and continued his work he was being jollied of course but the thing was too subtle for him at present he decided to wait for the next move burton continued to regard his subordinate however and by degrees an expression of pained disapproval crept into his face  clarkson he said if you will forgive my mentioning a purely personal matter why do you wear such uncomfortable collars and such an exceedingly unbecoming tie  the officeboy swung round upon his stool his mouth was wide open like a rabbits he fingered the offending articles  whats the matter with them he demanded getting his question out with a single breath  your collars are much too high burton pointed out one can see how they cut into your neck then why wear a tie of that particular shade of vivid purple when your clothes themselves with that blue and yellow stripe are somewhat noticeable there is a lack of symphony about the arrangement an entire absence of taste which is apt to depress one the whole effect which you produce upon ones vision is abominable you wont think my mentioning this a liberty i hope  what about your own red tie and dirty collar young clarkson asked indignantly what price your eight and sixpenny trousers eh with the blue stripe and the grease stains what about the sham diamond stud in your dickey and your three inches of pinned on cuff fancy your appearance perhaps why i wouldnt walk the streets in such a rigout  burton listened to his juniors attack unresentingly but with increasing bewilderment then he slipped from his seat and walked hurriedly across to the lookingglass which he took down from its nail he gazed at himself long and steadily and from every possible angle it is probable that for the first time in his life he saw himself then as he really was he was plain of insignificant appearance he was ill and tastelessly dressed he stood there before the sixpennyhapenny mirror and drank the cup of humiliation  calling my tie indeed the officeboy muttered his smouldering resentment bringing him back to the attack present from my best girl that was and she knows whats what young lady with a place in a westend milliners shop too if that doesnt mean good taste i should like to know what does look at your socks too all coming down over the tops of your boots nasty dirty pink and green stripes theres another thing about my collar too he continued speaking with renewed earnestness as he appreciated his seniors stupefaction it was clean yesterday and thats more than yours wasor the day before  burton shivered as he finally turned away from that lookingglass the expression upon his face was indescribable  i am sorry i spoke clarkson he apologized humbly it certainly seemed to have slipped my memory that i myselfi cant think how i managed to make such hideous unforgivable mistakes  while we are upon the subject his subordinate continued ruthlessly why dont you give your fingernails a scrub sometimes eh you might give your coat a brush too now and then while you are about it all covered with scurf and dust about the shoulders im all for cleanliness i am  burton made no reply he was down and his junior kicked him  id like to see the color of your shirt if you took those paper cuffs off the latter exclaimed why dont you chuck that rotten dickey away cave  the door leading into the private office was brusquely opened mr waddington the only existing member of the firm entereda large untidylooking man also dressed in most uncomely fashion and wearing an illbrushed silk hat on the back of his head he turned at once to his righthand man  well did you land him he demanded with some eagerness  burton shook his head regretfully  it was quite impossible to interest him in the house at all sir he declared he seemed inclined to take it at first but directly he understood the situation he would have nothing more to do with it  mr waddingtons face fell he was disappointed he was also puzzled  understood the situation he repeated what the dickens do you mean burton what situation  i mean about the typhoid sir and lady idlemays refusal to have the drains put in order  mr waddingtons expression for a few moments was an interesting and instructive study his jaw had fallen but he was still too bewildered to realize the situation properly  but who told him he gasped  i did burton replied gently i could not possibly let him remain in ignorance of the facts  you couldntwhat  i could not let him the house without explaining all the circumstances sir burton declared watching his senior anxiously i am sure you would not have wished me to do anything of the sort would you  what mr waddington said was unimportant there was very little that he forgot and he was an auctioneer with a lowclass clientele and a fine flow of language when he had finished the officeboy was dumb with admiration burton was looking a little pained and he had the shocked expression of a musician who has been listening to a series of discords otherwise he was unmoved  your duty was to let that house mr waddington wound up striking the palm of one hand with the fist of the other what do i give you fortyfour shillings a week for i should like to know to go and blab trade secrets to every customer that comes along if you couldnt get him to sign the lease you ought to have worked a deposit at any rate hed have had to forfeit that even if hed found out afterwards  i am sorry burton said speaking in a much lower tone than was usual with him but with a curious amount of confidence it would have been a moral falsehood if i had attempted anything of the sort i could not possibly offer the house to mr lynn or anybody else without disclosing its drawbacks  the auctioneers face had become redder his eyes seemed on the point of coming out of his head he became almost incoherent  god bless my soul he spluttered have you gone mad burton whats come to you since the morning have you changed into a blithering fool or what  i think not sir burton replied gravely i dontexactly remember for the moment he went on with a slight frown my head seems a little confused but i cannot believe that it has been our custom to conduct our business in the fashion you are suggesting  mr waddington walked round the office holding his head between his hands  i dont suppose either of us has been drinking at this hour in the morning he muttered when he came to a standstill once more look here burton i dont want to do anything rash go homenever mind the timego home this minute before i break out again come tomorrow morning as usual well talk it out then god bless my soul he added as burton picked up his hat with a little sigh of relief and turned toward the door either im drunk or the fellows got religion or something i never heard such infernal rubbish in my life  made a nasty remark about my tie just now sir clarkson said with dignity as his senior disappeared quite uncalled for i dont fancy he can be well  ever known him like it before mr waddington inquired  never sir i thought he seemed chippier than ever this morning when he went out his last words were that hed bet me a packet of woodbines that he landed the old fool  hes gone dotty the auctioneer decided as he turned back towards his sanctum hes either gone dotty or hes been drinking the last chap in the world i should have thought it of   the mental attitude of alfred burton as he emerged into the street was in some respects curious he was not in the least sorry for what had happened on the contrary he found himself wishing that the days respite had not been granted to him and that his departure from the place of his employment was final he was very much in the position of a man who has been transferred without warning or notice from the streets of london to the streets of pekin every object which he saw he looked upon with different eyes every face which he passed produced a different impression upon him he looked about him with all the avidity of one suddenly conscious of a great store of unused impressions it was like a second birth he neither understood the situation nor attempted to analyze it he was simply conscious of a most delightful and inexplicable lightheartedness and of a host of sensations which seemed to produce at every moment some new pleasure his first and most pressing anxiety was a singular one he loathed himself from head to foot he shuddered as he passed the shopwindows for fear he should see his own reflection he made his way unfalteringly to an outfitters shop and from there with a bundle under his arm to the baths it was a very different alfred burton indeed who an hour or two later issued forth into the streets gone was the cockney young man with the sandy moustache the cheap silk hat worn at various angles to give himself a rakish air the flashy clothes cheap and pretentious the assured not to say bumptious air so sedulously copied from the deportment of his employer enter a new and completely transformed alfred burton an inoffensivelooking young man in a neat gray suit a lilaccolored tie of delicate shade a flannel shirt with no pretence at cuffs but with a spotless turned down collar a soft homburg hat a cleanshaven lip with a new sense of selfrespect and an immense feeling of relief burton after a few moments hesitation directed his footsteps towards the national gallery he had once been there years ago on a wet bank holiday and some faint instinct of memory which somehow or other had survived the burden of his sordid days suddenly reasserted itself he climbed the steps and passed through the portals with the beating heart of the explorer who climbs his last hill it was his entrance this into the new world whose call was tearing at his heartstrings he bought no catalogue he asked no questions from room to room he passed with untiring footsteps his whole being was filled with the immeasurable relief the almost passionate joy of one who for the first time is able to gratify a new and marvelous appetite with his eyes his soul all these lateborn strange appreciative powers he ministered to an appetite which seemed unquenchable it was dusk when he came out his cheeks burning his eyes bright he carried a new music a whole world of new joys with him but his most vital sensation was one of glowing and passionate sympathy they were splendid these heroes who had seen the truth and had struggled to give life to it with pencil or brush or chisel that others too might see and understand if only one could do ones little share  he walked slowly along absorbed in his thoughts unconscious even of the direction in which his footsteps were taking him when at last he paused he was outside a theatre the name of ibsen occupied a prominent place upon the boards from somewhere among the hidden cells of his memory came a glimmering recollectiona word or two read at random an impression only half understood yet the germ of which had survived ibsen a prophet of truth surely he looked eagerly down the placard for the announcements and the prices of admission and then a sudden cold douche of memory descended upon his new enthusiasms there was ellen    chapter iii  mr alfred burtons family  there certainly was ellen like a man on his way to prison alfred burton took his place in a thirdclass carriage in his customary train to garden green ned miles who travelled in the oil trade came up and smote him upon the shoulder  say cocky what have you been doing to yourself he demanded in amazement have you robbed a bank and going about in disguise eh why the missis wont know you  burton shrank a little back in his place his eyes seemed filled with some nameless distaste as he returned the others gaze  i have taken a dislike to my former style of dress he replied simply also to my moustache  taken a dislikelord love a duck his quondam friend exclaimed strike me blind if i should have known you taken a dislike to thehere alf is this a game  not at all burton answered quietly it is the truth it is one of those matters i suppose he continued which principally concern oneself  no need to get jumpy about it mr miles remarked still a little dazed come in and have some farthing nap with the boys they wont recognize you in that getup well have a lark with them  burton shook his head again he was unable to keep the distaste from his eyes or tone  not tonight thank you  the train was just moving so miles was obliged to hurry off but at garden green burton was compelled to run the gauntlet of their cheers and mockery as he passed down the platform good sports and excellent fellows he had thought them yesterday today he had no words for them he simply knew that they grated upon every nerve in his body and that he loathed them for the first time he began to be frightened what was this thing that had happened to him how was it possible for him to continue his daily life  as soon as he was out of the station his troubles began again a veil seemed to have been torn from before his eyes just as in london every face into which he had looked every building which he had passed had seemed to him unfamiliar appealing to an altered system of impressions so here during that brief walk a new disgust was born in him the showylooking main street with its gingerbread buildings all new and glittering with paint appalled him the larger villasselfconscious types all reeking with plaster and false decorationsset him shivering he turned into his own street and his heart sank something had indeed touched his eyes and he saw new and terrible things the row of houses looked as though they had come out of a childs playbox they were all untrue shoddy uninviting the waste space on the other side of the unmade street a repository for all the rubbish of the neighborhood brought a groan to his lips he stopped before the gate of his own little dwelling there were yellow curtains in the window tied back with red velvet even with the latch of the gate in his hand he hesitated a child in a spotted velveteen suit and a soiled lace collar who had been playing in the street greeted him with an amazed shout and then ran on ahead  mummy come and look at daddy the boy shrieked hes cut off all the hair from his lip and hes got such funny clothes on do come and look at his hat  the child was puny unprepossessing and dirty worse tragedy than this burton knew it the woman who presently appeared to gaze at him with openmouthed wonder was pretentiously and untidily dressed with some measure of good looks woefully obscured by a hard and unsympathetic expression burton knew these things also it flashed into his mind as he stood there that her first attraction to him had been because she resembled his illconceived idea of an actress as a matter of fact she resembled much more closely her cousin who was a barmaid burton looked into the tragedy of his life and shivered  what in the name of wonders the meaning of this alfred his better half demanded what are you standing there for looking all struck of a heap  he made no reply speech for the moment was absolutely impossible she stood and stared at him her arms akimbo disapproval written in her face her hair was exceedingly untidy and there was a smut upon her cheek a soiled lace collar fastened with an imitation diamond brooch had burst asunder  whats come to your moustache she demanded and why are you dressed likelike a housepainter on a sunday  burton found his first gleam of consolation a newlydiscovered sense of humor soothed him inexplicably  sorry you dont like my clothes he replied youll get used to them  get used to them his better half repeated almost hysterically do you mean to say you are going about like that  something like it burton admitted  no silk hat no tail coat  burton shook his head gently  i trust he said that i have finished for the present at any rate with those most unsightly garments  come inside ellen ordered briskly  they passed into the little sittingroom burton glanced around him with a halffrightened sense of apprehension his memory at any rate had not played him false everything was as badeven worse than he had imagined the suite of furniture which was the joy of his wifes heart had been it is true exceedingly cheap but the stamped magenta velvet was as crude in its coloring as his own discarded tie he looked at the fringed cloth upon the table the framed oleographs upon the wall and he was absolutely compelled to close his eyes there was not a single thing anywhere which was not discordant  mrs burton had not yet finished with the subject of clothes the distaste upon her face had rather increased she looked her husband up and down and her eyes grew bright with anger  well i did think she declared vigorously that i was marrying a man who looked like a gentleman at least do you mean to say alfred that you mean to go into the city like that  certainly burton replied and ellen  well  since we are upon the subject of dress may i have a few words you have given expression to your dislikes quite freely you will not mind if i do the same  well what have you got to say she demanded belligerently  i dont like your bun burton said firmly  dont like my what his wife shrieked her hands flying to the back of her head  i dont like your bunfalse hair or whatever you call it burton repeated i dont like that brooch with the false diamonds and if you cant afford a clean white blouse id wear a colored one  mrs burtons mouth was open but for the moment she failed to express herself adequately her husband continued  your skirt is fashionable i suppose because it is very short and very tight but it makes you walk like a duck and it leaves unconcealed so much of your stockings that i think at least you should be sure that they are free from holes  you called my skirt smart only yesterday ellen gasped and i wasnt going out of doors in these stockings  it is just as bad to wear them indoors or outdoors whether any one sees them or whether any one does not burton insisted your own sense of selfrespect should tell you that did you happen by the bye to glance at the boys collar when you put it on  what little alf now his mother faltered youre getting on to him now are you  i certainly should wish burton protested mildly that he was more suitably dressed a plain sailorsuit or a tweed knickerbocker suit with a flannel collar would be better than those velveteen things with that lace abomination and why is he tugging at your skirt so  he is ready to start ellen replied sharply havent forgotten youre taking us to the band have you  i had forgotten it burton admitted but i am quite willing to go  ellen turned towards the stairs  down in five minutes she announced i hope youve finished all that rubbishing talk theres some tea in the teapot on the hob if you want any dont upset things  burton drifted mechanically into the kitchen noting its disorder with a new disapproval he sat on the edge of the table for a few moments gazing helplessly about him presently ellen descended the stairs and called to him he took up his hat and followed his wife and the boy out of the house the latter eyed him wonderingly  look at pas hat he shouted oh my  ellen stopped short upon her way to the gate  alfred she exclaimed you dont mean to say youre coming out with us like thatcoming to the band too where we shall meet everyone  certainly my dear burton replied placing the object of their remarks fearlessly upon his head you may not be quite used to it yet but i can assure you that it is far more becoming and suitable than a cheap silk hat especially for an occasion like the present  ellen opened her mouth and closed it againit was perhaps wise  come on she said abruptly alfred wants to hear the soldier music and we are late already take your fathers hand  they started upon their pilgrimage burton at any rate spent a miserable two hours he hated the stiff brandnew public garden in which they walked with its stunted trees its burnt grass its artificial and weary flowerbeds he hated the people who stood about as they did listening to the bandthe giggling girls the callow cigarettesmoking youths the dressed up unnatural replicas of his own wife and himself with whom he was occasionally forced to hold futile conversation he hated the sly punch in the ribs from one of his quondam companions the artful murmur about getting the missis to look another way and the hurried visit to a neighboring publichouse the affected anger and consequent jokes which followed upon their return as they walked homeward the cold ugliness of it all seemed almost to paralyze his newly awakened senses it was their social evening of the week looked forward to always by his wife spoken of cheerfully by him even last night an evening when he might have had to bring home friends to supper to share a tin of sardines a fragment of mutton dutch cheese and beer which he himself would have had to fetch from the nearest publichouse he wiped his forehead and found that it was wet then ellen broke the silence  what i should like to know alfred iswhats come to you she commenced indignantly not a word have you spoken all the eveningyou that theres no holding generally with your chaff and jokes what mr and mrs johnson must have thought of you i cant imagine standing there like a stick when they stopped to be civil for a few minutes and behaving as though you never even heard their asking us to go in and have a bite of supper what have we done eh little alf and me you look at us as though we had turned into ogres out with it my man whats wrong  i am not  burton stopped short the lie of illhealth stuck in his throat he thirsted to tell the truth but a new and gentle kindliness kept him speechless ellen was beginning to get a little frightened  what is it thats come to you alfred she again demanded have you lost your tongue or your wits or what  i do not know he answered truthfully enough his manner was so entirely nonprovocative that her resentment for a moment dropped  whats changed you since yesterday she persisted what is it that you dont like about us anyway what do you want us to do  burton sighed he would have given a great deal to have been able to prevaricate but he could not it was the truth alone which he could speak  i should like you he said to take down your hair and throw away all that is not real to wash it until it is its natural color to brush it hard and then do it up quite simply without a net or anything then i should like you to wash your face thoroughly in plain soap and water and never again touch a powderpuff or that nasty red stuff you have on your lips i should like you to throw away those fancy blouses with the imitation lace which are ugly to start with and which you cant afford to have washed often enough and i should like you to buy some plain linen shirts and collars a black tie and a blue serge skirt made so that you could walk in it naturally  ellen did not at that moment need any rouge nor any artificial means of lending brightness to her eyes what she really seemed to need was something to keep her still  anything else she demanded unsteadily  some thicker stockings or if not thicker stockings without that openwork stuff about them burton continued earnestly warming now to his task you see the openwork places have all spread into little holes and one cant help noticing it especially as your shoes are such a bright yellow that stuff that looks like lace at the bottom of your petticoat has got all draggled i should cut it off and throw it away then id empty all that scent down the drain and wear any sort of gloves except those kid ones you have had cleaned so often  and my hat she asked with trembling lips what about my hat dont leave that out  burn it he replied eagerly feathers and all theyve been dyed havent they more than once and i think their present color is their worst it must be very uncomfortable to wear too with all those pins sticking out of it colored glass they are made of arent they they are not pretty you know ill buy you a hat if you like a plain felt or straw with just a few flowers youll look as nice again  finished  he looked at her apprehensively  there are one or two things about the house he commenced  ellen began to talksimply because she was unable to keep silent any longer the longer she talked the more eloquent she became when she had finished burton had disappeared she followed him to the door and again to the gate her voice was still ringing in his ears as he turned the corner of the street    chapter iv  a shock to mr waddington  punctually at nine oclock on the following morning alfred burton after a night spent in a very unsatisfactory lodginghouse hung up his gray homburg on the peg consecrated to the support of his discarded silk hat and prepared to plunge into his work the officeboy who had been stricken dumb at his seniors appearance recovered himself at last sufficiently for speech  my eye he exclaimed whose clothes have you been stealing what have you been up to eh committing a burglary or a murder  burton shook his head  nothing of the sort he replied pleasantly the fact is i came to the conclusion that my late style of dress as you yourself somewhat eloquently pointed out yesterday was unbecoming  the boy seemed a little dazed  you look half way between a toff and an artist he declared whats it all about anyway have you gone crazy  i dont think so burton replied i rather think i have come to my senses have you got those last furniture accounts  no use starting on that job clarkson informed him genially the guvnor wants you down at the salesrooms youve got to clerk for him  burton looked very blank indeed a flood of unpleasant recollections assailed him he had lied a good deal in the letting of houses but he had lied more still in the auction room and todays sale he knew all about it he knew a great deal more than under the circumstances it was wise for him to know  i quite forgot he said slowly that there was a sale today i dont suppose mr waddington would let you take my place clarkson  not on your life the boy replied ive got to stay here and boss the show youd better hurry along too its thursday morning and you know the people come in early lord what a guy you look  very slowly and very reluctantly burton made his way through the gloomy warehouse and into the salesrooms which were approached from the street by a separate entrance he knew exactly what was before him and he realized that it must be the end mr waddington who had not yet mounted the rostrum saw him come in stared at him for several moments in his gray clothes and homburg hat and turned away to spit upon the floor a woman with a catalogue in her handevidently an intending purchasergripped burton by the arm  i say mister youre the auctioneers clerk arent you  i am he admitted  about that hoil painting nowthe one of gladstone my old mans fair dotty on gladstone and its his birthday tomorrow if its all right i thought i might make him a present it says in the catalogue artist unknown i suppose as its a real oil painting its worth a bit isnt it  it is not an oil painting at all burton said quietly  wot yer mean the woman demanded here you arelot number 17interesting oil painting of the right honorable w e gladstone artist unknown  burton thrust the catalogue away from him with a sigh  i am afraid he admitted that the description can scarcely be said to be entirely accurate as a matter of fact it is a colored lithograph very cleverly done but quite valueless i dare say you would find that there are thousands of them exactly like it  the woman stared at him suspiciously  why your guvnors just told me that the reserve upon its two guineas she exclaimed  mr waddington must have made a mistake burton replied with a sinking heart  look here the woman insisted what is it worth anyway  a few pence for the frame burton answered hurrying off  the woman drew her shawl about her shoulders threw her catalogue upon the floor and made her way towards the door  not going to stay here to be swindled she declared loudly looking around her colored lithograph indeed and put down in the catalogue as an interesting oil painting they must think us folks dont know nothing cheatings the word i saycheating  the womans eye met the eye of mr waddington as she stood for a moment in the doorway before taking her departure she raised her fist and shook it  bah she exclaimed ought to be ashamed of yourself you and your hoil paintings  mr waddington was too far off to hear her words but the character of her farewell was unmistakable he glanced suspiciously towards his chief clerk burton however had at that moment been buttonholed by a fidgety old gentleman who desired to ask him a few questions  i am a little puzzled sir the old gentleman said confidentially about the absolute authenticity of this chippendale suitelot number 101 in the catalogue this sale iserumadvertised as being the old gentleman turned over the pages of the catalogue quicklya sale of the effects of the late doctor transome thats so eh  i believe the announcement is to that effect burton confessed hesitatingly  quite so the little old gentleman continued now i knew dr transome intimately and he was without the slightest doubt a rare judge of old furniture i wouldnt mind following him anywhere or accepting his judgment about anything he was very set upon not having anything in his house that was not genuine now under any other circumstances mind you i should have had my doubts about that suite but if you can assure me that it came from dr transomes house why theres no more to be said about it im a bidder  burton shook his head gravely  i am sorry he declared but the frontispiece of the catalogue is certainly a little misleading to tell you the truth sir there are very few articles here from dr transomes house at all the bulk of his effects were distributed among relatives what we have here is a portion of the kitchen and servants bedroom furniture  then where on earth did all this diningroom and library furniture come from the old gentleman demanded  burton looked around him and back again at his questioner there was no evading the matter however  the great majority of it burton admitted has been sent in to us for sale from dealers and manufacturers  the little old gentleman was annoyed instead of being grateful as he ought to have been he visited his annoyance upon burton which was unreasonable  deliberate swindling sirthats what i call it he proclaimed rolling up the catalogue and striking the palm of his hand with it all the way from camberwell ive come entirely on the strength of what turns out to be a misrepresentation theres the bus fare there and backsixpence mind youand a wasted morning whos going to recompense me i should like to know im not made of sixpences  burtons hand slipped into his pocket the little old gentleman sniffed  you neednt insult me young fellow he declared ive a friend or two here and ill set about letting them know the truth  he was as good as his word the woman who had departed had also found her sympathizers mr waddington watched the departure of a little stream of people with a puzzled frown  whats the matter with them all he muttered come here burton  burton who had been standing a little in the background endeavoring to escape further observation until the commencement of the sale obeyed his masters summons promptly  cant reckon things up at all mr waddington confided why arent you round and amongst em burton eh youre generally such a good un at rubbing it into them why the only two people ive seen you talk to this morning have left the place whats wrong with you man  i only wish i knew burton replied fervently  mr waddingon scratched his chin  whats the meaning of those clothes eh he demanded youve lost your appearance burtonthats what youve done not even a silk hat on a sale day  im sorry burton answered to tell you the truth i had forgotten that it was a sale day  mr waddington looked curiously at his assistant and the longer he looked the more convinced he became that burton was not himself  well he said i suppose you cant always be gassing if youre not feeling on the spot lets start the sale before any more people leave come on  mr waddington led the way to the rostrum burton with a sinking heart and a premonition of evil took the place by his side the first few lots were put up and sold without event but trouble came with lot number 13  lot number 13a magnificent oak bedroom the auctioneer began eh what what is it burton  stained deal burton interrupted in a pained but audible whisper stained deal bedroom suite sirnot oak  mr waddington seemed about to choke he ignored the interruption however and went on with his description of the lot  a magnificent oak bedroom suite complete and as good as new been in use for three weeks only the deceased gentleman whose effects we are disposing of and who is known to have been a famous collector of valuable furniture told me himself that he found it at a farmhouse in northumberland look at it ladies and gentlemen look at it itll bear inspection shall we say fortyfive guineas for a start  mr waddington paused expectantly burton leaned over from his place  the suite is of stained deal he said distinctly it has been very cleverly treated by a new process to make it resemble old oak but if you examine it closely you will see that what i say is correct i regret that there has been an unfortunate error in the description  for a moment there was a tumult of voices and some laughter mr waddington was red in the face the veins about his temples were swollen and the hammer in his hand showed a desire to descend on his clerks head a small dealer had pulled out one of the drawers and was examining it closely  stained deal it is mr auctioneer he announced standing up call a spade a spade and have done with it  there was a little mingled laughter and cheers mr waddington swallowed his anger and went on with the sale  call it what you like he declared indulgently our clients send us in these things with their own description and we havent time to verify them allnot likely one bedroom suite thenthere you are now then burton you blithering idiot he muttered savagely under his breath if you cant hold your tongue ill kick you out of your seat thirty pounds shall we say he continued leaning forward persuasively twenty pounds then the price makes no difference to me only do lets get on  the suite in question was knocked down at eight pounds ten the sale proceeded but bidders were few a spirit of distrust seemed to be in the air most of the lots were knocked down to dummy bidders which meant that they were returned to the manufacturers on the following day the frown on mr waddingtons face deepened  see what youve done you silly jackass he whispered to his assistant during a momentary pause in the proceedings theres another little knot of people left heres old sherwell coming in half drunk now hold your tongue if you can ill have him for the diningroom suite sure if you interfere this time ill break your head    we come now ladies and gentlemen to the most important lot of the day mr sherwell sir i am glad to see you youre just in time theres a diningroom suite coming on the only one i have to offer and such a suite as is very seldom on the market one table two sideboards and twelve chairs now mr sherwell sir look at the table for yourself youre a judge and i am willing to take your word did you ever see a finer a more magnificent piece of mahogany there is no deception about it feel it look at it test it in any way you like i tell you ladies and gentlemen this is a lot i have examined myself and if i could afford it id have bought it privately i made a bid but the executors wouldnt listen to me now then ladies and gentlemen make me an offer for the suite  fine bit o wood the halfintoxicated furniture dealer pronounced leaning up against the table and examining it with clumsy gravity a genuine bit o stuff  youre right mr sherwell the auctioneer agreed impressively it is a unique piece of wood sira unique piece of wood ladies and gentlemen now how much shall we say for the suite lot number 85twelve chairs the table you are leaning up against two sideboards and butlers tray shall we say ninety guineas mr sherwell will you start the bidding in a reasonable manner and make it a hundred  fifty mr sherwell declared striking the table with his fist i say fifty  mr waddington for a moment looked pained he laid down the hammer and glanced around through the audience as though appealing for their sympathy then he shrugged his shoulders finally he took up his hammer again and sighed  very well then he consented in a resigned tone well start it at fifty then i dont know whats the matter with every one today but im giving you a turn mr sherwell and i shall knock it down quick fifty guineas is bid for lot number 85 going at fifty guineas  burton rose once more to his feet  does mr sherwell understand he asked that the remainder of the suite is different entirely from the table  mr sherwell stared at the speaker shifted his feet a little unsteadily and gripped the table  certainly i dont he replieddont understand anything of the sort where is the rest of the suite young man  just behind you sir burton pointed out up against the wall  mr sherwell turned and looked at a miserable collection of gimcrack articles piled up against the wall behind him then he consulted the catalogue  one mahogany diningtable two sideboards one butlers tray twelve chairs these the chairs he asked lifting one up  those are the chairs sir burton admitted mr sherwell with a gesture of contempt replaced upon the floor the one which he had detached from its fellows he leaned unsteadily across the table  a dirty trick mr auctioneer he declared shant come here any more shant buy anything ought to be ashamed of yourself yah  mr sherwell feeling his way carefully out made an impressive if not very dignified exit mr waddington gripped his clerk by the arm  burton he hissed under his breath get out of this before i throw you down never let me see your idiot face again if youre at the office when i come back ill kill you ill clerk myself be off with you  burton rose quietly and departed as he left the room he heard mr waddington volubly explaining that no deception was intended and that the catalogue spoke for itself then he passed out into the street and drew a little breath of relief the shackles had fallen away he was a free man messrs waddington  forbes had finished with him    chapter v  burtons new life  burton spent the rest of the day in most delightful fashion he took the tube to south kensington museum where he devoted himself for several hours to the ecstatic appreciation of a small section of its treasures he lunched off some fruit and tea and bread and butter out in the gardens wandering about afterwards among the flowerbeds and paying especial and delighted attention to the lilac trees beyond the memorial towards evening he grew depressed the memory of ellen of little alfred and his gingerbread villa became almost like a nightmare to him and then the light came his great resolution was formed with beating heart he turned to a stationers shop bought a sheet of paper and an envelope borrowed a pen and wrote  my dear ellen   i am not coming home for a short time as you remarked there is something the matter with me i dont know what it is perhaps in a few days i shall find out i shall send your money as usual on saturday and hope that you and the boy will continue well  from your husband  alfred burton  burton sighed a long sigh of intense relief as he folded up and addressed this epistle then he bought four stamps and sent it home he was a free man he had three pounds fifteen in his pocket a trifle of money in the savingsbank no situation and a wife and son to support the position was serious enough yet never for a moment could he regard it without a new elasticity of spirit and a certain reckless optimism the source of which he did not in the least understand he was to learn before long however that moods and their resulting effect upon the spirit were part of the penalty which he must pay for the greater variety of his new life  he took a tiny bedroom somewhere westminster waya room in a large solemnlooking house decayed and shabby but still showing traces of its former splendor that night he saw an ibsen play from the front row of a deserted gallery and afterwards in melancholy mood he walked homeward along the embankment by the moonlight for the first time in life he had come face to face with a condition of which he had had no previous experiencethe condition of intellectual pessimism he was depressed because in this new and more spontaneous world so full of undreamedof beauties so exquisitely stimulating to his new powers of appreciation he had found something which he did not understand truth for the first time had seemed unpleasant not only in its effects but in itself the problem was beyond him nevertheless he pulled his bed up to the window from which he could catch a glimpse of the varied lights of the city and fell asleep  in the morning he decided to seek for a situation a very reasonable instinct led him to avoid all such houses as messrs waddington  forbes he made his way instead to the offices of a firm who were quite at the top of their profession a junior partner accorded him a moments interview he was civil but to the point  there is no opening whatever in this firm he declared for any one who has been in the employment of messrs waddington  forbes good morning  on the doorstep burton ran into the arms of mr lynn who recognized him at once  say young man he exclaimed holding out his hand i am much obliged for that recommendation of yours to these people i have taken a house in connaught placea real nice house it is too come and see usnumber 17 the wife and daughters land tomorrow  thank you very much burton answered i am glad you are fixed up comfortably  mr lynn laid his hand upon the young mans shoulder he looked at him curiously he was an observant person and much interested in his fellowcreatures  kind of change in you isnt there he asked in a puzzled manner i scarcely recognized you at first  burton made no reply the conventional falsehood which rose to his lips died away before it was uttered  look here mr lynn continued you take a word of advice from me you chuck those people waddington  forbes theyre wrong unswont do you a bit of good get another job so long and dont forget to look us up  mr lynn passed on his way into the office he ran into the junior partner who greeted him warmly  say do you know that young man whos just gone out the former inquired  the junior partner shook his head  never seen him before he replied he came here looking for a job  is that so mr lynn asked with interest well i hope you gave it to him  young mr miller shook his head  he came from the wrong school for us he declared regular thieves the people he was with by the bye didnt they nearly let you that deathtrap of old lady idlemays  yes and he happens to be just the young man mr lynn asserted removing the cigar from his mouth who prevented my taking it or at any rate having to part with a handsome deposit i was sent down there with him and at first he cracked it up like a real hustler he got me so fixed that i had practically made up my mind and was ready to sign any reasonable agreement then he suddenly seemed to turn round he looked me straight in the face and told me about the typhoid and all of it explained that it wasnt the business of the firm to let houses likely to interest me and wound up by giving me your name and address and recommending me to come to you  you surprise me very much indeed mr miller admitted under the circumstances it is scarcely to be wondered at that he is out of employment old waddington wouldnt have much use for a man like that  i shouldnt be surprised mr lynn remarked thoughtfully if it was through my affair that he got the sack couldnt you do something for him mr millerto oblige me eh  if he calls again mr miller promised i will do my best  but burton did not call again he made various efforts to obtain a situation in other directions without the slightest result then he gave it up he became a wanderer about london one of her children who watched her with thoughtful eyes at all times and hours of the day and night he saw the pink dawn glimmer through the trees in st jamess park he saw the bridges empty the smokestained buildings deserted by their inhabitants with st pauls in the background like a sentinel watching over the sleeping world he heard the crash and roar of life die away and he watched like an anxious prophet while the city slept he looked upon the stereotyped horrors of the embankment vitalized and actual to him now in the light of his new understanding he wandered with the first gleam of light among the flowerbeds of the park sniffing with joy at the late hyacinths revelling in the cool sweet softness of the unpolluted air then he listened to the awakening to the birth of the day he heard it from the bridges from london bridge and westminster bridge over which thundered the great vans fresh from the country on their way to covent garden he stood in front of the mansion house and watched the thin black stream of the earliest corners grow into a surging blackcoated torrent there were things which made him sorry and there were things which made him glad on the whole however his isolated contemplation of what for so long he had taken as a matter of course depressed him life was unutterably and intensely selfish every little unit in that seething mass was so entirely so strangely selfcentered none of them had any real love or friendliness for the millions who toiled around them no one seemed to have time to take his eyes from his own work and his own interests burton became more and more depressed as the days passed then he closed his eyes and tried an antidote he abandoned this study of his fellowcreatures and plunged once more into the museums sated himself with the eternal beauties and came out to resume his place amid the tumultuous throng with rested nerves and a beatific smile upon his lips it mattered so little his welfare of today or tomorrowwhether he went hungry or satisfied to bed the other things were in his heart he saw the truth  one day he met his late employer mr waddington was not in his way an illnatured man and he stopped short upon the pavement burtons new suit was not wearing well it showed signs of exposure to the weather the young man himself was thin and pale it was not for mr waddington to appreciate the soft brilliance of his eyes the altered curves of his lips from his intensely practical point of view his late employee was certainly in low water  hullo burton he exclaimed coming to a standstill and taking the pipe from his mouth  how do you do sir burton replied civilly  getting on all right eh  very nicely indeed thank you sir  mr waddington grunted  hm you dont look like it got a job yet  no sir  then how the devil can you be getting on at all mr waddington inquired  burton smiled quite pleasantly  it does seem queer sir he admitted i said that i was getting on all right because i am contented and happy that is the chief thing after all isnt it  mr waddington opened his mouth and closed it again  i wish i could make out what the devil it was that happened to you he said why you used to be as smart as they make em a regular nipper after business i expected youd be after me for a partnership before long and i expect id have had to give it you and then you went clean dotty i shall never forget that day at the sale when you began telling people everything it wasnt good for them to know  you mean that it wasnt good for us for them to know burton corrected gently  mr waddington laughed he had a large amount of easy goodhumor and he was always ready to laugh  you havent lost your wits i see he declared what was it did you by any chance get religion burton  the young man shook his head  not particularly sir he replied by the bye you owe me four days money would it be quite convenient  you shall have it mr waddington declared thrusting his hand into his trousers pocket i cant afford it for things are going badly with me here it is though thirtyfour shillingsthats near enough anything else  there is one other thing burton said slowly it is rather a coincidence sir that we should have met just here i see that you have been into idlemay house i wonder whether you would lend me the keys i will return them to the office with pleasure but i should very much like to go in myself for a few minutes  mr waddington stared at his late employee thoroughly puzzled  if you arent a caution he exclaimed what the mischief do you want to go in there for  burton smiled  i should like to see if that little room where the old egyptian died has been disturbed since i was there sir  mr waddington hesitated then he turned and led the way  id forgotten all about that he said come along ill go in with you  they crossed the road ascended the steps and in a few minutes they were inside the house the place smelt very musty and uninhabited burton delicately avoided the subject of its being still unlet the little chamber on the right of the hall was as dark as ever burton felt his heart beat quickly as a little waft of familiar perfume swept out to him at the opening of the door mr waddington struck a match and held it over his head  so this is the room he remarked dashed if ive ever been in it it wants cleaning out and fumigating badly whats this  he picked up the sheet of paper which was lying exactly as burton had left it then he lifted up the little dwarf tree and looked at it   it is finished the nineteenth generation has triumphed he who shall eat of the brown fruit of this tree shall see the things of life and death as they are he who shall eat   well im dd he muttered whats it all mean anyway  try a brown bean burton suggested softly they arent half bad  very likely poison mr waddington said suspiciously  burton said nothing for a moment he had taken up the sheet of paper and was gazing at the untranslated portion  i wonder he murmured if there is any one who could tell us what the other part of it means  the dd thing smells all right mr waddington declared here goes  he broke off a brown bean and swallowed it burton turned round just in time to see the deed for a moment he stood aghast then very slowly he tiptoed his way from the door and hurried stealthily from the house from some bills which he had been studying half an hour ago he remembered that mr waddington was due later in the morning to conduct a sale of antique furniture    chapter vi  a meeting with ellen  the clearness of vision which enabled alfred burton now to live in and appreciate a new and marvelous world failed however to keep him from feeling occasionally exceedingly hungry he lived on very little but the weekly amount must always be sent to garden green there came a time when he broke in upon the last five pound note of his savings he realized the position without any actual misgivings he denied himself regretfully a tiny mezzotint of the raphael madonna which he coveted for his mantelpiece he also denied himself dinner for several evenings when fortune knocked at his door he was in fact extraordinarily hungry he still had faith notwithstanding his difficulties and no symptoms of dejection he was perfectly well aware that this need for food was after all one of the most unimportant affairs in the world although he was forced sometimes to admit to himself that he found it none the less surprisingly unpleasant chance however handed over to him a shilling discovered upon the curb and a highclass evening paper left upon a seat in the park he had no sooner eaten and drunk with the former than he opened the latter there was an article on the front page entitled london awake he read it line by line and laughed it was all so ridiculously simple he hurried back to his rooms and wrote a much better one on london asleep he was master of his subject he wrote of what he had seen with effortless and sublime verity why not simply with the aid of pen and ink he transferred from the cells of his memory into actual phrases the silent panorama which he had seen with his own eyes that one matchless hour before the dawn was entirely his throughout its sixty minutes he had watched and waited with every sense quivering he had watched and heard that first breath of dawn come stealing into life it was childs play to him he knew nothing about editors but he walked into the office of the newspaper which he had picked up and explained his mission  we are not looking for new contributors at present he was told a little curtly what paper have you been on  i have never written anything before in my life burton confessed but this is much better than london awake which you published a few evenings ago  the subeditor of that newspaper looked at him with kindly contempt  london awake was written for us by rupert mendosa we dont get beginners stuff like that i dont think it will be the least use but ill look at your article if you likequick  burton handed over his copy with calm confidence it was shockingly written on odd pieces of paper pinned together anyhowan untidy and extraordinarylooking production the subeditor very nearly threw it contemptuously back instead he glanced at it frowned read a little more and went on reading when he had finished he looked at this strange thin young man with the pallid cheeks and deepset eyes in something like awe  you wrote this yourself he asked  certainly sir burton answered if it is really worth putting in your paper and paying for you can have plenty more  but why did you write it the editor persisted where did you get the idea from  burton looked at him in mildeyed wonder  it is just what i see as i pass along he explained  the subeditor was an ambitious literary man himself and he looked steadfastly away from his visitor out of the window his eyes full of regret his teeth clenched almost in anger just what he saw as he passed along what he sawthis commonlooking halfeducated little person with only the burning eyes and sensitive mouth to redeem him from utter insignificance truly this was a strange finger which opened the eyes of some and kept sealed the eyelids of others for fifteen years this very cultivated gentleman who sat in the subeditors chair and drew his two thousand a year had driven his pen along the scholarly way and all that he had written beside this untidylooking document had not in it a single germ of the things that count  well burton asked with illconcealed eagerness  the subeditor was after all a man he set his teeth and came back to the present  my readers will i am sure find your little article quite interesting he said calmly we shall be glad to accept it and anything else you may send us in the same vein you have an extraordinary gift for description  burton drew a long sigh of relief  thank you he said how much shall you pay me for it  the subeditor estimated the length of the production it was not an easy matter owing to the odd scraps of paper upon which it was written  will ten guineas be satisfactory he inquired  very satisfactory indeed burton replied and i should like it now at once please i need some money to send to my wife  the subeditor rang for the cashier  so you are married he remarked you seem quite young  i am married burton admitted i am not living with my wife just now because we see things differently i have also a little boy they live down at garden green and i send them money every saturday  what do you do what is your occupation  i just wander about burton explained i used to be an auctioneers clerk but i lost my situation and i couldnt get another  what made you think of writing the subeditor asked leaning a little over towards his new contributor  i picked up a copy of your newspaper on a seat in the park burton replied i saw that article on london awake i thought if that sort of thing was worth printing it was worth paying for so i tried to do something like it it is so easy to write just what you see he concluded apologetically  the subeditor handed him his ten guineas  when will you bring me some more work  whenever you like burton replied promptly what about  the subeditor shook his head  you had better choose your own subjects  covent garden at halfpast three burton suggested a little diffidently i cant describe it properly i can only just put down what i see going on there but it might be interesting  covent garden will do very well indeed the subeditor told him you neednt bother about the description just do as you say put downwhat you see  burton put down just what he saw as he moved about the city for ten days following and without a word of criticism the subeditor paid him ten guineas a time and encouraged him to come again burton however decided upon a few days rest not that the work was any trouble to him on the contrary it was all too ridiculously easy it seemed to him the most amazing thing that a description in plain words of what any one might stand and look at should be called literature and yet some times in his more thoughtful moments he dimly understood he remembered that between him and the multitudes of his fellowcreatures there was a difference everything he saw he saw through the clear white light there were no mists to cloud his vision there was no halo of idealism hovering around the objects upon which his eyes rested it was the truth he saw and nothing beyond it he compared his own work with work of a similar character written by wellknown men and his understanding became more complete he found in their work a touch of personality a shade of selfconsciousness about the description of even the most ordinary things the individuality of the writer and his subject were always blended in his own work subject alone counted he had never learned any of the tricks of writing his prose consisted of the simple use of simple words his mind was empty of all inheritance of acquired knowledge he had no preconceived ideals towards the realizations of which he should bend the things he saw he was simply a prophet of absolute truth if he had found in those days a literary godfather he would without doubt have been presented to the world as a genius  then with money in his pocket clad once more in decent apparel he made one more effort to do his duty he sent for ellen and little alfred to come up and see him he sent them a little extra money and he wrote as kindly as possible he wanted to do the right thing he was even anxious about it he determined that he would do his very best to bridge over that yawning gulf the gingerbread villa he absolutely could not face so he met them at the leicester square tube  the moment they arrived his heart sank they stepped out of the lift and looked around them ellens hat seemed larger than ever and was ornate with violentcolored flowers her face was hidden behind a violet veil and she wore a white feather boa fragments of which reposed upon the lift mans shoulder and little alfreds knickerbockers her dress was of black velveteen fitting a little tightly over her corsets and showing several imperfectly removed stains and creases she wore tan shoes one of which was down at the heel and primrosecolored gloves alfred wore his usual black sunday suit a lace collar around his neck about a foot wide a straw hat on the ribbon of which was printed the name of one of his majestys battleships and a curl plastered upon his forehead very much in the style of burton himself in earlier days directly he saw his father he put his finger in his mouth and seemed inclined to howl ellen raised her veil and pushed him forward  run to daddy she ordered sharply do as youre told or ill box your ears  the child made an unwilling approach ellen herself advanced holding her skirts genteelly clutched in her left hand her eyes fixed upon her husband her expression a mixture of defiance and appeal burton welcomed them both calmly his tongue failed him however when he tried to embark upon the most ordinary form of greeting their appearance gave him again a most unpleasant shock a fact which he found it extremely difficult to conceal  well cant you say youre glad to see us ellen demanded belligerently  if i had not wished to see you he replied tactfully i should not have asked you to come  kiss your father ellen ordered twisting the arm of her offspring kiss him at once then and stop whimpering  the salute which seemed to afford no one any particular satisfaction was carried out in perfunctory fashion burton secretly wiping his lipshe hated peppermintturned towards piccadilly  we will have some tea he suggestedlyons if you like there is music there i am glad that you are both well  considering ellen declared that you havent set eyes on us for lord knows how longwell you need to be glad upon my word  she was regarding her husband in a puzzled manner burton was quietly but well dressed his apparel was not such as ellen would have thought of choosing for him but in a dim sort of way she recognized its qualities she recognized too something new about him which although she vigorously rebelled against it still impressed her with a sense of superiority  alfred burton she continued impressively for the dear lands sake whats come over you mrs johnson was around last week and told me youd lost your job at waddingtons months ago and here you are all in new clothes and not a word about coming back or anything am i your wife or not what do you mean by it have you gone off your head or what have we doneme and little alfred  we will talk at teatime burton said uneasily  ellen set her lips grimly and the little party hastened on burton ordered an extravagant tea in which ellen declined to take the slightest interest alfred alone ate stolidly and with every appearance of complete satisfaction burton had chosen a place as near the band as possible with a view to rendering conversation more or less difficult ellen however had a voice which was superior to bands alfred with his mouth continually filled with bun appeared fascinated by the cornet player from whom he seldom removed his eyes  what i want to know alfred burton is first how long this tomfoolery is to last and secondly what it all means ellen began with her elbows upon the table and a reckless disregard of neighbors havent we lived for ten years husband and wife at clematis villa and you as happy and satisfied with his home as a man could be and now all of a sudden comes this piece of business have you gone off your head here are all the neighbors just wild with curiosity and i knowing no more what to say to them than the man in the moon  is there any necessity to say anything to them burton asked a little vaguely  ellen shook in her chair a sham tortoiseshell hairpin dropped from her untidy hair on to the floor with a little clatter her veil parted at the top from her hat little alfred terrified by an angry frown from the cornet player was hastily returning fragments of partially consumed bun to his plate the air of the place was hot and uncomfortable burton for a moment half closed his eyes his whole being was in passionate revolt  any necessity ellen repeated half hysterically alfred burton lets have done with this shillyshallying after coming home regularly to your meals for six years do you suppose you can disappear and not have people curious do you suppose you can leave your wife and son and not a word said or a question asked what i want to know is thisare you coming home to clematis villa or are you not  at present i am not burton declared gently but very firmly indeed  is it true that youve got the sack from mr waddington  perfectly he admitted i have found some other work though  she leaned forward so that one of those dyed feathers to which he objected so strongly brushed his cheek  have you touched the money in the savings bank she demanded  i have drawn out every penny of it to send you week by week he replied but i am in a position now to replace it you can do it yourself in your own name if you like here it is  he produced a little roll of notes and handed them to her she took them with shaking fingers she was beginning to lose some of her courage the sight of the money impressed her  alfred burton she said why dont you drop all this foolishness come home with us this afternoon  she leaned across the table on which she had once more plumped her elbows she looked at him in a way he had once found fascinatingher chin thrown forward her cheeks supported by her knuckles little specks of her boa fell into her untouched teacup  come home with alfred and me she begged with halfashamed earnestness its band night and we might ask the johnsons in to supper ive got a nice steak in the house been hanging and mrs cross could come in and cook it while we are out mr johnson would sing to us afterwards and theres your banjo you do play it so well alfred you used to like band nightsto look forward to them all the week come now  the mans whole being was in a state of revolt it was an amazing thing indeed this which had come to him no wonder ellen was puzzled she had right on her side and more than right it was perfectly true that he had been accustomed to look forward to band nights it was true that he used to like to have a neighbor in to supper afterwards and play the fool with the banjo and crack silly jokes talk shop with johnson who was an auctioneers clerk himself smoke atrocious cigars and make worse puns and now he looked at her almost pitifully  ii cant manage it just yet he said hurriedly ill writeor see you again soon ellen im sorry he wound up but just at present i cant change anything  so burton paid the bill and the teaparty was over he saw them off as far as the lift in leicester square station but ellen never looked at him again he had a shrewd suspicion that underneath her veil she was weeping she refused to say goodbye and kept tight hold of alfreds hand when they had gone he passed out of the station and stood upon the pavement of piccadilly circus side by side with a sense of immeasurable relief an odd kind of pain was gripping his heart something that had belonged to him had been wrenched away a wave of meretricious sentiment false yet with a curious base of naturalness swept in upon him for a moment and tugged at his heartstrings she had been his woman the little boy with the sticky mouth was child of his the bald humanity of his affections for them joined forces for a moment with the simple greatness of his new capacity dimly he realized that somewhere behind all these things lurked a truth greater than any he had as yet found then with an almost incredible swiftness this new emotion began to fade away his brain began to work his new fastidiousness asserted itself a wave of cheap perfume assailed his nostrils the untidy pretentiousness of her illchosen clothes the unreality of her manner and carriage the sheer vulgarity of her choice of words and phrasesthese things seized him as a nightmare like a man who rushes to a cafe for a drink in a moment of exhaustion he hastened along towards the national gallery his nerves were all quivering an opalescent light in the sky above charing cross soothed him for a moment a glimpse into a famous art shop was like a cool draught of water then as he walked along in more leisurely fashion the great idea came to him he stopped short upon the pavement here was the solution to all his troubles a bean for ellen another or perhaps half of one for little alfred he could not go back to their world he would bring them into his    chapter vii  the truthful auctioneer  at a little before ten on the following morning burton stood upon the pavement outside looking with some amazement at the house in wenslow square the notices to let had all been torn down a small army of paperhangers and whitewashers were at work a man was busy fastening flower boxes in the lower windows on all hands were suggestions of impending occupation burton mounted the steps doubtfully and stood in the hall underneath a whitewashers plank the door of the familiar little room stood open before him he peered eagerly in it was swept bare and completely empty all traces of its former mysterious occupant were gone  is this house let he inquired of a man who was deliberately stirring a pail of shiny whitewash  the plasterer nodded  seems so he admitted its been empty long enough  burton looked around him a little vaguely  you all seem very busy he remarked  some bloke from the countrys taken the ouse the man grumbled and wants to move in before the blooming paints dry nobody cant do impossibilities mister he continued leaving out the unions which cant bear to see us overexert ourselves theyve always got a particular eye on me knowing im a bit too rapid for most of them when i start  give yourself a rest for a moment burton begged tell me whats become of the rugs and oddments of furniture from that little room opposite  the man produced a pipe contemplated it for a moment thoughtfully and squeezed down a portion of blackened tobacco with his thumb  poor smoking he complained got such a family i cant afford more than one ounce a week nothing but dust here  i havent any tobacco with me burton regretted but ill stand a couple of ounces with pleasure he added producing a shilling  the man pocketed the coin without undue exhilaration struck a vilely smelling match and lit the fragment of filth at the bottom of his pipe  about those oddments of furniture burton reminded him  stolen the man asserted gloomilystolen under our very eyes as it were some one must have nipped in just as you did this morning and whisked them off easy done with a covered truck outside and us so wrapped up in our work so to speak  when was this burton demanded eagerly  day afore yesterday  does mr waddington know about it  the man removed his pipe from his teeth and gazed intently at his questioner  is this mr waddington youre aspeaking of a redfaced gentlemankind of auctioneer or agent looks as though he could shift a drop  burton recognized the description  that he assented is mr waddington  the workman replaced the pipe in the corner of his mouth and nodded deliberately  he knows right enough he does came down here yesterday afternoon with a friend seemed from what i could hear to want to give him something to eat out of that room i put him down as dotty but my you should have heard him when he found out that the stuff had been lifted  was he disappointed burton asked  words seemed to fail the plasterer he nodded his head a great many times and spat upon the floor  that may be the word i was looking for he admitted cant say as i should have thought of it myself anyway the bloke never stopped for close on five minutes and old joehim on the ladder therehe came all the way down and listened with his mouth open and he dont want no laming neither when theres things to be said kind of auctioneer they said he was comes easy to that sort i suppose  did hedid mr waddington obtain any clue as to the whereabouts of the missing property burton asked with some eagerness  not as i knows on the plasterer replied picking up his brush and as to the missing property there was nowt but a few mouldy rugs and a flowerpot in the room some folks does seem able to work themselves up into a fuss about nothing and no mistake good morning guvnor drop in again some time when youre passing  burton turned out of wenslow square and approached the offices and salesrooms of messrs waddington  forbes with some misgiving bearing in mind the peculiar nature of the business conducted by the firm he could only conclude that ruin prompt and absolute had been the inevitable sequence of mr waddingtons regrettable appetite he was somewhat relieved to find that there were no evidences of it in the familiar office which he entered with some diffidence  is mr waddington in he inquired  a strange young man slipped from his stool and found his questioner gazing about him in a bewildered manner there was much indeed that was surprising in his surroundings the tattered bills had been torn down from the walls the dustcovered files of papers removed the ceilings and walls painted and papered a general cleanliness and sense of order had taken the place of the old medley the young man who had answered his inquiry was quietly dressed and not in the least like the missing officeboy  mr waddington is at present conducting a sale of furniture he replied i can send a message in if your business is important  burton who had always felt a certain amount of liking for his late employer was filled now with a sudden pity for him truth was a great and marvelous thing but the last person who had need of it was surely an auctioneer engaged in the sale of sham articles of every description it was putting the man in an unfair position a vague sense of loyalty towards his late chief prompted burtons next action if help were possible mr waddington should have it  thank you he said i will step into the salesroom myself i know the way  burton pushed open the doors and entered the room to his surprise the place was packed there was the usual crowd of buyers and many strange faces the usual stacks of furniture of the usual quality and other lots less familiar mr waddington stood in his accustomed place but not in his accustomed attitude the change in him was obvious but in a sense pathetic he was quietly dressed and his manner denoted a new nervousness not to say embarrassment drops of perspiration stood upon his forehead the strident note had gone from his voice he spoke clearly enough but more softly and without the familiar roll  gentlemenladies and gentlemen he was saying as burton entered the next item on the catalogue is number 17 described as an oak chest said to have come from winchester cathedral and to be a genuine antique  mr waddington leaned forward from his rostrum his tone became more earnest  ladies and gentlemen he continued i am bound to sell as per catalogue and the chest in question is described exactly as it was sent in to us but i do not myself for a moment believe either that it came from winchester or that it is in any way antique examine it for yourselvespray examine it thoroughly before you bid my impression is that it is a common oak chest treated by the modern huckster whose business it is to make new things look like old i have told you my opinion ladies and gentlemen at what shall we start the bidding it is a useful article anyhow and might pass for an antique if any one here really cares to deceive his friends at any rate there is no doubt that it isera chest and that it willerhold things how much shall we say for it  there was a little flutter of conversation people elbowed one another furiously in their desire to examine the chest a dark corpulent man with curly black hair and an unmistakable nose looked at the auctioneer in a puzzled manner  thay waddington old man whatth the game eh what have you got up your sleeve that you dont want to thell the stuff blow me if i can tumble to it  there is no game at all mr waddington replied firmly i can assure you mr absolom and all of you ladies and gentlemen that i have simply told you what i believe to be the absolute truth it is my business to sell whatever is sent to me here for that purpose but it is not my business or intention to deceive you in any way if i can help it  mr absolom reexamined the oak chest with a puzzled expression then he strolled away and joined a little knot of brokers who were busy discussing matters the various remarks which passed from one to another indicated sufficiently their perplexed condition of mind  the old mans dotty  not he theres a game on somewhere  he wants to buy in some of the truck  old waddy knows what hes doing  mr absolom listened for a while and then returned to the rostrum  mr waddington he asked ith it the truth that there are one or two pieces of real good stuff here thent in by an old farmer in kent  quite true mr waddington declared eagerly unfortunately they all came in together and were included with other articles which have not the same antecedents you may be able to pick out which they are i cant although i am supposed to be in the business i never could tell the difference myself  there was a chorus of guffaws mr waddington mopped his forehead with a handkerchief  it is absolutely true gentlemen he pleaded i have always posed as a judge but i know very little about it as a matter of fact i have had scarcely any experience in real antique furniture we must get on gentlemen what shall we say for lot number 17 will any one start the bidding at one sovereign  two mr absolom offered more than itth worth perhaps but ill rithk it  it is certainly more than its worth mr waddington admitted dolefully however if you have the money to throw awaytwo pounds then  mr waddington raised his hammer to knock the chest down but was met with a storm from all quarters of the room  twoten  three  threeten  four  fourten  five  six pounds  seven  seventen  ten pounds  mr absolom who so far had held his own hesitated at the last bid a grayhaired old gentleman looked around him fiercely the gentleman was seemingly opulent and mr absolom withdrew with a sigh mr waddington eyed the prospective buyer sorrowfully  you are quite sure that you mean it sir he asked the chest is not worth the money you know  you attend to your business and ill attend to mine the old gentleman answered savagely most improper behavior i call it trying to buy in your own goods in this barefaced manner my name is stephen hammonde and the moneys in my pocket for this or anything else i care to buy  mr waddington raised his hammer and struck the desk in front of him as his clerk entered the sale the auctioneer looked up and caught burtons eye he beckoned to him eagerly burton came up to the rostrum  burton mr waddington exclaimed i want to talk to you you see whats happened to me he went on mopping his forehead with his handkerchief  yes i see  its that dd bean mr waddington declared but look here burton can you tell me whats happened to the other people  i cannot burton confessed i am beginning to get an idea perhaps  stand by for a bit and watch mr waddington begged i must go on with the sale now take a little lunch with me afterwards dont desert me burton were in this together  burton nodded and found a seat at a little distance from the rostrum from here he watched the remainder of the mornings sale the whole affair seemed to resolve itself into a repetition of the sale of the chest the auctioneers attempts to describe correctly the wares he offered were met with mingled suspicion and disbelief the one or two articles which really had the appearance of being genuine and over which he hesitated fetched enormous prices and all the time his eager clients eyed him suspiciously no one trusted him and yet it was obvious that if he had advertised a sale every day the room would have been packed burton watched the proceedings with the utmost interest once or twice people who recognized him came up and asked him questions to which however he was able to return no satisfactory reply at one oclock precisely the auctioneer with a little sigh of relief announced a postponement even after he had left the rostrum the people seemed unwilling to leave the place  back again this afternoon sir some one called out  at halfpast two the auctioneer replied with a smothered groan    chapter viii  hesitation  mr waddington called a taxicab  i cant stand the golden lion any longer he explained somehow or other the place seems to have changed in the most extraordinary manner during the last week or so everybody drinks too much there the tablelinen isnt clean and the barmaids are too familiar ive found out a little place in jermyn street where i go now when i have time we can talk there  burton nodded he was as a matter of fact intensely interested only a few weeks ago his late employer had spent nearly every moment of his time when his services were not urgently required at the office at the golden lion and he had been seen on more than one occasion at the theatre and elsewhere with one or another of the goldenhaired ladies behind the bar mr waddingtonfortunately perhaps considering his present predicamentwas a bachelor  the restaurant if small was an excellent one and mr waddington who seemed already to be treated with the consideration of a regular customer ordered a luncheon which simple though it was inspired his companion with respect the waiter withdrew and the auctioneer and his quondam clerk sat and looked at one another their eyes were full of questions mr waddington made a bad lapse  what in hell do you suppose it all means burton he demanded you see ive got it too  obviously burton answered i am sure he added a little hesitatingly that i congratulate you  mr waddington at that moment looked scarcely a subject for congratulation a spasm as though of pain had suddenly passed across his face he clutched at the sides of his chair  its marvelous he murmured a single word like that and i suffer in an absolutely indescribable sort of way there seems to be something pulling at me all the time even when it rises to my lips  i shouldnt worry about that burton replied you must get out of the habit its quite easy i expect very soon you will find all desire to use strong language has disappeared entirely  mr waddington was inclined to be gloomy  thats all very well he declared but ive my living to get  you seem to be doing pretty well up to now burton reminded him  mr waddington assented but without enthusiasm  it cant last burton he said i am ashamed to say it but all my crowd have got so accustomed to hear meerexaggerate that they disbelieve everything i say as a matter of habit i tell them now that the goods i am offering are not what they should be because i cant help it and they think its because i have some deep game up my sleeve or because i do not want to part i give them a week or so at the most burtonno more  dont you think burton suggested doubtfully that there might be an opening in the profession for an auctioneer who told the truth  mr waddington smiled sadly  thats absurd burton he replied and you know it  burton considered the subject thoughtfully  there must be occupations he murmured where instinctive truthfulness would be an advantage  i cant think of one mr waddington answered gloomily besides i am too old for anything absolutely new  how on earth did you succeed in letting idlemay house burton asked suddenly  most remarkable incident his host declared reminds me of my last two sales of antique furniture this mana mr forrestercame to me with his wife very keen to take a house in that precise neighborhood i asked him the lowest rent to start with and i told him that the late owner had died of typhoid there and that the drains had practically not been touched since  and yet he took it  took it within twentyfour hours mr waddington continued he seemed to like the way i put it to him and instead of being scared he went to an expert in drains who advised him that there was only quite a small thing wrong hes doing up some of the rooms and moving in in a fortnight  this sounds as though there might be an opening for an honest houseagent burton suggested  mr waddington looked dubious  its never been tried just this once it came off but as a regular thing i should have no confidence in it people like to be gulled theyve been brought up to it they ask for liesthats why the worlds so full of them case of supply and demand you know  according to you then burton remarked a little dolefully it seems as though this change in us unfits us for any sort of practical life  mr waddington coughed even his cough was no longer strident  that he confessed has been worrying me i find it hard to see the matter differently if one might venture upon a somewhat personal question how did you manage to discover a vocation you seem to be prospering he added glancing at his companions neat clothes and gray silk tie  i was fortunate burton admitted frankly i discovered quite by accident the one form in which it is possible to palm off the truth on an unsuspecting public  mr waddington laid down his knife and fork he was intensely interested  art burton murmured softly  art mr waddington echoed under his breath a little vaguely the questioning gleam was still in his eyes  painting sculpture in my case writing burton explained i read something when i was half starving which was in a newspaper and had obviously been paid for and i saw at once that the only point about it was that the man had put down what he saw instead of what he thought he saw i tried the same thing and up to the present at any rate it seems to go quite well  thats queer mr waddington murmured do you know he continued dropping his voice and looking around him anxiously that ive taken to reading ruskin ive got a copy of the seven lamps at the office and i cant keep away from it i slip it into my drawer if any one comes in like an office boy reading the police gazette all the time i am in the streets i am looking at the buildings and burton this is the extraordinary part of it i know no more about architecture than a babe unborn and yet i can tell you where theyre wrong every one of them there are some streets i cant pass through and i close my eyes whenever i get near buckingham palace on the other hand i walked a mile the other day to see a perfect arch down in south kensington and there are some new maisonettes in queen anne street without a single erring line  burton poured himself out a glass of wine from the bottle which his companion had ordered  mr waddington he said this is a queer thing that has happened to us  not a soul would believe it the auctioneer assented no one will ever believe it the person who declared that there was nothing new under the sun evidently knew nothing about these beans  burton leaned across the table  mr waddington he continued i was around at idlemay house this morning i went to see what had become of the flowerpot i found the little room swept bare one of the workmen told me that the things had been stolen  mr waddington showed some signs of embarrassment he waited for his companion to proceed  i wanted the rest of those beans burton confessed  mr waddington shook his head slowly  i havent made up my mind about them yet he said better leave them alone  you do know where they are then burton demanded breathlessly  the auctioneer did not deny it  i had them removed he explained in a somewhat peculiar fashion the fact of it is the new tenant is a very peculiar man and i did not dare to ask him to give me that little tree i simply did not dare to run the risk it is a painful subject with me this because quite thoughtlessly i endeavored to assume the appearance of anger on discovering the theft the words nearly stuck in my throat and i was obliged to lie down for an hour afterwards   burton drew a little breath of relief  i wish id asked you about this before he declared i should have enjoyed my luncheon better  mr waddington coughed  the beans he remarked are in my possession there are only eleven of them and i have not yet made up my mind exactly what to do with them  mr waddington burton said impressively have you forgotten that i am a married man  mr waddington started  god bless my soul he exclaimed i had forgotten that  a wife and one little boy burton continued we were living at garden green in a small plastered edifice called clematis villa my wife is a vigorous woman part of whose life has been spent in domestic service and part in a suburban dressmakers establishment she keeps the house very clean pins up the oleographs presented to us at christmas time by the grocer and the oilman and thinks i look genteel in a silk hat when we walk out to hear the band in the public gardens on thursday evenings  i can see her mr waddington groaned my poor fellow  she cuts out her own clothes burton continued from patterns presented by a ladies penny paper she trims her own hats with an inheritance of feathers which in their day have known every color of the rainbow she loves strong perfumes and she is strenuous on the subject of the primary colors we have a tablecloth with fringed borders for tea on sunday afternoons she hates flowers because they mess up the rooms so but she adorns our parlor with woolwork mementoes artificial roses under a glass case and crockery neatly inscribed with the name of some seaside place  mr waddington wiped the perspiration from his forehead and produced a small silver casket from his waistcoat pocket  stop he begged you win i can see what you are aiming at here is a bean  burton waved it away  listen he proceeded i have also a childa little son his name is alfred he is called alf for short his mother greases his hair and he has a curl which comes over his forehead i have never known him when his hands were not both sticky and dirtyhis hands and his lips on holidays he wears a velveteen suit with grease spots inked over an imitation lace collar and a blue makeup tie  mr waddington reopened the silver casket  it is fate he decided here are two beans burton folded them up in a piece of paper and placed them carefully in his waistcoat pocket  i felt convinced he said gratefully that i should not make my appeal to you in vain tell me what do you think of doing with the rest  i am not sure mr waddington admitted after a brief pause we are confronted from the beginning with the fact that there isnt a living soul who would believe our story if we tried to publish it people would only look upon it as an inferior sort of fiction and declare that the idea had been used before i thought of having one of the beans resolved into its constituents by a scientific physician but i doubt if id get any one to treat the matter seriously of course he went on if there were any quantity of the beans so that we could prove the truth of our statements upon any one who professed to doubt them we might be able to put them to some practical use at present he concluded with a little sigh i really cant think of any  when one considers burton remarked the number of people in high positions who might have discovered these beans and profited by them it does rather appear as though they had been wasted upon an auctioneer and an auctioneers clerk who have to get their livings  i entirely agree with you mr waddington assented i must admit that in some respects i feel happier and life seems a much more interesting place yet i cant altogether escape from certain apprehensions as regards the future  if you take my advice burton said firmly youll continue the business exactly as you are doing at present  i have no idea of abandoning it mr waddington replied the trouble is how long will it be before it abandons me  i have a theory of my own as to that burton declared we will not talk about it at presentsimply wait and see  mr waddington paid the bill  meanwhile he said you had better get down to garden green as quickly as you can you will excuse me if i hurry off it is almost time to start the sale again  burton followed his host into the street the sun was shining and a breath of perfume from the roses in a womans gown assailed him as she passed by on the threshold to enter the restaurant he stood quite still for a moment he had succeeded in his object he had acquired the beans which were to restore to him his domestic life and in place of any sense of satisfaction he was conscious of an intense sense of depression what magic after all could change ellen he forgot for one moment the gulf across which he had so miraculously passed he thought of himself as he was now and of ellen as she had been the memory of that visit to garden green seemed suddenly like a nightmare the memory of the train underground for part of the way with its stuffy odors made him shiver the hot dusty unmade street with its hideous rows of stuccoed villas loomed before his eyes and confirmed his swiftly born disinclination to taking at once this final and ominous step something all the time seemed to be drawing him in another direction the faint magic of a fragrant memorya dream was itthat he had carried with him unconsciously through a wilderness of empty days he hesitated and finally climbed up on to the garden seat of an omnibus on its way to victoria    chapter ix  the land of enchantment  i do not think the girl with the blue eyes said diffidently that i gave you permission to sit down here  i do not believe burton admitted that i asked for it still having just saved your life  saved my life  without a doubt burton insisted firmly she laughed in his face when she laughed she was good to look upon she had firm white teeth light brown hair which fell in a sort of fringe about her forehead and eyes which could be dreamy but were more often humorous she was not tall and she was inclined to be slight but her figure was lithe full of beautiful spring and reach  you drove away a cow she exclaimed it is only because i am rather idiotic about cows that i happened to be afraid i am sure that it was a perfectly harmless animal  on the contrary he assured her seriously there was something in the eye of that cow which almost inspired me with fear did you notice the way it lashed its tail  absurd  at least he protested you cannot find it absurd that i prefer to sit here with you in the shadow of your lilac trees to trudging any further along that dusty road  you havent the slightest right to be here at all she reminded him i didnt even invite you to come in  he sighed  women have so little sense of consequence he murmured when you came in through that gate without saying goodbye i naturally concluded that i was expected to follow especially as you had just pointed this out to me as being your favorite seat  again she laughed then she stopped suddenly and looked at him he really was a somewhat difficult person to place  if i hadnt a very irritable parent to consider she declared i think i should ask you to tea  burton looked very sad  you need not have put it into my head he objected gently the inn smells so horribly of the beer that other people have drunk besides i have come such a long wayjust for a glimpse of you  it seemed to her like a false note she frowned  that she insisted is ridiculous  is it he murmured dont you ever when you walk in your gardens with only that low wall between you and the road wonder whether any of those who pass by may not carry away a little vision with them it is a beautiful setting you know  the people who pass by are few she answered we are too far off the beaten track only on saturdays and holiday times there are trippers fearful creatures who pick the bracken walk arm in arm and sing songs tell me why you look as though you were dreaming my preserver  look along the lane he said softly cant you see themthe wagonette with the tired horse drawn up just on the common therea tired dejectedlooking horse with a piece of bracken tied on to his head to keep the flies off there were three men two women and a little boy they drank beer and ate sandwiches behind that gorse bush there they called one another by their christian names they shouted loud personal jokes one of the women sang she wore a large hat with dyed feathers she had black untidylooking hair and her face was red one of the men made a noise with his lips as an accompaniment there was the little boy tooa pastyfaced little boy with a curl on his forehead who cried because he had eaten too much one of the men sat some distance apart from the others and stared at youstared at you for quite a long time  i remember it perfectly she declared it was last whitmonday hateful people they were all of them but how did you know i saw nobody else pass by  i was there he whispered  and i never saw you she exclaimed in wonder i remember those bank holiday people though how abominable they were  you saw me he insisted gently i was the one who sat apart and stared  of course you are talking rubbish she asserted uneasily  he shook his head  i was behind the banksthe banks of cloud you know he went on a little wistfully i think that that was one of the few moments in my life when i peered out of my prisonhouse i must have known what was coming i must have remembered afterwardsfor i came here  she looked at him doubtfully her eyes were very blue and he looked into them steadfastly by degrees the lines at the sides of her mouth began to quiver  why that person was abominable she declared he stared at me as though i were something unreal he had taken off his coat and rolled his shirt sleeves up he had on bright yellow boots and a hateful necktie you indeed i would as soon believe she concluded that you had fallen today from a flyingmachine  let us believe that he begged earnestly why not indeed in a sense it is true i am cut adrift from my kind a stroller through life a vagabond without any definite place or people i am trying to teach myself the simplest forms of philosophy today the sky is so blue and the wind blows from the west and the sun is just hot enough to draw the perfume from the gorse and the heather come and walk with me over the moors we will race the shadows for surely we can move quicker than those fleecy little morsels of clouds  certainly not she retorted with a firmness which was suspiciously emphasized i couldnt think of walking anywhere with a person whom i didnt know and besides i have to go and make tea in a few minutes  he looked over her shoulder and sighed a trim parlor maid was busy arranging a small table under the cedar tree  tea he murmured it is unfortunate  not at all she replied sharply if youd behave like a reasonable person for five minutes i might ask you to stay  a little instruction he pleaded i am really quite apt my apparent stupidity is only misleading  you may be as you say a vagabond and an outcast and all that sort of thing but this is a conventional english home the girl with the blue eyes declared and i am a perfectly wellbehaved young woman with an absentminded but strict parent i could not think of asking any one to tea of whose very name i was ignorant  he pointed to the afternoon paper which lay at her feet  i sign myself there a passerby my real name is burton until lately i was an auctioneers clerk now i am a drifterwhat you will  you wrote those impressions of st jamess park at dawn she asked eagerly  i did  she smiled a smile of relief  of course i knew that you were a reasonable person she pronounced why couldnt you have said so at once come along to tea  willingly he replied rising to his feet is this your father coming across the lawn  she nodded  hes rather a dear do you know anything about assyria  not a scrap  thats a pity she regretted come father this is mr burton he is very hot and he is going to have tea with us and he wrote those impressions in the piccadilly gazette which you gave me to read my father is an oriental scholar mr burton but he is also interested in modern things  burton held out his hand  i try to understand london he said it is enough for me i know nothing about assyria  mr cowper was a picturesquelooking old gentleman with kind blue eyes and long white hair  it is quite natural he assented you were born in london without a doubt you have lived there all your days and you write as one who sees i was born in a library i saw no city till i entered college i had fashioned cities for myself long before then and dwelt in them  the girl had taken her place at the teatable burtons eyes followed her admiringly  you were brought up in the country he asked his host  i was born in the city of strange imaginings mr cowper replied i read and read until i had learned the real art of fancy no one who has ever learned it needs to look elsewhere for a dwelling house it is the realism of your writing which fascinates me so mr burton i wish you would stay here and write of my garden the moorland too is beautiful  i should like to very much said burton  mr cowper gazed at him in mild curiosity  you are a stranger to me mr burton he remarked my daughter does not often encourage visitors pray tell me how did you make her acquaintance there was a bull he commenceda cow she interrupted softly  on the moor outside your daughter was a little terrified she accepted my escort after i had driven away theanimal  the old gentleman looked as though he thought it the most natural thing in the world  dear me he said how interesting edith the strawberries this afternoon are delicious you must show mrmr burton our kitchen gardens our south wall is famous  this was the whole miracle of how alfred burton whose first appearance in the neighborhood had been as an extremely objectionable tripper was accepted almost as one of the family in a most exclusive little household edith cool and graceful sitting back in her wicker chair behind the daintily laid teatable seemed to take it all for granted mr cowper after rambling on for some time made an excuse and departed through the french windows of his library afterwards burton walked with his young hostess in the oldfashioned walled garden  she treated him with the easy informality of privileged intimacy she had accepted him as belonging notwithstanding his damaging statements as to his antecedents and he walked by the side of his divinity without a trace of awkwardness or nervousness this world of truth was indeed a world of easy ways    the garden was fragrant with perfumes the perfume of fullblown rosesgreat pink and yellow and white blossoms drooping in clusters from trees and bushes of lavender from an ancient bed of stockspink and purple of sweetbriar growing in a hedge beyond they walked aimlessly about along the gravel paths and across the deep greensward and burton knew no world nor thought of any save the world of that garden but the girl when they reached the boundary leaned over the iron gate and her eyes were fixed northwards it was the old storyshe sighed for life and he for beauty the walls of her prisonhouse were beautiful things but not even the lichen and the moss and the peaches which already hung amber and red behind the thick leaves could ever make her wholly forget that they were in a sense symbolicalthe walls of her life  to live here he murmured must be like living in paradise  she sighed there was a little wistful droop about her lips her eyes were still fixed northwards  i should like he said to tell you a fairy story it is about a wife and a little boy  whose wife she asked quickly  mine he replied  there was a brief silence a shadow had passed across her face she was very young and really very unsophisticated and it may be that already the idea had presented itself however faintly that his might be the voice to call her into the promised land certain it is that after that silence some glory seemed to have passed from the summer evening  it is a fairy story and yet it is true he went on almost humbly somehow no one will believe it will you try  i will try she promised   afterwards he held the two beans in the palm of his hand and she turned them over curiously  tell me again what your wife is like she asked  he told her the pitiless truth and then there was a long silence as he stood before her a little breath of wind passed over the garden he came back from the world of sordid places to the land of enchantment there was certainly some spell upon him he had found his way into a garden which lay beyond the world he was conscious all at once of a strange mixture of spicy perfumes a faint sense of intoxication of weird delicate emotions which caught at the breath in his throat and sent the blood dancing through his veins warmed to a new and wonderful music her blue eyes were a little dimmed the droop of her head a little sad quite close to them was a thick bed of lavender he looked at the beans in his hand and his eyes sought the thickest part of the clustering mass of foliage and blossom she had lifted her eyes now and it seemed to him that she had divined his purposeapproved of it even her slim whiteclad body swayed towards him she appeared to have abandoned finally the faint aloofness of her attitude he raised his hand then she stopped him the moment whatever its dangers may have been had passed  i do not know whether your story is an allegory or not she said softly it really doesnt matter does it you must come and see me againafterwards    chapter x  no reconciliation  burton travelled down to garden green on the following morning by the tube which he hated and walked along the familiar avenue with loathing at his heart there was no doubt about ellens being at home the few feet of back yard were full of white garments of unlovely shape recently washed and fluttering in the breeze the very atmosphere was full of soapsuds ellen herself opened the door to him her skirts pinned up around her and a clothespeg in her mouth  he greeted her with an effort at pleasantness good morning ellen he said i am glad to find you at home may i come in  ellen removed the clothespeg from her mouth  its your own house isnt it she replied with a suspicious little quiver in her tone i dont suppose youve forgotten your way into the parlor keep well away from me or you may get some soapsuds on your fine clothes  she raised her red arms above her head and flattened herself against the wall with elaborate care burton hating himself and the whole situation stepped into the parlor ellen followed him as far as the threshold  what is it you want she demanded still retaining one foot in the passage im busy you havent forgotten that its friday morning have you  i want to talk to you for a little while he said gently i have something to propose which may improve our relations  ellens attitude became one of fierce contempt mingled with a slight tremulousness  such ridiculous goingson and ways of speaking she muttered well if youve anything to say to me youll have to wait a bit thats all ive got some clothes i cant leave all in a scurry like this ill send alf in to keep you company  burton sighed but accepted his fate for a few moments he sat upon the sofa and gazed around at the hopeless little room then in due course the door was pushed open and alfred appeared his hair shiny his cheeks redolent of recent ablutions more than a trifle reluctant his conversation was limited to a few monosyllables and a whoop of joy at the receipt of a shilling his efforts at escape afterwards were so pitiful that burton eventually let him out of the window from which he disappeared running at full tilt towards a confectioners shop  presently ellen returned it was exceedingly manifest that her temporary absence had not been wholly due to the exigencies of her domestic occupation her skirt was unpinned a mauve bow adorned her throat a scarf of some gauzy material also mauve floated around her neck she was wearing a hat with a wing which he was guiltily conscious of having once admired and which she attempted in an airy but exceedingly unconvincing fashion to explain  got to go up the street directly she said jerkily what is it  burton had made up his mind that the fewer words he employed the better  ellen he began you have perhaps noticed a certain change in me during the last few weeks  ellens bosom began to heave and her eyes to flash burton hastened on  you will find it hard to believe how it all occurred he continued i want you to though if you can there have been many instances of diet influencing morals but none quite  diet doing what ellen broke in whats that burton came very straight to the point  this change in me he explained simply is merely because i have taken something which makes it impossible for me to say or see anything but the absolute truth i could not tell you a falsehood if i tried wherever i look or whenever i listen i can always see or hear truth i know nothing about music yet since this thing happened it has been a wonderful joy to me i can tell a false note in a second i can tell true music from false i know nothing about art yet i can suddenly feel it and all its marvels you can understand a little perhaps what this means a whole new world full of beautiful objects and inspirations has suddenly come into my life  ellen stared at him blankly  have you gone dotty alfred she murmured  he shook his head  no he replied gently if anything i am a great deal wiser than ever i was before only there are penalties it is about these penalties that i want to talk to you  ellens arms became crooked and her knuckles were screwed into her waist it was an unfortunate and inherited habit of hers which reappeared frequently under circumstances of emotion  will you answer this one question she insisted why has all this made you leave your wife and home tell me that will you  burton went for his last fence gallantly  because our life here is hideous he declared and i cant stand it our house is ugly our furniture impossible the neighborhood atrocious your clothes are all wrong and so are alfreds i could not possibly live here any longer in the way we have been living up to now  ellen gave a little gasp  then what are you doing here now  i cannot come back to you he continued i want you to come to me this is the part of my story which will sound miraculous if not ridiculous to you but you will have to take my word for it try and remember for a moment that there are things in life beyond the pale of our knowledge things which we must accept simply by faith the change which came to me came through eating a sort of bean grown by an old man who was brought home from asia by a great scholar these beans are supposed to contain the germ of truth i have two hereone for you and one for alfred i want you to eat them and afterwards what i hope and believe is that we shall see things more the same way and come together again  he produced the beans from his pocket and ellen took a step forward the shortness of her breath and the glitter in her eyes should have warned him the greatness of his subject however had carried him away his attention was riveted upon the beans lying in the palm of his hand he looked at them almost reverently  are those the things she demanded  he held them out towards her a faint pang of regret stirred his heart for a single second the picture of a beautiful garden glowed and faded before his eyes a wave of delicious perfume came and went the girlslim whitecladlooked at him a little wistfully with her sad blue eyes it was a mirage which passed a mirage or some dear vanishing dream  take one yourself ellen he directed keep the other one carefully for alfred  she snatched them from his hand and before he could stop her she had thrown them out of the open window into the street he was for an instant stricken dumb  and you she cried fiercely you can follow yourbeans as soon as you choose  he looked at her and realized how completely he had failed she was indeed stirred to the very depths of her nature but the emotion which possessed her was one of passionate and jealous anger  not good enough for you as we are eh she cried you dont like our clothes or our manners youve got to be a fine gentleman in five minutes havent you we were good enough for you when thirty shillings a week didnt seem enough to keep us out of debt and i stitched my fingers to the bone with odd bits of dressmaking good enough for you then my man when i cooked your dinner washed your clothes kept your house clean and bore your son working to the last moment till my head swam and my knees tottered truth truth indeed what is there but truth in my life id like to know have i ever told you a lie have i ever looked at another man or let one touch my fingers since the day when you put that ring on and nowtake itand get out  she wrenched her wedding ring from her finger and threw it upon the ground between them her bosom was heaving her cheeks were red and her eyes glittering several wisps of her hair had been unable to stand the excitement and were hanging down the mauve bow had worked its way on to one sidevery nearly under her ear there was no deceit nor any pretence about her she was the daughter of a washerwoman and a greengrocer and heredity had triumphantly asserted itself yet as he backed towards the door before her fierce onslaught burton for the first time since this new thing had come positively admired her  ellen he protested you are behaving foolishly i wanted you and the boy to understand i wanted you to share the things which i had found it was the only way we could be happy together  alfred and i will look after ourselves and our own happiness she declared with a little gulp  other women have lost their husbands i can bear it why dont you go dont you know the way out  burton offered his hand she frankly scoffed at him  i dont understand all that rigmarole about truth she concluded but im no sort of a one at pretense outside my man and stay outside  she slammed the door burton found himself in the street instinctively he felt that her hasty dismissal was intended to conceal from him the torrent of tears which were imminent a little dazed he still groped his way to the spot where ellen had thrown the beans a man was there with a fruit barrow busy apparently rearranging his stock something about his appearance struck burton with a chill premonition he came to a standstill and looked at him  did you wish to buy any fruit sir the man asked in a tone unusually subdued for one of his class  burton shook his head  i was just wondering what you were doing he remarked  the man hesitated  to tell you the truth guvnor he confessed i was mixing up my apples and bananas a bit you see those at the top were all the best and it has been my custom to add a few from underneath theremost of them a little going off it was the only way he added with a sigh that one could make a profit i have made up my mind though to either throw them away or sell them separately for what they are worth which isnt much ive had enough of deceiving the public if i cant get a living honestly with this barrow ill try another job  do you happen to have eaten anything just lately burton asked him with a sinking heart  the man looked at his questioner for a moment doubtfully  ad my breakfast at seven he replied just a bite of bread and cheese since with my morning beer  nothing sincenot anything at all burton pressed  i picked up a funnycolored bean and ate it a few minutes ago queer flavor it had too nothing else that i can think of  burton looked at the man and down at his barrow he glanced around at the neighborhood in which he had to make a living then he groaned softly to himself  good luck to you he murmured and turned away    chapter xi  the gate into paradise  the girl looked up from her seat wonderingly his coming had been a little precipitate his appearance too betokened a disturbed mind  there is a front door she reminded him there are also bells  i could not wait he answered simply i saw the flutter of your gown as i came along the lane and i climbed the wall all the way down i fancied that you might be wearing blue  a slight air of reserve which she had carefully prepared for him faded away what was the use he was such an extraordinary person it was not possible to measure him by the usual standards she was obliged to smile  you find bluebecoming  adorable he replied fervently i have dreamed of you in blue you wore blue only the night before last when i wrote my little sketch of the pavements of bond street on a summer afternoon  she pointed to the journal which lay at her feet  i recognized myself of course she declared trying to speak severely it was most improper of you  it was nothing of the sort he answered bluntly you came into the picture and i could not keep you out you were there so you had to stay  it was much too flattering she objected  again he contradicted her  i could not flatter if i tried he assured her it was just you  she laughed softly  it is so difficult to argue with you she murmured all the same i think that it was most improper but then everything you do is improper you had no right to climb over that wall you had no right to walk here with me the other afternoon even though you had driven away a tame cow you have no right whatever to be here today what about your wife  i have been to garden green he announced i offered her emancipation the same emancipation as that which i myself have attained she refused it absolutely she is satisfied with garden green  you mean the girl asked that she refuses thethe  beans he said precisely she did more than refuse themshe threw them out of the window she has no imagination from her point of view i suppose she behaved in a perfectly natural fashion she told me to go my own way and leave her alone  edith sighed  it is very unfortunate she declared that you were not able to convince her  is it he replied i tried my best and when i had failed i was glad  she raised her eyes for a moment but she shook her head  i am afraid that it doesnt make any difference does it  why not it makes all the difference he insisted  my dear mr burton she expostulated making room for him to sit down beside her i cannot possibly allow you to make love to me because your wife refuses to swallow a bean  but she threw them out of the window he persisted she understood quite well what she was doing her action was entirely symbolical she declared for garden green and the vulgar life  for a girl who lived in an oldfashioned garden and who seemed herself to be part of a fairy story edith certainly took a practical view of the situation  i am afraid she murmured that the divorce courts have no jurisdiction over your case you are therefore a married man and likely to continue a married man i cannot possibly allow you to hold my hand  his head swam for a moment she was very alluring with her pale face set in its clouds of golden hair her faintly wrinkled forehead her bewitchingly regretful smileregretful yet in a sense provocative  i am in love with you he declared  naturally she replied the question is she paused and looked intently at the tip of her slipper it was very small and very pointed and it was quite impossible to ignore the fact that she had a remarkably pretty foot and that she wore white silk stockings burton had never known any one before who wore white silk stockings  i am very much in love with you he repeated i cannot help it it is not my faultthat is to say it is as much your fault as it is mine  the corners of her mouth twitched  is it well what are you going to do about it  i am going to take you down to the orchard through the little gate and across the plank into the hayfield he announced boldly i am going to sit with you under the oak tree where we can just catch the view of the moor through the dip in the hills we will lean back and watch the cloudsthose little white fleecy brokenoff piecesand i will tell you fairy stories we shall be quite alone there and perhaps you will let me hold your hand  she shook her head gently but very firmly such things are impossible  because i have a wife at garden green  she nodded  because you have a wife and becausei had really quite forgotten to mention it before but as a matter of fact i am half engaged to someone myself  he went suddenly white  you are not serious he demanded perfectly she assured him i cant think how i forgot it  does he come here to see you burton asked jealously  not very often he has to work hard burton leaned back in his seat the music of life seemed suddenly to be playing afar offso far that he could only dimly catch the strains the wind too must have changedthe perfume of the roses reached him no more  i thought you understood he said slowly  she did not speak again for several moments then she rose a little abruptly to her feet  you can walk as far as the hayfield with me she said  they passed down the narrow garden path in single file there had been a storm in the night and the beds of pink and white stocks lay dashed and drooping with a weight of glistening raindrops the path was strewn with rose petals and the air seemed fuller than ever of a fresh and delicate fragrance at the end of the garden a little gate led into the orchard side by side they passed beneath the trees  tell me he begged in a low tone about this lover of yours  there is so little to tell she answered he is a member of the firm who publish books for my father he is quite kind to us both he used to come down here more often even than he does now and one night he asked my father whether he might speak to me  and your father  my father was very much pleased she continued we have little money and father is not very strong he told me that it had taken a weight off his mind  how often does he come burton asked  he was here last sunday week  last sunday week and you call him your lover  no i have not called him that she reminded him gently he is not that sort of man only i think that he is the person whom i shall marrysome day  i am sure that you were beginning to like me he insisted  she turned and looked at himat his pale eager face with the hollow eyes the tremulous moutha curiously negative and wholly indescribable figure yet in some dim sense impressive through certain unspelt suggestions of latent force no one could have described him in those days though no one with perceptions could have failed to observe much that was unusual in his personality  it is true she admitted i do like you you seem to carry some quality with you which i do not understand what is it i wonder it is something which reminds me of your writing  i think that it is truthfulness he told her that is no virtue on my part it is sheer necessity i am quite sure that if i had not been obliged i should never have told you that it was i who stared at you from the common there one of a hideous little band of trippers i should not even have told you about my wife it is all so humiliating  it was yourself which obliged yourself she pointed outi mean that the truthfulness was part of yourself do you know it has set me thinking so often if only people realized how attractive absolute simplicity absolute candor is the world would be so much easier a place to live in and so much more beautiful life is so full of small shams so many imperfectly hidden little deceits even if you had not told me this strange story about yourself i think that i should still have felt this quality about you  i should like he declared to have you conceive a passion for the truth i should like to have you feel that it was not possible to live anyhow or anywhere else save in its light if you really felt that it would be like a guiding star to you through life you would never be able even to consider marriage with a man whom you did not love  this evening she said slowly he is coming down i was thinking it all over this afternoon i had made up my mind to say nothing about you since you came however i feel differently i shall tell him everything  perhaps burton suggested hopefully he may be jealous  it is possible she assented he does not seem like that but one can never tell  he may even give you up  she smiled  if he did she reminded him it would not make any difference  i will not admit that he declared i want your lovei want your whole love i want you to feel the same things that i feel in the same way you live in two placesin a real garden and a fairy garden the fairy garden of my dreams i want you to leave the real garden and let me try and teach you how beautiful the garden of fancies may become  she sighed  alas she said it is because i may not come and live always in that fairy garden that i am going to send you away  dont he pleadednot altogether at any rate life is so short so pitifully incomplete we live through so many epochs and each epoch has its own personality it was not i who married ellen it was burton the auctioneers clerk i cannot carry the burden of that fellows asinine mistakes upon my shoulders forever  i am afraid she murmured that however clever the mr burton of today may be he will never be able to rid himself altogether of his predecessors burdens  they were leaning over the gate looking into the deserted hayfield the quiet of evening had stolen down upon them he drew a little nearer to her  dear he whispered there isnt really any ellen there isnt really any woman in the world of my thoughts the world in which i live save you  she was almost in his arms she did not resist but she looked a little pitifully into his face you will notplease she begged  once more the music passed away into the clouds it was the gate into paradise over which he had leaned but the gate was locked and as he stood there it seemed to grow higher and higher until he could not even see over the top almost roughly he turned away  quite right he muttered i must not touch the princess of my fairy garden only let us go back now please i cannot stay here any longer  she obeyed at once there was a queer pathetic little droop at the corners of her lips and she avoided his eyes  goodbye he said  his tone was dull and spiritless something for the moment seemed to have passed from him he seemed indeed to lack both inspiration and courage her fingers clung slightly to his she was praying even that he might laugh to scorn her unspoken appeal he moved a yard away and stood looking at her her heart began to beat wildly surely her prayer would be granted the light of adoration was coming back to his eyes  i cannot see the truth he cried hoarsely you belong to mei feel that you belong to me you are part of the great life i have found youyou are mine and yet    i feel i mustnt touch you i dont understand perhaps i shall come back  he turned and hurried off she watched him until he was a speck upon the road watched him even then from among the shadows of the trees there was a lump in her throat and a misty light in her eyes she had forgotten everything that had seemed absurd to her in this strange little romance her eyes and her arms almost her lips were calling him to her    chapter xii  a bolt from the blue  burtons life moved for a time among the easy places the subeditor of the piccadilly gazette to which he still contributed voluntarily increased his scale of pay and was insatiable in his demand for copy burton moved into pleasant rooms in a sunny corner of an oldfashioned square he sent ellen three pounds a weekall she would acceptand save for a dull pain at his heart which seldom left him he found much pleasure in life then came the first little break in the clear sky mr waddington came in to see him one day and mr waddington was looking distinctly worried he was neatly and tastefully dressed and his demeanor had lost all its old offensiveness his manner too was immensely improved his tone was almost gentle nevertheless there was a perplexed frown upon his forehead and an anxious look in his eyes  business all right i hope burton asked him after he had welcomed his late employer installed him in an easy chair and pushed a box of cigarettes towards him  it is better than all right mr waddington replied it is wonderful we have never had such crowds at the sales and i have taken on four more clerks in the houseletting department  burton laughed softly the humor of the auctioneers position appealed to him immensely  i am making money fast mr waddington admitted without enthusiasm another year or two of this and i could retire comfortably  then what burton asked is the worry  mr waddington smoked vigorously for a moment has it ever occurred to you burton he inquired to ask yourself whether this peculiar state in which you and i find ourselves may be wholly permanent  burton was genuinely startled he sat looking at his visitor like one turned to stone the prospect called up by that simple question was appalling his cigarette burned idly away between his fingers the shadow of fear lurked in his eyes  not permanent he repeated i never thought of that why do you ask  mr waddington scratched his chin thoughtfully it was not a graceful proceeding and burton with a sinking heart remembered that this was one of his employers old habits he scrutinized his visitor more closely although his appearance at first sight was immaculate there were certain alarming symptoms to be noted his linen collar was certainly doing service for the second time and burton noticed with dismay a slight revival of the auctioneers taste for loud colors in his shirt and socks  it was yesterday afternoon mr waddington continued i was selling an oak chest i explained that it was not a genuine antique but that it had certainly some claims to antiquity on account of its design that seemed to me to be a very fair way of putting it then i saw a man who was very keen on buying it examining the brass handles he looked up at me why the handles are genuine he exclaimed theyre real old brass anyway now i knew quite well burton that those handles though they were extraordinarily near the real thing were not genuine i opened my mouth to tell him so and then burton do you know that i hesitated  you didnt tell himthat they were genuine burton gasped  mr waddington shook his head  no he admitted i did not go so far as that still it was almost as great a shock to me i felt a distinct impulse to tell him that they were a few days ago such an idea would never have entered my head it would have been a sheer impossibility  anything else  mr waddington hesitated he seemed to be feeling the shame of these avowals  this morning he confessed i passed the door of the golden lion on my way to the office for the first time sinceyou know wheni felt a desirea faint desire but still it was thereto go in and chaff milly and have a pint of beer in a tankard i didnt go of course but i felt the impulse nevertheless  burton had turned very pale  this he exclaimed is terrible what have you done with the rest of the beans  i have nine mr waddington replied i carry them in my waistcoat pocket i am perfectly convinced now that there is trouble ahead for on my way up the stairs here i felt a strong inclination to tell you that i had lost them in case you should want any  it would be only fair burton declared warmly to divide them mr waddington frowned   i see no reason for that at all he objected feeling his waistcoat pocket the beans are in my possession  but if we are to revert to our former state of barbarism burton urged let us at least do so together  you are some time ahead of me mr waddington pointed out none of these warnings have come to you yet it may be something wrong with my disposition or the way i have swallowed my bean yours may be a permanent affair  burton hesitated then he threw himself into a chair and buried his face in his hands  my time is coming too he confessed mournfully i am in the same position even while you were speaking just now i felt a strong desire to deceive you to invent some experience similar to your own  are you sure of that mr waddington asked anxiously  quite sure burton groaned  then we are both of us in it and thats a fact mr waddington affirmed  burton looked up  about those beans  mr waddington thought for some few moments  i shall keep five and give you four he decided it is treating you very generously i am not obliged to give you any at all you know i am doing it because i am goodnatured and because we are in this thing together if the worst happens you can come back to your old place in the firm i dare say we shall pull along somehow  burton shuddered from head to foot he saw it all mapped out before himthe miserable routine of dull undignified work the whole intolerable outlook of that daily life he covered his face with his hands to shut out the prospect  i couldnt come back he muttered i couldnt  thats all very well mr waddington objected but if this thing really passes off youll be only too glad to i suppose i shall flirt with milly again and drink beer give up ruskin for the sporting times wear loud clothes tell most frightful falsehoods when i sell that terrible furniture and buy another trotting horse to drive out on sundays oh lord  mr waddington rose slowly to his feet he lit a cigarette sniffed it and looked at it disparagingly it was very fine turkish tobacco and one of burtons extravagances  i am not sure after all he declared that there isnt more flavor in a british cigar  burton shuddered  you had better take a bean at once he groaned those cigarettes are made from the finest tobacco imported  mr waddington felt in his waistcoat pocket with trembling fingers slowly produced a little silver box took out a bean and crunched it between his teeth an expression of immense relief at once spread over his features he sniffed at his cigarette with an air of keen appreciation and deliberately handed over to burton his share of the remaining beans  i am myself again he declared firmly i can feel the change already  burton eyed him anxiously  cigarette taste all right now  delicious mr waddington replied most exquisite tobacco makes me shiver inside to think how i could ever have smoked that other filthy rubbish  no idea of calling in at the golden lion on your way back eh burton persisted  mr waddingtons expression was full of reproach the very thought of that place with its smell of stale beer and those awful creatures behind the bar makes me shiver he confessed i shall walk for an hour before lunch in kensington gardens if i have a moment to spare i shall run into the museum and spend a little time with the mosaics what a charming effect the sunlight has coming through those trees burton i want you to come down and see my rooms sometime i have picked up a few trifles that i think you would appreciate  i will come with pleasure burton replied this afternoon if you could spare a few minutes the auctioneer suggested we might go around and look at that romney which has just been unearthed i have been to christies three times already to see it but i should like to take you theres something about the face which i dont quite understand there is a landscape there too just sent up from some country house which i think would interest you  burton shook his head and moved feverishly towards his desk  i am going to work he declared you have frightened me a little i must economize time i shall write a novel a novel of real life i must write it while i can still see the perfect truth    chapter xiii  proof positive  burton did not get very far with his novel about nine oclock on the same evening mr waddington who was spending a quiet hour or two with his books was disturbed by a hasty knock at the door of his rooms he rose with some reluctance from his chair to answer the summons  burton he exclaimed  burton came quickly in he was paler even than usual and there were black shadows under his eyes there was a change in his face indescribable but very apparent his eyes had lost their dreamy look he glanced furtively about him he had the air of a man who has committed a crime and fears detection his dress was not nearly so neat as usual mr waddington whose bachelor evening clothesa loose dinnerjacket and carefully tied black tiewere exactly as they should be glanced disparagingly at his visitor  my dear burton he gasped whatever is the matter with you you seem all knocked over  burton had thrown himself into a chair he was contemplating the little silver box which he had drawn from his pocket  ive got to take one of these he muttered thats all when i have eaten it there will be three left i took the last one exactly two months and four days ago at the same rate in just eight months and sixteen days i shall be back again in bondage  mr waddington was very much interested he was also a little distressed  are you quite sure he asked of your symptoms  absolutely certain burton declared sadly i found myself this evening trying to kiss my landladys daughter who is not in the least goodlooking i was attracted by the programme of a music hall and had hard work to keep from going there a man asked me the way to leicester square just now and i almost directed him wrongly for the sheer pleasure of telling a lie i nearly bought some ties at an outfitters shop in the strandsuch ties its awfulawful mr waddington  mr waddingon nodded his head compassionately  i suppose you know what youre talking about he said you see i have already taken my second bean and to me the things that you have spoken of seem altogether incredible i could not bring myself to believe that an absolute return to those former horrible conditions would be possible for either you or me by the bye he added with a sudden change of tone ive just managed to get a photograph of the romney i was telling you of  burton waved it away  it doesnt interest me in the least he declared gloomily i very nearly bought a copy of ally sloper on my way down here  mr waddington shivered  i suppose there is no hope for you he said it is excessively painful for me to see you in this state on the whole i think that the sooner you take the bean the better  burton suddenly sat up in his chair  what are those sheets of paper you have on the table he asked quickly  they are the sheets of paper left with the little flowerpot in the room of idlemay house mr waddington answered i was just looking them through and wondering what language it was they were written in it is curious too that our friend should have only translated the last few lines  burton rose from his chair and leaned over the table looking at them with keen interest  it was about those papers that i started out to come and see you he declared there must be some way by which we could make the action of these beans more permanent i propose that we get the rest of the pages translated we may find them most valuable  mr waddington was rather inclined to favor the idea  i cannot think he admitted why it never occurred to us before whom do you propose to take them to  there is some one i know who lives a little way down in the country burton replied he is a great antiquarian and egyptologist and if any one can translate them i should think he would be able to lend me the sheets of manuscript just as they are and i will take them down to him tomorrow it may tell us perhaps how to deal with the plant so that we can get more of the beans eight months is no use to me when i am like this just drifting back everything seems possible i can even see myself back at clematis villa walking with ellen listening to the band leaning over the bar of the golden lion listen  he stopped short a barrel organ outside was playing a music hall ditty his head kept time to the music  i wish i had my banjo he exclaimed impulsively then he shivered did you hear that a banjo i used to play it you know  mr waddington looked shocked  the banjo he repeated do you really mean that you want to play it at the present moment  i do burton replied if i had it with me now i should play that tune i should play others like it everything seems to be slipping away from me i can smell the supper cooking in my little kitchen at clematis villa delicious my god i cant bear it any longer here goes  he took a bean from his pocket with trembling fingers and swallowed it then he leaned back in his chair for several moments with closed eyes when he opened them again an expression of intense relief was upon his face  i am coming back already he declared faintly thank heavens mr waddington your room is charming sir japanese prints too i had no idea that you were interested in them that third one is exquisite and what a dado  hewlings himself designed it for me mr waddington observed with satisfaction there are several things i should like you to notice burton that lacquerwork box  burton was already holding it in his fingers and was gazing at it lovingly  it is perfect he admitted what workmanship you are indeed fortunate mr waddington and isnt that mona lisa on the walls what a beautiful reproduction i am saving up money even now to go to paris to see the original only a few nights ago i was reading paters appreciation of it  he rose and wandered around the room making murmured comments all the time presently he came back to the table and glanced down at the sheets of manuscript  mr waddington he said let me take these to my friend i feel that the last few hours must have been a sort of nightmare and yet  he drew out a little box from his waistcoat pocket and peered inside he was suddenly grave  it was no nightmare then he muttered i have really taken a bean  you took it not a quarter of an hour ago mr waddington told him  burton sighed  it is awful to imagine that i should have needed it he confessed there must be some way out of this you will trust me with these sheets mr waddington if my friend in the country can do nothing for us i will take them to the british museum  by all means mr waddington replied take care of them and bring them back safely i should like if possible to have a written translation it should indeed prove most interesting  burton went out with the muskysmelling sheets in his pocket all the temptations of the earlier part of the evening had completely passed away he walked slowly because a big yellow moon hung down from the sky and because mr waddingtons rooms were in a neighborhood of leafy squares and picturesque houses when he came back to the more travelled ways he ceased however to look about him he took a bus to westminster and returned to his rooms somehow or other the possession of the sheets acted like a sedative he felt a new confidence in himself the absurdity of any return to his former state had never been more established the remainder of the night he spent in the same way as many others he drew his writingtable up to the open window and with the lights of the city and the river spread out before him and the faint wind blowing into the room he worked at his novel    chapter xiv  the legend of the perfect food  a foretaste of autumn had crept into the midst of summer there were gray clouds in the sky a north wind booming across the moors burton even shivered as he walked down the hill to the house where she lived there was still gorse still heather still a few roses in the garden and a glimmering vision of the beds of other flowers in the background but the sun which gave them life was hidden burton looked eagerly into the garden and his heart sank there was no sign there of any living person after a moments hesitation he opened the gate passed up the neat little path and rang the bell it was opened after the briefest of delays by the trim parlormaid  is your mistress at home he asked  miss edith has gone to london for two days sir the girl announced the professor is in his study sir  burton stood quite still for a moment it was absurd that his heart should be so suddenly heavy that all the spring and buoyancy should have gone out of life for the first time he realized the direction in which his thoughts had been travelling since he had left his rooms an hour ago he had to remind himself that it was the professor whom he had come to see  mr cowper received him graciously if a little vaguely burton wasted no time however in announcing the nature of his errand directly he produced the sheets the professor became interested the faint odor which seemed shaken out from them into the room stimulated his curiosity he sniffed at it with great content  strange he remarked very strange i havent smelt that perfume since i was with the excavators at chaldea a real oriental flavor young man about your manuscript  there is very little of it burton saidjust a page or so which apparently the writer never had time to finish the sheets came into my hands in rather a curious way and i should very much like to have an exact translation of them i dont even know what the language is i thought perhaps that you might be able to help me i will explain to you later if you will allow me the exact nature of my interest in them  mr cowper took the pages into his hand with a benevolent smile at the first glance however his expression changed it was obvious that he was greatly interested it was obvious also that he was correspondingly surprised  my dear young man he exclaimed my dear mrmr burtonwhy this is wonderful where did you get these sheets do you say are you honestly telling me that they were written within the last thousand years  without a doubt burton replied they were written in london a few months ago  mr cowper was already busy surrounding himself with strangelooking volumes his face displayed the utmost enthusiasm in his task  it is most amazing this he declared drawing a chair up to the table these sheets are written in a language which has been dead as a medium of actual intercourse for over two thousand years you meet with it sometimes in old egyptian manuscripts there was a monastery somewhere near the excavations which i had the honor to conduct in syria where an ancient prayerbook contained several prayers in this language literally i cannot translate this for you actually i will i can get at the sensei can get at the sense quite well but if one could only find the man who wrote it he is the man i should like to see mr burton if the pages were written so recently where is the writer  he is dead burton replied  mr cowper sighed  well well he continued starting upon his task with avidity we will talk about him presently this is indeed miraculous i am most gratefuldeeply grateful to youfor having brought me this manuscript  mr cowper was busy for the next quarter of an hour his expression as he turned up dictionaries and made notes was still full of the liveliest and most intense interest presently he leaned back in his chair he kept one hand upon the loose sheets of manuscript while with the other he removed his spectacles then he closed his eyes for a moment  my young friend he said did you ever hear a quaint asiatic legendscarcely a legend perhaps but a superstitionthat many and many a wise man four thousand years ago spent his nights and his days not as our more modern scientists of a few hundred years ago have done in the attempt to turn baser metals into gold but in the attempt to constitute from simple elements the perfect food for man  burton shook his head he was somewhat mystified  i have never heard anything of the sort he acknowledged  the whole literature of ancient egypt and the neighboring countries mr cowper proceeded abounds with mystical stories of this perfect food it was to come to man in the nature of a fruit it was to give him not eternal lifefor that was valuelessbut eternal and absolute understanding so that nothing in life could be harmful nothing save objects and thoughts of beauty could present themselves to the understanding of the fortunate person who partook of it these pages which you have brought to me to translate are concerned with this superstition the writer claims here that after centuries of research and blending and grafting carried on without a break by the priests of his family each one handing down together with an inheritance of his sacerdotal office many wonderful truths respecting the growth of this fruitthe writer of these lines claims here that he the last of his line has succeeded in producing the one perfect food from which everything gross is eliminated and whose spiritual result upon a normal man is such as to turn him from a thing of clay into something approaching a god  does he mention anything about beans burton asked anxiously  mr cowper nodded benignantly  the perfect food referred to he said appears to have been produced in the shape of small beans they are to be eaten with great care and to ensure permanency in the results a green leaf of the little tree is to follow the consumption of the bean  burton sprang to his feet  a thousand thanks professor he cried that is the one thing we were seeking to discover the leaves of course  mr cowper looked at his visitor in amazement  my young friend he said are you going to tell me that you have seen one of these beans  not only that but i have eaten one burton announcedin fact i have eaten two  mr cowper was greatly excited  where are they he exclaimed show me one where is the tree how did the man come to write this where did he write it let me look at one of the beans  burton produced the little silver snuffbox in which he carried them with his left hand he kept the professor away  mr cowper he said i cannot let you touch them or handle them they mean more to me than i can tell you yet there they are look at them and let me tell you this that old superstition you have spoken of has truth in it these beans are indeed a spiritual food they alter character they have the most amazing effect upon a mans moral system  young man mr cowper insisted i must eat one  burton shook his head  mr cowper he said there are reasons why i find it very hard to deny you anything but as regards those three beans you will neither eat one nor even hold it in your hand sit down and i will tell you a story which sounds as though it might have happened a thousand years ago it happened within the last three months listen  burton told his story with absolute sincerity the professor listened with intense interest it was perhaps strange that extraordinary though it was he never for one moment seemed to doubt the truth of what he heard when burton had finished he rose to his feet in a state of great excitement  this is indeed wonderful he declared it is more wonderful even than you can know of the legend of the perfect food appears in the manuscripts of many centuries it antedates literature by generations there is a tomb in the interior of japan sacred to a saint who for seventy years worked for the production of this very bean that let me tell you was three thousand years ago my young friend you have indeed been favored  let me understand this thing burton said anxiously those pages say that if one eats a green leaf after the bean the change wrought in one will become absolutely permanent  that is so the professor assented now all that you have to do is to eat a green leaf from the little tree after that you will have no more need of those three beans and you can therefore give them to me  burton made no attempt to produce his little silver box  first of all he said i must test the truth of this i cannot run any risks i must go and eat a leaf if in three months no change has taken place in me i will lend you a bean to examine i can do no more than that until this matter is absolutely settled they are worth more than life itself to me  mr cowper seemed annoyed  surely he protested you are not going to ask me to wait three months until i can examine one of these  three months will soon pass burton replied until that time is up i could not part with them  but you cant imagine the professor pleaded how marvelously interesting this is to me remember that i have spent all my life digging about among the archives and the literature and the superstitions of these preegyptian peoples you are the first man in the world outside a little circle of fellowworkers to speak to me of this perfect food your story as to how it came into your hands is the most amazing romance i have ever heard it confirms many of my theories it is wonderful do you realize what has happened you sir you in your insignificant person the professor continued shaking his finger at his visitor have tasted the result of thousands of years of unceasing study wise men in their cells before athens was built before the pyramids were conceived were thinking out this matter in strange parts of egypt in forgotten parts of syria and asia for generations their dream has been looked upon as a thing elusive as the philosophers stone the transmutation of metalsany of these unsolved problems for five hundred yearssince the days of a russian scientist who lived on the black sea but whose name for the moment i have forgottenthe whole subject has lain dead it is indeed true that the fairy tales of one generation become the science of the next our own learned men have been blind the whole chain of reasoning is so clear every article of human food contains its separate particles affecting the moral as well as the physical system why should it have been deemed necromancy to endeavor to combine these parts to evolve by careful elimination and change the perfect food in the house young man which you have told me of there died the hero of the greatest discovery which has ever been made since the world began to spin upon its orbit  will miss edith be back tomorrow burton asked  the professor stared at him  miss edith he repeated oh my daughter is she not in  she is away for two days your servant told me burton replied  perhaps soperhaps so the professor agreed she has gone to her aunts very likely in chelsea my sister has a house there in bromsgrove terrace  burton rose to his feet he held out his hand for the manuscript  i am exceedingly obliged to you he said now i must go  the professor gripped the manuscript in his hand he was no longer a harmless and benevolent old gentleman he was like a wild animal about to be robbed of its prey  no he cried you must not take these away you must not think of it they are of no use to you leave me the sheets just as they are i will go further back there are several words at the meaning of which i have only guessed leave them with me for a few days and i will make you an exact translation  very well burton assented  and one bean the professor begged leave me one bean only i promise not to eat it not to dissect it not to subject it to experiments of any sort let me just have it to look at to be sure that what you have told me is not an hallucination  burton shook his head  i dare not part with one i am going straight back to test the leaf theory if it is correct i will keep my promise andwill you remember me to miss edith when she returns professor  to miss edith yes yes of course mr cowper declared impatiently when shall you be down again my young friend he went on earnestly i want to hear more of your experiences i want you to tell me the whole thing over again i should like to get a signed statement from you there are several points in connection with what you say which bear out a favorite theory of mine  i will come in a few days if i may burton assured him  the professor walked with his guest to the front door he seemed reluctant to let him go  take care of yourself mr burton he enjoined yours is a precious life on no account subject yourself to any risks be careful of the crossings dont expose yourself to inclement weather keep away from any place likely to harbor infectious disease i should very much like to have a meeting in london of a few of my friends if i could ensure your presence  when i come down again burton promised we will discuss it  he shook hands and hurried away in less than an hour and a half he was in mr waddingtons rooms the latter had just arrived from the office  mr waddington burton exclaimed the little tree on which the beans grewwhere is it  mr waddington was taken aback  but i picked all the beans he replied there were only the leaves left  never mind that burton cried it is the leaves we want the treewhere is it quick i want to feel myself absolutely safe  mr waddingtons face was blank  you have heard the translation of those sheets  i have burton answered hastily i will tell you all about it directlyas soon as you have brought me the tree  mr waddington had turned a little pale  i gave it to a child in the street on my way home from idlemay house he declared there was no sign of any more beans coming and i had more than enough to carry  burton sank into a chair and groaned  we are lost he exclaimed unless you can find that child our cure is only temporary we need a leaf each from the tree i have only eight months and two weeks more  mr waddington staggered to a seat he produced his own beans and counted them eagerly  a little under eleven months he muttered we must find the tree    chapter xv  the professor insists  crouched over his writing table with sheets of manuscript on every side of him burton worked like a slave at his novel after a week devoted by mr waddington and himself to a fruitless search for the missing plant they had handed the matter over to a private detective and burton had settled down to make the most of the time before him day after day of strange joys had dawned and passed away he had peopled his room with shadows edith had looked at him out of her wonderful eyes he had felt the touch of her fingers as she had knelt by his side the glow which had crept into his heart as he had read to her fragments of his story and listened to her words of praise the wall which he had built stood firm and fast he lived in his new days life was all foreground and hour by hour the splendid fancies came  it was his first great effort at composition those little studies of his as he had passed backwards and forwards through the streets and crowded places had counted for little here he was making serious demands upon his new capacity in a sense it was all very easy all very wonderful yet sometimes dejection came then his head drooped upon his folded arms he doubted himself and his work he told himself that he was living in a fools paradisea fools paradise indeed  one afternoon there came a timid knock at his door he turned in his chair a little impatiently then his pen slipped from his fingers his left hand gripped the side of the table his right hand the arm of his chair it was a dream of course  i hope we do not disturb you mr burton the professor inquired with anxious amiability my daughter and i were in the neighborhood and i could not resist the visit we had some trouble at first in finding you  burton rose to his feet he was looking past the professor straight into ediths eyes in her white muslin gown her white hat and flowing white veil she seemed to him more wonderful indeed than any of those cherished fancies of her which had passed through his room night and day to the music of his thoughts  i am glad he said simply of course i am glad to see you please come in it is very untidy here i have been hard at work  he placed chairs for them the professor glanced around the room with some satisfaction it was bare but there was nothing discordant upon the walls or in the furniture there were many evidences too of a scholarly and cultivated taste edith had glided past him to the window and was murmuring her praises of the view  i have never seen a prettier view of the river in my life she declared and i love your big window it is almost like living out of doors this and how industrious you have been  she pointed to the sea of loose sheets which covered the table and the floor he smiled he was beginning to recover himself  i have been working very hard he admitted  but why she murmured you are young surely there is plenty of time is it because the thoughts have come to you and you dared not daily with them or is it because you are like every one elsein such a terrible hurry to become rich and famous  he shook his head  it is not that he said i have no thought of either alas he added looking into her eyes i lack the great incentive  then why is it she whispered  you must not ask our young friend too many questions the professor interrupted a trifle impatiently tell me mr burton has there been any changeerin your condition  burton shivered for a moment  none at present he admitted it is scarcely due as yet  mr cowper drew his chair a little nearer his face betokened the liveliest interest edith stood in the window for a moment and then sank into a chair in the background  with reference to your last remark the professor went on it has yet i think to be proved that these beans are of equal potency you understand me i am sure mr burton i mean that it does not in the least follow that because one of them is able to keep you in an abnormal condition for two months the next one will keep you there for the same period  burton was frankly startled  is there anything about that in the translation sir he asked  there is this sentence which i will read to you the professor pronounced drawing a roll of paper from his pocket and adjusting his spectacles i have now a more or less correct translation of the sheets you left with me a copy of which is at your disposal here it isthe formula is now enunciated and proved the secret which has defied the sages of the world since the ages of twilight has yielded itself to me the nineteenth seeker after the truth in one direct line one slight detail alone baffles me so far as i have gone at present the constituent parts containing always the same elements and producing therefore the same effect appear in variable dimensions or potencies for reasons which at present elude me of my formula there is no longer any doubt this substance which i have produced shall purify and make holy the world  the professor looked up from his paper  our interesting friend he remarked seems to have been interrupted at this point probably by the commencement of that illness which had unfortunately a fatal conclusion yet the meaning of what he writes is perfectly clear this substance consolidated i believe into what you term a bean is not equally distributed therefore i take it that you may remain in your present condition for a longer or shorter period of time the potency of the firsterdose is nothing to go by you have however already learned how to render your present condition eternal  burton sighed  the knowledge came too late he said the tree had disappeared it was given away by the mr waddington i told you of to a child whom he met in the street  dear me mr cowper exclaimed gravely this is most disappointing is there no chance of recovering it  we are trying burton replied mr waddington has engaged a private detective and we are also advertising in the papers  you have the beans still at any rate the professor remarked hopefully  we have the beans burton admitted but it is very awkward not knowing how long ones condition is going to last i might go out without my beans one day and find myself assailed by all manner of amazing inclinations  my dear young man the professor said earnestly let me point out to you that this is a wonderful position in which you have been placed you ought to be most proud and grateful any trifling inconveniences which may result should be i venture to say utterly ignored by you now come let me ask you a question are you feeling absolutely yourhow shall i call itrevised self today  absolutely thank heaven burton declared fervently  the professor nodded his head all the time his eyes were roving about burtons person as though he were longing to make a minute study of his anatomy  it would be most interesting he said to trace the commencement of any change in your condition i am here with a proposition mr burton i appeal to you in the name of science as well aserhospitality the change might come to you here while you are alone there would be no one to remark upon it no one to make those interesting and instructive notes which in justice to the cause of progress should be made by some competent person such asforgive memyself i ask you therefore to pack up and return with us to leagate you shall have a study to yourself my daughter will be only too pleased and proud to assist you in your work and i have also a young female who comes to typewrite for me whose services you can entirely command i trust that you will not hesitate mr burton we are most anxiousindeed we are most anxious are we not edithto have you come  burton turned his head and glanced toward the girl she had raised her veil her eyes met his met his question and evaded it she studied the pattern of the carpet when she looked up again her cheeks were pink  mr burton will be very welcome she said  there was a short silence in the room the sunshine fell across the dusty room in a long quivering shaft outside the branches of an elm tree swinging in the wind cast a shadow across the floor the professor with folded arms sat alert and expectant burton pale and shrunken with the labors of the last ten days looked out of his burning eyes at the girl for a single moment she had raised her head had met his fierce inquiry with a certain wistful pathos puzzling an incomplete sentiment now she too was sitting as though in an attitude of waiting burton felt his heart suddenly leap what might lie beyond the wall was of no account he was a man with only a few brief months to live as he had come to understand life he would follow the eternal philosophy he would do as the others and make the best of them  it is very kind of you he said i am not prepared to make a visiti mean my clothes and that sort of thingbut if you will take me as i am i will come with pleasure  mr cowpers face showed the liveliest satisfaction edith on the other hand never turned her head although she felt burtons eyes upon her  capital the professor declared now do not think that we are trying to abduct you but there is a motorcar outside we are going to take you straight home you can have a little recreation this beautiful afternoona walk on the moors or some tennis with edith here we will try and give you a pleasant time you must collect your work now and go and put your things together we are not in the least hurry we will wait  burton rose a little unsteadily to his feet he was weary with much labor carried a little away by this wonderful prospect of living in the same house of having her by his side continually it was too amazing to realize his heart gave a great leap as she moved towards him and looked a little shyly into his face  may i not help you to pick up these sheets i see that you have numbered them all i will keep them in their proper order perhaps you could trust me to do that while you went and packed your bag  quite right my dearquite right the professor remarked approvingly you will find my daughter most careful in such matters mr burton she is used to being associated with work of importance  you are very kind burton murmured if you will excuse me then for a few moments  by all means the professor declared and pray suit yourself entirely mr burton as to the clothes you bring and the preparations you make for your visit if you prefer not to change for the evening i will do the same i am renowned in the neighborhood chiefly for my shabbiness and my carpet slippers  burton paused on the threshold and looked back edith was bending over the table collecting the loose sheets of manuscript the sunlight had turned her hair almost to the color of flame against the background of the open window her slim delicate figure clad in a fashionable mist of lace and muslin seemed to him like some wonderful piece of intensely modern statuary between them the professor sat with his arms still folded a benevolent yet pensive smile upon his lips    chapter xvi  enter mr bomford  i have decided edith remarked stopping the swinging of the hammock with her foot to write and ask mr bomford to come and spend the weekend here  burton shook his head  please dont think of it he begged it would completely upset me i should not be able to do another stroke of work  you and your work edith murmured looking down at him what about me what is the use of being engaged if i may not have my fiancé come and see me sometimes  you dont want him burton declared confidently  but i do she insisted if only to stop your making love to me  i do not make love to you he asserted i am in love with you there is a difference  but you ought not to be in love with meyou have a wife she reminded him  a wife who lives at garden green does not count he assured her besides it was the other fellow who married her she isnt really my wife at all it would be most improper of me to pretend that she was  you are much too complicated a person to live in the same house with she sighed i shall do as i said i shall ask mr bomford down for the weekend  then i shall go back to london he pronounced firmly  a shadow fell across the grass  whats thatwhats that the professor demanded anxiously  they both looked up quickly the professor had just put in one of his unexpected appearances he had a habit of shuffling about in felt slippers which were altogether inaudible  miss edith was speaking of asking a visitora mr bomforddown for the weekend burton explained suavely i somehow felt that i should not like him in any case i have been here for a week and i really ought  edith will do nothing of the sort the professor declared sharply do you hear that edith no one is to be asked here at all mr burtons convenience is to be consulted before any ones  she yawned and made a face at burton  very well father she replied meekly only i might just as well not be engaged at all  just as well the professor snapped such rubbish  edith swung herself upright in the hammock arranged her skirts and faced her father indignantly  how horrid of you she exclaimed you know that i only got engaged to please you because you thought that mr bomford would take more interest in publishing your books if i cant ever have him here i shall break it off he expects to be askedi am quite sure he does  the professor frowned impatiently  you are a most unreasonable child he declared mr bomford may probably pay us a passing visit at any time and you must be content with that  edith sighed she contemplated the tips of her shoes for some moments  i do seem to be in trouble today she remarkedfirst with mr burton and then with you  the professor turned unsympathetically away  you know perfectly well how to keep out of it he said making his way toward the house  between you both edith continued i really am having rather a hard time this is the last straw of all i am deprived of my young man now just to please you  he isnt a young man burton contradicted  edith clasped her hands behind her head and looked fixedly up at the blue sky  never mind his age she murmured he is really very nice  ive seen his photograph in the drawingroom burton reminded her  edith frowned  he is really much better looking than that she said with emphasis  it is perhaps as well burton retorted especially if he is in the habit of going about unattended  edith ignored his last speech altogether mr bomford is also she went on extremely pleasant and remarkably wellread his manners are charming  i am sorry you are missing him so much burton said  a girl edith declared with her head in the air naturally misses the small attentions to which she is accustomed from her fiancé  if there is anything an unworthy substitute can do burton began  nice girls do not accept substitutes for their fiancés edith interrupted ruthlessly i am a very nice girl indeed i think that you are very lazy this afternoon you would be better employed at work than in talking nonsense  burton sighed  i tried to work this morning he declared i gave up simply because i found myself thinking of you all the time genius is so susceptible to diversions this afternoon i couldnt settle down because i was wondering all the time whether you were wearing blue linen or white muslin i just looked out of the window to seeyou were asleep in the hammock    you witch he murmured softly how could i keep sane and collected how could i write about anybody or anything in the world except you the wind was blowing those little strands of hair over your face your left arm was hanging downso why is an arm such a graceful thing i wonder your left knee was drawn upyou had been supporting a book against it and  i dont want to hear another word edith protested quickly  he sighed  it took me about thirty seconds to get down he murmured you hadnt moved  shall we have tea out here or in the study edith asked  anywhere so long as we escape from this burton replied gazing across the lawn what is it  a man was making his way from the house towards them a man who certainly presented a somewhat singular appearance he was wearing a long linen duster a motorcap which came over his ears and a pair of goggles which he was busy removing edith swung herself on to her feet considering her late laments the dismay in her tone was a little astonishing  it is mr bomford she cried  burton sighedwith relief  i am glad to hear that it is human he murmured i thought that it was a wells nightmare or that something from underground had been let loose  she shot an indignant glance at him her greeting of mr bomford was almost enough to turn his head she held out both her hands  my dear mrmy dear paul she exclaimed how glad i am to see you have you motored down  obviously my dear obviously the newcomer remarked removing further portions of his disguise and revealing a middleaged man of medium height and unimposing appearance with slight sandy whiskers and moustache a very hot and dusty ride too still after your fathers message i did not hesitate for a second where is he edith have you any idea what it is that he wants  she shook her head  did he send for you she asked  send for me mr bomford repeated i should rather think he did  he looked inquiringly towards burton edith introduced them  this she said is mr burton a friend of fathers who is staying with us for a few days he is writing a book perhaps if you are very polite to him he will let you publish it mr bomfordmr burton  the two men shook hands solemnly neither of them expressed any pleasure at the meeting  i am sure you would like a drink edith suggested let me take you up to the house and we can find father you wont mind mr burton  not in the least he assured her  they disappeared into the house burton threw himself once more upon the lawn his hands clasped behind his head gazing upwards through the leafy boughs to the blue sky so this was mr bomford this was the rival of whom he had heard not so very formidable a person not formidable at all save for one thing onlyhe was free to marry her free to marry edith burton lay and dreamed in the sunshine a thrush came out and sang to him a west wind brought him wafts of perfume from the gardens below the serenity of the perfect afternoon mocked his disturbed frame of mind what was the use of it all the longer he remained here the more abject he became    suddenly edith reappeared alone she came across the lawn to him with a slight frown upon her forehead he lay there and watched her until the last moment then he rose and dragged out a chair for her  so the lovers interview is over he ventured to observe you do not seem altogether transported with delight  i am very much pleased indeed to see mr bomford she assured him  i he murmured am glad that i have seen him  edith looked at him covertly  i do not think she said that i quite approve of your tone this afternoon  i am quite sure he retorted that i do not approve of yours  she made a little grimace at him  let us agree then to be mutually dissatisfied i do wish she added softly that i knew why father had sent for mr bomford it is nothing to do with his work i am sure of that he knows that paul hates coming away from the office on week days  burton groaned  is his name paul  certainly it is she answered  it sounds very familiar  it is nothing of the sort when you are engaged to a person you naturally call him by his christian name i cant think though why father didnt tell us that he was coming  i have an idea burton declared that his coming has something to do with me  with you  why not am i not an interesting subject for speculation mr bomford you told me only a few days ago is a scientist an egyptologist a philosopher why should he not be interested in the same things which interest your father  it is quite true she admitted i had not thought of that  at the present moment burton continued moving a little on one side they are probably in the diningroom drinking hock and seltzer and your father is explaining to your fiancé the phenomenon of my experiences i wonder whether he will believe them  mr bomford she said will believe anything that my father tells him  are you very much in love burton asked irrelevantly  you ask such absurd questions she replied nowadays one is never in love  how little you know of what goes on nowadays he sighed what about myself do i need to tell you that i am hopelessly in love with you  you she declared are a phenomenon you do not count  the professor and his guest came through the french window arm in arm talking earnestly  look at them burton groaned they are talking about mei can tell it by their furtive manner mr bomford has heard the whole story he is a little incredulous but he wishes to be polite to his future fatherinlaw what a pity that i could not have a relapse while he is here  couldnt you she exclaimed it would be such fun  burton shook his head  nothing but the truth he declared sadly  mr bomford without his motoring outfit was still an unprepossessing figure he wore a pincenez his manner was fussy and inclined to be a little patronizing he had the air of an unsuccessful pedagogue he was obviously regarding burton with a new interest during teatime he conversed chiefly with edith who seemed a little nervous and answered most of his questions with monosyllables burton and the professor were silent burton was watching edith and the professor was watching burton as soon as the meal was concluded the professor rose to his feet  edith my dear he said we wish you to leave us for a minute or two mr bomford and i have something to say to mr burton  edith with a slight shrug of the shoulders rose to her feet she caught a glance from burton and turned at once to her fiancé  am i to be taken for a ride this evening she asked  a little later on by all means my dear edith mr bomford declared a little later on certainly your father has kindly invited me to stay and dine it will give me very much pleasure perhaps we could go for a short distance insay threequarters of an hours time  edith went slowly back to the house burton watched her disappear the professor and mr bomford drew their chairs a little closer the professor cleared his throat  mr burton he began mr bomford and i have a proposition to lay before you may i beg for your undivided attention  burton withdrew his eyes from the french window through which edith had vanished  i am quite at your service he answered quietly please let me hear exactly what it is that you have to say    chapter xvii  burton declines  the professor cleared his throat  in the first place mr burton he said i feel that i owe you an apology i have taken a great liberty mr bomford here is one of my oldest and most intimate friends i have spoken to him of the manuscript you brought me to translate i have told him your story  mr bomford scratched his side whiskers and nodded patronizingly  it is a very remarkable story he declared a very remarkable story indeed i can assure you mrmr burton that i never listened to anything so amazing if any one else except my old friend here had told me of it i should have laughed i should have dismissed the whole thing at once as incredible and preposterous even now i must admit that i find it almost impossible to accept the story in its entirety  burton looked him coldly in the eyes mr bomford did not please him  the story is perfectly true he said there is not the slightest necessity for you to believe itin fact so far as i am concerned it does not matter in the least whether you do or not  mr burton the professor interposed i beg that you will not misunderstand mr bomford his is not a militant disbelief it is simply a case of suspended judgment in the meantime assuming the truth of what you have told usand i for one you must remember mr burton have every faith in your storyassuming its truth mr bomford has made a most interesting proposition  burton with halfclosed eyes was listening to the singing of a thrush and watching the sunshine creep through the dark foliage of the cedar trees he was only slightly interested  a proposition he murmured  precisely mr cowper assented we have an appeal to make to you an appeal on behalf of science an appeal on behalf of your fellowcreatures an appeal on behalf of yourself your amazing experience is one which should be analyzed and given to the world  what you want i suppose burton remarked is one of my beans  exactly the professor admitted eagerly  i have already burton said done my best to make you understand my feelings in this matter those beans represent everything to me nothing would induce me to part with a single one  we can understand that the professor agreed we are approaching you with regard to them in an altogether different manner mr bomford is a man of business it is our wish to make you an offer  you mean that you would like to buy one  precisely the professor replied we are prepared to give you between us a thousand pounds for one of those beans  burton shook his head the conversation appeared to be totally devoid of interest to him  a thousand pounds he said is i suppose a great deal of money i have never owned so much in my life but money after all is only valuable for what it can buy each one of my beans means two months perhaps more of real life no money could buy that  my young friend the professor insisted solemnly you are looking at this matter from a selfish point of view experiences such as you have passed through belong to the world you are merely the agent the fortunate medium through which they have materialized  burton shrugged his shoulders  so far he replied i owe no debt to humanity the longer i live and the wiser i get the more i realize the absolute importance of selfcare individualism is the only real and logical creed no one else looks after your interests no one else in the world save yourself is of any real account  a thousand pounds mr bomford interposed is a great deal of money for a young man in your position  it is a very great deal burton admitted but what you and mr cowper both seem to forget is the very small part that money plays in the acquisition of real happiness money will not buy the joy which makes life worth living it will not buy the power to appreciate the power to discriminate it will not buy taste or the finer feelings without the possession of which one becomes a dolt a thing that creeps about the face of the world i thank you for your offer professor and mr bomford but i have nothing to sell if you would excuse me  he half rose from his chair but mr cowper thrust him back again  we have not finished yet my dear mr burton he said eagerly you are making up your mind too hastily  a thousand pounds mr bomford repeated condescendingly is a very useful sum those peculiar gifts of yours may vanish take the advice of a business man remember that you will still have two or three beans left it is only one we ask for i want to put the matter on as broad a basis as possible we make our appeal on behalf of the cause of science you must not refuse us burton rose to his feet determinedly not only do i refuse he said but it is not a matter which i am inclined to discuss any longer i am sorry if you are disappointed but my story was really told to mr cowper here in confidence he left them both sitting there he found edith in a corner of the long drawingroom she was pretending to read  whatever is the matter she asked i did not expect you so soon i thought that mr bomford and father wanted to talk to you so they did he replied they made me a foolish offer it was mr bomfords idea i am sure not your fathers i am tired edith come and walk with meshe glanced out of the window  i think she said demurely that i am expected to go for a ride with mr bomford  then please disappoint him he pleaded i do not like your friend mr bomford he is an egotistical and ignorant person we will go across the moors we will climb our little hill perhaps we might even wait there until the sunset  i am quite sure she said decidedly that mr bomford would not like that  what does it matter he answered a man like mr bomford has no right to have any authority over you at all you are of a different clay i am sure that you will never marry him if you will not walk with me i shall work and i am not in the humor for work i shall probably spoil one of my best chapters  she rose to her feet  in the interests of your novel she murmured come only we had better go out by the back door  like children they stole out of the house they climbed the rolling moorland till they reached the hill on the further side of the valley she sat down breathless with her back against the trunk of a small scotch fir burton threw himself on to the ground by her side  we think too much always of consequences he said after this evening what does anything matter the gorse is a flaming yellow do you see how it looks like a field of gold there in the distance only the haze separates it from the blue sky look down where i am pointing edith it was there by the side of the road that i first looked into the garden and saw you  it was not you who looked she objected shaking her head it was the other man  what part is it that survives he asked a little bitterly why should the new man be cursed with memory dont you think that even then there must have been two of me one struggling against the otherone seeking for the big things one laying hold of the lower we are all like that edith even now i sometimes feel the tug although it leads in other directions  to garden green she murmured  never that he answered fiercely and you know it there are lower heights though in the most cultured of lives there are moments of madness moments that carry one off ones feet which come alike to the slave and his master dear edith up here one can talk it is such a beautiful world one can open ones eyes one can breathe one can look around him it is the joy of simple things the real true joy of life which beats in our veins do you think that we were made for unhappiness in such a world edith  no she whispered faintly  there isnt anything so beautiful to me upon gods earth he continued as the love in my heart for you i wanted to tell you so this evening i have brought you here to tell you soto this particular spot something tells me that it may be almost our last chance i left those two whispering upon the lawn what is it they are planning i wonder that man bomford is no companion for your father he has given him an idea about me and my story what is it i wonder to rob me to throw me out to take my treasure from me by force  you are my fathers guest she reminded him softly he will not forget it  there are greater things in the world he went on than the obligations of hospitality there are tides which sweep away the landmarks of nature herself your father is thirsty for knowledge this man bomford is his friend there have been more crimes committed in the world for lofty motives than one hears of  he leaned a little forward they could see the smoke curling up from the house below its gardens laid out like patchwork the low house itself covered with creepers  it was an idyll that he went on bomfords trail is about the place now the trail of some poisonous creature nothing will ever be the same i want to remember this last evening i have looked upon life from the hill tops and i have looked at it along the level ways but i have seen nothing in it so beautiful i have felt nothing in it so wonderful as my love for you you were a dream to me before half hidden only partly realized soon you will be a dream to me again but never never dear since the magic brush painted the blue into the skies the purple on to the heather the green on to the grass the yellow into the gorse the blue into your eyes was there any love like mine  she leaned towards him her fingers were cold and her voice trembled  you must not she begged  he smiled as he passed his arm around her  are we not on the hill top dear he said you need have no fear only tonight i felt that i must say these things to you even though the passion which they represent remains as ineffective forever as the words themselves i have a feeling you know that after today things will be different  why should they be she asked in any case your time cannot come yet  once more he looked downward into the valley like a little speck along the road a motorcar was crawling along  it is mr bomford he said he is coming to look for you  she rose to her feet together they stood for a moment hand in hand looking down upon the flaming landscape the fields at their feet were brilliant with color in the far distance the haze of the sea their fingers were locked  mr bomford he sighed is coming up the hill  then i think she said quietly that we had better go down    chapter xviii  the end of a dream  dinner that evening was a curious meal partly constrained partly enlivened by strange little bursts of attempted geniality on the part of the professor mr bomford told long and pointless stories with much effort and the air of a man who would have made himself agreeable if he could edith leaned back in her chair eating very little her eyes large her cheeks pale she made her escape as soon as possible and burton watched her with longing eyes as he passed out into the cool darkness he half rose indeed to follow her but his host and mr bomford both moved their chairs so that they sat on either side of him the professor filled the glasses with his own hand it was his special claret a wonderful wine the cobwebbed bottle of which reposing in a wicker cradle he handled with jealous care  mr burton he began settling down in his chair we have been unjust to you mr bomford and i we apologize we ask your forgiveness  unjust burton murmured  unjust the professor repeated i allude to this with a certain amount of shame we made you an offer of a thousand pounds for a portion of thaterpeculiar product to which you owe this wonderful change in your disposition we were in the wrong we had thoughts in our mind which we should have shared with you it was not fair mr burton to attempt to carry out such a scheme as mr bomford here had conceived without including you in it the professor nodded to himself amiably satisfied with his words burton remained mystified mr bomford took up the ball  we yielded mr burton he said to the natural impulse of all business men we tried to make the best bargain we could for ourselves a little reflection anderyour refusal of our offer has brought us into what i trust you will find a more reasonable frame of mind we wish now to treat you with the utmost confidence we wish to lay our whole scheme before you  i dont know what you mean burton declared a little wearily you want one of my beans for which you offered a certain sum of money i am sorry i would give you one if i could but i cannot spare it they are all that stand between me and a relapse into a state of being which i shudder to contemplate need we discuss it any further i think if you do not mind  he half rose to his feet his eyes were searching the shadows of the garden the professor pulled him down  be reasonable mr burtonbe reasonable he begged listen to what mr bomford has to say  mr bomford cleared his throat scratched his chin for a moment thoughtfully and half emptied his glass of claret  our scheme my young friend he said condescendingly is worthy even of your consideration you are i understand gifted with some powers of observation which you have turned to lucrative account it has naturally occurred to you then in your studies of life that the greatest accumulations of wealth which have taken place during the present generation have come entirely through discoveries which either nominally or actually have affected the personal wellbeing of the individual do i make myself clear  i have no doubt burton murmured that i shall understand presently  once convince a man mr bomford continued that you are offering him something which will improve his health and he is yours or rather his money ishis two and sixpence or whatever particular sum you may have designed to relieve him of it is for that reason that you see the pages of the magazines and newspapers filled with advertisements of new cures for ancient diseases there is more money in the country than there has ever been but there are just the same number of real and fancied diseases mankind is if possible more credulous today than at any epoch during our history there are millions who will snatch at the slightest chance of getting rid of some real or fancied ailment great journals have endeavored to persuade us that you can attain perfect health by standing on your head in the bathroom for ten minutes before breakfast a million bodies distorted into strange shapes can be seen every morning in the domestic bedchamber a healthfood made from old bones has been one of the brilliant successes of this generation now listen to my motto this is what i want to bring home to every inhabitant of this country this is what i want to see in great black type in every newspaper on every hoarding and if possible flashed at night upon the sky cure the mind first the mind will cure the body that mr bomford concluded modestly is my idea of one of our preliminary advertisements  the professor nodded approvingly burton glanced from one to the other of the two men with an air of almost pitiful noncomprehension mr bomford having emptied his glass of claret started afresh  my idea in short he went on is this let us three join forces let us analyze this marvelous product into the possession of which you mr burton have so mysteriously come let us blending its constituents as nearly as possible place upon the market a healthfood not for the body but for the mind you follow me now i am sure menticulture is the craze of the moment it would become the craze of the million but for a certain vagueness in its principles a certain lack of appeal to direct energies we will preach the cause we will give the public something to buy we will ask them ten and sixpence a time and they will pay it gladly what is more mr burton the public will pay it all over the world america will become our greatest market nothing like this has ever before been conceived leave your bodies alone for a time we shall say take our food and improve your moral system we shall become the crusaders of commerce your story will be told in every quarter of the globe it will be translated into every conceivable tongue your picture will very likely adorn the lid of our boxes it will be a matter for consideration indeed whether we shall not name this great discovery after you  so it was for this burton exclaimed that you offered me that thousand pounds  we were to blame mr bomford admitted  very much to blame the professor echoed  nevertheless mr bomford insisted it is an incident which you must forget it is mans first impulse is it not to make the best bargain he can for himself we tried it and failed for the future we abandon all ideas of that sort mr burton we associate you both nominally and in effect with our enterprise in which we will be equal partners the professor will find the capital i will find the commercial experience you shall hand over the bean i promise you that before five years have gone by you shall be possessed of wealth beyond any dreams you may ever have conceived  burton moved uneasily in his chair  but i have never conceived any dreams of wealth at all he objected i have no desire whatever to be rich wealth seems to me to be only an additional excitement to vulgarity besides the possession of wealth in itself tends to an unnatural state of existence man is happy only if he earns the money which buys for him the necessaries of life  mr bomford listened as one listens to a lunatic mr cowper however nodded his head in kindly toleration  thoughts like that he admitted have come to me my young friend in the seclusion of my study they have come perhaps in the inspired moments but in the inspired moments one is not living that everyday and necessary life which is forced upon us by the conditions of existence in this planet there is nothing in the whole scheme of life so great as money with it you can buy the means of gratifying every one of those unnatural desires with which fate has endowed us take my case for instance if this wealth comes to me i shall spend no more upon what i eat or drink or wear yet on the other hand i shall gratify one of the dreams of my life i shall start for the east with a search party equipped with every modern invention which the mind of man has conceived i shall go from site to site of the ruined cities of egypt no one can imagine what treasures i may not discover i shall even go on to a part of africabut i need not weary you with this i simply wanted you to understand that the desire for wealth is not necessarily vulgar  burton yawned slightly his eyes sought once more the velvety shadows which hung over the lawn he wondered down which of those dim avenues she had passed  i am so sorry he said apologetically you are a man of business mr bomford and you professor see much further into life than i can but i do not wish to have anything whatever to do with your scheme it does not appeal to me in the leastin fact it offends me it seems crassly vulgar a vulgar way of attaining to a position which i personally should loathe  he rose to his feet  if you will excuse me professor he said mr bomford with a greater show of vigor than he had previously displayed jumped up and laid his hand upon the young mans shoulder his hard face seemed suddenly to have become the rioting place for evil passions his lips were a little parted and his teeth showed unpleasantly  do you mean young man he exclaimed that you refuse to join us  that is what i intended to convey burton replied coldly  you refuse either to come into our scheme or to give us one of the beans  burton nodded  i hold them in trust for myself there was a moments silence mr bomford seemed to be struggling for words the professor was looking exceedingly disappointed  mr burton he protested i cannot help feeling a certain amount of admiration for your point of view but believe me you are entirely in the wrong i beg that you will think this matter over  i am sure that it would be useless burton replied nothing would induce me to change my mind  nothing mr bomford asked with a peculiar meaning in his tone  nothing the professor echoed softly  burton withdrew his eyes from the little shadowy vista of garden and looked steadfastly at the two men then his heart began to beat he was filled with a sort of terror lest they should say what he felt sure was in their minds it was like sacrilege it was something unholy his eyes had been caught by the flutter of a white gown passing across one of the lighter places of the perfumed darkness they had been watching him he only prayed that they would not interrupt until he had reached the end of his speech  professor he said softly turning to his host there is one thing which i desire so greatly that i would give my life itself for it i would give even what you have asked for tonight and be content to leave the world in so much shorter time but that one thing i may not ask of you for in those days of which i have told you before the wonderful adventure came i was married my wife lives now in garden green i have also a little boy you will forgive me  he passed through the open french windows and neither of them made any further attempt to detain him their silence was a little unnatural and from the walk outside he glanced for a moment behind him the two men were sitting in exactly the same positions their faces were turned towards him and their eyes seemed to be following his movements yet there was a change the professor was no longer the absorbed mildly benevolent man of science mr bomford had lost his commonplace expression there was a new thing in their faces something eager ominous burton felt a sudden depression as he turned away he looked with relief at the thin circle of the moon visible now through the waving elm trees at the bottom of the garden he drew in with joy a long breath of the delicious perfume drawn by the night from the silent boughs of the cedar tree resolutely he hurried away from the sight of that ugly little framed picture upon which he had gazed through the open french windowsthe two men on either side of the lamp watching him  edith he called softly  she answered him with a little laugh she was almost by his side he took a quick step forward she was standing among the deepest shadows against the trunk of the cedar tree her slim body leaning slightly against it it seemed to him that her face was whiter her eyes softer than ever he took her hand in his  she smiled  you must not come out to me here she whispered mr bomford will not like it it is most improper  but it may be our goodbye he pleaded they want me to do something mr bomford and your father something hideous utterly grotesque i have refused and they are very angry  what is it that they want you to do  dear he answered you i am sure will understand they want me to give them one of my beans they want to make some wretched drug or medicine from it to advertise it all over the world to amass a great fortune  are you in earnest she cried  absolutely he assured her it is mr bomfords scheme he says that it would mean great wealth for all of us your father too praises it he too seemed to comefor the moment at any rateunder the curse he too is greedy for money  and you she whispered what did you say  what did i say he repeated wonderingly but of course you know imagine the horror of ita healthfood for the mind huge sums of money rolling in from the pockets of credulous people money stinking with the curse of vulgarity and quackery it is almost like a false note dear to speak of it out here but i must tell you because they are angry with me i am afraid that your father will send me away and i am afraid that our little dream is over and that i shall not wander with you any more evenings here in the cool darkness when the heat of the day is past and the fragrance of the cedar tree and your roses fills the air and you your sweet self edith are here  she was looking at him very fixedly her lips were a little parted her eyes were moist her bosom was rising and falling as though she were shaken by some wonderful emotion  dear she murmured  it seemed to him that she leaned a little towards him his heart ached with longing very slowly almost reverently his hands touched her shoulders drew her towards him  you and i he whispered at least we live in the same world nothing will ever be able to take the joy of that thought from my heart  she remained quite passive in her eyes there was a faraway look  dear she said softly in his ear you are such a dreamer arent yousuch a dear unpractical person have you never used your wonderful imagination to ask yourself what money may really mean you can buy a world of beautiful things you can buy the souls of men and women you can buy the law  he felt a cold pain in his heart looking at her through the twilight he could almost fancy that there was a gleam in her face of something which he had seen shining out of her fathers eyes his arms fell away from her the passion which had thrilled him but a moment ago seemed crushed by that great resurgent impulse which he was powerless to control  you think that i should do this he cried hoarsely  why not she answered money is only vulgar if you spend it vulgarly it might mean so much to you and to me  tell me how he faltered  mr bomford is very fond of money she continued he is fonder of money i think than he is of me and then she added her voice sinking to a whisper there is garden green of course i do not know much about these things but i suppose if you really wanted to and spent a great deal of money you could buy your freedom couldnt you  the air seemed full of jangling discords he closed his eyes it was as though a shipwreck was going on around him his dream was being broken up into pieces the girl with the fair hair was passing into the shadows from which she had come she called to him across the lawn as he hurried away softly at first and then insistently but burton did not return he spent his night upon the common    chapter xix  a bad halfhour  burton slept that night under a gorse bush he was no sooner alone on the great unlit common with its vast sense of spaciousness its cool silence its splendid dome of starlit sky than all his anger and disappointment seemed to pass away the white threatening faces of the professor and mr bomford no longer haunted him even the memory of edith herself tugged no longer at his heartstrings he slept almost like a child and awoke to look out upon a million points of sunlight sparkling in the dewdrops a delicious west wind was blowing little piledup masses of white cloud had been scattered across the blue sky even the gorse bushes creaked and quivered the fir trees in a little spinney close at hand were twisted into all manners of shapes burton listened to their music for a few minutes and exchanged civilities with a dapplebreasted thrush seated on a clump of heather a few yards away then he rose to his feet took in a long breath of the fresh morning air and started briskly across the common towards the nearest railway station  he was conscious after the first few steps of a dim premonition of some coming change it did not affectindeed it seemed to increase the lightness of his spirits yet he was conscious at the back of his brain of a fear which he could not put into words the first indication of real trouble came in the fact that he found himself whistling yipiaddyiay as he turned into the station yard he knew then what was coming  after the first start the rapidity of his collapse was appalling the seclusion of the firstclass carriage to which his ticket entitled him and which his somewhat peculiar toilet certainly rendered advisable was suddenly immensely distasteful he bought titbits and ally sloper at the bookstall squeezed his way into a crowded thirdclass compartment and joined in a noisy game of nap with half a dozen roistering young clerks who were full of jokes about his crumpled dinner clothes arrived in london he had the utmost difficulty to refrain from buying a red and yellow tie displayed in the station lavatory where he washed and shaved and the necessity for purchasing a collar stud left him for a few moments in imminent peril of acquiring a large brassstemmed production with a sham diamond head he hastened to his rooms scarcely daring to look about him turned over the clothes in his wardrobe with a curious dissatisfaction and dressed himself hastily in as offensive a combination of garments as he could lay his hands upon he bought some common virginian cigarettes and made his way to the offices of messrs waddington and forbes  mr waddington was unfeignedly glad to see him his office was pervaded by a sort of studious calm which from a business point of view seemed scarcely satisfactory mr waddington himself appeared to be immersed in a calfbound volume of ruskin he glanced curiously at his late employee  did you dress in a hurry burton he inquired that combination of gray trousers and brown coat with a blue tie seems scarcely in your usual form  burton dragged up a chair to the side of his late employers desk  mr waddington he begged dont let me go out of your sight until i have taken another bean it came on early this morning i went through all my wardrobe to find the wrong sort of clothes and the only thing that seemed to satisfy me was to wear odd ones whatever you do dont lose sight of me in a few hours time i shouldnt want to take a bean at all i should be inviting you to lunch at the golden lion playing billiards in the afternoon and having a night out at a music hall  mr waddington nodded sympathetically  poor fellow he said seems odd that you should turn up this morning i can sympathize with you have you noticed my tie  burton nodded approvingly  very pretty indeed he declared  you wont think so when youve had that bean mr waddington groaned it began to come on with me about an hour ago i forced myself into these clothes but the tie floored me ive a volume of ruskin here before me but underneath you see he continued lifting up the blottingpaper is a copy of snapshots im fighting it off as long as i can the fact is ive a sale this afternoon i thought if i could last until after that it might not be a bad thing  hows the biz burton asked with a touch of his old jauntiness going strong eh  not so good and not so bad mr waddington admitted weve got over that boom that started at first when people didnt understand things they seem to regard me now with a mixture of suspicion and contempt all the same we get a good many outside buyers in and weve pulled along all right up till now its been the best few months of my life mr waddington continued by a long way but im getting scared and thats a fact  how many beans have you left burton inquired  four mr waddington replied what i shall do when theyve gone i cant imagine  burton held his head for a moment a little wearily  there are times he confessed especially when ones sort of between the two things like this when i cant see my way ahead at all do you know that last night the man with whom i have been stayinga man of education too who has been a professor at oxford universityand another a more commercial sort of johnny offered me a third partnership in a great enterprise for putting on the market a new mental healthfood if i would give them one of the beans for analysis they were convinced that we should make millions  mr waddington was evidently struck with the idea  its a great scheme he said hesitatingly i suppose last night it occurred to you that it was just a trifleehjust a trifle vulgar he asked tentatively  burton assented gloomily  last night he declared it seemed to me like a crime it made me shiver all over while they talked of it today well im half glad and im half sorry that theyre not here if they walked into this office now id swallow a bean as quickly as i could but i tell you frankly mr waddington that at the present moment it seems entirely reasonable to me money after all is worth having isnt ita nice comfortable sum so that one could sit back and just have a good time dont stare at me like that of course im half ashamed of what im saying theres the other part pulling and tugging away all the time makes me feel inclined to kick myself but i cant help it i know that these half formed ideas of enjoyment by means of wealth are only degrading that one would sinkoh hang it all mr waddington what a mess it all is  mr waddington pulled down his desk  we must go through with it burton he said firmly youre more advanced than i am in this thing i can see youll need your bean quickly i believe i can hold off till after the sale butive a curious sort of temptation at the present moment burton shall i tell you what it is  go ahead burton answered gloomily  mr waddington slapped his trousers pocket  before we do another thing he suggested lets go round to the golden lion and have just one bottle of beerjust to feel what its like eh  burton sprang up  by jove lets he exclaimed ive had no breakfast im ravenous do they still have that cheese and crusty loaf there  mr waddington glanced at the clock  its on by now he declared come along  they went out together and trod eagerly yet a trifle sheepishly the very wellknown way that led to the golden lion the yellowhaired young lady behind the bar welcomed them with a little cry of astonishment she tossed her head her manner was familiar but was intended to convey some sense of resentment  to think of seeing you two again she exclaimed you mr waddington of all gentlemen in the world well i declare she went on holding out her hand across the counter after having given it a preliminary wipe with a small duster talk about a deserter where have you been to every morning i should like to know  not anywhere else my dear mr waddington asserted hastily that i can assure you seem to have lost my taste for beer or taking anything in the morning lately matter of digestion i suppose must obey our doctors eh well have a tankard each please thats right isnt it burton  burton whose mouth was already full of bread and cheese nodded the two men sat down in a little enclosed partition the yellowhaired young lady leaned across the counter with the air of one willing for conversation  such queer things as ive heard about you mr waddington she began my the way people have been talking  that so mr waddington muttered wish theyd mind their own business  thats too much to expect from folks nowadays the young lady continued why there were some saying as youd come into a fortune and spent all your time in the westend some that youd turned religious and others that youd gone a bit dotty i must say youre looking somehow different you and mr burton too its quite like old times though to see you sitting there together you used to come in after every sale and sit just where youre sitting now and go through the papers hows the business  very good mr waddington admitted how have you been getting along eh  the young lady sighed she rolled her eyes at mr waddington in a manner which was meant to be languishing  very badly indeed she declared thanks to you you neglectful ungrateful person ive heard of fickle men before but ive never met one to come up to one that i could name  mr waddington moved a little uneasily in his place  been to the theatre lately he inquired  the theatre was apparently a sore point  been to the theatre indeed she repeated why i refused all the other gentlemen just so as to go with you and as soon as we got nicely started why you never came near again ive had no chance to go  mr waddington took out a little book  i wonder he suggested if any evening next thursday night at seven oclock i shall be free the young lady interrupted promptly well have a little dinner first as we used to and i want to go to the gaiety its lucky you came in she went on for i can assure you that i shouldnt have waited much longer there are others you know that are free enough with their invitations  she tossed her head with her hands to the back of her hair she turned round to look at herself for a moment in one of the mirrors which lined the inside of the bar burton grinned at his late employer  now youve gone and done it he whispered why youll have taken a bean before then  mr waddington started  ill have to make some excuse he said  you wont be able to burton reminded him excuses are not for us nowadays youll have to tell the truth im afraid youve rather put your foot in it  mr waddington became thoughtful the young lady having disposed of some other customers returned to her place she rubbed the counter for a few minutes with a duster which hung from the belt around her waist then she leaned over once more towards them  its a pity mauds off duty mr burton she remarked shes been asking about you pretty nearly every day  a vision of maud rose up before burtons eyes first of all he shivered then in some vague unwholesome sort of manner he began to find the vision attractive he found himself actually wishing that she were therea buxom young woman with dyed hair and sidelong glances a loud voice and a distinct fancy for flirtations  she is quite well i hope he said  oh maudies all right the young lady replied fortunately for her shes like meshe dont lay too much store on the things you gentlemen say when you come in staying away for months at a time she continued indignantly im ashamed of both of you its the way we girls always get treated i shall tell them to lay for you for lunch today anyway  the two men looked at one another across the round table mr waddington heaved a sigh  i shouldnt bother about that sale if i were you burton whispered hoarsely i tell you what it is i darent go on like this any longer i shall do something desperate this horrible place is getting attractive to me i shall probably sit here and order more beer and wait till maud comes i shall stay to lunch and sit with my arm around her afterwards i am going to take a bean at once  mr waddington sighed and produced the snuffbox from his waistcoat pocket burton followed suit the young woman leaning across the counter watched them curiously  whats that youre taking she inquired something for indigestion  not exactly mr waddington replied its a little ailment im suffering from and burton too  they both swallowed their beans burton gave a deep sigh  i feel safe again he murmured i am certain that i was on the point of suggesting that she send up for maud we might have taken them out together tonight mr waddingtonhad dinner at frascatis drunk cheap champagne and gone to a musichall  burton mr waddington said calmly i do not for a moment believe that we should so far have forgotten ourselves i dont know how you are feeling but the atmosphere of this place is most distasteful to me these tawdry decorations are positively vicious the odor too is insufferable  burton rose hastily to his feet  i quite agree with you he said let us get out as quickly as we can  something mr waddington went on ought to be done to prevent the employment of young women in a public place it is enough to alter ones whole opinion of the sex to see a brazenlooking creature like that lounging about the bar and to be compelled to be served by her if one is in need of a little refreshment  burton nodded his approbation  how we could ever have found our way into the place he said i cant imagine  a moment or two ago mr waddington groaned you were thinking of sending up for maud  burton at this wiped the perspiration from his forehead  please dont remind me of it he begged let us get away as quickly as we can  the young lady leaned over from the bar holding out a hand none too clean on which sparkled several rings  well youre in a great hurry all at once she remarked cant you stay a bit longershe glanced at the clockmaud will be down in ten minutes youre not going away after all this time without leaving a message or something for her mr burton surely  burton looked at her across the counter as one might look at some strange creature from a foreign world a creature to be pitied perhaps nothing more  i am afraid he said that mine was only a chance visit pray remember me to miss maud if you think it would be any satisfaction to her  the young woman stared at him  my but you are funny she declared you were always such a one for acting ill give her your love never fear i shall tell her youll be round later in the day on thursday night then she added turning to mr waddington if i dont see you before and if you really mean youre not going to stay for lunch ill meet you at the corner as usual  mr waddington turned away without apparently noticing the outstretched hand he raised his hat however most politely if i should be prevented he beganthe young woman glared at him  look here ive had enough of this shillyshallying she exclaimed sharply do you mean taking me out on thursday or do you notbecause theres a gentleman who comes in here for his beer most every morning whos most anxious i should dine out with him my next night off ive only to say the word and hell fetch me in a taxicab im not sure that he hasnt got a motor of his own no more nonsense if you please mr waddington she continued shaking out her duster is that an engagement with you on thursday night or is it not  mr waddington measured with his eye the distance to the door he gripped burtons arm and looked over his shoulder  it is not he said firmly  they left the place a little precipitately once in the open air however they seemed quickly to recover their equanimity burton breathed a deep sigh of relief  i must go and change my clothes mr waddington he declared i dont know how on earth i could have come out looking such a sight i feel like working too  such a lovely morning mr waddington sighed gazing up at the sky if only one could escape from these hateful streets and get out into the country for a few hours have you ever thought of travelling abroad burton  have you burton asked  mr waddington nodded  i have it in my mind at the present moment he admitted imagine the joy of wandering about in rome or florence say just looking at the buildings one has heard of all ones life and the picture galleriesjust fancy the picture galleries burton what a dream have you ever been to paris  never burton confessed sadly  nor i mr waddington continued i have been lying awake at nights lately thinking of versailles why do we waste our time here at all i wonder in this ugly little corner of the universe  burton smiled  there is something of the hedonist about you mr waddington he remarked to me these multitudes of people are wonderful i seem driven always to seek for light in the crowded places  mr waddington called a taxicab  can i give you a lift he asked i have no sale until the afternoon i shall go to one of the galleries i want to escape from the memory of the last halfhour    chapter xx  another complication  there came a time when burton finished his novel he wrapped it up very carefully in brown paper and set out to call upon his friend the subeditor he gained his sanctum without any particular trouble and was warmly greeted  why havent you brought us anything lately the subeditor asked  burton tapped the parcel which he was carrying  i have written a novel he said  the subeditor was not in the least impressedin fact he shook his head  there are too many novels he declared  i am afraid burton replied that there will have to be one more or else i must starve  why have you brought it here anyhow  i thought you might tell me what to do with it burton answered diffidently  the subeditor sighed and drew a sheet of notepaper towards him he wrote a few lines and put them in an envelope  there is a letter of introduction to a publisher he explained frankly i dont think it is worth the paper it is written on nowadays novels are published or not either according to their merit or the possibility of their appealing to the public taste  burton looked at the address  thank you very much he said i will take this in myself  when are you going to bring us something the subeditor inquired  i am going home to try and write something now burton replied it is either that or the pawnshop  the subeditor nodded  novels are all very well for amusement he said but they dont bring in bread and cheese come right up to me as soon as youve got something  burton left his novel at the address which the subeditor had given him and went back to his lodgings he let himself in with a latchkey the caretaker of the floor bustled up to him as he turned towards the door of his room  dont know that ive done right sir she remarked doubtfully there was a young person here waiting about to see you been waiting the best part of an hour i let her into your sittingroom  any name burton asked  the caretaker looked thoughtfully up at the ceiling  said she was your wife sir sorry if ive done wrong it came over me afterwards that id been a bit rash  burton threw open the door of his sittingroom and closed it quickly behind him it was indeed ellen who was sitting in the most uncomfortable chair with her arms folded in an attitude of grim but patient resignation she was still wearing the hat with the wing the mauve scarf the tan shoes and the velveteen gown a touch of the parisienne however was supplied to her costume by a black veil dotted over with purple spots her taste in perfumes was obviously unaltered  ellen he exclaimed  well she replied  as a monosyllabic start to a conversation ellens well created difficulties instead of his demanding an explanation she was doing it burton was conscious that his opening was not brilliant  why this is quite a surprise he said i had no idea you were here  dare say not she answered didnt know i was coming myself till i found myself on the doorstep kind of impulse i suppose what have you been doing to little alf  burton looked at her in bewilderment  doing to the boy he repeated i havent seen him since i saw you last  thats all very well for a tale ellen replied but youre not going to tell me that hes come into these ways naturally  what ways burton exclaimed my dear ellen you must be a little more explicit i tell you that i have not seen the child since i was at garden green i am utterly ignorant of anything which may have happened to him  ellen remained entirely unconvinced  theres things about she declared which i dont understand nor dont want to first of all you go dotty now the same sort of thing seems to have come to little alf and what i want to know is what you mean by it its all rubbish for you to expect me to believe that hes taken to this naturally  burton put his hand to his head for a moment  go on he said unless you tell me what has happened to alfred i cannot even attempt to help you  well ill tell you fast enough ellen assured him though you neednt take that for a proof that i believe what you say hes been a changed child ever since you were down last came home from the school and complained about the other boys not washing properly wanted a bath every day and made me buy him a new toothbrush brushes his hair and washes his hands every time he goes out took a dislike to his tie and burned it plagued me to death till i got him a new suit of clothesplain ugly things too he would have he wont have nothing to do with his friends chucked playing marbles or hopscotch and goes out in the country picking flowers just to humor him the first lot he brought home i put in one of those vases that ma brought us from yarmouth and what do you think he didthrew the vase out of the window and bought with his own pocket money a plain china bowl  burton listened in blank amazement as yet the light had not come  go on he murmured anything else  up comes his master a few days ago ellen continued fairly scared me to death said the boy showed signs of great talent in drawing talent in drawing indeed ill give him talent wanted me to have him go to night school and pay for extra lessons said he thought the boy would turn out an artist nice bit of money there is in that  what did you tell him burton asked  i told him to stop putting silly ideas into the childs head ellen replied we dont want to make no artist of alfred into an office hes got to go as soon as hes passed his proper standard and thats what i told his schoolmaster calling alf a genius indeed  is this all thats troubling you burton inquired calmly  all ellen cried bless my soul as though it wasnt enough a nice harmless boy as ever was until that day that you came down you dont seem to understand hes like a little old man chooses his words corrects my grammar keeps himself so clean you can almost smell the soap what i say is that it isnt natural in a child of his age  burton smiled  well really he said i dont see anything to worry about in what you have told me  dont you ellen replied well just you listen to me and answer my question i left alf alone with you while i changed mywhile i looked after the washing the day you came and what i want to know is did you give him one of those things that you talked to me about  i certainly did not burton answered  then a light broke in upon him ellen saw the change in his face  well what is it she asked sharply i can see you know all about it  there were the two beans you threw out of the window he said he must have picked up one  beans indeed ellen replied scornfully do you mean to tell me that a bean would work all this mischief in the child  i happen to know that it would  comes of picking up things in the street ellen exclaimed ill give it him when i get back i will  you must forgive me burton said but i really dont see what you have to complain about from what you tell me i should consider the boy very much improved  improved ellen repeated an unnatural little impudent scallywag of a child you dont think i want a schoolmaster in knickerbockers about the place all the time found fault with my clothes yesterday hid some of the ornaments in the parlor and i caught him doing a sketch of a woman the other day with not a shred of clothes on said it was a copy of some statue in the library it may be your idea of how a boy nine years old should go on but it isnt mine and thats straight  burton sighed  my dear ellen he said we do not look at this matter from the same point of view but fortunately as you will say unfortunately from my point of view the change in alfred is not likely to prove lasting you will find in another few weeks that he will be himself again  dont believe it ellen declared hes as set in his ways now as a little old man  burton shook his head  it wont last i know it  lasts with you all right she snapped  burton opened his little silver box  it lasts with me only as long as these little beans last he replied you see i have only two left when they are gone i shall be back again  if you think ellen exclaimed that youre going to march into clematis villa just when you feel like it and behave as though nothing has happened all i can say my man is that youre going to be disappointed youve kept away so long you can keep away for good we can do without you me and alf  burton still held the box in his hand  i suppose he ventured slowly i couldnt persuade you to take one  ellen rose to her feet she threw the scarf around her neck buttoned her gloves and shook out her skirt she picked up the satchel which she had been carrying and prepared to depart  if you say anything more to me about your beastly beans she said ill lose my temper and thats straight can you tell me how to bring little alf to himself again thats all i want to know  time will do that unfortunately burton assured her where is he this afternoon  its his halfholiday ellen replied in a tone of disgust and where do you think hes gone gone to a museum to look at some statues the schoolmaster called for him theyve gone off together all i can say is that if he dont turn natural again before long you can have him he dont belong to me no longer  i am willing to take the responsibility burton replied if it is necessary will you let me give you some tea  i want nothing from you except my weekly money that the law provides for ellen answered fiercely you can keep your tea and mind what i say too its no use coming down to clematis villa and talking about the effect of the bean having worn off and being yourself again you seem pretty comfortable here and you can stay here until im ready for you oh bother holding the door open she added angrily i hate such tricks get out of the way and let me pass i can let myself out more fool me for coming i might have known youd have nothing sensible to say  im afraid burton admitted that we do rather look at this matter from different points of view but as i told you before you will find very soon that alfred will be just the same as he used to be  if he dont alter ellen declared looking back from the door youll find him here one day by carter pattersons with a label around his neck im not one for keeping children about the place that know more than their mothers i give him another three weeks and not a day longer what do you think was the last thing he did went and had his hair cutwanted to get rid of his curl he said  i cant blame him for that burton remarked smiling i never thought it becoming will you shake hands ellen before you go  i wont she replied drawing up her skirt in genteel fashion i want nothing to do with you only if he dont alter well just you look out for youll find him on your doorstep  she departed in a lily of the valley scent and little fragments of purple fluff burton threw himself into an easychair  if one could only find the tree he muttered to himself what a life for the boy poor little chap    chapter xxi  an amazing transformation  the novel which was to bring immortal fame and incidentally freedom from all financial responsibilities to burton came back within a week with a polite note which he was at first inclined to accept as some consolation until he found that it was stereotyped within a few hours it was despatched to another firm of publishers taken at random from the advertisement columns of the times an hour or two afterwards alfred arrived with no label around his neck but a veritable truant of the two he was the more selfpossessed as he greeted his amazed parent  i am sorry if you are angry about my coming father he said a little tremulously something seems to have happened to mother during the last few days everything that i do displeases her  i am not angry burton declared after a moments amazed silence the only thing is he added glancing helplessly around i dont know what to do with you i have no servants here and only my one little bed  the child smiled he appeared to consider these matters unimportant  you eat things sometimes i suppose daddy he said apologetically i left home before breakfast this morning and it took me some time to find my way here  sit down for five minutes burton directed him and ill take you out somewhere  burton was glad to get into the privacy of his small bedroom and sit down for a moment the thing was amazing enough when it had happened to himself it was perhaps more amazing still to watch its effect upon mr waddington but certainly this was the most astounding development of all the child was utterly transformed there was no sign of his mothers hand upon his clothes his neatly brushed hair or his shiny face his eyes too seemed to have grown bigger alfred had been a vulgar little boy addicted to slang and immoderately fond of noisy games burton tried to call him back to his mind it was impossible to connect him in any way with the child whom through a crack in the door he could see standing upon a chair the better to scrutinize closely the few engravings which hung upon the wall without a doubt a new responsibility in life had arrived to meet it burton had a little less than two pounds and the weekly money to send to ellen within a few days he took alfred out to luncheon  i am afraid he said beginning their conversation anew that even if i am able to keep you with me for a short time you will find it exceedingly dull  i do not mind being dull in the least father the boy replied mother is always wanting me to play silly games out in the street with boys whom i dont like at all  i used to see you playing with them often his father reminded him  the child looked puzzled he appeared to be trying to recollect something  daddy some things in the world seem so funny he said thoughtfully i know that i used to like to play with teddy miles and dick hopscotch and marbles and relievo relievo is a very rough game and marbles makes one very dirty and dusty still i know that i used to like to play those games i dont want to now a bit i would rather read if you are busy daddy i shant mind a bit please dont think that you will have to play with me i want to read i shall be quite happy reading all the time mr denschem has given me a list of books perhaps you have some of them if not couldnt we get some out of a library  burton looked at the list which the boy produced and groaned to himself  my dear alfred he protested these books are for almost grownup people  the boy smiled confidently  mr denschem gave me the list father he repeated simply  after lunch burton took the boy round to mr waddingtons office mr waddington was deep in a book of engravings which he had just purchased he welcomed burton warmly and gazed with surprise at the child  alfred his father directed go and sit in that easychair for a few minutes i want to talk to mr waddington  the child obeyed at once his eyes however were longingly fixed upon the book of engravings  perhaps you would like to have a look at these mr waddington suggested  alfred held out his hands eagerly  thank you very much he said it is very kind of you i am very fond of this sort of picture  burton took mr waddington by the arm and led him out into the warehouse  whose child is that the latter demanded curiously  mine burton groaned can you guess what has happened  mr waddington looked puzzled  you remember the day i went down to garden green you gave me two beans to give to ellen and the child it was before we knew that their action was not permanent  i remember quite well mr waddington confessed  you remember i told you that ellen threw them both into the street a man who was wheeling a fruit barrow picked up one i told you about that  yes  this child picked up the other burton declared solemnly  mr waddington stared at him blankly you dont mean to tell me he said that this is the illdressed unwashed unmannerly little brat whom your wife brought into the office one day and who turned the ink bottles upside down and rubbed the gum on his hands  this is the child burton admitted  god bless my soul mr waddington muttered  they sat down together on the top of a case neither of them found words easy  hes taken to drawing burton continued slowly hates the life at home goes out for walks with the schoolmaster hes got a list of books to readclassics every one of them  poor little fellow mr waddington said to himself and to think that in three weeks or a month  and in the meantime burton interrupted here he is on my hands hes run away from homeas i did i dont wonder at it what do you advise me to do mr waddington  what can you do mr waddington replied you must keep him until  upon children burton said thoughtfully the effect may be more lasting no news i suppose of the tree  mr waddington shook his head sorrowfully ive had a private detective now working ever since that day he declared the man thinks me of course a sort of lunatic but i have made it worth his while to find it i should think that every child in the neighborhood has been interviewed what about the novel  come back from the publishers burton replied i have sent it away to some one else  mr waddington looked at him compassionately  you were relying upon that were you not  entirely burton admitted if i dont earn some money before saturday i shant know how to send the three pounds to ellen  you had better mr waddington said gently accept a trifling loan  not if i can help it burton answered hastily thank you all the same mr waddington but i would rather not we will see what happens i am going back now to try and write something  they returned to the office burton pointed towards the easychair  look  mr waddington nodded alfred had propped up the book of engravings before him was holding a sheet of paper on the blottingpad and with a pencil was intently copying one of the heads they crossed the room and peered over his shoulder for an untrained child it was an amazing piece of work  it is a botticelli head mr waddington whispered look at the outline  the boy glanced up and saw them standing there he excused himself gracefully  you dont mind sir do you he asked mr waddington i took a sheet of paper from your office this head was so wonderful i wanted to carry away something that would remind me of it  if you like mr waddington offered i will lend you the book of engravings then when your father is busy you could make copies of some that please you  the boys cheeks were pink and his eyes soft  how lovely he exclaimed father may i have it  he left the office with the book clasped under his arm on the way home burton bought him some drawingpaper and pencils for the remainder of the afternoon they both worked in silence of the two the boy was the more completely engrossed towards five oclock burton made tea which they took together alfred first carefully washed his hands and his manners at table were irreproachable burton began to feel uncomfortable he felt that the spirit of some older person had come to him in childlike guise there was so little to connect this boy with the alfred of his recollections in looking over his work too burton was conscious of an almost awed sense of a power in this childs fingers which could have been directed by no ordinary inspiration from one to another of those prints the outlines of which he had committed to paper the essential quality of the work the underlying truth seemed inevitably to be reproduced there were mistakes of perspective and outline crudities odd little touches and often a failure of proportion and yet that one fact always remained the meaning of the picture was there the only human note about the child seemed to be that looking at him shortly after teatime burton discovered that he had fallen asleep in his chair  burton took up his hat and stole softly out of the room as quickly as he could he made his way to the offices of the piccadilly gazette and sought his friend the subeditor the subeditor greeted him with a nod  heard about your novel yet he inquired  i had it back this morning his caller replied i have sent it away somewhere else i have written you a little study of the children of london i hope you will like it  the subeditor nodded and glanced it through he laid it down by his side and for the first time there seemed to be a shadow of hesitation in his tone  dont force yourself burton he advised looking curiously at his contributor we will use this in a day or two you can apply at the cashiers office for your cheque when you like but if you dont mind my saying so there are little touches here repetitions that might be improved i think  burton thanked him and went home with money in his pocket he undressed the boy who sleepily demanded a bath put him to sleep in his own bed and threw himself into an easychair it was late but he had not troubled to light a lamp he sat for hours looking out into the shadows a new responsibility indeed had come into life he was powerless to grapple with it the grotesqueness of the situation appalled him how could he plan or dream like other men when the measure of the childs existence as of his own could be counted by weeks for the first time since his emancipation he looked back into the past without a shudder if one had realized if one had only taken a little pains would it not have been possible to have escaped from the life of bondage by less violent but more permanent means it was only the impulse which was lacking he sat dreaming there until he fell into a deep sleep    chapter xxii  doubts  mr bomford in his town clothes was a strikingly adequate reflection of the fashion of the times from the tips of his patent boots his neatly tied black satin tie his waistcoat with its immaculate white slip to his glossy silk hat he was an entirely satisfactory reproduction the caretaker who admitted him to burtons rooms sighed as she let him in he represented exactly her ideal of a gentleman  mr burton and the little boy are both in the sittingroom sir she announced opening the door a gentleman to see you sir  burton looked up from his writingtable for a moment somewhat vaguely mr bomford who had withdrawn his glove held out his hand  i trust mr burton that you have not entirely forgotten me he said i had the pleasure of dining with you a short time ago at professor cowpers you will doubtless remember our conversation  burton welcomed his visitor civilly and motioned him to a seat he was conscious of feeling a little disturbed mr bomford brought him once more into touch with memories which were ever assailing him by night and by day  i have taken the liberty of calling upon you mr burton the newcomer continued setting down his silk hat upon a corner of the table and lifting his coattails preparatory to sinking into a chair because i believe that in the excitement of our conversation a few nights ago we did not do adequate justice to the sentiments whicherprovoked our offer to you  mr bomford sat down with the air of a man who has spoken well he was thoroughly pleased with his opening sentence  it did not occur to me burton replied that there was any possibility of misunderstanding anything you or professor cowper said still it is very kind of you to come and see me  alfred who was drawing in colored chalks at the other end of the room rose up and approached his father  would you like me to go into the other room father he asked i can leave my work quite easily for a time and i have several books there  mr bomford screwed an eyeglass into his eye and looked across at the child  what an extraordinarilyforgive my remark mr burtonbut what an extraordinarily wellbehaved child is it possible that this is your boy  alfred turned his head and there was no doubt about the relationship he too possessed the deepset eyes with their strange intense glow the quivering mouth the same sensitiveness of outline  yes this is my son burton admitted quietly go and shake hands with mr bomford alfred  the child crossed the room and held out his hand with grave selfpossession  it is very kind of you to come and see father he said i am afraid that sometimes he is very lonely here i will go away and leave you to talk  mr bomford fumbled in his pocket  dear me he exclaimed dear me ah here is a halfcrown you must buy some chocolates or something tomorrow young man or a gun eh can one buy a gun for halfacrown  alfred smiled at him  it is very kind of you sir he said slowly i do not care for chocolate or guns but if my father would allow me to accept your present i should like very much to buy a larger drawing block  mr bomford looked at the child and looked at his father  buy anything you like he murmured weaklyanything you like at all  the child glanced towards his father burton nodded  certainly you may keep the halfcrown dear he assented it is one of the privileges of your age to accept presents now run along into the other room and i will come in and fetch you presently  the child held out his hand once more to mr bomford  it is exceedingly kind of you to give me this sir he said i can assure you that the drawing block will be a great pleasure to me  he withdrew with a little nod and a smile mr bomford watched him pass into the inner room with his mouth open  god bless my soul burton he exclaimed what an extraordinary child  burton laughed a little hoarsely  a few weeks ago he said that boy was running about the streets with greased hair a butchers curl a soiled velveteen suit a filthy lace collar dirty hands torn stockings playing disreputable games with all the urchins of the neighborhood he murdered the queens english every time he spoke and spent his pennies on things you suck his mother threw two of the beans i had procured with great difficulty for them both into the street he picked one up and ate ita wretched habit of his you see the result  mr bomford sat quite still and breathed several times before he spoke it was a sign with him of most intense emotion  mr burton he declared if this is true that child is even a greater testimony to the efficacy of youryour beans than you yourself  there is no doubt burton agreed that the change is even greater  there was a knock at the door burton with a word of excuse crossed the room to open it the postman stood there with a packet it was his novel returned once more he threw it on to a table in the corner and returned to his place  mr burton his visitor continued for the first time in my lifeand i may say that i have been accustomed to public speaking and am considered to have a fair choice of wordsfor the first time in my life i confess that i find myself in trouble as to exactly how to express myself i want to convince you i am myself entirely and absolutely convinced as to the justice of the cause i plead i want you to reconsider your decision of the other night  burton shook his head  i am afraid he said uneasily that that is not possible  mr bomford cleared his throat he was only externally a fool  mr burton he declared you are an artist your child has the makings of a great artist have you no desire to travel have you no desire to see the famous picture galleries and cities of the continent cities which have been the birthplaces of the men whose works you and your son in days to come will regard with so much reverence  i should like to travel very much indeed burton admitted  it is the opportunity to travel which we offer you mr bomford reminded him it is the opportunity to surround yourself with beautiful objects the opportunity to make your life free from anxieties a cultured phase of being during which removed from all material cares you canerdevelop yourself and the boy in any direction you choose  mr bomford stopped and coughed again he was pleased with himself  money is only vulgar he went on to vulgar minds and remember thisthat underlying the whole thing there is truth the beans which you and the boy have eaten do contain something of the miraculous those same constituents would be blended in the preparation which we shall offer to the public have you no faith in them why should you not believe it possible that the ingredients which have made so great a change in you and that child may not influence for the better the whole world of your fellowcreatures omit for a moment the reflection that you yourself would benefit so much by the acceptance of my offer consider only your fellow human creatures dont you realizecant you see that in acceding to our offer you will be acting the part of a philanthropist  mr bomford burton said leaning a little forward in all your arguments you forget one thing my stock of these beans is already perilously low when they are gone i remain no more what i hope and believe i am at the present moment once more i revert to the impossible i become the auctioneers clerka commonplace material vulgar objectionable little bounder whose doings and feelings i sometimes dimly remember cant you imagine what sort of use a person like that would make of wealth in justice to him in justice to the myself of the future i cannot place such temptations in his way  mr bomford was staggered  i find it hard to follow you he admitted you will not accept my offer because you are afraid that when the effect of these beans has worn off you will misuse the wealth which will come to youis that it  that is the entire truth burton confessed  have you asked yourself mr bomford demanded impressively whether you have a right to treat your other self in this fashion your other self will assuredly resent it if you retain your memory your other self would hate your present self for its shortsighted quixotic folly i tell you frankly that you have not the right to treat your coming self in this way consider wealth does not inevitably vulgarize on the contrary it takes you away from the necessity of associating with people calculated to depress and cramp your life there are many points of view which i am sure you have not adequately considered take the case of our friend professor cowper for instance he is a poor man with a scientific hobby in which he is burning to indulge why deprive him of the opportunity there is his daughter  i will reconsider the matter burton interrupted hastily i cannot say more than that  mr bomford signified his satisfaction  i am convinced he said that you will come around to our way of thinking i proceed now to the second reason of my visit to you this afternoon professor cowper and his daughter are doing me the honor to dine with me tonight at the milan i beg that you will join us  burton sat for some time without reply for a moment the strong wave of humanity which swept up from his heart and set his pulses leaping set the music beating in the air terrified him surely this could mean but one thing he waited almost in agony for the thoughts which might fill his brain  miss cowper mr bomford continued has been much upset since your hasty departure from leagate she is conscious of some mistakesome foolish speech  burton drew a little sigh of relief after all what he had feared was not coming he saw the flaw he felt even now the revulsion of feeling with which her words had inspired him yet the other things remained she was still wonderful it was still she who was the presiding genius of that sentimental garden  you are very kind he murmured  we shall expect you mr bomford declared at a quarter past eight this evening    chapter xxiii  condemned  to burton who was in those days an epicure in sensations there was something almost ecstatic in the pleasure of that evening they dined at a little round table in the most desirable corner of the roomthe professor and edith mr bomford and himself the music of one of the most famous orchestras in europe alternately swelled and died away always with the background of that steady hum of cheerful conversation it was his first experience of a restaurant de luxe he looked about him in amazed wonder he had expected to find himself in a palace of gilt to find the prevailing note of the place an unrestrained and inartistic gorgeousness he found instead that the decorations everywhere were of spotless white the whole effect one of cultivated and restful harmony the glass and linen on the table were perfect there was nowhere the slightest evidence of any ostentation within a few feet of him separated only by that little space of tablecloth and a great bowl of pink roses sat edith dressed as he had never seen her before a most becoming flush upon her cheeks a new and softer brilliancy in her eyes which seemed always to be seeking his they drank champagne to the taste and effects of which he was as yet unaccustomed burton felt its inspiring effect even though he himself drank little  the conversation was always interesting the professor talked of assyria and there was no man who had had stranger experiences he talked with the eloquence and fervor of a man who speaks of things which have become a passion with him so vividly indeed that more than once he seemed to carry his listeners with him back through the ages back into actual touch with the life of thousands of years ago which he described with such full and picturesque detail not at any time during the dinner was the slightest allusion made to that last heated interview which had taken place between the three men even when they sat out in the palm court afterwards and smoked and listened to the band and watched the people mr bomford only distantly alluded to it  i want to ask you mr burton he said what you think of your surroundingsof the restaurant and your neighbors on every side  the restaurant is very beautiful burton admitted the whole place seems delightful one can only judge of the people by their appearance that at any rate is in their favor  mr bomford nodded approvingly  i will admit mr burton he continued leaning a little towards him that one of my objects in asking you to dine this evening apart from the pleasure of your company was to prove to you the truth of one of my remarks the other eveningthat the expenditure of money need not necessarily be associated with vulgarity this is a restaurant which only the rich could afford to patronize save occasionally yet you see for yourself that the prominent note here is a subdued and artistic tastefulness the days of loud colors and of the flamboyant life are past money today is the handmaiden to culture  exceedingly pleased with his speech mr bomford leaned back in his chair and lighted a halfcrown cigar presently without any visible cooperation on their part a little scheme was carried into effect by the professor and mr bomford the latter rose and crossed to the other side of the room to speak to some friends a few moments later he beckoned to the professor edith and burton were alone she drew a deep sigh of relief and turned towards him as though expecting him to say something burton however was silent he had never seen her quite like this she wore a plain white satin dress and a string of pearls about her neck which he saw for the first time entirely exposed the excitement of the evening had brought a delicate flush to her face the blue in her eyes was more wonderful here even than out in the sunlight amid many toilettes of more complicated design the exquisite and entire simplicity of her gown and hair and ornaments was delightful  you are quiet this evening she whispered i wish i could know what you are thinking of all the time  there is nothing in my thoughts or in my heart he answered which i would not tell you if i could evenings like this other evenings which you and i have spent together in still more beautiful places have been like little perfect epochs in an imperfect life yet all the time one is haunted i am haunted here tonight even as i sit by your side i move through life a condemned man i know it for i have proved it before very long the man whom you know who sits by your side at this moment who is your slave dear must pass  you can never altogether change she murmured  his hands clasped the small silver box in his pocket  in a few months he said hoarsely unless we can find the missing plant i shall be again the common little clerk who came and peered over your hedge at you in the summer  she smiled a little incredulously  even when you tell me so she insisted i cannot believe it  he drew his chair closer to hers he looked around him nervously the horror was in his eyes  since i saw you last he continued i have been very nearly like it i couldnt travel alone i bought silly comic papers i played nap with young men who talked of nothing but their shop and their young ladies i have been to a publichouse drunk beer and shaken hands with the barmaid i was even disappointed when one of thema creature with false hair a loud rasping voice and painted lipswas not there just in time i took one of my beans and became myself again but edith i have only two more when they are gone there is an end of me that is why i sit here by your side at this moment and feel myself a condemned man i think that when i feel the change coming i shall throw myself over into the river i could not bear the other life again  absurd she declared  if i believed he went on that i could carry with me across that curious boundary enough of decency enough of my present feelings to keep us wholly apart i would be happier it is one of the terrors of my worst moments when i think that in the months or years to come i may again be temptedno not i but alfred burton of garden green may be temptedto look once more across the hedge for you  she smiled reassuringly at him  you do not terrify me in the least i shall ask you in to tea  he groaned  my speech will be cockney and my manners a little forward he said in a tone of misery if i see your piano i shall want to vamp  i think she murmured that for the sake of the alfred burton who is sitting by my side tonight i shall still be kind to you perhaps you will not need my sympathy though perhaps you will adapt yourself wholly to your new life when the time comes  he shook his head  there are cells in ones memory he muttered i dont understandi dont know how they get therebut dont you remember that time last summer when i was picnicking with my common friends we were drinking beer out of a stone jug we were singing vulgar songs we were revelling in the silly puerilities of a bank holiday out of doors and i saw your face and something came to me i saw for a moment over the wall dear i am very sure that if i go back there will be times when i shall see over the wall and my heart will ache and the whole taste of life will be like dust between my teeth  she leaned towards him  it is your fault if i say this she whispered it is you yourself who have prepared the way why not make sure of riches the world can give so much to the rich you can buy education manners taste anything surely would be better than taking up the life of an auctioneers clerk once more with riches you can at least get away from the most oppressive forms of vulgarity  i wish i could believe it he replied the poor man is as a rule natural the rich man has the taste of other things on his palate he has looked over the wrong wall he apes what he sees in the wrong garden  not always she pleaded dont you believe that something will remain of these splendid months of yourssome will power some faint impulse towards the choicer ways of life oh it really must be so she went on more confidently i am sure of it i think of you as you are now how carefully you control even your emotions how sensitive you always are in your speech and i know that you could never revert entirely to those other days you may slip back and slip back a long way but there would always be something to keep you from the depths  her eyes were glowing her fingers deliberately touched his for a moment  it is wonderful to hope that it may be so he sighed even as i sit here and remember that awful picnic party i remember too that something drew me a little away from the others to gaze into your garden and at you there was something even then which kept me from being with them while i looked and i know that at that moment at the moment i looked up and met your eyes i know that there was no vulgar thought in my heart  dear she said with every word you make me the more inclined to persist i honestly believe that father and mr bomford are right it is your duty you owe it to yourself to accept their offer  he sat for several minutes without speech  if i could only make you understand he went on at last somehow i feel as though it would be making almost a vulgar use of something which is to me divine these strange little things which mr bomford would have me barter for money brought me out of the unclean world and showed me how beautiful life might beshowed me indeed what beauty really is there is no religion has ever brought such joy to the heart of a man nor any love nor any of the great passions of the world have opened such gates as they have done for me you cant imagine what the hideous life is likethe life of vulgar days of ugly surroundings the dull and ceaseless trudge side by side with the multitude across the sterile plain without the power to raise ones eyes without the power to stretch out ones arms and feel the throb of freedom in ones pulses if i die tomorrow i shall at least have lived for a little time thanks to these can you wonder that i think of them with reverence yet you ask me to make use of one of them to help launch upon the world a patent food something built upon the credulity of fools something whose praises must be sung in blatant advertisements desecrating the pages of magazines gaping from the hoardings thrust inside the chinks of human simplicity by the art of the advertising agent edith it is a hard thing this do try and realize how hard it is if there be anything in the world divine if there be anything sacred at all anything to lift one from the common way it is what you ask me to sacrifice  you are such a sentimentalist dear she whispered you need have no share in the commercial part of this the money can simply keep you while you write or help you to travel  it will lead that other fellow he groaned into no end of mischief  the professor and mr bomford returned they talked for a little time together and then the party broke up as they waited for edith to get her cloak burton spoke the few words which they were both longing to hear  mr bomford he announced and professor i should like to see you tomorrow i am going to think over this matter tonight once more it is very possible that i may see my way clear to do as you ask  mr burton sir the professor said grasping his hand i congratulate you i felt sure that your common sense would assert itself let me assure you of one thing too indirectly you will be the cause of marvelous discoveries enlightening discoveries being made as to the source of some of that older civilization which still bewilders the student of prehistoric days  mr bomford had less to say but he was quite as emphatic  if you only think hard enough mr burton he declared you cant make a mistake  he saw them into the motor edith in a cloak of lace which made her seem like some dainty fairylike creature as she stepped from the pavement into a corner of the landaulette afterwards he walked with uplifted heart through the streets and back to his rooms he let himself in with a mechanical turn of the key on the threshold he stood still in sudden amazement the lights were all turned on the room was in rank disorder simmering upon the hearth were the remains of his novel upset upon the table several pots of paint three chairs were lashed together with a piece of rope on a fourth sat alfred cracking a homemade whip his hands were covered with coaldust traces of which were smeared upon his cheeks there were spots of ink all down his clothes his eyes seemed somehow to have crept closer together there were distinct signs of a tendency on the part of his hair to curl over a certain spot on his forehead he looked at his father like a whipped hound but he said never a word  what on earth have you been doing alfred burton faltered  the boy dropped his whip and put his finger in his mouth he was obviously on the point of howling  you left me here all alone he said in an aggrieved tone there was no one to play with nothing to do i want to go back to mother i want ned and dick to play with dont want to stop here any longer  he began to howl burton looked around once more at the scene of his desolation he moved to the fireplace and gazed down at the charred remnants of his novel the boy continued to howl    chapter xxiv  menatogen the mind food  it had been a dinner of celebration the professor had ransacked his cellar and produced his best wine he had drunk a good deal of it himselfso had mr bomford a third visitor mr horace bunsome a company promoter from the city had been even more assiduous in his attentions to a particular brand of champagne  burton had been conscious of a sense of drifting the more human side of him was paramount the dinner was perfect the long low diningroom with its bowls of flowers and quaint decorations delightful the wine and food the best of their sort edith looking like an exquisite picture was sitting by his side after all if the end of things were to come this way what did it matter she had no eyes for any one else her fingers had touched his more than once the complete joy of living was in his pulses he too had yielded to the general spirit  edith left them late and reluctantly then the professor raised his glass there was an unaccustomed color in his parchmentwhite cheeks his spectacles were sitting at a new angle his black tie had wandered from its usual precise place around to the side of his neck  let us drink he exclaimed to the new company to the new mind food to the new scientific diet of the coming century let us drink to ourselves the pioneers of this wonderful discovery the manufacturers and ownerstobe of the new food the first of its kind created and designed to satisfy the moral appetite  well have a little of that in the prospectus mr horace bunsome remarked taking out his notebook it sounds mighty good professor  it sounds good because it is true sir mr cowper asserted a little severely your services mr bunsome are necessary to us but i beg that you will not confound the enterprise in which you will presently find yourself engaged with any of the hazardous willothewisp undertakings which spring up day by day they tell me in the city and which owe their very existence and such measure of success as they may achieve to the credulity of fools let me impress upon you mr bunsome that you are on this occasion associated with a genuine and marvelous discoverythe scientific discovery sir of the age you are going to be one of those who will offer to the world a genuinean absolutely genuine tonic to the moral system  mr bunsome nodded approvingly  the more i hear you talk he declared the more i like the sound of it people are tired of brain foods and nerve foods a food for the moral self professor youre a genius  i am nothing of the sort sir the professor answered my share in this is trifling the discovery is the discovery of our friend here he continued indicating burton the idea of exploiting it is the idea of mr bomford    my young friend burton you at least must rejoice with us tonight you must rejoice in your heart that our wise counsels have prevailed you must feel that you have done a great and a good action in sharing this inheritance of yours with millions of your fellowcreatures  burton leaned a little forward in his place  professor he said remember that there are only two small beans each less than the size of a sixpence which i have handed over to you as to the qualities which they possess there is no shadow of doubt about them for i myself am a proof yet you take ones breath away with your schemes how could you out of two beans provide a food for millions  the professor smiled  science will do it my dear mr burton he replied with some note of patronage in his tone science the highways of which to you are an untrodden road i myself am a chemist i myself before i felt the call of assyria have made discoveries not wholly unimportant this afternoon i spent four hours in my laboratory with one of your beans i tell you frankly that i have discovered constituents in that small article which absolutely stupefy me qualities which no substance on earth that i know of in the vegetable or mineral world possesses yet within a week the chemist whom i have engaged to come to my assistance and i will assuredly have resolved that little bean into a definite formula when we have done that the rest is easy its primary constituents will form the backbone of our new food if we are only able to reproduce them in trifling quantities then we must add a larger proportion of some harmless and negative substance the matter is simple  no worry about that that i can see mr bunsome remarked so long as we have this testimony of mr burtons and the professors introduction and explanation we dont really need the bean at all weve only got to print his story get hold of some tasteless sort of stuff that no one can exactly analyze and the whole things done so far as we are concerned of course whether it takes on or not with the public is always a bit of a risk but the risk doesnt lie with us to control it depends entirely upon the advertisements if we are able to engage rentoul and raise enough money to give him a free hand for the posters as well as the literary matter why then i tell you this moral food will turn out to be the greatest boom of the generation  mr cowper moved a little uneasily in his chair  yours mr bunsome he said is purely the commercial point of view so far as mr burton and i are concerned and mr bomford too you must please remember that we are profoundly and absolutely convinced of the almost miraculous properties of this preparation its romantic history is a thing we have thoroughly attested our only fear at the present moment is that too large a quantity of the constituents of the beans which mr burton has handed over to me may be found to be distilled from oriental herbs brought by that old student from the east however of that in a few days time we shall of course be able to speak more definitely  mr bunsome coughed  anyway he declared that isnt my show my part is to get the particulars of this thing into shape draft a prospectus and engage rentoul if we can raise the money i presume mr burton will have no objection to our using his photograph on the posters  burton shivered  you must not think of such a thing he said harshly  mr bunsome was disappointed  a picture of yourself as you were as an auctioneers clerk he remarked thoughtfullya little gay in the costume perhaps rakishlooking hat and tie you know and that sort of thing leaning over the bar say of a publichouseand a picture of yourself as you are now writing in a library one of those little articles of yoursthe two together now one each side would have a distinct and convincing effect  burton rose abruptly to his feet  these details he said i must leave to mr cowper you have the beans i have done my share  the professor caught hold of his arm  sit down my dear fellowsit down he begged we have not finished our discussion the whole subject is most engrossing we cannot have you hurrying away mr bunsomes suggestion is of course hideously philistine but after all we want the world to know the truth  but the truth about me burton protested may not be the truth about this food how do you know that you can reproduce the beans at all in an artificial manner  science my young friendscience the professor murmured i tell you that the problem is already nearly solved  supposing you do solve it burton continued supposing you do produce a food which will have the same effect as the beans do you realize what you are doing you will create a revolution you will break up lifelong friendships you will revolutionize business you will swamp the divorce courts you will destroy the whole fabric of social life for at least a generation truth is the most glorious thing which the brain of man ever conceived but i myself have had some experience of the strange position one occupies who has come under its absolutely compelling influence the world as it is run today could never exist for a week without its leaven of lies  mr bunsome looked mystified the professor however inclined his head sympathetically  it is my intention he remarked in drafting my final prescription that the action of the food shall not be so violent if the quantities are less strenuously mixed the food as you can surmise will be so much the milder a gentle preference for truth a dawning appreciation of beauty a gradual withdrawal from the grosser things of lifethese may perhaps be conceived after a weeks trial of the food then a regular course of itsay for six months or sowould build up these tendencies till they became a part of character the change as you see would not be too sudden that is my idea bomford we have not heard much from you this evening what do you think  i agree with you entirely professor mr bomford pronounced for many reasons it will be as well i think to render the food a little less violent in its effects  mr bunsome began to chuckle to himself an imperfectly developed sense of humor was asserting itself  its a funny idea he exclaimed the more one thinks of it the funnier it becomes supposing for a momentyou all take it so seriouslysupposing for a moment that the food were to turn out to really have in it some of these qualities what a mess a few days of it would make of the stock exchange it would mean chaos sir  it is our hope the professor declared sternly our profound hope that this enterprise of ours will not only bring great fortunes to ourselves but will result in the moral elevation of the whole world there are medicinespatent medicines toowhich have cured thousands of bodily diseases why should we consider ourselves too sanguine when we hope that ours the first real attempt to minister to the physical side of morals may be equally successful  burton stole away in the garden he found edith they sat together upon a seat and she allowed her hand to remain in his  i never knew father so wrapped up in anything as he is in this new scheme she whispered he is even worse than mr bomford  burton shivered a little as he leaned back and closed his eyes  it is a nightmare he groaned have you seen all those advertisements of brain foods the advertisement columns of our magazines and newspapers are full of them their announcements grin down upon us from every hoarding do you know that we are going to do the same thing we are going to contribute our share to the defilement of journalism we are going to make a similar appeal to the quack instincts of the credulous  she laughed softly at him  you foolish person she murmured father has been talking to me about it for hours at a time you are taking it for granted that they will not be able to transmit the qualities of the bean into this new food but father is sure that they will supposing they succeed why should you object why should not the whole world share in this thing which has come to you  i do not know he answered a little wearily and yet nothing seems to be able to alter the way i feel about it it seems as though we were committing sacrilege your father and mr bomford and now this man bunsome are entirely engrossed in the commercial side of it if it were to be a gift to the world a real philanthropic enterprise it would be different  the world wasnt made for philanthropists dear she reminded him we are only poor human beings and in our days we have to eat and drink and love  if only mr bomford he began  she laid her fingers warningly upon his arm mr bomford was coming across the lawn towards them if you go off alone with him burton whispered ill get back the beans and swamp the enterprise i swear it   if you leave us alone together she answered softly ill never speak to you again  she sprang lightly to her feet  come she declared it is chilly out here tonight we are all going back into the drawingroom i am going to make you listen while i sing  mr bomford looked dissatisfied he was flushed with wine and he spoke a little thickly  if i could have five minutes he began  edith shook her head  i am much too cold she objected besides i want to hear mr bunsome talk about the new discovery have you found a title for the food yet  she walked rapidly on with burton mr bomford followed them  we have decided he said to call it menatogen    chapter xxv  discontent  burton gave a little start of surprise as he entered mr waddingtons office seated on the chair usually occupied by clients was ellen  my dear burton mr waddington exclaimed with an air of some relief your arrival is most opportune your wife has just paid me a visit we were discussing your probable whereabouts only a moment ago  rooms all shut up ellen declared and not a word left behind nor nothing and little alfred come down with a messenger boy in such a mess as never was  i hope he arrived safely burton inquired i found it necessary to send him home  he arrived all right ellen announced  you found a change in him burton asked  if you mean about his finicking ways i do find a change ellen replied and a good job too hes playing with the other boys again and using those silly books to shoot at with a catapult which to my mind is a sight more reasonable than poring over them all the time i never did see a man she continued with a slow smile so taken aback as mr denschem when he came to take him to the museum yesterday little alf wouldnt have nothing to do with him at any price  burton sighed  i am afraid he said politely that you may have been inconvenienced by not hearing from me on saturday  inconvenienced is a good word ellen remarked ive managed to pay my way till now thank you what i came up to know about is this she went on producing a copy of the daily press from her reticule and smoothing it out on her knee  burton groaned he looked anxiously at mr waddington  have you read it sir he asked  mr waddington shook his head  i make it a rule he said to avoid the advertisement columns of all newspapers these skilfully worded announcements only serve to remind us how a man may prostitute an aptitude if not an art for sheer purposes of gain it is my theory mrs burton he went on addressing her that no one has a right to use his peculiar capacities for the production of any sort of work which is in the least unworthy which does not aimyou follow me i am sureat the ideal  ellen stared at him for a moment  i dont follow you she declared brusquely and i dont know as i want to about that advertisement is it you alfred whos to be one of the directors of this menatogen or whatever they call it are they your experiences that are given here  they are burton groaned  mr waddington with a heavy frown took the paper  what is this burton he demanded  you had better read it burton replied sinking into a chair i mentioned it to you a little time ago you see the scheme has finally come to fruition  mr waddington read the advertisement through word by word one gathered that the greatest discovery for many thousands of years would shortly be announced to the world a certified and unfailing tonic for the moral system was shortly to be placed upon the market a large factory had been engaged for the manufacture of the new commodity and distributing warehouses in a central neighborhood first come first served ten and sixpence a jar the paper fluttered out of mr waddingtons fingers he looked across at burton burton sank forward in his chair his head fell into his hands  what i want to know ellen continued in a tone of some excitement iswhat is there coming to us for this i never did give you credit alfrednot in these days at any ratefor so much common sense i see they have made you a director if theres anything in those rotten beans of yours youve more in your head than i thought to be trying to make a bit of use of them what are you getting out of it  there was a dead silence mr waddington had the appearance of a man who has received a shock burton withdrew his hands from before his face he was looking pale and miserable  i am getting money he admitted slowly i am getting a great deal of money  ellen nodded her face betokened the liveliest interest mr waddington sat like a musician listening to an illplayed rendering of his favorite melody burton thrust his hand into his pocket  i failed to send you your three pounds on saturday ellen he said here are thirtythree hundred if you will take them and leave me for a little time  it is not too much to say that ellen grabbed at the notes she counted them carefully and thrust them into her reticule her manner was indicating a change the hard contempt had gone from her face she looked at her husband with something like awe after all this was the signal and final proof of greatnesshe had made money  arent you pleased about it she asked sharply not that i ever thought youd have the wits to turn anything like this into real solid account  burton set his teeth  i am afraid he said that i cannot quite explain how i feel about it there will be plenty of money for youfor some time at any rate you can buy the house if you like or buy one somewhere else  what about you she demanded aint you coming back  he did not move she rose to her feet raised her veil and came over to where he was sitting he smelt the familiar odor of lily of the valley perfume blended with the odor of cleaned gloves and benzine the air around him was full of little violet specks from her boa she laid her hand upon his shoulder  come and be a man again alfred she begged a little awkwardly youve got good common sense at the bottom still i am sure why dont you give up this tomfoolery and come home to me and the boy or shall i stay up she went on and have a little evening in town youve got the money why not lets go to a restaurant and a musichall afterwards we might ask the johnsons little alf would be all right and i put on my best hat in case  burton looked wearily up  ellen he said i am afraid i cant make you understand it is true that i shall probably be rich but i hate the thought of it i only want to be left alone i have made a mistake and yet heaven knows it was hard for me to escape before very long he added his voice sinking a little lower it is quite likely that you will recognize me again completely i dare say then i shall be very glad to go to the theatre with you and to meet the johnsons just now ii cant  ellen began to tremble  before long youll be very glad eh she exclaimed well well see about that im sick of this begging and praying of you to behave like a reasonable person if theres another woman whos come along why out with it and let me know  you dont understand mr waddington interrupted gently your husband and i have both come under the influence of thesethese beans it is not possible for us to live as we have been accustomed to live  well i like that ellen declared do you mean to say this is going on  burton looked up  on the contrary he announced it is coming to an endwith me at any rate until it does come to an end it will be kinder of you and better for both of us for you to keep away  she stood for a moment quite still her back was turned to them her shoulders were moving when she spoke however her tone was still hard and unsympathetic  very well she said ill get back to garden green but mind you my man she went on none of your sneaking back home just when youre ready for it next time it shall be as i choose im no wishywashy creature to be your wife one moment and something you cant bear even to look at the next no i dont want none of your monkey tricks opening the door she went on angrily as burton rose to see her out stay where you are i can find my way out of the place  she departed slamming the door after her mr waddington came and sat down by his former clerks side  tell me burton he asked kindly how did you come to do this thing  it was the professor and the girl he murmured they made it seem so reasonable  it is always the girl mr waddington reflected the girl with the blue eyes i suppose whom you told me about the girl of the garden  burton nodded  her father is a scientific man he explained he wants money badly to go on with some excavations in assyria between them all i consented waddington he went on looking up i was beginning to get terrified i had only two beans left i have parted with them they could have lasted me only a few months i thought if i had to go back i would go back free from any anxieties of work in an office wealth must help one somehow if i can travel surround myself with books live in the country i cant ever be so bad i cant fall back where i was before what do you think mr waddington you must have this on your mind sometimes you yourself have only six or seven months left  mr waddington sighed  do you think that it isnt a nightmare for me too he said gently only i am afraid that wealth will not help you the most vulgar and ignorant people i know are among the wealthiest there is a more genuine simplicity and naturalness among the contented and competent poor than any other class you were wrong burton riches breed idleness riches tempt one to the purchase of false pleasure you would have been better back upon your stool in my office  it is too late burton declared a little doggedly i came to ask you if you wanted to join for two more beans they would make you too a director and give you five thousand shares  mr waddington shook his head  thank you burton he said i would sooner retain my beans i have no interest in your enterprise i think it hateful and abominable i cannot conceive he went on how you burton in your sane mind could have stooped so low as to associate yourself in any way with the thing  you dont know what my temptations were burton groaned  and therefore mr waddington replied i will not judge you yet do not think that i should ever allow myself to consider your proposition even for a moment tell me you say youve parted with your last bean  and my time is almost up burton interrupted beating the table before him only this morning for an instant i was afraid  try and keep your thoughts away from it mr waddington advised let me show you these new prints by the bye where is your wonderful little boy  goneback to his mother burton answered grimly didnt you hear us mention him i left him in my rooms one night and when i came back the whole place was in disorder he was in a filthy state and sobbing for his home  my poor fellow mr waddington murmured come i will take you with me to lunch we can spend the afternoon in my library i have some new treasures to show you we will lose ourselves for a short time at least you shall forget    chapter xxvi  the end of a wonderful world  mr waddington turned his head away quickly and glanced half guiltily towards his companion to his amazement burton had been gazing in the same direction their eyes met burton coughed  a remarkably fine woman that mr waddington declared  burton looked at him in astonishment  my dear mr waddington he exclaimed you cannot really think so  they both turned their heads once more the woman in question was standing upon the doorstep of a milliners shop waiting for a taxicab in appearance she was certainly somewhat striking but her hair was flagrantly dyed her eyebrows darkened her costume daring her type obvious  a very fine woman indeed i call her mr waddington repeated shouldnt mind taking her to lunch good mind to ask her  burton hesitated for a moment then a curious change came into his own face  she is rather fetching he admitted  the woman suddenly smiled mr waddington pulled himself together  it serves us right he said a little severely and hastening his companion on i was looking at her only as a curiosity  burton glanced behind and move on reluctantly  i call her jolly goodlooking he declared  mr waddington pretended not to hear they turned into jermyn street  there are some vases here at this small shop round the corner which i want you particularly to notice burton he continued they are perfect models of old etruscan ware did you ever see a more beautiful curve isnt it a dream one could look at a curve like that and it has something the same effect upon one as a line of poetry or a single exquisite thought  burton glanced into the window and looked back again over his shoulder the lady however had disappeared  hm he remarked very nice vase lets get on to lunch im hungry  mr waddington stopped short upon the pavement and gripped his companions arm  burton he said a trifle hesitatingly you dont thinkyou dont imagine  not a bit of it burton interrupted savagely one must be a little human now and then by jove old man there are some ties if you like i always did think a yellow one would suit me  mr waddington pressed him gently along  i am not sure he muttered that we are quite in the mood to buy ties i want to ask you a question burton  go ahead  you were telling me about this wonderful scheme of your friend the professors to makemenatogen i think you said did you part with both your beans  both burton replied almost fiercely but ive another fortnight or so yet it cant come beforeit shant  you expect i suppose to make a great deal of money mr waddington continued  we shall make piles burton declared i have had a large sum already for the beans my pockets are full of money queer how lighthearted it makes you feel to have plenty of money its a dull world you know after all and we are dull fellows think what one could do now with some of the notes i have in my pocket hire a motorcar go to some bright place like the metropole at brightona bright cheerful sociable place i mean where people who look interesting arent above talking to you and then a little dinner and perhaps a musichall afterwards and some supper and plenty to eat and drink  burton mr waddington gasped stop stop at once  why the dickens should i stop burton demanded  mr waddington was looking shocked and pained you dont mean to tell me he exclaimed that this is your idea of a good time that you would go to a hotel like the metropole and mix with the people whom you might meet there and eat and drink too much and call it enjoyment burton what has come to you  burton was looking a little sullen  its all very well he grumbled were too jolly careful of ourselves we dont get much fun heres your poky little restaurant lets see what it looks like inside  they entered and a maitre dhôtel came hurrying to meet them burton however shook his head  this place is no good waddington he decided only about halfadozen stodgy old people here no music and nothing to look at lets go where theres some life ill take you my lunch come along  mr waddington protested but faintly he murmured a word of apology to the maitre dhôtel whom he knew but burton had already gone on ahead and was whistling for a taxi with a groan mr waddington noticed that his hat had slipped a little on one side there was a distinct return of his rakish manner  the milan burton ordered get along as quick as you can we are hungry  the two men sat side by side in the taxicab mr waddington watched his companion in halfpained eagerness burton certainly was looking much more alert than earlier in the morning  i tell you moneys a great thing the latter went on producing a cigarette from his pocket and lighting it i dont know why i should have worried about this little business adventure i call it a firstclass idea id like to be able to take taxies whenever i wanted them and go round to the big restaurants and sit and watch the people come to a musichall one night mr waddington wont you i havent seen anything really funny for a long time  im afraid i should like to mr waddington begani mean i should be delighted  what are you afraid about burton asked quickly  mr waddington mopped his forehead with his handkerchief  burton he said hoarsely i think its coming on im glad we are going to the milan i wish we could go to a musichall tonight that woman was attractive  burton set his teeth  i cant help it he muttered i cant help anything here goes for a good time  he dismissed the taxi and entered the milan swaggering just a little they lunched together and neither showed their usual discrimination in the selection of the meal in place of the light wine which mr waddington generally chose they had champagne they drank benedictine with their coffee and smoked cigars instead of cigarettes their conversation was a trifle jerky and mr waddington kept on returning to the subject of the menatogen company  you know ive three beans left burton he explained towards the end of the meal i dont know why i should keep them theyd only last a matter of seven months anyway ive got to go back sometime do you think i could get in with you in the company  well go andwhy there is mr bunsome burton exclaimed mr bunsome  the company promoter was just passing their table he turned around at the sound of his name for a moment he failed to recognize burton there was very little likeness between the pale contemptuous young man with the dreamy eyes who had sat opposite to him at the professors dinner table a few nights ago and this flushed young man who had just attracted his attention and who had evidently been lunching exceedingly well it was part of his business however to remember faces and his natural aptitude came to his assistance  how do you do mr burton he said glad to meet you again spending some of the menatogen profits eh  friend of mine heremr waddington burton explained mr cowper knows all about him he owns the rest of the beans you know  mr bunsome was at once interested  im delighted to meet you mr waddington he declared holding out his hand indirectly you are connected with one of the most marvelous discoveries of modern days  i should like to make it directly mr waddington said do you think my three beans would get me in on the ground floor  mr bunsome was a little surprised  i understood from the professor he remarked that your friend was not likely to care about entering into this  burton for a moment half closed his eyes  i remember he said last night i didnt think he would care about it i find i was mistaken  mr bunsome looked at his watch  i am meeting mr cowper this afternoon he said and mr bomford i know that the greatest difficulty that we have to face at present is the very minute specimens of this wonderfulervegetable from which we have to prepare the food i should think it very likely that we might be able to offer you an interest in return for your beans will you call at my office mr waddington at ten oclock tomorrow morningnumber 17 norfolk street  with pleasure mr waddington assented have a drink  mr bunsome did not hesitateit was not his custom to refuse any offer of the sort he sat down at their table and ordered a sherry and bitters mr waddington seemed to have expanded he did not mention the subject of architecture more than once mr bunsome glanced with some surprise at burton the young man completely puzzled him they talked about menatogen and its possibilities and burton kept harking back to the subject of profits mr bunsome at last could contain his curiosity no longer  say he remarked you had a headache or something the other night i think seemed as quiet as they make em down at the old professors i tell you i shouldnt have known you again  burton was suddenly white mr waddington plunged in  dry old stick the professor anyway from what ive heard he said now dont you forget mr bunsome i shall be round at your office at ten oclock sharp tomorrow and i expect to be let into the company three beans ive got and remember theyre worth something they took that old egyptian johnnyhim and his family of coursea matter of a thousand years to grow and theres no one else on to them why theyre unique and they do the trick toothat i can speak for paid the bill burton  burton nodded the two men shook hands with mr bunsome and prepared to leave they walked out into the strand  got anything to do this afternoon particular mr waddington asked after a moments hesitation  not a thing burton replied puffing at his cigar and unconsciously altering slightly the angle of his hat  wouldnt care about a game of billiards at the golden lion i suppose mr waddington suggested  rather burton assented lets buy the girls some flowers and take a taxi down go down in style eh ill pay  mr waddington looked at his companionwatched him indeed hail the taxiand groaned a sudden wave of halfashamed regret swept through him it was gone then this brief peep into a wonderful world his own fall was imminent the click of the balls was in his ears the taste of strong drink was inviting him the hard laugh and playful familiarities of the buxom young lady were calling to him he sighed and took his place by his companions side    chapter xxvii  mr waddington also  with his hat at a very distinct angle indeed with a fourpenny cigar ornamented by a gold band in his mouth burton sat before a hardtoned piano and vamped  pretty music the chocolate soldier he remarked with an air of complete satisfaction in his performance  miss maud who was standing by his side with her hand laid lightly upon his shoulder assented vigorously  and you do play it so nicely mr burton she said it makes me long to see it again i havent been to the theatre for heaven knows how long  burton turned round in his stool what are you doing tonight he asked nothing the young lady replied eagerly take me to the theatre theres a dear  righto he declared i expect i can manage it  miss maud waltzed playfully around the room her hands above her head she put her head out of the door and called into the bar  milly mr burtons taking me to the theatre tonight why dont you get mr waddington to come along we can both get a night off if you make up to the governor for a bit  ill try was the eager replythat is if mr waddingtons agreeable  maud came back to her place by the piano she was a plump young lady with a pink and white complexion which suffered slightly from lack of exercise and fresh air and overuse of powder her hair was yellower than her friends but it also owed some part of its beauty to artificial means in business hours she was attired in an exceedingly tightfitting black dress disfigured in many places by the accidents of her profession  you are a dear mr burton she declared i wonder what your wife would say though she added a little coyly  not seeing much of ellen just lately burton replied im living up in town alone  oh she remarked mr burton im ashamed of you what does that mean i wonder you men she went on with a sigh one has to be so careful you are such deceivers you know whats the attraction  you he whispered  what a caution you are she exclaimed i like that too after not coming near me for months what are you looking so scared about all of a sudden  burton was looking through the garishly papered walls of the publichouse sittingroom out into the world he was certainly a little paler  havent i been in for months he asked softly  she stared at him  well i suppose you know she retorted pretty shabby i thought it of you too after coming in and making such a fuss as you used to pretty well every afternoon i dont like friends that treat you like that makes you careful when they come round again id like to know what youve been doing  ah he said you will never know that perhaps i myself shall never know that really again get me a whiskey and soda maud i want a drink  i should say you did the young woman declared pertly sitting there looking struck all of a heap some woman i expect youve been gone on you men are all the same ive no patience with younot a bit if it wasnt she added taking down the whiskey bottle from the shelf that lifes so precious dull without you i wouldnt have a thing to say to youno not me nor milly either we were both talking about you and mr waddington only a few nights ago and of the two im not sure that hes not the worst a man at his age ought to know his mind special scotchthere you are mr burton hope it will do you good  burton drank his whiskey and soda as though he needed it he was suddenly pale and his fingers were idle upon the keys of the pianoforte the girl looked at him curiously  not quite yourself are you she inquired dont get chippy before this evening i dont think ill give you anything else to drink when a gentleman takes me out i like him to be at his best  burton came back it was a long journey from the little corner of the world into which his thoughts had strayed to the ornate artificiallooking parlor with the turkeycarpet upon the floor and framed advertisements upon the walls  i am sorry he said i had forgotten i cant take you out tonightive got an engagement how i shall keep it i dont know he went on half reminiscently but ive got to  the young woman looked at him with rising color well i declare she exclaimed youre a nice one you are you come in for the first time for lord knows how long you agree to take me out this evening and then all of a sudden back out of it ive had enough of you mr burton you can hook it as soon as you like  burton rose slowly to his feet  i am sorry he said simply i suppose i am not quite myself today i was just thinking how jolly it would be to take you out and have a little supper afterwards when i rememberedi rememberedthat engagement ive got to go through with it  another girl i suppose she demanded turning away to look at herself in the mirror  he shivered he was in a curious state of mind but there seemed to him something heretical in placing edith among the same sex  it is an engagement i cant very well break he confessed ill come in again  you neednt she declared curtly when i say a thing i mean it ive done with you  burton crossed the threshold into the smaller room where mr waddington appeared to be deriving a certain amount of beatific satisfaction from sitting in an easychair and having his hand held by miss milly they both looked at him as he entered in some surprise  what have you two been going on about the young lady asked i heard maud speaking up at you some lovers quarrel i suppose  the moment was passing burton laugheda little hardly perhaps but boisterously  mauds mad with me he explained i thought i could take her out tonight remembered afterwards i couldnt say old man youre going it a bit arent you he continued shaking his head at his late employer  mr waddington held his companions hand more tenderly than ever  at your age he remarked severely you shouldnt notice such things milly and i are old friends arent we he added drawing her to him  well its taken a bit of making up my mind to forgive you the young lady admitted what a pity you cant bring maud along tonight she went on addressing burton were going to frascatis to dinner and into the oxford afterwards get along back and make it up with her you can easily break your other engagement  burton swaggered back to the threshold of the other room  hi come along maudie he said i cant take you out tonight but ill take you tomorrow night and ill stand a bottle of champagne now to make up for it  dont want your champagne the young lady beganleastways she added remembering that after all business was supposed to be her first concern i wont say no to a glass of wine with you but you mustnt take it that you can come in here and do just as you please i may go out with you some other evening and i may not i dont think i shall tonight just happens to suit me  with a last admiring glance at herself in the mirror she came into the room burton patted her on the arm and waved the wine list away  the best is good enough he declaredthe best in the house just what you like yourself price dont matter just now  he counted a roll of notes which he drew from his trousers pocket the two girls looked at him in amazement he threw one upon the table  backed a horse maud asked legacy milly inquired burton with some difficulty relit the stump of his cigar  bit of an advance ive just received from a company im connected with he explained would insist on my being a director im trying to get waddington here into it he added condescendingly jolly good thing for him if i succeed i can tell you  miss maud moved away in a chastened manner she took the opportunity to slip upstairs and powder her face and put on clean white cuffs presently she returned carrying the wine on a silver tray with the best glasses that could be procured  heres luck burton exclaimed jauntily cant drink much myself this bubbly stuff never did agree with me and i had a good go at it last night  maud filled up his glass nevertheless touched it with her own and drank looking at him all the time with an expression in her eyes upon which she was wont to rely  take me out tonight dear she whispered i feel just like having a good time tonight do  burton suddenly threw his glass upon the floor the wine ran across the carpet in a little stream splinters of the glass lay about in all directions they all three looked at him transfixed  i am sorry he said  he turned and walked out of the room they were all too astonished to stop him they heard him cross the barroom and they heard the door close as he passed into the street  of all the extraordinary things maud declared  well i never milly gasped  if mr burton calls that behaving like a gentleman maud continued in a heated mannermr waddington patted her on the shoulder  hush hush my dear he said between ourselves burton has been going it a bit lately theres no doubt that hes had a drop too much to drink this afternoon dont take any notice of him hell come round all right i can understand whats the matter with him you mark my words in two or three days hell be just his old self  has he come into a fortune or what maud demanded hes left you hasnt he  mr waddington nodded  hes found a better job he admitted kind of queer in his health though ive been taken a little like it myself but those sort of things pass offthey pass off  milly looked at him curiously he was suddenly quiet  why youre looking just like mr burton did a few minutes ago she declared whats the matter with you can you see ghosts mr waddington sat quite still yes he muttered i see ghosts  they looked at him in a puzzled manner then milly leaned towards him and filled his glass with wine she touched his glass with her own she even suffered her arm to rest upon his shoulder for a single moment mr waddington appeared to feel some instinct of aversion he seemed almost about to draw away then the mood passed he drew her towards him with a little burst of laughter and raised his glass to his lips  heres fun he exclaimed poor old burton    chapter xxviii  the real alfred burton  edith slipped out of her evening cloak and came into the foyer of the opera house a spotless vision of white for a moment she looked at her cavalier in something like amazement it did not need the red handkerchief a corner of which was creeping out from behind his waistcoat to convince her that some extraordinary change had taken place in burton he was looking pale and confused and his quiet naturalness of manner had altogether disappeared he came towards her awkwardly swinging a pair of white kid gloves in his hand  bit late arent you he remarked  i am afraid i am a few minutes late she admitted until the last moment father said he was coming we shall have to go in very quietly  come along then he said i dont know the way i suppose one of these fellows will tell us  his inquiry loudvoiced and not entirely coherent received at first scant attention from the usher to whom he addressed himself they were directed to their places at last however the house was in darkness and with the music edith forgot for a time the slight shock which she had received the opera was samson et dalila and a very famous tenor was making his reappearance after a long absence edith gave herself up to complete enjoyment of the music then suddenly she was startled by a yawn at her side burton was sitting back his hands in his pockets his mouth wideopen  mr burton she exclaimed softly he had the grace to sit up longwinded sort of stuff this he pronounced in an audible whisper  she felt a cold shiver of apprehension as she saw him lounging there beside her her thoughts seemed to go back to the day when she had looked with scornful disdain at that miserable picnicparty of trippers who drank beer out of stone jugs and formed a blot upon the landscape once more she saw the man who stood a little apart in his loud clothes and common cloth cap saw him looking into the garden she began to tremble what had she doneso nearly done in spite of herself the music drew her away again she even found herself turning towards him once for sympathy  isnt it exquisite she murmured  he laughed shortly  give me the chocolate soldier he declared worth a dozen of this  suddenly she realized what had happened her anger and resentment faded away for the first time she wholly and entirely believed his story for the first time she felt that this miracle had come to pass she was no longer ashamed of him she no longer harbored any small feelings of resentment at his illbred attitude a profound sympathy swept up from her heartsympathy for him sympathy too for herself when they passed out together she was as sweet to him as possible though he put on a black bowler hat some time before it was necessary and though his red handkerchief became very much in evidence  you will drive me down to chelsea wont you she begged  righto he replied ill get one of these chaps to fetch a taxi  he succeeded in obtaining one gleeful because he had outwitted some prior applicant to whom the cab properly belonged  couldnt stop somewhere and have a little supper could we he asked  i am afraid not she answered it wouldnt be quite the thing  he tried to take her hand after a moments hesitation she permitted it  mr burton she said softly do answer me one question did you part with all your beans  his hand went up to his forehead for a moment  yes he replied both of them i only had two and it didnt seem worth while keeping one got my pockets full of money too and they are going to make me a director of menatogen  do you feel any different she asked him  he looked at her in a puzzled way and striking a match lit a cigarette without her permission  odd you should ask that he remarked i do feel sort of queer tonightas though id been ill or something of the sort there are so many things i can only half rememberat least i remember the things themselves but the part i took in them seems so odd kind of feeling as though id been masquerading in another chaps clothes he added with an uneasy little laugh i dont half like it  tell me she persisted did you really find the music tiresome  he nodded  rather he confessed the chocolate soldier is my idea of music i like something with a tune in it theres been no one to beat gilbert and sullivan i dont know who wrote this samson and delilah but he was a dismal sort of beggar wasnt he i like something cheerful dont you want to come and have some supper edith i know a place where they play all the popular music  no thank you she told him gravely  you seem so cold and sort of standoffish tonight he complained coming a little closer to her some of those nights down at your placecant remember em very well but i am jolly sure you were different whats happened maynt i hold your fingers even  his arm would have been around her waist but she evaded it firmly  dont you know what has happened she demanded earnestly dont you really know  cant say that i do he admitted ive got a sort of feeling as though id been all tiedup like lately havent been able to enjoy myself properly and gone mooning about after shadows tonight i feel just as though i were coming into my own again a bit i say he added admiringly you do look stunning come and have some supperno one will knowand let me drive you home afterwards do  she shook her head  i dont think you must talk to me quite like this she said kindly you have a wife you know and i am engaged to be married  he laughed quite easily  never seen ellen have you he remarked shes a fine woman you know although she isnt quite your style shed think you sort of pale and colorless i expectno kind of go or dash about you  is that what you think edith asked him smiling  you arent exactly the style ive always admired he confessed but theres something about you he added in a puzzled manneri dont know what it is but i remember it from a year agosomething that seemed to catch hold of me i expect i must be a sentimental sort of johnny underneath however i do admire you edith immensely i only wish  again she evaded him  please do not forget mr bomford she begged  that silly old ass burton exclaimed looks as though hed swallowed a poker youre never going to marry him  i think that i shall she replied at any rate at present i am engaged to him therefore if you please you must keep just a little further away i dont like to mention it but i thinkhavent you been smoking rather too much  he laughed without a trace of sensitiveness i have been having rather a day of it he admitted but i say edith if you wont come to supper i think you might let a fellow  she drew back into her corner  mr burton she said you must please not come near me  but i want a kiss he protested youd have given me one the other night youd have given me as many as id liked you almost clung to methat night under the cedar tree  her eyes for a moment were half closed  it was a different world then she whispered softly it was a different mr burton you see since then a curtain has come down we are starting a fresh act and i dont think i know you quite so well as i did  sounds like tommyrot he grumbled  the taxicab came to a standstill the man got down and opened the door burton half sulkily stepped out on to the pavement  well here you are he announced cant say that i think much of you this evening  she held out her hand they were standing on the pavement now in the light of a gaslamp and with the chauffeur close at hand she was not in the least afraid but there was a lump in her throat he looked so very common so far away from those little memories with which she must grapple  mr burton she said goodnight i want to thank you for this evening and i want to ask you to promise that if ever you are sorry because i persuaded you to sell those little beans you will forgive me it was a very wonderful thing you know and i didnt understand perhaps i was wrong  dont you worry he answered cheerfully thats all right anyway its jolly well the best thing i ever did in my life got my pockets full of money already and i mean to have a thundering good time with it no fear of my ever blaming you goodnight miss edith my regards to the governor and tell him i am all on for menatogen  he gave his hat a little twist and stepped back into the taxi  i will give my father your message she told him as the door opened to receive her  righto burton replied leicester square cabby    chapter xxix  riches and repentance  there was considerable excitement in laurence avenue when a few mornings later mr alfred burton in a perfectly appointed motorcar drew up before the door of clematis villa in a very leisurely manner he descended and stood looking around him for a moment in the front garden  poky little place he said half to himself having completed a disparaging survey hullo johnson how are you  mr johnson who with a little bag in his hand had just trudged a mile to save a penny looked with something like amazement at the apparition which confronted him mr alfred burton was arrayed in town clothes of the most pronounced cut his tail coat was exactly the right length his trousers although the pattern was a little loud were exceedingly well cut he wore patent boots with white gaiters a carefully brushed silk hat and he carried in his hand a pair of yellow kid gloves he had a malacca cane with a gold top under his arm and a cigar at the usual angle in the corner of his mouth no wonder that mr johnson who was it must be confessed exceedingly shabby took his pipe from his mouth and stared at his quondam friend in amazement  hullo burton you back again he exclaimed weakly  i am back again just to settle up here mr burton explained with a wave of the hand just run down in the car to take the missis out a little way  mr johnson held on to the railing tightly  your car  my car mr burton admitted modestly take you for a ride some day if you like hows the wife  firstclass thanks mr johnson replied firstclass thank you mr burton  burton protested mildly  no need to mr burton me johnson old fellow it shall never be said of me that a great and wonderful rise in the world altered my feelings towards those with whom i was once on terms of intimacy i shall always be glad to know you johnson thursday evening isnt it what are you and the wife doing  i dont know johnson confessed that we are doing anything particular we shall turn up at the band i suppose  good mr burton said it will be our last thursday evening in these parts i expect but after i have taken the wife for a little spin well walk round the bandstand ourselves perhaps we shall be able to induce you and mrs johnson to come back and take a little supper with us  mr johnson pulled himself together  very kind of you old cocky he declared tremulously been striking it thick havent you  burton nodded  dropped across a little thing in the city he remarked flicking the dust from the sleeve of his coat jolly good spec it turned out they made me a director its this new menatogen company heard of it  god bless my soul of course i have johnson exclaimed millions in it they say the shares went from par to four premium in half an hour i know a man who had a call of a hundred hes cleared four hundred pounds  mr burton nodded in a most condescending manner  that so he remarked ive a matter of ten thousand myself besides some further calls but im not selling just yet if your friends got any left you can tell him from meand i ought to know as im a directorthat the shares will be at nine before long shouldnt wonder if they didnt go to twenty its a grand invention best thing i ever touched in my life  johnson had been finding it chilly a short time ago but he took off his hat now and mopped his forehead  havent been home lately have you he remarked  to tell you the truth mr burton explained puffing at his cigar this little affair has been taking up every minute of my time i had to take chambers in town to keep up with my work well so long johnson see you later at the bandstand dont forget we shall be expecting you this evening may run you up to the westend perhaps if the missis feels like it  he nodded and proceeded on his way to the front door of his domicile mr johnson narrowly escaping an impulse to take off his hat proceeded on his homeward way  any one at home mr burton inquired letting himself in  there was no reply mr burton knocked with his goldheaded cane upon the side of the wall the door at the end of the passage opened abruptly ellen appeared  what are you doing there knocking all the plaster down she demanded sharply if you want to come in why cant you ring the bell standing there with your hat on as though the place belonged to you  burton was a little taken aback he recovered himself however secure in the splendid consciousness of his irreproachable clothes and the waiting motorcar he threw open the door of the parlor  step this way a moment ellen he said she followed him reluctantly into the room he put his hand upon her shoulder to lead her to the window she shook herself free at once  hands off she ordered what is it you want  he pointed out of the window to the magnificent memorial of his success she looked at it disparagingly  whats that your taxicab she asked what did you keep him for you can get another one at the corner  burton gasped  taxicab he exclaimed taxicab indeed look at it again thats a motorcarmy own motorcar do you hear that bought and paid for  well run away and play with it then she retorted turning as though to leave the room i dont want you fooling about here im just getting alfreds supper burton dropped his cigar upon the carpet even when he had picked it up he stood looking at her with his mouth a little open  you dont seem to understand ellen he said listen ive come back home a share of that motorcar is yours  come back home ellen repeated slowly  exactly he admitted complacently i am afraid this is rather a shock for you but good news never kills you know well motor up to the band presently and ive asked the johnsons to supper if youve nothing in the house well all go up to the westend somewhere    whats the matter with you  ellen was looking at that moment positively handsome her cheeks were scarlet and her eyes ablaze  alfred burton she declared the last few times ive seen you ive put you down as being dotty now i am sure of it the sooner youre out of this the better before i lose my temper  but my dear ellen he protested soothingly i can assure you that what i am telling you is the truth i have become unexpectedly rich a fortunate stroke of businessthe menatogen company you knowhas completely altered our lives you are naturally overcome  naturally overfiddlesticks ellen interrupted look here my man ive had about enough of this you come down here thinking because youve come to your senses and because youve got new clothes and a motorcar that you can just sit down as though nothing had happened just let me tell you thisyou cant do it you can leave your wife because she cant stop you you can stay away from her because she cant drag you back but you cant come and put on a new suit of clothes and bring a motorcar and say ive come back and sit down at your usual place and find everything just as youve left it you cant do that alfred burton and you must be a bigger fool even than you look to imagine that you can  ellen he faltered dont you want me back  not i she replied fiercely not you nor your motorcar nor your money nor any part of you come swaggering in dropping your cigar ash over the place and behaving as though youd been a respectable person all your life she continued indignantly what right have you got to think that your wife was made to be your slave or your trained dog to beg when you hold out a piece of biscuit and go and lie down alone when you dont want her send your three pounds a week and get out of it thats all i want to hear of you you know the way dont you  her outstretched forefinger pointed to the door burton had never felt so pitifully short of words in his life  iive asked the johnsons to supper he stammered as he took up his hat  take them to your westend then ellen cried scornfully take them riding in your motorcar why dont you tell the man to drive up and down the avenue that every one may see how fine you are would you like to know just what i think of you  burton looked into her face and felt a singular reluctance to listen to the torrent of words which he felt was ready to break upon his head he tried to hold himself a little more upright  you will be sorry for this ellen he said with some attempt at dignity  she laughed scornfully  one isnt sorry at getting rid of such as you she answered and slammed the door behind him  burton walked with hesitating footsteps down the footpath this was not in the least the triumphal return he had intended to make he stood for a moment upon the pavement considering it was curious but his motorcar no longer seemed to him a glorious vehicle he was distinctly dissatisfied with the cut of his clothes the glossiness of his silk hat his general appearance the thought of his bank balance failed to bring him any satisfaction whatever he seemed suddenly as clearly as though he were looking into a mirror to see himself with eyes he recognized even the blatant stupidity of his return and he admired ellen more than he had ever admired her in his life  where to sir his brandnew chauffeur asked  burton pitched away his cigar  wait a moment he said and turning round walked with firm footsteps back to the house he tried the door and opened it looked into the parlor and found it empty he walked down the passage and pushed open the door of the kitchen little alfreds meal was ready on a tray the room was spotless and shining but ellen with her head buried in her hands was leaning forward in her chair sobbing he suddenly fell on his knees by her side  please forgive me ellen he cried almost sobbing himself please forgive me for being such a rotter ill neveri promise that ill never do anything of the sort again  she looked up he ventured to put his arm around her waist she shook herself free very weakly he tried again and with success  i know ive made an idiot of myself he went on id no right to come down here like that i just want you to forgive me now thats all i didnt mean to swagger about being rich im not enjoying it a bit till you come along  ellen raised her head once more her lips were quivering half with a smile although the tears were still in her eyes  sure you mean it she asked softly  absolutely he insisted go and put on your hat with the feathers and well meet the johnsons and take them for a ride  you dont like the one with the feathers she said doubtfully  i like it now he assured her heartily im fonder of you at this moment ellen than any one in the world i always have been really  stupid she declared i shall wear my hat with the wing and we will call around at saunders and i can buy a motor veil i always did think that a motor veil would suit me wed better call at mrs crosss too and have her come in and cook the supper dont get into mischief while im upstairs  ill come tooand see little alfred he added hastily  carry the tray then and mind where youre going ellen ordered    chapter xxx  a mans soul  the halfyearly directors meeting of the menatogen company had just been held one by one those who had attended it were taking their leave the auditor with a bundle of papers under his arm shook hands cordially with the chairmanalfred burton esquireand mr waddington and mr bomford who during the absence of the professor in assyria represented the financial interests of the company  a most wonderful report gentlemen the auditor pronounceda business i should consider without its equal in the world  and still developing mr waddington remarked impressively  and still developing the auditor agreed another three years like the last and i shall have the pleasure of numbering at least three millionaires among my acquaintances  shall we mr burton suggested glancing towards waddington  mr waddington nodded but mr bomford took up his hat he was dressed in the height of subdued fashion his clothes and manners would have graced a cabinet minister he had as a matter of fact just entered parliament  you will excuse me gentlemen he said i make it a rule never to take anything at all in the middle of the day  he took his leave with the auditor  pompous old ass mr waddington murmured a snob mr alfred burton declaredthats what i call him got his eye on a place in society saw his name in the paper the other day a guest at lady somebodys reception here goes old chapsuccess to menatogen  waddington drained his glass  they say its his wife who pushes him on so he remarked  mr burtons wine went suddenly flat he drank it but without enjoyment then he rose to his feet  well so long waddington old chap he said i expect the missis is waiting for me  mrs burton was certainly waiting for her husband she was sitting back among the cushions of her sixty horsepower daimler wrapped in a motoring coat of the latest fashion her somewhat brilliant coloring only partially obscured by the silvergray veil which drooped from her motor bonnet burton took his place beside her almost in silence and they glided off she looked at him curiously  meeting go off all right she asked a little sharply  top hole mr burton replied  then what are you so glum about she demanded suspiciously youve got nothing to worry about that i can see  nothing at all mr burton admitted  very good report of alfred came second post mrs burton continued they say hell be fit to enter harrow next year and an invitation to dine too with lady goldstein were getting on alfred the only thing now is that country house i wish we could find something to suit us  if we keep on looking burton remarked we are bound to come across something sooner or later if not i must build  im all for building mrs burton declared i dont care for mouldy old ruins with ivy and damp places upon the walls i like something fine and spick and span and handsome with a tower to it and a long straight drive that you can see down to the road plenty of stone work about the windows and good square rooms as for the garden well let that come we can plant a lot of small trees about and lay down a lawn i dont care about other folks leavings in houses and a lot of trees around a place always did put me off have you told him where to go to  burton shook his head  i just told him to drive about thirty or forty miles into the country he said it doesnt matter in what direction does it we may see something that will suit us  the car with its splendid easy motion sped noiselessly through the suburbs and out into the country it seemed to mr burton that he must have dozed he had been up late the night before and for several nights before that he was a little puffy about the cheeks and his eyes were not so bright as they had been he had developed a habit of dozing off in odd places when he awoke he sat up with a start he had been dreaming surely this was a part of the dream the car was going very slowly indeed on one side of him was a common with bushes of flaming gorse and clumps of heather and little ragged plantations of pine trees and on his right a low oldfashioned house a lawn of velvet and a great cedar tree a walled garden with straight boxbordered paths a garden full of oldfashioned flowers whose perfume seemed suddenly to be tearing at some newlyawakened part of the man he sat up he stared at the little seat among the rose bushes surely he was back again back again in that strange world where the flavor of existence was a different thing where his head had touched the clouds where all the gross cares and pleasures of his everyday life had fallen away was it the perfume of the roses of the stocks which had suddenly appealed to some dormant sense of beauty or had he indeed passed back for a moment into that world concerning which he had sometimes strange half doubtful thoughts he leaned forward and his eyes wandered feverishly among the hidden places of the garden the seat was empty propped up against the hedge was a notice board this house to let  what on earth are you staring at mrs burton demanded with some acerbity a silly little place like that would be no use to us i dont know what the people whove been living there could have been thinking about to let the garden get into such a state fancy a nasty dark tree like that too keeping all the sun away from the house id have it cut down if it were mine what on earth are you looking at alfred burton  he turned towards her heavyeyed  somewhere under that cedar tree he said a mans soul was buried i was wondering if its ghost ever walked  mrs burton lifted the speakingtube to her lips  you can take the next turning home john she ordered  the mans hand was mechanically raised to his hat mrs burton leaned back once more among the cushions  you and your ghosts she exclaimed if you want to sit there thinking like an owl youd better try and think of some of your funny stories for tonight youll have to sit next that stuckup mrs bomford and she takes a bit of amusing   the end
