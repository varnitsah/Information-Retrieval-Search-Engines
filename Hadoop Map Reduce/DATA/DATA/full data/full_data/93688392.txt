93688392	a district messenger boy and a necktie party   by   james otis    author of toby tyler teddy and carrots jenny wrens boardinghouse the boy captain little joe etc etc   contents      a district messenger boy  i unwilling passengers ii home again  dan hardys crippy  a necktie party i sis scheme ii aggies scheme iii toms scheme   a district messenger boy   chapter i unwilling passengers  what is your name boy  joe curtis sir  and your number    two hundred and ninetyseven   very well now listen to what i say and see that you do exactly as i tell you i am going to providence by the sound steamer that sails in an hour and a half take these tickets go to the office of the boat get the key of the stateroom i have engaged and paid for and put these satchels in it  yes sir  then wait near the gangway of the steamer until i come for i shall probably be late as i have to take a sick friend with me be sure to have the room ready so that i can have him carried directly from the carriage to his berth   i will wait for you sir   what are the rates  for an hour and a half ninety cents sir and car fare extra if you want me to get there in a hurry   very well here is a dollar and see that you do exactly as i have told you  joe touched his cap took the two valises that the gentleman pointed out to him in one corner of the office and staggering under the heavy weight started for the nearest elevated railroad station joe was scarcely large enough to carry the valises but when he succeeded in getting a situation in the messenger service he knew that he would have plenty of hard work to do and was fully prepared for it besides this acting the part of porter was by no means so difficult a job as some that had been assigned to him in the past six weeks and he went about it as philosophically as if he had been a man instead of a boy only twelve years old  arrived at the dock he had no trouble in getting the stateroom key since he had the proper tickets and after caring for the baggage it was only necessary to wait near the gangplank until his employer should appear  it was by no means hard work for joe to wait for the gentleman in the bustle and confusion everywhere around him he found plenty to occupy his mind and forgetting how hard he had struggled to get the baggage down there he thought he had been particularly fortunate in being assigned to the work  the moments went by so fast that when the last bell sounded and joe heard the cry of all ashore thats going he could hardly believe it possible that he had been on the boat more than an hour waiting for the gentleman and his sick friend   hes got to come pretty soon or else his  stateroom wont do him much good joe said to himself as he stood close by the gangplank with the key in his hand ready to deliver it without delay  but although carriage after carriage was driven up just in time for its occupants to get on the boat joes employer did not come and the boy began to understand that unless he made some decided move at once he would be carried away  he told me to look out for the baggage until he came but i dont spose he meant for me to go to providence if he didnt come  the sailors were pulling the gangplank ashore and joe saw that his time was indeed limited since he had been ordered to care for the baggage until the gentleman came he had no idea of leaving it on the steamer neither did he propose to make a trip to providence  ill get the things out of the room an then wait on the pier he said to himself as he ran up to the saloon where the stateroom was located  there were a large number of passengers on the boat and despite all joes efforts he could not get through the crowd quickly he struggled and pushed even at the risk of incurring the displeasure of those gentlemen who were in his way until he reached the stateroom to get the valises out after he was once there was but the work of a few moments and then he had another difficult task to reach the main deck  when he did get there breathless and excited he saw that his efforts had been in vain for the steamer had already left the dock and was so far out in the stream that unless he had been mr giantstride of fairytale fame he could not have leaped ashore   well this is nice exclaimed joe as he stood with a valise in each hand looking at the dock on which he fancied he could see the man who had been the cause of his involuntary voyage now whatll i do  he stood looking about him in doubt and perplexity uncertain whether to go to the captain of the boat and demand that he be landed at once or to explain the situation to some of the passengers in the vain hope that they might be able to aid him when he heard the sound of sobs close beside him   hello did you get carried away too he asked as he saw a boy not more than eight or nine years old crying bitterly come here sonny an tell me what the matter is for it looks as if you an i were in the same scrape  theyre takin me away from mamma an papa an ill just jump overboard was sonnys answer  oh dont get like that said joe soothinglyas he placed the valises carefully in one corner and took the child by the hand to reassure him they arnt to blame cause they told everybody to go on shore that wanted to an we didnt go   i couldnt sobbed the boy he held me an when i cried he struck me in the face  who did  the man that made me come here with him mamma let me go out in the street to play if i wouldnt go away from the block but that man came up an asked me if i did not want a real live pony an i did an i went with him to get it  an  you forgot what you promised your mother said joe sagely   yes cause he said it was only a little ways off but when wed walked two blocks i wanted to go home and he told me hed cut my throat wide open if i said anything and then we come here  why hes up an stole you thats what hes done said joe as with his hands deep in his pockets he stood contemplating the boy whose trouble was so much greater than his  oh dear wailed the child as he hid his head in the corner and gave way to his grief im goin right straight home an i wont stay here  joe was touched by the boys distress he forgot his own troubles which were light as compared to the little fellows and did his best to comfort him  now see herewhats your name though  ned   well ned you couldnt get home now so youd better stop crying an well see if we cant fix it in some way wheres the man   he went downstairs when the boat started an he told me hed beat me black an blue if i spoke to anybody while he was gone  an probly he would said joe if he dared to reglarly steal you hed dare to do anything else but ill get away before he comes up an ill go an tell the captain of the boat then t rather think the man will wish hed neverd said anything about a pony for hell be arrested   no no dont  cried ned hed be sure to kill me if you should do that an then what good would it do me   but you haint goin to let him carry you off be you  oh i dont know said ned and he began to cry piteously again while joe tried to soothe him by wiping away the big tears with the cuff of his jacket  i think youd better let me tell the captain he said  i cant cause he knows another man on the boat an one of them would be sure to kill me why wont you let me just go with you  i would if i knew where i was goin  but you see im most as bad off as you are and then joe told him of his misfortune in having become an involuntary passenger concluding his story by saying an ive got a mother thatll feel just as bad as yours will it will be worse for her too cause she says now that fathers dead im all that shes got an every cent i make i carry home to her cause she has to work hard to get money to pay the rent  joe could understand very readily by neds clothing that their homes were widely differenthad it not been for his uniform the messenger boy would have worn a very shabby suit of clothes while ned was not only dressed expensively but he wore what was to joe the very height of extravagance  a gold ring  even if you dont know where youre goin take me with you said ned if youd help me id try to get away from that man  there he comes now dont let him whip me  ill go off sos he wont know weve been talkin an just as soon as he leaves again ill come back said he  he had just time enough to dart behind a pile of baggage before the man came up and he needed but one glance to convince him that ned had good cause for fear the mans face was so brutal looking that even he began to think perhaps it might not be advisable to appeal to the captain of the steamer lest the story should not be believed and he be called to an account for interfering  the valises were still where he had left them and marching boldly out but feeling quite the reverse of what he tried to assume he took the baggage not heeding the pleading look ned gave him and went to the stateroom where he remained some time trying to make up his mind what he could do to aid the boy who had appealed to him he did not for a moment entertain the idea of leaving him with that man suddenly what seemed to be a very brilliant idea came to him and he walked downstairs on to the main deck again leaving the door of the stateroom unlocked  the man was seated by neds side smoking and joe went from one place to another keeping the couple in sight all the while until he saw him walk away with a companion who spoke to him and looked quite as detestable as he  joe made sure that the two had gone into the lower cabin and running quickly to where ned sat he said come upstairs with me as fast as you can an ill show you what to do then taking the little fellow by the hand he hurried to the upper deck not looking around and hardly daring to breathe until they were in the stateroom with the door securely fastened and the blind of the window closed   there he exclaimed triumphantly in a whisper i guess this fixes mr man an when he tries to find you hell think that stealin boys haint so easy as he thought it was  but hell come up here to get me said ned hoping that there was an opportunity for him to escape yet frightened at the step he had taken   he may come upstairs but how can he find you see here ned ive got two tickets for the passage in my pocket an the rooms been paid for by the man i told you about now we can keep in here till the boat stops and then i guess we can give him the slip but i haint thought yet how we either of us can get home  but sposen he comes right up here to  the door  he w6nt do that cant you see ned that he don t know anything more about this room than he does of any other were all right for awhile anyhow but i guess well be pretty hungry cause we cant get anything to eat   i dont care bout that if he dont get hold of me again said ned growing bright and happy as he realized his temporary safety  the boys examined the tickets joe had looked curiously at the snug little cabin wondered what the man would say or do when he could not find ned and finally the first novelty of the situation having passed away they talked of their homes  it was the most unwise thing they could have done so far as peace of mind was concerned for at the thoughts of their mothers waiting and watching for them both broke down ned lay down in the berth without a thought of hiding his grief but joe who considered it his duty in his position of protector to the younger boy to appear unconcerned was obliged to stand by the window in order to cry without being seen or heard and he wiped his eyes with the curtain until his cheeks were stained blue and green from the dye of the fabric in a sorrowfully ridiculous fashion  however it happened neither of the boys quite understood but despite their deep sorrow they both fell asleep shortly after joe lay down by the side of ned to comfort him and did not awaken until morning the sun was streaming in through the slats of the blinds the throbbing of the engine was stilled and everything betokened the end of the voyage  neither of the boys had undressed for they had anticipated a long dreary evening during which they would be very hungry and joe had fully intended to walk around the boat for the purpose r of learning what neds enemy was doing they had not laid any plans arid in this joe felt that they had been culpable since now that they were at liberty to go on shore neither had an idea of what course to pursue  while you are washing your face i will go out and see if that man is around anywhere said joe finally an ill lock the door and take the key with me sos there wont be any chance of his gettin in while im gone  ned did not much like being left alone but he made no objections since he could readily see that it was of the highest importance that they should learn if the man and his companion were watching for them  joe went into every portion of the boat in which passengers are allowed but without seeing either neds captor or his companion had he been on deck when the steamer arrived at newport he  would have seen the two men land there after searching vainly for the boy they had stolen much as if they feared they might be called to an account for what they had done of this of course joe knew nothing and when he failed to see either of the men he naturally feared they were waiting on shore in the hope of catching ned as he landed  it was but seven oclock and as a number of the passengers were yet on board the stewards had paid no attention to the stateroom the boys occupied otherwise an explanation might have been made which would have prevented both the young passengers much trouble  its morning ned an i spose were in providence said joe as he came back to the stateroom where the child was waiting in fear and trembling the result of his trip on deck i cant see anything of the men an perhaps if we go on shore now they wont catch us weve got to take these valises for the man told me to watch em an that means that ive got to keep right side of em  ned manfully took hold of one side of the heaviest piece of baggage and with anxious hearts the two left the room at the gangway the children were stopped by the man whose duty it was to collect the tickets he looked at the small boys with the large valises curiously but as joe gave him the two pieces of pasteboard that entitled them to first cabin passages the officer could do no less than allow them to land  even though they were supposed to be in providence they were some distance from the city as they learned when they were off the pier and joe said  now ned im sorry to make you do it but weve got to walk fast if we dont want those men to catch us and that was sufficient to induce the boy to do his best  but no matter how frightened a boy may be he cannot walk very far on a hot morning without breakfast more especially if he has had no supper the night previous and some time before they were near the city both ned and joe were obliged to rest  as a matter of course they had seen nothing of the men and with the feeling of freedom came the question which should have been settled the night before  that of where they should go  i declare i dont know what we will do said joe in answer to ned and then he chewed a piece of straw vigorously as if by that means he hoped to be aided in arriving at some satisfactory conclusion  you see the trouble is that weve got all this baggage to lug round when its about as much as we can do to get along ourselves  why dont you leave the things somewhere you never can find the man that owns em even if you carry them all the way back to new york said little ned sensibly   thats so bub said joe but all the same you see he told me to take care of them an ive got to do it or else theyll blame me at the office  just then an express wagon passed which suggested to joe a very simple way of disposing of his burden  ill tell you what we can do he said as he started to his feet quickly while his face lighted up with pleasure at the idea  well walk along until we come to an express office an then well just send the valises on to where i work i know we can do that for last week somebody sent two trunks there an the manager had to pay the bill for bringing them  unfortunately it never occurred to joe that it also would be possible to get money sufficient to pay for the passage home by telegraphing to the manager of the office  weve got a dollar he said as they trudged along the valises seemingly growing heavier each moment and jest as soon as we get rid of these well get something to eat  at the express office the clerk took the baggage and gave joe a receipt for it without un necessary conversation if he had not been so busy he might have asked some questions and thus the boys would have been advised as to the proper course to pursue but as it was they walked out little thinking how much they might have learned and rejoicing that they were freed from a heavy burden  after they had made a very satisfactory breakfast on a pie which joe bought for the small sum of ten cents in consideration of the fact that it was not as fresh as a firstclass pie should be they walked in the direction of the wharves as a first step towards learning how they should get home  it surely seemed as if they had been singularly fortunate in taking this step for they had gone hardly more than a block when they met a boy about ten years old who appeared to know all about it it was not a difficult matter to make his acquaintance for he met their advances considerably more than halfway and in a few moments the three were comfortably seated on some barrels near the pier discussing the situation   a district messenger boy  chapter ii home again  you see you have to go up that way to get to new york said the boy pointing with an air of wisdom an if you fellers want to get  home real bad ill carry you there tomorrow myself in a boat  how long would it take you  asked joe just a trifle doubtful as to whether this boy could do as much as he said he could  only two or three hours if we have a fair wind  but we was all night comin down in the steamer remarked joe quickly  thats nothin said the boy contemptuously for this boat im goin to take you in can sail moren four times as fast as any steamer you ever saw why she sailed right around tom stevenss boat the other day an there wasnt any wind at all i tell you what it is just you come up here with me an see her then youll know what she can do  there was no reason why the boys should not accept the offer since they had plenty of time at their disposal and they started at once  whats your name asked joe thinking that perhaps it might be as well to call the boy by his right name as to be obliged to attract his attention by i say or look here  bartholomew west was the prompt reply as the boy looked around much as if he expected they had heard of him and would recognize the name at once not seeing the flush of joy he had expected would lighten up the faces of his acquaintances when they knew who he was he walked on ahead much as if he were angry until they arrived at the end of the street at the waters edge  bartholomew pointed to a beautiful little yacht that was riding at anchor a short distance from the shore and said in a tone of triumph  thats the boat  joe and ned stood looking at her with such undisguised admiration that bartholomew seemed willing to forgive their ignorance in not knowing him and at once entered into a detailed account of what the yacht had done in the way of sailing  do you spose you could manage her asked joe you see i dont know anything about boats an of course this little shaver here dont  manage her why i could sail a whole ship all alone if i wanted to was the confident reply now you fellers be ready just as soon as its light tomorrow mornin an well start  then youll have to come back alone and joe began to fear that they were accepting too much from this new acquaintance who must belong to some important family in the city since he was the owner of such a beautiful craft  well i haint sure but i shall stay in new york after i get there an if i do ill give you fellows lots of sails in the boat you see im  bartholomew had assumed a confidential tone much as if he were about to impart some important secret but evidently concluded not to since he stopped suddenly and looked as if he had already betrayed too much   why cant we go now  asked ned who was growing more and more homesick each moment  we cant start until tomorrow morning said bartholomew decidedly cause we couldnt get the boat till then you see some of the men will be aboard of her pretty soon now   couldnt get the boat  repeated joe in surprise why cant you have her whenever you want her if shes yours   w ell well  you see some other fellers are going to have her to day said the boy in confusion  if she was my boat i wouldnt lend her to anybody said ned gazing at the beautiful yacht  i have to sometimes said bartholomew but we can get her tomorrow mornin if were down here early enough  it never occurred to joe that his new acquaintance intended to steal the yacht he had no idea but that the boy owned her although it did seem a little queer that he did not offer to take them on board then but whatll we do all dayan tonight he asked finally  we haint got but ninety cents an   ninety cents exclaimed the yachtowner have you fellers got ninety cents joe explained how it happened that they had that amount and master west was so delighted that he acted very much as if he wanted to embrace them you stay right with me he said as he took each by the arm in an affectionate manner walking with them directly away from the water ill show you where you can sleep an nobody wont ever find you now come up with me sos we can get what we want  what we want  why yes if were goin to sail from here to new york weve got to have some things to eat so well go up an get some candy an some peanuts an crackers an a lot of things  joe was not just certain whether or no it was wise for him to spend his money although it did seem as if it was his duty to do so since bartholomew was going to take them home  he did as the owner of the yacht proposed spending half of his money in the purchase of such dainties as master west fancied and then in order to see if they had been cheated as bartholomew proposed they sat down on a doorstep to test the goods  i t seemed to joe as if master west ate a much larger proportion of the articles he had purchased than was strictly necessary in order to learn whether they were as they had been represented since more than half the stock had been consumed before the question was decided of course ned and joe ate some of the dainties but they only tasted of them while bartholomew had a regular feast and only stopped when by eating as much as possible he had lost his appetite for such things  after this repast was ended and the remainder of the eatables packed away in joes and neds pockets bartholomew appeared to have lost his desire to show his new acquaintances around the city he still said that he would carry them to new york on the following morning but he seemed to think that they should be able to care for themselves until then  ive got to lay round sos to find out whether anybodys goin to be on the boat this evenin he said an you fellers had better wait on the wharf awhile perhaps we can all sleep on board the boat tonight an if we can ill come back for you and take you aboard  where are you going now asked joe   over near where the boat is  why cant we go with you  it wouldnt do cause somebody might see you an then they would know what we was up to  what if they should asked joe quickly beginning to think that the yachtowner did not appear to have many rights on board of his own vessel  cant you take your boat when you want to  oh ill tell you all about it tomorrow after were on the way to new york said master west you stay right around the wharf till i come back  before either joe or ned could prevent him he had darted away in the direction of the yacht leaving his two friends at whose expense he had just been feasting to look out for themselves   do you know ned i dont believe that feller owns the whole of the boat cause he acts so queer about her an im almost sorry we spent that money for what we did you see it belongs to the office and when i get back an tell the manager that i had to spend it to get something to eat hell take it out of my wages   i wish we was home an my papa would give you the money to pay back said ned warmly   oh dear have we got to stay here a whole night   im fraid we have ned an it makes me feel awful bad to think about mother she must be about crazy cause i dont come home an as likely as not the manager thinks i run away with the money  my papa had gone away so he dont know that i didnt come home said ned with quivering lip but my mamma is feeling as bad as yours is  yes ned but we wont talk about it now cause it dont make me feel very good well wait awhile an if that west boy dont come well start off somewhere cause id rather walk than stay round here  dont you spose the captain of the steamboat would let us go back if we should tell him what made us come here im sure my mother would pay him when we got home said ned  do you spose shed have money enough you know it would cost much as two or three dollars apiece  course shes got enough why sir if she wanted as much as twenty dollars she could get it my mother could  then lets go right down to the steamboat an see if theyll take us  you are a sensible little chap and joe started to his feet but he stopped suddenly as a second thought came to him it wouldnt do to go cause the man that stole you is waitin round there probly an hed catch you sure  oh dear id forgot all about him said the child  joe made no reply seated on a pile of boards with his chin in his hands he gave himself up to the most gloomy reflections so hopeless did the case seem he had remained in this sorrowful attitude some moments with ned silent by his side when both were startled by a shout  hello there i why haint you up to the office  joe sprang to his feet he saw just behind him a boy about his own age in the uniform of a district messenger why you haint one of our boys are you where did you corne from continued the newcomer  joe looked first at the uniform and then at the boy that wore it as if uncertain whether he could trust the evidence of his own senses  well said the messenger whats the matter with you now does it overcome you very much to see me   where did you come from asked joe  corne from why i belong here what are you doip where do you work   in new york   new york exclaimed the boy and he uttered a prolonged whistle you dont mean to say that you was sent way down here with a message do you  see here joe made up his mind in an instant im in an awful bad scrape an so is this little feller sit down here an ill tell you all about it  all right but i guess wed better get behind those barrels cause if anybody should see me theyd think i ought to go back to the office even if i have got half an hour off  a convenient place for conversation was found behind some barrels where the two were almost completely screened from view and then joe told the story but not without many interruptions in the way of exclamations of surprise almost incredulity from his brother messenger he concluded by telling the story of their meeting with master west and his offer to take them to new york in his yacht  was it bart west that you met asked the boy  his name was bartholomew   an where is the boat   joe explained as well as he was able the locality in which they had seen the yacht and the messenger said quickly  well you dont want to have anything to do with that feller cause hes a reglar duffer hes too lazy to work an he hangs round the city like a loafer that boat haint his at all i know who owns her bart west haint got money enough to buy one end of a punt he was goin to steal the yacht thats what he was goin to do if he was goin to do anything an if you had gone off with him youd got into a pile of trouble  quite naturally both joe and ned were alarmed at the narrow escape they had had for they would have gone with bart west without a question  well how are you goin to get home asked the providence boy  thats just what we dont know we dont dare to go to the steamer cause that man might catch ned again im afraid well have to walk if that west boy dont own the boat  walk  echoed the messenger why it would take you a year to do it an then i haint sure that you could get there  well what can we do cant you help us somehow if you know all the folks here    i spose i could said the new acquaintance as he rubbed his chin reflectively if i should tell our manager about it i guess he could telegraph to new york to find out if it was all right an then he could fix it sos you could go back on the boat but he couldnt send the other feller cause you see he haint one of the crowd  oh dont go away an leave me here will you joe asked ned imploringly a sense of utter loneliness coming over him as he thought of what might happen to him if he were left alone   indeed i wont ned if we cant get home together ill stay and go with you if we have to walk every step of the way  ned stole his hand shyly into joes to thank him for the promise and the messenger said in a tone of superior wisdom   you see if he was a messenger like we are it would be all right but im most sure our manager wouldnt have anything to do with him but you stay here an ill tell him what youve said an then ill come back to let you know  what hes going to do about it  the boy leaped out of the hidingplace running swiftly towards the office as if he would scorn to walk while he had his uniform on and ned and joe were left alone two very forsakenfeeling little fellows even though there was a faint prospect that they might escape from their present difficulty  joe was obliged to repeat again and again to his weary little charge that he would remain with him and they were talking of what they would do in case they were obliged to walk home when suddenly they heard master west calling to them  well what is it asked joe coolly feeling that he had good cause for complaint against this boy who would have allowed them to get into trouble by going away in a stolen boat  come uptown an lets get some more things for we haint got half enough to last us to new york  i guess not said joe i haint goin to spend any more money for such things and too we wont go with you in the boat if we never get home  why not and bartholomew stood before them a perfect picture of painful surprise  well you see we haint sure that you own the boat an we concluded not to run any risks  sposen i dont own the boat so long as i can get her ill fix all that an youve only got to come along   i guess we can walk thankee wed rather do that than steal a boat  oh youre too much of a girl to suit me if you dont dare to do a little thing like that said master west loftily and then he walked slowly away much as if he expected the boys would call him back when they found that he was really intending to leave them to their fate   we want to get home pretty bad said joe but not so much that were willing to steal a boat to go in  all right you can stay here an starve to death for all i care youll be sorry though  youll be sorry bart west cried a voice from up the street but you cant get any messenger boy to go in with you when youre goin to steal mr longleys yacht  then it was you george browning who told these fellers that the boat wasnt mine said bart angrily   yes it was replied the messenger who appeared excited an these fellers can get home without you for our manager says hell pay their fare he telegraphed to new york an if the little fellers name is edward hawley hes goin to give em all they want to eat an buy a stateroom an they are to go like reglar swells  tis edward hawley piped ned jumping up on his tired little feet  it was not many seconds before joe and ned were out from behind the barrels questioning george in breathless excitement  the manager of your office had telegraphed down hereto know if you come on the boat said george as soon as the boys gave him an opportunity to speak  an to pay your fare back if you was here so when i told our manager he knew all about it then when i told him about the other feller he said folks in new york had been telegraphing all around the country for a boy by the name of edward hawley now youd better come up to the office an everythingll be all right  as may be imagined it was not many moments before joe and ned were telling their stories to the manager of the office in which george was employed and then their troubles were over the fact that they were in providence and safe was telegraphed to new york at once and george was detailed to show the boys around the city until time for the boat to leave for mr hawley had sent word that ned should be supplied with what he needed to make him comfortable and happy  nothing more was seen of master west and the two boys returned to new york on the same steamer on which they had been involuntary passengers the night previous   hello theres the man come to look for his valises said joe next morning as he and ned stood by the rail while the steamer was being warped into the dock i spose hell be mad now cause i sent them on by express   why thats my father exclaimed ned when joe had pointed his employer out from among the crowd on the pier  it was indeed the case and the reason why mr hawley had not come to relieve joe was that word of neds nonappearance at home had been sent to him nearly an hour before the steamer sailed  joe went back to the office after he had been home to see his mother but he did not remain there very long for mr hawley gave him a position in his store in return for his kindness to ned and today the district messenger boy is in a fair way to become a successful merchant   dan hardys crippy   among the flock of geese that toddled in and out of farmer hardys barnyard last winter hissing in protest at the ice which covered the pond so that there was no chance of a swimming match was one remarkable neither for its beauty nor its grace this particular goose was gray and was looked upon with no special favor by mrs hardy who had great pride in all the flock but the gray one  when it was a little fluffy drabcolored gosling one of the sheep had stepped on it crushing out its life so nearly that mrs hardy had no idea it would ever recover but dan begged for its life he felt sure he could set the broken leg and he pleaded so hard that his mother finally allowed him to make the attempt  and he did succeed the gosling was naturally a strong little thing and thanks to dans nursing was soon able to limp around the shed that had been converted into a hospital one of its legs was nearly a quarter of an inch shorter than the other but the little fellow increased in strength as rapidly as he did in size and seemed to consider dan as his owner and especial protector  like marys lamb it followed dan about whenever the opportunity offered until crippy  which was the name dan had given it  was known in the village quite as well as the boy was  many were the long walks confidential chats when the boy talked and the goose cackled that dan and crippy had and when the preparations for the thanksgiving festival were begun the gray goose was decidedly the fattest in the flock dan had always given crippy a share of his luncheon or had supplied for him a separate and private allowance of corn and by this very care of his pet did he get into serious trouble  dans goose is the largest and the fattest and i think we had better kill him for the thanksgiving dinner dan heard his father say three days before thanksgiving and mrs hardy had replied  i had thought of that gray feathers never bring as much money as white ones and the goose is terribly in the way he is always in the house and always directly under foot  dan could hardly believe his own ears the thought of killing and eating crippy seemed wicked why he would as soon have thought his parents would serve him up for dinner as crippy and as for eating any of his pet it would to his mind be little short of cannibalism  you wouldnt be so wicked as to kill crippy would you mother he asked while the big tears came into his eyes almost spilling over the lashes  why not mrs hardy was so busily engaged in her work of making mince pies that she did not notice the sorrow on dans face why not hes only a goose and gray weve got to have one and crip is the fattest  but mother i couldnt have poor crippy killed he an i do love each other so much   now dont be foolish about a goose danny come help me stem these raisins  dan said nothing more for he knew by the way she had spoken that his mother had fully made up her mind and that it would be useless to try to induce her to change her cruel plans he stemmed the raisins as she had requested but he worked as quickly as possible and when the task was done he ran out to the barn  when the gray goose toddled towards him immediately he opened the barn door cackling and hissing with delight at seeing his young master the tears which dan had managed to keep back came at last and with the goose in his arms he seated himself on the barn floor with a feeling in his heart that he and crippy were the two most unhappy and abused fellows in the world  0 crippy they say theyre gointo kill you an id a heap sooner theyd kill me what shall we do crippy   the goose made no reply he was perfectly content to nestle down in dans arms and so far as he could see he and his master were in remarkably comfortable quarters  much as the goose had been petted by dan the affection bestowed upon him just then seemed to surprise him and while the boy was still crying over him he struggled until he got away when he limped over to the cornbin as a gentle reminder that grain would please him far better than tears  during that day and the next dan spent his time alternately begging for crippys life and petting him but all to no purpose so far as inducing his mother to change her mind was concerned  on the following morning the gray goose was to be killed and dan could see no way to save him  that afternoon he spent the greater portion of his time with the doomed crippy crying and talking until all the fowls must have wondered what the matter was for there being no almanac in the barn of course they could have no idea thanksgiving was so near suddenly dan thought of a plan by which crippy might be  saved it was a desperate one and almost frightened him as he thought it over but with his pets life in the balance he could not hesitate at anything  ill tell you what well do crippy he said as he succeeded in making the goose remain quietly in his arms by feeding him with corn i uncle robert lives in new york an hes awful good i know if we could find him he could save you now ill get up in the night an come out here for you its only seven miles an im most sure we could walk there in a day then if he wont come out here to see mother thanksgiving will be gone an they cant have you for dinner  crippy swallowed the corn greedily and dan looked upon this as a sign that he not only understood what had been said but was eating an unusually hearty meal by way of preparation for the journey  under any less desperate circumstances dan could not have been persuaded to go away from home for an hour without asking his mothers permission and even as he was situated then he felt that he was about to do something which was almost wicked but since he could save crippys life in no other way what could he do he almost felt as if by taking the goose away he was preventing his parents from committing a crime for it could hardly be less than one to kill so intelligent and loving a creature  but though he tried to persuade himself that what he was doing was under the circumstances a favor to his parents there was a big lump in his throat as he did his work that night and realized that in a few hours neither his father nor his mother would know where he was he was more than usually careful about the kindlingwood and the water and when his mother spoke to him so kindly he had the greatest difficulty in keeping his secret  it was only the thought that he was by no means running away that prevented him from telling his mother what he intended to do he argued with himself that he was only going to uncle roberts on business and that he should return the day after he arrived there that would be entirely different from running away  during the evening dan worked hard at a message which he was to leave for his parents feeling obliged to take every precaution lest they should see what he was about and after the most painful efforts he succeeded in printing this note  crip  me have gorne to unkle roberts to get him to come up here to koax you not to kill crip we will come right back daniel k hardy  dan had six cents which he had earned carrying milk and his preparations for the journey consisted simply in putting these in his pocket together with some corn for crippy and in placing the little clock and some matches by the side of his bed so that he might be able to tell when the proper time had come for him to start  perhaps mr and mrs hardy were surprised by dans unusually affectionate manner when he bade them goodnight but if they were nothing was said about it and the inmates of the hardy farmhouse retired on the night before the proposed execution of poor crippy at the usual early hour of nine oclock  dans idea was to lie awake until three in the morning then steal cautiously out of the house get crippy and start but it was much harder work to remain awake than he had fancied and before he had been in bed an hour he was sleeping soundly  but even though his eyes persisted in closing despite his will dan did not sleep very long at a time he was awake at least every half hour and his small stock of matches was exhausted as early as two oclock with no means of procuring a light it would be impossible for him to know when the time had come and since he did not dare to go to sleep again he concluded it would be better to set out at once than run the risk of delaying until his father should awaken  during the time he was making very awkward attempts to dress himself in the darkness his fingers trembling violently both from fear and the cold he fancied each moment that he could hear his parents moving around as if they had suspected his purpose and were on the alert to prevent him from carrying it into execution it seemed too as if each particular board in the floor creaked in protest at what he was doing and to give the alarm  the note which was to inform his parents of where he had gone was placed conspicuously on the chair by the bed where his mother could not fail to see it when she came to awaken him and when that was done his journey seemed more like some demand of business and less like disobedience to what he knew his parents command would be  he did finally succeed in dressing himself although his jacket was buttoned in a very curious fashion and then with his shoes and mittens in his hands he started downstairs if the boards of the floor had tried to arouse his parents the stairs appeared bent on awakening the entire household  although he did his best to put as little weight as possible upon them they creaked and screamed in a most alarming fashion  it seemed strange to him that his parents could sleep while so much noise was being made but when he finally succeeded in closing the outside door behind him there had been no sign made to show that his departure was known  dan was so nervous and excited that he hardly felt the frost when he stepped with stockinged feet upon the snow but instinct prompted him to put on his boots and mittens and it only remained to get crippy and start  he almost expected that the goose would be waiting for him at the stable door when he opened it but since he knew he should find his pet in the warm box he had made for him he was not greatly disappointed at not seeing him ready for the journey besides he had come an hour before he told crippy he would be there which was sufficient reason why the goose was not ready and anxious to start  after groping his way around the barn to the corner in which was crippys sleeping apartment dan was considerably surprised because the goose was so very careless both in regard to his safety and the possibility of arousing the household he cackled and hissed when dan took him from the box as if he preferred to be killed and served up for the thanksgiving dinner rather than go outofdoors so early on a cold morning  dan whispered that he knew it was hard to be obliged to start so early but that they must do so and the more he explained matters the harder the goose struggled until it seemed much as if the attempt to save crippys life would be a dismal failure  im doin this sos you wont have to be killed crippy whispered dan as he held the goose tightly clasped in his arms an it does seems if you might help a feller instead of tryin to wake up father an mother  perhaps crippy was weary with struggling dan thought he began to realize his position  for he ceased all protests after his masters last appeal and with his head tucked under dans coat submitted quietly to the rescue  if he had not repeated to himself so many times that he was not running away from home but simply going to uncle roberts to save poor  crippys life dan would have felt that he was doing something wrong because of the warning cries uttered by everything around the stable door when he tried to close it softly shut with a spiteful clatter and even the snow gave forth a sharp crunching sound such as he had never heard before but he must keep on for to remain would be to see the plump brown body of poor crippy on the thanksgiving dinnertable while to go on would be at the worst but a few hours discomfort with crips life as the reward  once they were outofdoors crippy behaved much as if he had suddenly realized how important it was for him to get away from the hardy farm and dan had no trouble with him while he was passing the house  there seemed to be an unnatural stillness everywhere amid which the crunching of the dry snow sounded with a distinctness that almost frightened the boy who was simply going to his uncle roberts to spend a day or two but finally dan was on the main road where the snow was frozen so hard that his footsteps could not be heard as distinctly and where the two tracks worn smooth by the runners of the sleighs lay spread out before him looking like two satin ribbons on white broadcloth  dan trudged slowly on his heart growing lighter as the moments went by and he knew he had actually gotten away without arousing anyone but after he had walked some distance he began to realize how heavy crippy was he had thought he could carry his pet almost any length of time but at the very commencement of his journey his arms began to ache  its no use crippy youll have to walk some of the way he said as he put the goose on the snow and then started off to show him he must follow now a moonlight promenade on the snow in the morning with the thermometer several degrees below zero was not at all to crips liking and he scolded most furiously in his goose dialect but he took good care to run after his master at the same time  as mrs hardy had said crippy was very fat and when he toddled on at full speed he could only get along about half as fast as his master so that dans journey was made up with alternately trudging over the frozen road and waiting for his pet to overtake him  and soon it was necessary to make a change even in this slow way of travelling for before crippy had been half an hour on the road he began to evince the most decided aversion to walking and it became necessary for dan to take him in his arms again on he walked carrying crippy the greater portion of the time and coaxing him along when it became absolutely necessary for him to give his aching arms a little relief until the sun came up over the hills and he could see the great city but a short distance ahead of him  during all this time he had not stopped once to rest but now since he was so near his destination at such an early hour in the morning he sat down in the snow and began to arrange with the discontented crippy as to how they might best find uncle robert for dan had not the slightest idea of where his relative lived  ill tell you what well do crip he said as he gave the goose a handful of corn contenting himself with half a biscuit he had taken from the suppertable the night previous  well walk right along till we see uncle robert or some of the folks its the day before thanksgiving you know an some of em will be sure to be out buyin things  crippy had finished eating the corn as his master ceased speaking and he looked up side ways into dans face much as if he doubted the success of their plan if carried out in that manner  well if we dont find him that way well ask some of the boys an theyll be sure to know said dan replying as earnestly to crippys look as if his pet had spoken   then the weary journey was resumed much to crippys displeasure even though he was carried comfortably in dans arms and it was not until the outskirts of the city were reached that the goose was requested to walk there the pavements were free from snow and crippy could move along much faster than on the icy road but yet his progress was far from satisfactory  the great number of people all of whom regarded the boy and the goose curiously bewildered both the travellers more than once when dan was sure crippy was close at his heels on looking around he would see the goose standing on one foot near the curbstone looking sideways at the street much as if trying to decide whether he would continue to follow his master or toddle back home as fast as his legs of unequal length would carry him  oh come on crippy dan said in a tone that showed plainly how tired and discouraged he was we shant ever find uncle robert this way an if a strange dog comes along where will you be    it seemed very much as if crippy had not realized that he might chance to meet a dog until dan spoke of it for then he ran hurriedly on as if he fully understood the danger that might come to him by loitering on the way  but there were other enemies besides dogs which crippy was to meet with as he and dan learned when they reached the more densely populated portions of the city and those enemies were boys  dan was walking slowly on looking first at the houses in the hope of seeing some of his uncles family and then at crippy to make sure he was following when half a dozen boys who had been watching the singular pair from the opposite side of the street made a sudden dash at the goose  the first intimation dan had that his pet was in danger was when he heard the shouts of the boys followed by crippys angry hiss and the flapping of his wings quickly turning dan saw the goose closely pressed by the boys all of whom were trying to catch him and some of whom already had one or more feathers as trophies  it did not take dan many moments to catch his pet up in his arms and then he stood ready to do battle for the goose while the city boys advanced towards him threateningly  there could have been but one result to such a battle where six boys attacked one who was hampered in his movements by the goose and some serious injury might have been done to both dan and crippy had not a policeman come from around the corner just at that instant dans assailants fled at the sight of the officer and the country boy with his heavy noisy burden continued on his journey  there was no further interruption for nearly an hour for when dan carried the goose in his arms he was by no means the object of curiosity he was with crippy following him at the expiration of that time it dawned upon him that in a place as large as new york it was useless for him to walk around in the hope of meeting his uncle or any of his family  i declare i dont know what to do crippy he said as he seated himself on a doorstep with the goose by his side and looked mournfully up and down the street  i shouldnt wonder if we hadnt been moren halfway round the city in all this time an yet we haint seen any of uncle roberts folks what shall we do  crippy made no reply to the question but a boy about dans size who was looking wonderingly at the goose as he stood on his shortest leg in a mournful way spoke  wot is it yer dont know wot ter do   i dont know how to find my uncle robert crippy an me come down to see him an now we cant find his house   do you call him crippy asked the boy as he nodded towards the goose  ves hes crippy hardy mother was goin to kill him for dinner to morrer so we come down here to get uncle robert to go up an see about it   how far have you come    seven miles   did you walk    every step   well said the boy as he looked at crippy in a critical way it seems to me thats a mighty mean kind of a goose ter walk so far fur he haint handsome no ways an i think hed look a good deal better on ther table roasted than he does out here on ther street  up to that moment dan had been disposed to trust this boy who was so friendly but when he spoke so slightingly of crippy he was disappointed in him  vou dont know crippy or you wouldnt say that replied dan gravely i would walk seventeen times as far if it would keep him from gettin killed   well i tell yer wot it is and the boy spoke like one thoroughly conversant with geese and their ways hes got ter be a good deal bettern he looks ter mount to anything  an he is replied dan and then he gave the stranger a full account of crippys sagacity and wisdom with such success that when he had finished the goose evidently stood high in the city boys estimation  hes probly a mighty nice kind of a goose said the boy but it seems to me if i had a pet id want one that could sleep with me an you know you couldnt take this goose to bed  i could if mother would let me an i dont see why she wont for i know crippy would just snuggle right down as good as anybody could  for some time the two discussed the question of pets in general and crippy in particular and then the city boy remembered that his mother had sent him on an errand which should have been done an hour before  dan felt more lonely than ever after this newmade friend had gone and with crippy in his arms he started wearily out in search of uncle robert hardly knowing where he was going in his bewilderment he had walked entirely around the same block four times and an observant policeman asked him where he was going  under the circumstances dan did not require much urging to induce him to tell the man his story  do you know your uncles name asked the officer  uncle robert hardy  what is his business  i mean what kind of work does he do     he keeps store  the officer led dan to the nearest drug store and there after consulting the directory told him there were several robert hardys mentioned at the same time giving him a list of the names  dan took the paper with the written directions upon it feeling more completely at a loss to know how to proceed than he had before and it was in a dazed way that he listened to the instructions as to how he should find the nearest hardy  but he started bravely off still carrying crippy who seemed to have doubled in weight and when he had walked half an hour in the direction pointed out by the policeman he appeared to be no nearer his destination than when he started  what can we do crippy he cried as again he took refuge on a doorstep weary hungry and footsore he had seen no opportunity to buy a breakfast with his six cents it was then long past his usual time for dinner and his hunger did not tend to make him more cheerful  the goose was as unable to answer this question as he had been the ones dan had previously asked and the only reply he made was a loud cackling which in his language signified that he thought it quite time that he had some dinner  by this time and dan had not been on the doorstep more than five minutes a crowd of boys gathered around all disposed to make sport of the goose and to annoy the boy  say country why dont you sell your  goose    where did the bird find you   does yer mother know youre so far away from home   these and other equally annoying questions dan listened to until he could no longer control himself and he cried to his tormentors  see here boys if you had somethin you thought a good deal of an it was goin to be killed an roasted for dinner what would you do  the boys were too much surprised by the question to reply and dan continued earnestly this goose is crippy an ive had him ever since he was a baby an got his leg broke we come in here to find uncle robert sos he could tell mother not to kill poor crip an now we cant find him anan well were jest two as lonesome fellers as you ever saw an if you knew jest how we did feel you wouldnt stand there pokin fun at us  for a moment none of dans tormentors spoke and then the tallest one said sympathetically as he seated himself by the country boys side to show that he took both the boy and the goose under his protecting arm  they shant plague you any more an ef id a known how you was feelin i wouldnt a said a word now tell us all about it  dan was in that frame of mind where he needed sympathy and he told the whole story while the entire party stood around interrupting him now and then by exclamations of surprise that his parents should have been so cruel as to even think of killing that faithful crippy  this consolation even though it did dan no material good was very sweet to him and he would have continued to sing the praise of his pet had not one of the boys proposed that an effort be made to find uncle roberts house then each one had a different plan to propose none of them thinking that at that hourfour oclock in the afternoon  it might be an act of charity first to give dan and crippy something to eat  it surely seemed as if this discussion as to how the search should be begun would continue until it would be too late to do anything and while each one was stoutly maintaining that his plan was the best an oldfashioned sleigh drawn by a clumsylooking horse stopped directly opposite where the boys were holding their conference  why father cried dan as he saw the occupant of the sleigh and at the same time he hugged crippy close to him as if he believed his father had come for the goose  well dan you did find your uncle robert after all didnt you asked mr hardy as he alighted covered old dobbin carefully with the robe and then went to where dan was sitting already deserted by his newmade friends who feared mr hardy was about to inflict some signal punishment  no sir i didnt find him faltered dan wondering what his father would do to him and crippy  why havent you been in yet   in where asked dan in surprise  in here of course this is where your uncle robert lives and mr hardy pointed to the house on the steps of which dan had been sitting  to his great surprise dan learned that he had followed the policemans directions exactly but not knowing it had neglected to look on he house doors for his uncles name  in a few moments more he and his father were in the house while crippy was in the kitchen actually gorging himself with food  when mr hardy found the note dan had left he was not at all worried about his sons safety but when later in the day he had leisure he started to the city for the travellers and driving directly to his brothers house found them as has been seen  it is easy to understand that after all this labor on dans part to save his pet mr hardy readily promised that crippy should be allowed to die of old age instead of being killed and roasted and dan with crippy hugged very close to him started for home with his father sure that no boy in all the wide world would spend a merrier thanksgiving than he  crippy was also happy on that day if food could make him so and it is safe to say that if he survives the wonderfully big dinner dan proposes to give him this year he will live to a green old age   a necktie party  chapter i sis scheme  when deacon littlefield dismissed the pupils of the one school in the little town of orland on a certain day in december some years ago he was at a decided loss to understand what caused such an excitement among them before they had walked the short length of the playground the deacon had a very large bump of inquisitiveness on his bald head which perhaps accounted for his great desire to know why nearly all the boys and girls had stopped beside the tiny brook that scolded and fretted all the long summer days away but which was now closely encased in ice and why they were apparently holding a very animated discussion despite the intensely cold weather but the deacons bump of inquisitiveness was counterbalanced by one representing dignity and he thought that it would be hardly the proper thing for a deacon and a schoolteacher to be seen running through the snow with a skullcap and dressinggown on therefore he watched his pupils from the window but without being able to satisfy his curiosity in the slightest degree  the girls and boys were indeed in a high state of excitement  on the noon of that same day agnes morrell had under injunctions of strictest secrecy told maria gilman and annie rich of a certain plan which she had developed in her own mind  in some unaccountable way it had been whispered around until before recess was over nearly everyone excepting deacon littlefield knew that aggie proposed giving what she called a necktie party there were but two others who knew what kind of a party this could be and they were maria and annie therefore it is not to be wondered at that she was almost overwhelmed by questions from the other girls even before she was fairly out of the schoolhouse  as a matter of fact the boys were equally interested but si kelly had said to his particular friends now dont let on that we care a cent about the party whatever it is and acting under what was both advice and a command none of the boys had condescended to ask any questions although they took good care to be near aggie when she finally explained the purpose of the party  now this is what it is she said as she tied her muffler closer about her neck and sought shelter from the cold wind behind the high board fence all of us girls must meet as often as we can during the coming week to make aprons and neckties out of print only one apron and one necktie is to be alike and walt haley and mr dilloway are going to give us as much calico as we need  i thought you said you was goin to have a party and master kelly forgetting his own caution to the boys not to appear interested in the scheme looked decidedly disappointed  so i am but we are going to get money enough out of it to give aunt betsey bolton a nice present  oh its some begging thing is it and although si knew very well that he had not a single penny about his person he plunged his hands deeply in his pockets as if to prevent any inroad upon his wealth   it isnt anything of the kind replied aggie indignantly her face flushing with something very nearly resembling anger until her numerous freckles stood out quite prominently aggie had a large supply of freckles as even a very nearsighted person could see we are going to have just as many boys as girls and no one is obliged to come but if any boy is willing to pay ten cents towards helping aunt betsey he buys a necktie and the girls each buy an apron either one will be worth the ten cents so it hasnt anything to do with begging  but what do you have these things to sell for why not let each one give ten cents for  going to the party asked winny curtis in a tone that was very nearly a squeak so shrill and peculiar was his voice  thats the fun of it replied aggie triumphantly after we girls have made the neckties and aprons mother will wrap each one in paper so that no one can tell which is which then when a boy buys one of the packages he sees what color of necktie he has got and he hunts for the girl that has an apron like it he must go in to supper with that girl and walk home with her after the party is over  are you goin to have a supper  squeaked winny   yes mother says she will get a nice one for us and that will be the only party i am to have this winter  goin to have cake continued winny growing deeply interested despite sis caution  of course we are it will be just like any party except that each boy will have to pay attention to the girl whose apron matches his necktie now we want all of the boys to come because it wont be any fun if there isnt an even pattern of aprons and neckties we girls are going to maria gilmans house tonight to begin the work and tomorrow morning the boys that will come must tell us so well know just how many neckties to make  winny curtis thinking more of cake than of the charitable purpose of the party and remembering how difficult it was for him to persuade any of the girls to allow him to walk home with them because of his diminutive size and disagreeable voice at once announced his determination to be present the other boys looked at si and as he did not choose to commit himself they also remained silent  aggie saw at once that there were more difficulties in the way of this manner of giving a party than she had supposed she knew that winny as the only boy present would not make matters very lively even though he should be willing to buy a dozen neckties and escort as many of the girls home   well have lots of fun she said if you boys will come for im sure the girls will all be there and while were enjoying ourselves we shall know that were doing something to help aunt betsey whos a good deal poorer this year than she was last  then aggie understood from sis face that he was growing more and more opposed to the plan and as her freckles came prominently into view again she said with a show of dignity that even deacon littlefield might have been proud of as she started down the street  come girls lets go home so that we can get over to marias house early well have the party and well each buy an apron  then aggie walked away followed by the girls each one trying to appear as if perfectly indifferent whether any of the boys came to the party but all thinking that it would be a very tame affair if no one but winny was present  on this particular year there had been but little to amuse the school children of orland therefore the girls if not the boys had hailed aggies scheme with delight none of the girls had openly expressed any opinion as to the advisability of having the party for the double purpose of enjoying themselves and helping aunt betsey but it was easy to tell from their faces that the plan had their unqualified approval  winny looked around him as the girls walked away he had but just begun to understand that he was the only boy who had agreed to attend the party and it was by no means pleasant to be in opposition to si kelly who had a most disagreeable way of making sport of anyone who did not agree with him  nothing but the thought that he could have a perfect feast of cake would have caused him to forget even for an instant that the selfappointed leader of the boys had not approved of the plan now since he had accepted the invitation without first consulting si he believed it necessary for him to make some effort to correct what had undoubtedly been a very grave error on his part  of course i shant go if the other fellers dont he said i thought you was all in for it when i spoke  well youd better run home now an see how many tencent pieces you can find said si in what he intended should be a scornful tone  youll be the only feller to the party and youll have to buy a good many neckties   where are you fellers goin asked winny feeling that he was in disgrace  that neednt bother you any were goin to have a reglar good time none of your tencent parties  an you can go home now   but if you are to have a time i want to be in it  well you cant cause youve agreed to go to aggie morrells an wear a tencent necktie so run home sonny for we want to talk about what it wouldnt do for you to hear  poor winny his desire for cake had caused him to place himself in a most unenviable position he knew that si and all the boys would call him a girl baby during the remainder of the winter and he was quite sure the fellows would get up some kind of a good time which would be more jolly than the girls party he knew however that it would be useless for him to say anything more after having offended \si and he went sorrowfully home while the other boys remained to discuss a scheme their leader had decided upon on the impulse of the moment  we wont have nothin to do with the tencent party the oracle said as soon as winny was so far away that he could not hear if the girls had come to us an asked what we thought of it then prhaps wed gone in with em but instead of that they fixed the thing up to suit themselves an then told us what they was going to do now they can have their party and win curtis will be the only feller there  it is safe to say that fully half the boys wished to go to aggie morrells and that nearly every one would have been pleased to have done something towards helping poor old aunt betsey but si had said that it must not be   but whatll we do to get even  asked lute hubbard anxiously we shall have to get up something thatll be better than the party  i guess that wont be very hard to do replied si loftily if i couldnt get up a better kind of a time than following girls round by their apron  strings well each of us put in twentyfive cents to hire grouts twohorse sleigh an go on a ride to bucksport for all day  there was no question but that si was right  a ride to bucksport in mr grouts handsome sleigh was the one thing the boys could enjoy and for the moment all desire to go to the party was forgotten each boy pledged himself to raise twentyfive cents and with some little difficulty in counting noses after which si laboriously figured up the total amount it was learned that they would not only have money enough to hire the sleigh and horses but there would be a surplus sufficient to buy such a goodly supply of candy and nuts as would make a really respectable feast   now thats all right an well have the sleighride si said but weve got to fix it with the girls lets go back to the schoolhouse an ill write a letter to ag morrell thatll show her she cant make us do just what she thinks best  whats the use of writin her a letter asked tom hardy who wanted to get home in time to do his chores before dark  we can tell her in the mornin that we haint goin to the party an that will settle it   well write the letter said si with the air of one who does not allow himself to be contradicted weve got to let the girls know that they cant do jest what they want to with us an i nows the time to do it  then si led the way back to the schoolhouse knowing that every boy would follow him and while deacon littlefield was making his preparations to leave for the night master kelly wrote a letter to aggie the composition and writing required no little amount of time and labor for if si was the leader of the school he was not a remarkably brilliant scholar and he was forced to pucker his brows and bite his tongue a good many times before it was completed  there he said as he handed it to tom hardy after he had tried unsuccessfully to wipe off a large blot of ink with his coat sleeve read that out loud an if it wont show them girls that they cant do jest what they want to then i dont know what will  tom read after considerable difficulty the following remarkable production which in justice  to si is given here exactly as he wrote it  mis morel us boys dont wanter come to your party cause were goin somewhere else you think you can do whatever you wanter jest cause your girls but you make a mistak the next time you wanter start anything youd better ask us about it  then purhaps you can do something we hop youll have a good time at your ten cent party but dont get too much money so that ant betsey will think she is rich  get recklis the boys  no one ventured to express an opinion on this ungentlemanly epistle although there were several in the party who did not think it fair to send such a reply to the kindly meant invitation and si said with a satisfied air  i guess thatll show em what kind of fellers we are i when they want to get up any more times theyll find out first what we think about it ill put it in her readin book where shell be sure to see it the first thing in the mornin an then ill talk to grout about hirin his sleigh  even those who were opposed to sending so harsh a reply in answer to the invitation did not remonstrate against the plans of their leader and that which was believed would be the deathblow to the girls necktie party was left where aggie would be sure to see it when she came to school next morning   chapter ii aggies scheme   while it is a fact that nearly every boy who had allowed himself to be influenced by si kelly in the matter of refusing to attend aggie morrells necktie party was almost ashamed of himself for permitting such a letter to be written without making protest each one was at the schoolhouse early next day in order to learn what the girls were going to do about it  aggie had always been a favorite with her schoolmates but on this particular morning when she came into the schoolhouse a quarter of an hour before deacon littlefield called the pupils to order the boys with the single exception of winny curtis were very careful to keep on their own side of the room every fellow was anxious to hear what she would say when she read sis note but no one was willing to put himself forward more prominently than another for even the redoubtable si was rather afraid of aggies temper  although winny had no idea of what the boys were intending to do he was at the schoolhouse quite as early as anyone in order to see all that might take place as well as to make his peace with the boys if possible si refused positively to have anything to do with the ten center as he called winny and the others gave him the  cold shoulder acting very much as if they blamed him because they had refused to go to the necktie party  when the girls entered the schoolroom in a body the boys were gathered in the back seats strictly following sis commands to act as if nothin was up  it was not many moments before aggie and her friends understood that the boys had decided against the party therefore when just before school was opened the letter was found it caused but little surprise indignation was the feeling that predominated and had deacon littlefield not rapped loudly on his desk as a signal that it was time for school to open it is probable that master si would have heard from more than one of the tencenters the exact opinion they all had regarding him  the good old deacon knew that some great and barely suppressed excitement among the pupils was the cause of the inattentiveness even on the part of those who were usually the most studious and he acted as if his life was particularly a burden to him during the hour and a half that elapsed before recess he had reproved nearly every pupil before halfpast ten and then he said in his most severe tones  i hardly know whether you or i feel the most relieved because the forenoon session is half finished if it was any other time than immediately before the holidays i should think it my duty to inflict extra tasks upon you all but under the circumstances i propose to do just the reverse by increasing the length of recess giving you half an hour instead of fifteen minutes after that time i expect you will be in a more fitting condition to give proper attention to your studies if such should not be the case it will become my duty to remind you forcibly that you must not try to unite your amusements with your studies  the boys headed by si rushed out with their customary shout of joy and the girls went at once into one of the classrooms where an indignation meeting was held but not called to order   its all si kellys doings exclaimed aggie  the other boys would have been in favor of the party if he hadnt said they shouldnt i should think they would be ashamed of themselves to come and go at his beck and call  sis ears must have tingled during that recess  if there is any truth in the old saying that those useful members grow warm when their owner is being spoken ill of for every girl present seemed to think it her duty to say something against him before she could discuss the matter with calmness  its no use standing here talking about that kelly boy maria gilman said at last the bell will ring and we shant have anything settled the question is what are we going to do of course it is foolish for us to say that we can have very much of a party if all the boys stay away  we must have it said annie rich decidedly it would never do to let them think that we had given up a good time just because they wouldnt join us  yes we must have the party said aggie thoughtfully  and we must make the boys come if possible its no use for me to try to study now and im going to ask the deacon to let me go home some of you girls catch winny curtis and find out from him what the boys are going to do ill think up some kind of a plan and after school tonight well see what can be done  then refusing to answer a single question but cautioning the girls not to look as if they cared in the slightest because of the letter aggie went into the schoolroom where she had no difficulty in getting permission to go home as a matter of fact deacon littlefield would have been more pleased than his pupils could have been if he could have given them all a holiday for trying to teach a number of boys and girls who were in the highest state of excitement over aggies proposed necktie party was a task  maria and annie caught winny curtis as aggie had proposed but the information they succeeded in getting from him was limited for the reason that he knew nothing of the boys plans all he could tell them was that si kelly was fixin it for a reglar high old time but unfortunately he had not been permitted to join them even had he been disposed to give up the party where it seemed probable that he would be the only boy among twentyfive or thirty girls  the boys did not have as much sport out of the letter as they had expected the girls spoke to them pleasantly without any reference to what had been said or done and they began to fear that some plan was under way which might promise even better sport than their sleighride  theyll get up something to beat us tom hardy said mournfully its got to be a pretty smart boy who can get the best of a lot of girls an i tell you what it is fellers theyll serve us out before we get through puttin on airs  now dont be an idiot tom cried si angrily do you want them to say that we cant have a good time unless theyre along too our sleighride will go ahead of anything they can get up an theyll be mighty sorry they cant go with us  prhaps so replied tom doubtfully but aggie morrell has gone home to cook up some plan an we sha n t know whether were goin to have the best time or not till we find out what shes about  if you want to go in with the tencenters an wear a calico necktie why dont you say so cried si now thoroughly angry  if i wanted to i would retorted tom i stood by an saw you write that letter an ill stick to it but all the same im sorry weve done what we have cause whenever weve started anything the girls have always gone in with us an it looks mean  more than one of the boys believed as tom did and the result was that the opponents of the necktie party held a stormy meeting although no one had the slightest idea of backing down from the position he had taken under sis leadership  aggie did not show herself to friend or foe until just as the afternoon recess was ended and then she entered the schoolroom with such a demure innocent look on her face that every girl knew she had decided upon some plan that promised success even si kelly looked anxious when she came in and he immediately resolved to collect on the very next morning the money each of the boys was to pay towards the sleighride in order that no one might be tempted to join the necktie party  s0 attentive was aggie to her studies during the remainder of the afternoon that deacon littlefield must have thought it would be a good idea to send each one of his pupils home for a few hours  the girls tried in every way except that of breaking the rule against whispering to induce aggie to give some hint of what she had decided upon and the boys watched her jealously but neither to the one party nor the other did she make a sign betokening that she had even thought of the necktie party since she went home  when school was dismissed the boys instead of rushing out at full speed as was their custom appeared to have a remarkable amount of trouble to arrange the books in their desks and deacon littlefield was yet more surprised by seeing every one of his boy pupils loitering around as if pained at being obliged to go home  the girls understood at once that they might have some trouble to hold a meeting in the schoolroom and at the same time prevent the boys from knowing what was said or done and they adjourned to the classroom locking the door behind them  now tell us all about it aggie said annie rich as she stuffed the keyhole with paper what is it to be  did anyone find out from winny curtis what the boys think of doing asked aggie he doesnt know anything about it  si kelly wont let him join them because he said he would come to our party  jen hardy you must try to find out from tom tonight what they are going to do and at the same time you mustnt whisper to him a word of what we say here and aggie spoke in a tone of authority warranted by the fact that the girls looked up to her as their leader now i believe we can shame those boys so that whether they come to our party or not they wont serve us such a trick again here is a letter i have written to si kelly and each one of you must write the same thing to some other boy so that they will all get one now listen ill read it and then eyery one can copy it  with a look of the most intense satisfaction on her freckled face aggie read  dear si  all of us girls are sorry that you cant come to the party we made a great mistake when we proposed that each one should pay ten cents even though the money was to be used to help aunt betsey we know that only the lack of money prevents you from coming and in order that you need not be obliged to stay away when we all want to see you i have paid the ten cents for your necktie which i send with this letter will you please come as early as eight oclock  your friend agnes morrell  for several moments after aggie ceased reading the applause was so great that it was impossible for anyone to make herself heard the girls were so pleased with the scheme that they were almost as noisy as the boys would have been under similar circumstances  now we must each give twentyfive cents aggie said as soon as the tumult had partially subsided and we will buy the things for aunt betsey so that the boys will know we have really paid the money each one decide which boy she will write to so that everyone will get a letter and mother says you may all come to my house tonight to make the neckties ive been to mr dilloways and lute haleys and got the prints so that we can have everything fixed this evening  when will we send the letters  the first thing in the morning mother will wrap up the neckties to night so that we shant know which ones we are sending away we will leave the letters with the packages on the boys desks before school begins and if they are not ashamed of themselves by the time they read them im mistaken   but suppose the boys dont come after we do all this said maria dolefully  then well have the party just the same and i guess we can manage to have a good time even if mr si kelly does not permit the boys to come   but how can we leave the letters maria appeared to be full of doubts even though aggies plan seemed so promising the boys will be sure to come here the first thing and we shall look rather silly carrying the letters around to the desks when they are all here  i know that replied aggie promptly and im going to tell deacon littlefield the whole story just as soon as we get through here we will ask him to let us come in first and to keep the boys out until we get everything fixed  there was no question but that aggie had thought of all possible contingencies and the girls were convinced that under her leadership they would be able to rout master kelly even though they might not have the satisfaction of seeing him at the party  now well go home and write the letters before supper so that we shall have nothing to do this evening but work on the neckties said aggie as she made her preparations for leaving the room ii you girls go and ill arrange it with the deacon so that we can get in here in  the morning ahead of the boys  of course girls dont cheer when anything pleases them as boys do but this particular party of girls were strongly tempted to do so as they left the room so thoroughly convinced were they that they would soon triumph over those who had tried to humiliate them   chapter iii tom s scheme  despite all efforts not a boy had been able to learn what course the girls had decided  upon during the meeting in the classroom several of those who were in favor of the sleighride had sisters among the tencenters and they used every effort to learn what had been the result of the meeting but in each individual case before the boy had asked very many questions he found that his sister was more successful in getting information from him than he from her  during that evening the girls kept their secret closely guarded while more than one of the boys had inadvertently divulged enough of sis great scheme to enable the girls to judge quite clearly what they proposed to do si had notified his friends and adherents that he would meet them at half past eight in the schoolroom when he expected that each one would be prepared to pay his share of the cost of the sleighride and all hands were in the playground at an early hour next morning anxious but unable to get into the building  why it was that the schoolhouse door should be locked so late on this particular morning when it was usually opened as early as seven oclock no fellow could imagine that the girls were the cause of their being deprived of their regular place for holding business meetings never occurred to them and the only reason they could assign for this remarkable delay on the part of the janitor was that deacon littlefield was ill they did not really hope that their teacher was sick but they would have been willing he should be slightly indisposed if in such case they would have an unexpected holiday  si did not think it advisable to neglect business simply because they were obliged to stand outofdoors instead of being in a warm room and he promptly collected twentyfive cents for the proposed sleighride from each boy who was so fortunate as to have that amount of money with him  at ten minutes before nine the boys who had begun to grow surprised because none of the girls had appeared were disappointed at seeing deacon littlefield whom they had believed to be sick come into the yard and in five minutes more they trooped into the schoolroom behind him the door having been opened by the janitor from the inside the moment the teacher stood before it  all this looked mysterious and the mystification was complete when the sleighriders saw every individual member of the tencenters with the single exception of winny seated at their desks much as if they had remained there all night on going to his seat each boy found a letter and a package staring him in the face and from that time until the deacon called the school to order no sound was heard save the rustling of paper as the boys read the missives while the girls appeared to have no thought save for their books which they were studying with most remarkable intentness  no one of the boys had time to compare notes with his neighbor when deacon littlefield said after he had rapped vigorously on his desk to command attention it has been suggested to me by such of your parents as i have had time to call upon that in view of the near approach of the holidays and of the many plans you may possibly have in mind school be dismissed until after the beginning of the new year to have followed out my original intention we should have continued in session today and to morrow but believing that i should have only your divided attention during that time i have concluded to give you two extra holidays trusting that when we assemble here again you will endeavor to make up for the time thus lost you are therefore dismissed from attendance until the day after new years  under ordinary circumstances this unexpected announcement would have been received with cheers by the boys but so confused were the sleigh riders by the letters they had just received that they remained quietly in their seats while the girls walked demurely out of the building  even before deacon littlefield had taken his departure the confusion began tom hardy being the first one to express an opinion i tell you what it is fellers the girls have got the best of us and no mistake  the best of us growled si kelly i call it about as mean a thing as i know of   is it any meaner than what we did to them   of course it is they write as if we couldnt afford to pay ten cents to go to their old party an here the most of us have already given twentyfive cents for our ride ag morrell can have her calico necktie back an im goin to carry it up to her house before im an hour older   i wouldnt do that squeaked winny who was secretly delighted at the turn in affairs  if she gets to talkin about the letter you sent youll have the worst of it  then everybody spoke at the same time until no one could understand what the other was saying and deacon littlefield rushed out of the building to save himself from premature deafness  it was some time before anything like order was restored and then tom hardy said impatiently  look here fellers its no use for us to stand here cawing like a lot of crows when nobody knows what the one next to him is saying i go in for havin this thing done right if were goin to do it at all the girls have got the best of us now an if any of you think we can turn things around lets go to work shipshape   i nominate tom hardy president of this meetin to see how we can get ahead of the girls squeaked winny and to say the least he was very officious in so doing since he was a member of the tencenters and really had nothing to do with the discomfiture of the sleighriders  in the general excitement however no one seemed to remember that winny was not one of them and all called for tom hardy to conduct the meeting si kelly recognized the fact that he should have been the one to occupy this proud position but the leadership seemed to be slipping away from him and shout as he might no one paid any attention to him he had led the boys on to defeat instead of victory and since he could suggest no wiser plan than to return the neckties and letters all looked to tom hardy for advice  fellers he said gravely as he seated himself in the deacons chair understanding the importance of his position weve got to do something to get ahead of the girls an i go in for havin each one say what he thinks is best after that we can pick out a plan now what do you think we ought to do si  master kelly was very sulky but he managed to state as his conviction that they could do no less than return the neckties and letters to the senders treating the whole matter with silent scorn and carry out the idea of the sleighride as if such insignificant persons had never had an existence  joe barr thought it best to accept the invitations given and treat the whole matter as a good joke whereby each boy had saved ten cents joe however had not yet paid the assessment twentyfive cents for the sleighride and many ought he had proposed this plan as a way of rading any outlay of money  eben coulliard was willing to do whatever the others thought best but at the same time he reminded them that a party at aggie morrells house was not a thing to be sneezed at and if the invitation could be accepted graciously he thought it would be a pleasant way of spending an evening  dan crockett announced that he was not afraid to say he had rather go to the party he had already paid his quarter towards the sleighride but he was willing to look upon hat as so much money thrown away if the others would agree to go to aggies house he thought that the money that the girls had spent could be returned to them in some way and that the friendly feelings between the boys and girls of the school could be restored  jack haley and his four intimate friends did not care a cent what was done they would agree to anything the other fellows thought best  bart carleton agreed with si kelly but since it was known that he owed si four agates and seventeen marbles to say nothing of three tops all believed that his debt had influenced his decision  all save tom hardy gave their opinion and it was found that the boys were about evenly divided one party adopting sis suggestion and the other favoring the acceptance of the invitations if it could be done so that they would not appear to be backing down  it now see here fellers said tom when every one looked at him as if expecting to hear what he thought i want you all to understand in the first place that i am willing to do what the majority think best but ive got a little scheme that i think a good one lets go on the sleigh ride an go to the party too  then the girls would think we were smart  growled si  wait a minute till you hear the whole of it  about half want to do one thing and half another now i say lets each one write to the girl who has sent him a necktie thanking her for the invitation to the party and ask her to go on a sleighride with us we can hire both of grouts big sleighs an have about as big a time as was ever seen in this town i guess the girls wont be much ahead of us then  but how about their payin for our neckties  asked dan crockett  well let that go as if we was much obliged to them but well raise ten cents more apiece an buy aunt betsey wood enough to last her till summer if we pay the money now we can each get a saw an have it all cut up before night the girls wont have any the best of us then aunt betsey will be just that much better off we can have our sleighride and we can go to the party as well but if we should do simply one thing or the other then the girls would be sure to think we had been beaten now if all the fellers will agree to that ill get my share of the money right away an well ask deacon littlefield to buy the wood this morning  tom saw even before he had ceased speaking that the majority of the boys were in favor of his scheme since by carrying it out they would miss neither one pleasure nor the other and would only be obliged to pay ten cents extra and to spend a little time sawing wood  but we cant get both sleighs for the same price we could one said si but even this objection showed that he was favorably inclined towards toms scheme if it could be accomplished without too great a sacrifice  yes we can if we dont take them till the middle of the afternoon we will start about three oclock an come back to aggies house in time for the party  but howll you fix it about the letters asked si  ill send this one to maria gilman for she sent me the necktie an you can all copy it then tom read the following letter which he had written while the others had been talking  dear rie  i am much obliged for the invitation and the necktie i will be there by eight oclock if you will do a little favor for me us boys have been getting up a sleigh ride for saturday afternoon we shall start about three oclock from the schoolhouse and get back to aggies in time for the party will you go  i am sure aunt betsey will feel grateful to you girls when she knows you each gave twenty cents towards making her comfortable and if it had not been for the lack of money we boys would have paid our share  your friend tom  hurrah  shouted dan crockett i reckon that will fix things an when they find that we bought the wood for aunt betsey they cant think that theyve got the right to feel very superior  theyll never know but that we meant all the time to do this very thing said tom an we shall have as good a time as can be had  there was no question but that this scheme would be carried out for even si kelly came to understand that it was a very graceful way of extricating themselves from what at one time promised to be a decidedly disagreeable position and he announced his decision by saying  now every feller must hurry home an get the ten cents sos we can buy the wood quick an then there wont be any chance for the girls to believe that we thought of this after we got their letters  take the money you had collected for the ride an we will all make it up before night suggested tom  in another moment si was running at full speed towards deacon littlefields house to ask him to buy the wood and tom suggested that each sleighrider sharpen his saw in order to be ready for work as soon as the fuel should be in aunt betseys yard  before night the wood had been purchased  sawed and split the letters had been written and sent to the girls and both of mr grouts sleighs engaged for saturday afternoon  the story of the ride and of the necktie party that followed it would without doubt be interesting but the telling of these pleasant festivities would occupy too much space suffice it to say that the girls readily accepted the invitations that were the result of toms scheme and although they learned from some of the more garrulous sleighriders under just what press of circumstances they had been given the ten  centers were too generous to hint of what they knew  aggies party was a dazzling success every one appeared to have a good time and the pairing off of the aprons and neckties caused considerable amusement especially when debby thompson the tallest girl present found that she must accept the smallest boy  who was winny of course  as an escort  it is hardly necessary to say that winny was allowed to become one of the sleighriders and since he had voluntarily agreed to go to the party he was obliged to pay for his necktie as well as his proportion of the cost of the sleighride and the wood thus it was that his love for cake proved to be quite expensive to him owing to the varied schemes of his friends  the end 43
