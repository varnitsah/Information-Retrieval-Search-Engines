series for young americans  as i mentioned in a previous volume of this series when i began this set of books i had in mind to write no more than three volumes relating the adventures of dick tom and sam rover at home at school and elsewhere but the publication of the rover boys at school the rover boys on the ocean and the rover boys in the jungle immediately called for more stories of the same sort so year after year i have followed with the rover boys out west the rover boys on the great lakes the rover boys in the mountains and now the volume before you which relates the adventures of the three brothers and some of their friends and enemies on the sea and on a number of far away islands where for a time all lead a sort of robinson crusoe life  in writing this tale i had in mind not alone to please my young readers but also to give them a fair picture of life on the ocean as it is today in distinction to what it was years ago and also to acquaint the boys and girls with some of the beauties of those midocean lands which are generally so strange to all of us the boys see much that is new novel and pleasingnew fruits new flowers new animalsand have often to use their wits to the utmost to get themselves out of serious difficulty and also to make themselves and those under their protection comfortable  once again i thank my young friends for the interest they have shown in my previous stories i trust that all who peruse this volume will find it equally to their liking  affectionately and sincerely yours arthur m winfield      the rover boys on land and sea     chapter i  the rover boys in san francisco   well dick here we are in san francisco at last  yes tom and what a fine large city it is  well have to take care or well get lost came from a third boy the youngest of the party  just listen to sam cried tom rover get lost as if we werent in the habit of taking care of ourselves  sam is joking came from dick rover still we might get lost here as well as in new york or any other large city  boston is the place to get lost in said tom rover got streets that curve in all directions but let us go on where is the hotel  im sure i dont know came from sam rover  cab carriage coupe bawled a cabman standing near take you anywhere you want to go gents  how much to take the three of us to the oakland house  take you there for a dollar trunks and all  ill go you answered dick rover come on ill see that you get the right trunks  i think we are going to have some good times while we are on the pacific coast observed tom rover while he and sam were waiting for dick and the cabman to return  i shant object to a good time replied sam that is what we came for  before we go back i am going to have a sail up and down the coast  to be sure tom perhaps we can sail down to santa barbara that is a sort of asbury park and coney island combined so i have been told  dick rover and the cabman soon returned the trunks were piled on the carriage and the boys got in and away they bowled from the station in the direction of the oakland house  it was about ten oclock of a clear day in early spring the boys had reached san francisco a few minutes before taking in the sights on the way now they sat up in the carriage taking in more sights as the turnout moved along first one street and then another  as old readers of this series know the rover boys were three in number dick being the oldest funloving tom next and sturdyhearted sam the youngest they were the only offspring of anderson rover a former traveler and mineowner who at present was living with his brother randolph and his sisterinlaw martha on their beautiful farm at valley brook in the heart of new york state  during the past few years the rover boys had had numerous adventures so many in fact that they can scarcely be hinted at here while their father was in the heart of africa their uncle randolph had sent them off to putnam hall academy here they had made many friends among the boys and also among some folks living in the vicinity including mrs stanhope and her daughter dora a girl who according to dick rovers idea was the sweetest creature in the whole world they had also made some enemies the worst of the number being dan baxter a fellow who had been the bully of the school but who was now a homeless wanderer on the face of the earth baxter came from a disreputable family his father having at one time tried to swindle mr rover out of a rich gold mine in the west the elder baxter was now in prison suffering the penalty for various crimes  a term at school had been followed by an exciting chase on the ocean and then by a trip through the jungle of africa whence the rover boys had gone to find their longlost father after this the boys made a trip west to establish their parents claim to the gold mine just mentioned and this was followed by a grand trip on the great lakes in which the boys suffered not a little at the hands of the baxters on an island on one of the lakes the rover boys found a curious casket and this on being opened proved to contain some directions for locating a treasure secreted in the heart of the adirondack mountains  we must locate that treasure said tom rover and off they started for the mountains and did locate it at last but not before dan baxter had done everything in his power to locate it ahead of them when they finally outwitted their enemy dan baxter had disappeared and that was the last they had seen of him for some time  the rover boys had expected to return to putnam hall and their studies immediately after the winter outing in the adirondacks but an unexpected happening at the institution of learning made them change their plans three pupils were taken down with scarlet fever and rather than run the risk of having more taken sick captain victor putnam had closed up the academy for the time being and sent the pupils to their homes  the boys will have to go to some other school their aunt martha had said but one and another had murmured at this for they loved captain putnam too well to desert him so quickly  let us wait a few months had been dicks suggestion  let us study at home had come from sam  let us travel tom had put in travel broadens the mind he loved to be on the go all the time  the matter was talked over for several days and tom begged that they might take a trip across the continent and back using some of the money derived from the old treasure at last anderson rover consented and two days later the three boys were off going by way of new york city on the chicago limited they had spent two days in the great city by the lakes and then come direct to the golden gate city  i wonder if we will meet anybody we know while we are out here said tom as the carriage continued on its way  if we get down to santa barbara i think well meet somebody answered dick and he blushed just a trifle i got a letter in chicago as you know it was from dora stanhope and she said that she and her mother were traveling again and expected to go either to santa barbara or los angeles her mother is not well again and the doctor thought the air on the pacific coast might benefit her  oh my but wont dick have an elegant time if he falls in with dora cried sam tom we wont be in it  now dont you start to tease me returned dick his face redder than ever i guess dora always gave you a good time too  thats right she did said tom and then he added did she say anything about the lanings for the laning girls nellie and grace were cousins to dora stanhope and tom and sam thought almost as much of them as dick did of dora  to be sure she did replied dick but i guess itswell its a secret  a secret shouted sam not much dick let us in on it at once  yes do put in tom  but it may prove a disappointment  well chance it returned tom  well then dora wrote that if she and her mother could find a nice cottage at los angeles or santa barbara they were going to invite nellie and grace to come out and keep house with them for six months or so  hurrah cried sam enthusiastically i hope they come if they do wont the six of us just have boss times and his face glowed with anticipation  we can certainly have good times if mrs stanhopes health will permit said dick here we are at the hotel  he uttered the last words as the carriage came to a stop at the curb he leaped out and so did the others and a few minutes later found them safe and sound in the hotel they were assigned to a large room on the third floor and hither they made their way followed by their trunks and then began to wash and dress up preparatory to going down to the dining room for the journeying around since breakfast had made them hungry  i think i am going to like san francisco said tom as he was adjusting a fresh collar and gazing out of the window at the same time everything looks so bright and clean  they have some pretty tall buildings here the same as in chicago and new york came from dick as he too gazed out of the window  oh all the big cities are a good deal alike put in sam who was drying his face on a towel  san francisco is a mighty rich place continued tom they are too rich even to use pennies its five cents here or a bit there or two bits for this and two bits for that i never heard a quarter called two bits in new york  ive been told that is a southern expression and one used in the west indies said dick the early californiansmy gracious  dick broke off short and leaned far out of the window which they had opened to let in the fresh spring air  whats up queried tom dont fall out and he caught his elder brother by the arm  i must have been mistaken but it did look like him said dick slowly  look like whom asked sam joining the pair  dan baxter  dan baxter here shouted the others  i am pretty sure it was dan baxter  where is he asked tom  he is gone nowhe just disappeared around the hotel corner  well if it really was dan baxter we want to keep our eyes open was sams comment     chapter ii  the turning up of dan baxter   the boys were very curious concerning their old enemy and on going below took a walk around several squares in the vicinity in the hope of meeting the individual who had attracted dicks attention  but the search proved unsuccessful and they returned to the hotel and went to dinner with a larger appetite than ever  it would be queer if we met dan baxter out here said tom while they were eating he seems to get on our heels no matter where we go  if he came to san francisco first hell think we have been following him up said sam  he must have come here before we did said dick our arrival dates back but three hours and he grinned  the meal over the boys took it easy for a couple of hours and then prepared to go out and visit half a dozen points of interest and also purchase tickets for a performance at one of the leading theaters in the evening  as they crossed the lobby of the hotel they almost ran into a big burly young fellow who was coming in the opposite direction  dan baxter ejaculated dick then i was right after all  the burly young fellow stared first at dick and then the others in blank amazement he carried a dresssuit case and this dropped from his hand to the floor  whewhere did yoyou come from he stammered at last  i guess we can ask the same question said tom coldly  been following me have you sneered dan baxter making an effort to recover his selfpossession  no we havent been following you said sam  supposing you tell us how it happens that you are here  suppose you tell us how it happens that you are here came from dick  that is my business  our business is our own too dan baxter  you followed me growled the big bully his face darkening i know you and dont you forget it  why should we follow you said tom we got the best of you over that treasure in the adirondacks  oh you neednt blow remember the old saying he laughs best who laughs last i aint done with you yetnot by a long shot  well let me warn you to keep your distance said dick sternly if you dont youll regret it we have been very easy with you in the past but if you go too far i for one will be for putting you where your father is in prison  and i say the same said tom  ditto here came from sam  at these words a look of bitter hatred crossed dan baxters face he clenched his fists and breathed hard  you can brag when you are three to one he cried fiercely but wait thats all my father would be a free man if it wasnt for you wait and see what i do  and so speaking he caught up his dresssuit case swung around on his heel and left the hotel before anybody could stop him  hes the same old baxter said tom with a long sigh always going to square up  i think he is more vindictive than he used to be observed sam when dick spoke about his father being in prison he looked as if he would like to strangle the lot of us  well i admit it would be rough on any ordinary boy to mention the fact that his father was in prison said dick but we all know and dan baxter himself knows that one is about as wicked as the other the only thing that makes arnold baxters case worse is that he is old enough to know better  so is dan old enough to know better was toms comment  i believe he was coming here to get accommodations said dick  if he was that would tend to prove that he had just arrived in san francisco dick  true but he may have been in this vicinity perhaps in oakland alameda or some other nearby town  what do you suppose could have brought him here  thats a conundrum maybe he thought the east was getting too hot to hold him  i wish we knew where he was going  let us see if we can follow him up  but to follow dan baxter up was out of the question as they speedily discovered when they stepped out on the sidewalk people were hurrying in all directions and the bully had been completely swallowed up in the crowd  we must watch out said dick now he knows we are here he will try to do us harm mark my words  the walk that afternoon proved full of interest and in the evening they went to see a performance of a light opera at the columbia theater the performance gave them a good deal of pleasure  quarter past eleven exclaimed dick when they were coming away thats the time we got our moneys worth  i thought it must be late said tom i was getting hungry let us get a bite of something before we go back to the hotel  the others were willing and they entered a nearby restaurant and seated themselves at one of the tables as they did this a person who had been following them stopped at the door to peer in after them the person was dan baxter  they are going to dine before retiring he muttered to himself the old nick take the luck they have all the good times while i have only the bad  dan baxter had followed the boys from the hotel to the theater and had also waited around for them to come out he wanted to square up with them but had no definite plan of action and was trusting to luck for something to turn up in his favor  he had drifted to the west for a double reason the one was as the boys had surmised because the east seemed to be getting too hot to hold him his second reason was that he hoped to get passage on some vessel bound for sydney australia he had a distant relative in australia and thought that if he could only see that relative personally he might be able to get some money he was nearly out of funds and so far the relative although rich had refused to send any money by mail or express  they have everything they want while i have nothing he went on savagely and they dont deserve it either oh how i wish i could wring their necks for em  suddenly an idea struck him and without waiting for the boys to come out of the restaurant he hopped on board of a street car running in the direction of the oakland house entering the hotel office he asked to look at the register  room 324 he said to himself that is on the third floor i suppose since they generally start a new hundred for every floor wonder if i can get up without being noticed  he watched his chance and slipping past the bell boys made his way up the stairs which on account of the elevators were but little used in a few minutes he was in front of the door to room 324 he tried it cautiously to find it locked  now if only the keys will work he muttered breathing hard and taking a bunch of keys from his pocket he tried them one after another  he had tried four keys without success when he saw a waiter approaching with a trayful of good things for a late supper in a nearby apartment at once he moved away down the hallway and did not return until the servant had disappeared from view  he had five other keys and the third fitted the lock although rather crudely so crudely in fact that once the lock bolt was turned the key could not be withdrawn  thats bad he thought but as it cannot be helped ill have to make the best of it i mustnt stay here too long and going into the room he closed the door after him  there was a faint light burning at one of the gas jets and this he turned up and pulled down the shades of the windows then he gazed swiftly around the large room noting the boys trunks and traveling bags and several articles of wearing apparel scattered about  oh if only i can find what i am after he muttered but more than likely they carry their money with them or else they left it at the hotel office  all of the trunks and traveling bags were locked and to force the trunks open seemed at first impossible one of the traveling bags was slit open with a sharp pocketknife the bully carried and the contents emptied on one of the beds  not much that i want muttered dan baxter as he gazed at the collection then a jewel case caught his eye and he opened it a diamond stud and a diamond scarf pin not so bad after all and he transferred the jewelry to his pocket  a second later he came upon a bunch of keys they proved to belong to the trunks and bags and soon he had the trunks open and the contents scattered in all directions then he went down on his knees examining everything brought to light  it must be confessed that he was in a fever of excitement the rover boys might return at any moment and he knew full well that to be caught would mean a term in prison he kept his ears on the alert while his heart thumped loudly within his bosom  a pocketbook at last he cried softly and snatched it up one look showed him a small pile of five and tendollar bills exactly two hundred and seventyfive dollars in all then he found another jewel case and from it extracted a second diamond stud and a pair of very fine cuff buttons  that is all i guess i can get he muttered as he stood up but i might as well take a new outfit while i am at it he added and picked up several articles of wearing apparel these he stuffed in one of the bags which had not been cut and around it put a small strap  tiptoeing his way to the door he opened it and listened nobody was within hearing or sight but as he stepped out the waiter he had before seen came once more into view this time carrying a tray with some bottles and a box of cigars the waiter eyed him curiously again but said nothing  too bad he saw me but it cant be helped thought dan baxter and made his way downstairs with all possible speed once in the lower hall he lost no time in gaining the street in another moment he was swallowed up in the darkness of the night     chapter iii  a discovery and what followed   hullo what does this mean here is a key in the door  it was dick rover who spoke he stood in the hallway of the hotel and beside him were tom and sam they had eaten rather heartily at the restaurant and taken more time than they had anticipated  i didnt leave the key there came from tom here it is and he brought it out of his pocket i meant to leave it at the desk but it slipped my mind  dick found the door open and walked into the room followed by his brothers baxter had extinguished the gas and they stood in the dark until sam found a match and lit up then a cry went up from all three  we have been robbed  this is some sneak thiefs work came from dick run down and tell the hotel clerk at once  tom bolted from the room and went down the stairs three steps at a time the clerk sat dozing in his chair and was roused up with difficulty but as soon as he realized that something was wrong he was wideawake  a robbery eh he queried what have you lost  weve got to find that out answered tom  in less than a quarter of an hour they knew the extent of their lossthree diamonds and a pair of cuff buttons in all worth over two hundred dollars and two hundred and seventyfive dollars in cashnot to mention a ruined valise and one missing and the loss of a light overcoat some silk handkerchiefs and some underwear  a total loss of over five hundred dollars said tom  at this the hotel clerk gave a long whistle as much as that  yes said dick  we must get on the track of the thief and without delay  i reckon i know the thief said sam  you think it was dan baxter questioned his elder brother  i do  perhaps you are right but there is no proof that he did it  the hotel clerk found the windows closed and locked  the thief came in and went out by the door he said the hall boys or somebody else must have seen him this key is stuck in the lock which proves that it is not a regular hotel key  without delay the story of the robbery was telephoned to the nearest police station and soon two detectives appeared by this time some of the servants noticed that something was wrong and the waiter who had seen dan baxter come in and go out told his story to which the boys the hotel clerk and the detectives listened with interest  tell us just how that fellow looked said dick and the waiter gave a very good description of the person he had seen  i imagine sam is right said dick if it wasnt dan baxter it was his double  upon hearing this the hotel clerk and the detectives insisted upon knowing who dan baxter was and the boys told as much of the bully as they deemed necessary  of course if he is guilty the chances are that he will leave san francisco as soon as possible said one of the detectives the best we can do is to try to head him off  and well do our best to find him too added tom  i think the hotel ought to be responsible for this robbery said dick  you didnt leave your key at the desk when you went out cried the hotel clerk struck by a sudden idea  what of that asked tom  that makes the guest responsible  what cried tom aghast  we are responsible only when the key is left at the desk and jewels must be left for keeping in one of our safes went on the clerk there are our rules and he pointed to the printed form tacked on the inside of the door  dont let us talk about that just now said one of the detectives i think we can get hold of this thief and if we are quick about it well get everything he took too  the matter was talked over for a quarter of an hour longer and then the detectives went off to make their report and to follow on the trail of dan baxter if such a thing was possible  it must be confessed that the three rover boys slept but little that night the loss of the cash was something of a serious matter to them even though they still possessed a hundred odd dollars in cash between them and could easily telegraph home for more more than this the diamonds and cuff buttons had been gifts of which they were very proud  and to think that dan baxter should get them said tom i wouldnt feel half so bitter if it had been just some ordinary sneak thief and the others said the same  two days went by and nothing was learned concerning dan baxter further than that he had put up at the montgomery hotel for one night and had left early in the morning  he is hundreds of miles away from here by this time said dick sadly  he said he would get square and i guess he has done it returned tom  but dan baxter had not gotten as far as they supposed he was in hiding in oakland across the bay having pawned the diamonds at a pawnbrokers of shady reputation for seventyfive dollars this gave him three hundred and fifty dollars in cash which made him for the time being feel quite rich  but he was afraid to take a train to some other town and so remained in the boarding house for nearly a week under the assumed name of robert brown  at the end of the fifth day dan baxter became acquainted with a seafaring man named jack lesher lesher was a rough fellow who had sailed to many ports on the pacific ocean he had now obtained the position of first mate on a large schooner which was to sail in a few days from san francisco to several ports in australia  id like to go on that trip to australia said baxter thinking of his distant relative do you want a passenger  ill see about it my hearty replied jack lesher and on the following day said that captain blossom would take him for an even hundred dollars a bargain was struck at once and dan baxter went on board of the schooner golden wave that afternoon  im glad i am out of it he told himself when snug on board of the craft ill get to australia after all and im considerably richer than i thought i would be more than that ive got in on those rover boys in a way they wont forget in a hurry  while the detectives looked for the thief the boys had small heart to go sightseeing every time they went out they looked for dan baxter  if only i could meet him cried tom oh but wouldnt i just punch him good before i passed him over to a policeman  during those days the lads received several letters from home and also three communications from the stanhopes and the lanings  the stanhopes have gone to santa barbara announced dick after perusing an epistle from dora and she says her mother is slightly better  nellie laning is coming out and so is grace said tom  when questioned dick  they have already started according to the letter i have put in sam boys i think we can have just the jolliest time ever was when the girls are all together  right you are came from tom what a pity we had to have that robbery to darken our fun  i am not going to let it darken my fun said dick dont worry but what some day well get the best of dan baxter that stolen stuff will never do him much good  the very next morning came word from the detectives one of them called at the hotel  i am afraid the case is queered said he we tracked the rascal to oakland and now it looks as if he had given us the slip for good  cant you find any trace of him questioned sam  oh yes but he has shipped on a vessel which is bound for australia and as she is already two days out of port he is out of our reach  you are certain he went on that vessel cried tom  yes he went as a passenger under the name of robert brown  and did he take the jewels and money with him  more than likely at any rate we can find no trace of the jewels  then that chase is done for said dick and we shall have to pocket our loss  the detective was chagrined to think that he had tracked dan baxter only to lose him and promised to see if anything more could be done in the matter  but nothing could be done as there was no telling when the golden wave would arrive at australia and what port the craft would first make  we have seen the last of dan baxter said sam  but the youngest rover was mistaken they were to meet the bully again and under circumstances as astonishing as they were perilous     chapter iv  good times at santa barbara   what a land of plenty  it was tom who made the remark  the rover boys were on their way to santa barbara after having spent three weeks at san francisco and vicinity they had received word that dora stanhope and her mother and the two laning girls were at the fashionable watering place and they were anxious to meet their old friends  on sped the luxurious train over hills and through the valleys past heavy woodlands and by rich fruit farms it was a scene which interested them greatly and they never tired of sitting at the windows gazing out  presently the car door opened and a tall young fellow carrying a valise stepped inside and walked down the aisle as he came closer dick rover leaped up  bob sutter he cried with a smile of pleasure who would ever dream of meeting you out here  is it really dick rover questioned the newcomer as he shook hands and tom and sam too i must be dreaming is putnam hall on its travels  we are on our travels replied tom also shaking hands followed by sam but what are you doing here  bob sutter a former scholar at putnam hall smiled broadly  i live in california now my father is interested in real estate in los angeles ventura and santa barbara our home is in santa barbara  that is where we are going came from sam  what are you doing just traveling around  yes we thought wed put in time until the hall opens again  i heard it had been closed too bad if you are going to santa barbara you must call and see me by all means went on bob sutter  to be sure we will said tom and his brothers nodded  we were going down there now to call on the stanhopes said dick they have come here for the benefit of mrs stanhopes health and nellie and grace laning are with them i guess you know them all  i know the laning girls and i think i did meet miss stanhope onceat a football game ill be glad to meet them again but tell me about yourselves  bob sutter sat down and soon all were talking at a lively rate the newcomer was astonished to hear of the doings of dan baxter  the baxters always were a hard crowd he said i hope youll get back your stuff some time  it was late at night when santa barbara was reached yet many of the hotels were a blaze of light from top to bottom at the depot the rover boys parted with bob sutter but promised to call upon him in a day or two  ive got a fine yacht said bob sutter some time i want to take you for a trip  just what we were wishing for cried tom just name your time thats all  how will next monday suit  will your yacht hold us asked sam  the old glory will hold ten passengers on a pinch answered bob sutter  then you dont sail the craft alone  i can sail her in fair weather but father makes me take an old sailor named jerry tolman along with me jerry is a charactera regular old salt and i love to have his company and that makes me think why cant we make up a party and go out you can bring the three girls you are going to visit and i can bring my cousin mary parloe  now you are talking shouted sam what a jolly trip it will be  the proposal met with immediate approval and it was decided that the boys should meet not later than saturday afternoon to complete arrangements  the rover boys had received word that mrs stanhope had rented a furnished cottage not far from one of the leading hotels the lady was very nervous and did not like too much noise and confusion about her meals were brought in from the hotel which made it very pleasant  when the three boys drove up in a carriage from the depot three girls came rushing out to greet them the three were dora stanhope and her two cousins nellie and grace laning  so here you are at last cried dora stanhope as she gave dicks hand a tight squeeze  we almost made up our mind you had missed the train said nellie laning to tom giving him a bright smile as she spoke  how fine you are looking said grace to sam traveling must agree with you  traveling does agree with us said sam  we would have been here sooner only we stopped to talk to an old schoolmate said dick and then he told about bob sutter  oh i remember bob sutter said nellie we went on a strawride together oncebefore you came to putnam hall she added to tom  i know him too put in grace hes a nice boy  of course he is said sam pointedly  but he isnt as nice as some boys went on grace in a lower tone and giving sam an arch smile that made him feel very happy  they were soon in the cottage and greeting mrs stanhope who had been lying on a couch the lady greeted them in a motherly way that made them feel more at home than ever she thought a great deal of the rover boys and especially of dick and did not object in the least to the marked attention dick bestowed upon her only child as my old readers know the rover boys had in the past done mother and daughter more than one valuable service  the boys were fortunate in obtaining rooms in the hotel close to the cottage which would make it possible for them to run in and out as they pleased  its like old times to be together again said tom when he and his brothers were retiring that night and as mrs stanhope is feeling so well i guess we can have lots of fun  and fun they did have there were bathing in the surf and lawn tennis and dancing at the hotel in the evening and also lovely walks and drives and once they went out on horseback to a large fruit farm some miles away and were royally entertained by some of bob sutters friends bob sutter and his cousin mary parloe went along and proved firstclass company  the idea of a trip on bobs yacht suited everybody and it was decided that the whole party should go out early monday morning taking old jerry tolman with them they were to load down well with provisions and visit not only several points along the coast but also one or two of the islands lying twentyfive to thirty miles south of santa barbara  the rover boys had already inspected the old glory and found her to be a firstclass yacht in every respect the craft was about sixty feet in length and correspondingly broad of beam she carried a tall mast but the lead in her keel was amply sufficient to keep her from going over unless under full sail in a very heavy wind the cabin was fairly large and richly furnished for the sutters were a family of means and desired everything of the best  if the boys liked the yacht they also liked the man who had charge of her bluff and hearty jerry tolmancaptain jerry as bob sutter called him he was truly an old salt having sailed the ocean since his tenth year on both whalers and merchantmen captain jerry lacked a book education but he was naturally shrewd and far from being a fool  downright glad to meet ye my hearties he said when the boys were brought on board and he gave each hand a grip like that of iron want to look over my lady eh well shes a putty one to inspect take my word ont and he showed them over the craft with pleasure they found the yacht clean as a whistle and each particular bit of brasswork polished like a mirror  by saturday evening all was ready for the trip on sunday morning the rover boys went to church with the stanhopes and the lanings and rested in the afternoon  they were just about to go to supper when a note came for dick it was from bob sutter and ran as follows    my dear dick my cousin and i have been in an accident we went driving to church this morning and the horse ran away and threw us both out on the rocks miss parloe had her collar bone broken and i broke my left ankle kindly come and see me if you can    an accident cried tom that is too bad  let us all go and see him suggested sam and this plan was carried out  they found that bob sutter was resting easily on his bed the doctor had set the broken ankle and put it in plaster and he had told bob that he must keep quiet for several weeks  this ends that yacht trip so far as i am concerned said bob ruefully  never mind we can wait until you get well said dick cheerfully although he did not expect to remain at santa barbara more than ten days longer  no i dont want you to wait answered bob sutter my cousin wont be well so they tell me for several months and i wont want to go without her ive been thinking that you had better take the trip without us captain jerry can easily run the yacht with your aid  thats very kind of you said tom but wed rather have you along  the matter was talked over for an hour the rover boys knew that dora nellie and grace would be sorely disappointed if the yacht trip was given up at last they decided to accept bob sutters kind suggestion and make the trip without the company of the young owner and his cousin and then they withdrew wishing bob a speedy recovery     chapter v  on board of the yacht   what a glorious day for the trip  we are going to turn real sailors arent we  cant i help pull up a sail or something tom  such were the remarks of dora nellie and grace as they boarded the old glory early on monday morning  the boys and captain jerry were there to receive them having arrived an hour before to see that all the provisions were stowed away and that the craft was in prime condition for sailing by a curious combination of circumstances bob sutter had ordered far more provisions than were necessary for such a short trip but captain jerry had found a place for everything remarking that they might come in useful after all but never dreaming how useful as later events were to prove  mrs stanhope had come down in a carriage to see them off she kissed all of the girls an affectionate goodby  have a good time she said and be sure and come back safe and sound  dont ye worry but what ill bring em back safe enough maam said captain jerry as he tipped his cap respectfully  when the girls were safe on board the boys waved an adieu to mrs stanhope then they ranged up in a row in front of old jerry and each touched his forelock and gave a hitch to his trowser leg  ready for orders capn they said in unison having practiced this little byplay in secret  whwhat stammered captain jerry gazing at them in bewilderment  ready for orders sir they said  shall we shake out the mainsail asked dick  shall i hoist the jib came from tom  can i set the topsail captain put in sam  well by the son o neptune gasped captain jerry got a real generwine crew aint i all right my hearties ill set ye to work fast enough and then followed a string of orders in true nautical style and the rover boys flew in one direction and another to execute them up went the mainsail and the jib and the topsail followed and soon the old glory was standing off into santa barbara channel with mrs stanhope in the carriage waving them an adieu and the girls and the boys waving their handkerchiefs in return  it certainly was a glorious day as dora had said and after the sails were set there was nothing to do but to take it easy on the cushions of the rail seats captain jerry was at the wheel but he promised to let each of them take a trick in his place before the trip should come to an end  i jest wish we had another yacht to race with said the old sailor then i could show ye what sort o a clean pair o heels the old glory could show the other craft  it is easy to see the yacht is speedy replied dick she cuts the water like a thing of life and you know just how to get her best speed out of her he went on a remark that pleased old jerry very much  will we have more breeze do you think asked tom later on as he observed some in clouds to the westward  cant say as to that lad those clouds may come this way and they may blow northard if they come down here well catch it putty lively  i like a good stiff breeze came from sam  oh dont run us into a storm cried grace in alarm we might all get seasick  dont be alarmed said dick we are a very long way from a storm to my way of thinking  the morning passed quickly enough and at noon they ran into a small harbor on one of the islands and had dinner in true picnic style at one oclock they packed up once more went on board of the old glory and stood off to the westward for all wanted a run right on the ocean as tom expressed it  captain jerry was just a bit doubtful of the trip for the clouds in the western sky had grown considerably larger than when first noticed not that he did not think the yacht could weather a blow but he was afraid the young ladies would get seasick however as he did not wish to put a damper on their fun he said nothing resolved to turn back at the first sign of any inward upsettin as he expressed it  the breeze had increased and as it was directly from off shore the old glory bowled along merrily over the waves nobody showed the least sign of seasickness and they talked laughed and sang as if they had not a care in the world tom also did some fishing and caught a string of the finny tribe of which he was justly proud  you can bake them for us when we get back he said to nellie and then we can all have a fish party  i could go on sailing like this for a week said dick to dora as they moved forward i mean if you were along with me he added in a lower tone and she gave him a look that meant a good deal  when three oclock came captain jerry announced that they must turn back they were far out of sight of land with nothing but the blue ocean around them overhead the sky was still clear but the clouds on the horizon were rapidly increasing  oh let us keep on a while longer pleaded tom this is just glorious and the others said the same  so they kept on although somewhat against captain jerrys better judgment the old sailor was watching the clouds presently there came an extra heavy puff of wind and then the clouds seemed to rush up with lightninglike rapidity  got to go back now said the sailor going to have a big blow afore night and he threw over the tiller and gave the necessary commands to change the sails  by jove but those clouds are coming up fast exclaimed dick after a careful survey i ever saw them come up like that on the atlantic or on the great lakes  its unusual replied captain jerry with a shake of his head never seen it afore myself the wind is coming around too its goin to be a different storm from what we generally git around these waters  the black clouds soon obscured the sun and the wind began to blow stronger than ever sending the whitecaps rolling over the ocean and causing the spray to fly over the deck of the yacht nellie clutched tom by the arm  oh tom what does this mean she asked in a trembling voice  it means that we are going to have a storm thats all he answered as lightly as he could  butbut will it hurt us came from grace  i dont think so put in sam but we may get wet unless we go into the cabin  i vote the girls all go into the cabin said dick sam can go with them if he wants to tom you and i can stay on deck to look after the sails  im going to do my duty on deck too came from sam promptly  another rush of wind now sent the spray flying in all directions and to keep from being drenched the girls retired to the tiny cabin or rather cuddy of which the old glory boasted  i am sure it is going to be an awful storm said dora i wish we were safe on land once more  oh dear do you think well go to the bottom asked nellie  the boys wont let the yacht go down answered dora they are all good sailors and captain jerry must know all about handling this craft but we may have a very bad time of it before we get back to santa barbara  it was dark in the cabin but the yacht pitched and plunged so violently that they were afraid to light the lantern so they huddled together each holding anothers hand  on deck captain jerry gave orders to lower the topsail and haul in the jib several reefs were also taken in the mainsail and the boys stood ready to bring down the rest of the sheet with a rush at the first word from the old sailor  its a remarkable stormremarkable said captain jerry chewing vigorously on the quid of tobacco in his cheek aint never seen no sech storm here afore puts me in mind o a blow i stood out in onct off the coast o alaska when i was in a whaler thet storm caught us same time as this an ripped our mast out in a jiffy and drowned two o the sailors  i hope nothing like that happens to us said dick with a shudder he was not thinking of himself but of the three girls in the cabin  well lad it aint goin to be no easy blow i kin tell ye that responded captain jerry  soon the wind began to whistle shrilly through the air and the sky became so black they could scarcely see a hundred yards in any direction then came some distant flashes of lightning and rolling thunder and soon the patter of rain  now we are going to catch it said tom and he was right ten minutes later it was pouring in torrents and the rain continued to keep coming down as if there was to be no end of it  boys arent you most drowned asked nellie peeping out of the cabin door  no but youll be if you come out here called back tom  we cant stand up and we cant sit still came from grace  sorry but youll have to make the best of it answered sam  oh we wont mind if only we reach shore in safety put in dora and then the door was closed again  on and on swept the old glory through the wind the rain and the darkness as there was no land near captain jerry paid his whole attention to making the yacht ride easily an almost impossible task in such a sea as was now raging  suddenly from somewhere out of the air came a humming sound it grew louder and louder and the boys felt a strange suction of wind which made them hold tightly to the rail for fear of being pulled overboard by some uncanny force there followed a loud snap and a crash and the mast began to come down  look out for the mast screamed captain jerry and all jumped just in the nick of time down came the stick to strike the rail and shatter it like a pipe stem and then lay over the deck and over the waves beyond     chapter vi  adrift on the pacific ocean   the mast has gone by the board screamed dick on rising to his feet  that stick will turn the yacht over gasped tom  poor sam could not speak for a wave had struck him full in the mouth and he had all he could do to keep from being washed overboard  the girls in the cabin heard the crash above the roaring of the elements and let up a scream of alarm  are we going down  shall we come out on deck  stay where ye are shouted back captain jerry clinging to the wheel with a grip of steel then he turned to dick can ye git an ax and clear away the wreck  ill try it replied the eldest rover and he moved cautiously to where an ax rested in a holder soon he had the article in hand and was chopping away as fast as he could while tom holding to the bottom of the mast with one hand held dick with the other sam in the meantime cut away some cordage with a hatchet which was handy  it was truly a perilous moment and it looked as if the mighty waves would swamp the old glory before the wreckage could be cleared away the girls stood at a cabin window watching the work and ready to leap out if the yacht should start to go down  there it goes cried dick at last and gave another stroke with the ax there followed a snap and a crack and overboard slid the broken mast carrying a mass of cordage with it  at once the old glory righted herself sending a small sheet of water flowing from one side of the deck to the other some of the water swept into the cabin and the girls were alarmed more than ever  a good job done that its overboard said captain jerry another plunge or two and we would have gone over sure pop  with the wreckage cleared away the boys breathed more freely but the peril was still extreme for it was no easy matter to keep the craft from taking the mighty waves broadside but the force of the wind drove them on and captain jerry handled the wheel as only a veteran tar could  i guess its a hurricane was toms comment  looks more like a cyclone to me spluttered sam id give a good deal to be out of it  to keep from being swamped they had to run out to sea this was no pleasant prospect to the boys but it could not be helped  we neednt tell the girls said dick it will only worry them more without doing any good  two hours went by and the storm kept on as madly as ever night was now coming on and soon it was impossible to see a hundred feet in any direction the yachts lanterns were lit and one was hoisted on a stick which dick nailed to the stump of the mast  weve got to have some sort o light said captain jerry if not we may run afoul o some other craft  the time went by slowly each hour seeming an age nobody felt like eating and nothing was said about supper until nearly nine oclock when dora opened the cabin door and called dick  we thought we would get to shore before eating she said how much longer will we be out do you think  there is no telling dora he replied evasively  no telling doesnt captain jerry know where we are  hardly you see it is so dark and we cant make any headway with the mast gone  how stupid of me i should have known that shall we try to fix up some supper  you might pass some sandwiches but no we had better come down one at a time returned dick  this suggestion was carried out captain jerry being the last to go down leaving the wheel in the hands of dick and tom  dont ye let it git away from ye was his caution if ye do it will be goodby liza jane an all of us goin slam bang to davy jones locker  from old jerry the girls learned that they would probably have to remain on the yacht all night  dont ye git alarmed he said the storms goin down an well come out all right when the sun rises  the prospect of remaining on the ocean all night was dismaying and all of the girls wondered what mrs stanhope would say when they did not return  i know mother will be very much worried said dora soberly  it was decided by the boys that they should take turns at lying down each being given two hours in which to rest sam was the first to turn in but it is doubtful if he slept to any extent tom followed and then came dick captain jerry declined stating he could sleep when he had the party safe on shore once more  by morning the storm had taken another turn it no longer rained but the sky was murky and there was a dense fog which the wind blew first in one direction and then another they were still running to sea with small prospect of being able to turn back  this is certainly more than i bargained for observed dick to tom in a low voice to me it looks mighty serious  oh the storm is bound to go down  yes tom but how long do you suppose the provisions and water will last  at this question toms face fell  i hadnt thought of that dick i dont suppose we have more than enough for today have we  well we might make it last two days on a pinchwe brought quite a lot along but after that  do you think well have to stay out here more than two days demanded sam  i dont know what to think sam  cant we rig up some sort of a jurymast  captain jerry mentioned that well try  there was no stick on board of the  old glory outside of the bowsprit and at last they decided to saw this off and put it up as a small mast  the task was no easy one and just as the temporary mast was being fitted into place there came an extra heavy puff of wind which sent the yacht far over on her side  hold fast all of ye roared captain jerry and they obeyed and the stick went rolling over the side and out of sight in the billows  gone gasped tom that ends putting up another mast  slowly the day wore along the girls were silent and if the truth be told more than one tear was shed between them although before the boys they tried to put on a brave face there were no regular meals and by the advice of captain jerry and dick they were sparing of the provisions and the water  our only hope now is for the storm to go down or else to sight some passing ship said dick getting back to santa barbara at present is out of the question for all we know we may be a hundred or two hundred miles from the coast  about two oclock in the afternoon the sky cleared a little but as the fog lifted the wind blew with greater force sending them reeling and plunging into the mighty waves  it looks as if we should be swamped after all said tom dolefully  never say die tom came from sam resolutely  i suppose mrs stanhope will be worried half to death  no doubt of it  nobody had any heart to talk and each watched eagerly for some sign of a sail tom had a spyglass and just before sunset he let out a shout  a ship a ship  where came from the others  off in that direction and tom pointed with his hand  all took a look through the glass and saw that he was right there was a steamer approaching  if only they see us said dick and his brothers nodded  the girls had heard the cry and now came on deck to learn what it meant  oh i hope they take us on board and back home said nellie i must say i am heartily tired of this yacht  the wind was increasing and the girls had to go back to the cabin to keep from getting wet the boys put up a flag upside down on a piece of planking and waited eagerly for the steamer to come nearer  the yacht is settling cried dick a little while later dont you notice it  the old glory has sprung some leaks responded captain jerry sadly take the wheel while i go and look them over  tom and sam took the wheel while old jerry and dick inspected the leaks they soon reported that two seams had opened at the bow and that there was a bad break at the stern which was bound soon to interfere with the rudder  i believe that steamer is going to leave us cried sam a little while later  oh dont say that said dick we must signal her somehow  well fire some rockets said captain jerry  this was done and a little later they saw that the steamer was heading in their direction by this time the old glory showed unmistakable signs of being on the point of foundering and the girls were told to come on deck everybody was given a life preserver which had been kept close at hand since the beginning of the trouble  we are seen cried sam joyously as a signal came from the steamer  gradually the strange vessel drew closer and they saw that she was a rather clumsy affair of the tramp pattern used to carry all sorts of cargoes from one port to another  they are lowering a small boat said sam a little later  i wish they would hurry returned tom in a low voice i believe this yacht is going to go down very soon  at last the small boat was close enough to be hailed and preparations were made for transferring the girls first  it was no easy matter to make the change and it took a good quarter of an hour to land the girls on the steamers deck  by this time the old glory was completely waterlogged  we have got to jump for it lads cried captain jerry unless you want to go down with her  and jump they did into the mighty waves and none too soon for a minute later the yacht went down out of their sight forever  the small boat was not far away and soon sam and tom were picked up to get dick and captain jerry was not so easy but the task was finally accomplished and soon all of our friends stood on the deck of the tramp steamer safe and sound once more     chapter vii  dismaying news   thank fortune we got away from the yacht just in time exclaimed tom as he shook the water from his clothes  im sorry to see the old glory go said captain jerry sadly i thought a heap o that craft i did it will be sorry news to take back to master bob  never mind well help pay for the loss put in dick  where are you folks from questioned the captain of the steamer as he came up to the crowd  we came from santa barbara the storm took our mast and blew us out to sea answered dick we owe you something for picking us up  youre welcome for what ive done answered captain fairleigh come with me and ill try to get you some dry clothing i can trick out the men folks and the young ladies will have to see my wife who happens to be with me on this trip  what steamer is this asked tom  the tacoma lad  are you bound for san francisco questioned sam  no we are bound for honolulu on the hawaiian islands  honolulu burst out the others  do you mean to say that the first port you will make will be honolulu demanded dick  thats my orders lad i must get there just as quick as i can too for a cargo of sugar  but we dont want to go to the hawaiian islands put in dora mercy its two thousand miles away  at this captain fairleigh shrugged his broad shoulders  i am sorry for you but i cant put back miss perhaps well meet some vessel bound for some port in the united states if so i can ask the captain to take you back  and if you dont meet any vessel came from grace  oh i think well pass some vessel returned the captain  he took the girls and introduced them to his wife and then turned the boys and old jerry over to the first mate who obtained for them some dry clothing after this all were provided with a hot supper which did much toward making them comfortable at least physically speaking  but not one of them was comfortable mentally to be carried to the hawaiian islands two thousand miles away was no pleasant thought besides what would their folks think of their prolonged absence  mother will think that we have all been drowned said dora  and that is what our folks will think too said nellie oh it is terrible simply terrible and she wrung her little hands  by making inquiries dick learned that the steamer was expected to reach honolulu inside of two weeks if the weather was not too bad from honolulu they could get passage to san francisco on the mail steamer the trip lasting exactly seven days  well have to get some money first said tom and we cant cable for it either he went on for the cable to the hawaiian islands from the united states had not yet been laid  let us hope that we will see some ship that will take us back said sam  day after day they watched eagerly for a passing sail but though they sighted four vessels and hailed them not one was bound for the united states outside of a whaler and that craft intended to stay out at least three months longer before making for port  we are booked for this trip and no mistake sighed tom well since that is so let us make the best of it  the tacoma was heavily laden and though the storm cleared away and the pacific ocean became moderately calm she made but slow progress  our boilers are not in the best of condition said captain fairleigh  i trust there is no danger of their blowing up returned dick  not if we dont force them too much  it had been arranged that the boys and girls should pay a fair price for the trip to honolulu the money to be sent to the captain of the tacoma later on as for old jerry he signed articles to work his passage to the hawaiian islands and back again as captain fairleigh was rather short of hands he was glad to have the old sailor join his crew  the days slipped by and having recovered from the effects of the storm the rover boys became as light hearted as ever tom was particularly full of pranks  no use of crying over spilt milk he declared let us be thankful the pitcher wasnt broken or in other words that we are not at this moment at the bottom of the pacific  right you are replied sam  there was an old piano on board and the boys and girls often amused themselves at this singing and playing as there were no other passengers they had the freedom of the ship  this would be real jolly said tom if it wasnt that the folks at home must be worried and then he began to sing for he really could not be sad  a life on the ocean wave   a home on the rolling deep a house in a watery cave   where i might rest in sleep  did you ever hear such a song cried nellie and tom went on  the boy stood on the burning deck   munching apples by the peck the captain yelled he stood stockstill   for of those apples he wanted his fill  tom rover burst out dora i believe you would sing at your own funeral and tom continued gayly  sailing sailing over the bounding main   for many a stormy wind shall blow ere the rovers get home again  tom lives on songs said sam slyly hed rather sing than eat a pie  pie thundered tom tragically who said pie i havent seen a homemade pie sincesince  the time you went down in the pantry at midnight and ate two finished dick and then there was a burst of laughter  never mind tom ill make you half a dozen pieswhen we get home came from nellie  will you really said tom and then he began once more as gayly as ever  you can give me pudding and give me cake and anything else you care to bake but if you wish to charm my eye just hand me over some homemade pie  thats all right said dick but in place of eye you should have said stomach  stomach doesnt rhyme with pie snorted tom im a true poet and i know what i am doing  talking about pie makes me think of pieplates said sam let us play spinning the plate on deck it will be lots of fun trying to catch the plate while it is spinning and the steamer is rolling  good cried grace and ran to get a plate from the cooks galley soon they were playing merrily and the game served to make an hour pass pleasantly when the forfeits had to be redeemed the girls made the boys do several ridiculous things tom had to hop from one end of the deck to the other on one foot sam had to stand on his head and recite mary had a little lamb and dick had to go to three of the sailors and ask each if they would tie the ship to a post during the night  ill wager you are a merry crowd on land said captain fairleigh as he paused to watch the fun takes me back to the time when i was a boy and he laughed heartily even the captains wife was amused she was particularly fond of music and loved to listen to the playing and singing  the days slipped by one after the other until captain fairleigh announced that fortyeight hours more ought to bring them in sight of diamond head a high hill at the entrance to honolulu harbor  but another storm was at hand and that night the wind blew more fiercely than ever the tacoma tossed and pitched to such a degree that standing on the deck was next to impossible and all of the boys and the girls gathered in the cabin and held fast to the posts and the stationary seats  it feels as if the steamer would roll clear over said sam here we go again  there was thunder and lightning and soon a deluge of rain fully as heavy as that experienced while on board of the illfated old glory this continued all of the night and in the morning the storm seemed to grow worse instead of better  we are in a run of bad luck said dick i really believe we will have all sorts of trouble before we get back to the united states  toward noon a mist came up and it grew dark lanterns were lit and the tacoma felt her way along carefully for captain fairleigh knew that they were now in the track of considerable shipping  by nightfall the steamer lay almost at a standstill for the mist was thicker than ever for safety the whistle was sounded at short intervals  the girls were the first to retire and the boys followed half an hour later the staterooms of all were close together  dick rover was the last to go to sleep how long he slept he did not know  he awoke with a start a shock had thrown him to the floor of the stateroom and down came sam on top of him there were hoarse cries from the deck a shrill steam whistle and the sound of a fog horn and then a grinding thud and a bump that told the tacoma had either run into some other ship or into the rocks     chapter viii  from one ship to another   we struck something  what is the matter  are we going down  these and a score of other cries rang out on board the steamer the thumping and bumping continued followed by a crashing that could mean but one thingthat the ship was being splintered and that her seams were being laid wide open  as soon as possible the rover boys slipped into some clothing and went on deck they were quickly followed by the three girls who clung tight to them in terror  oh dick this is the worst yet came from dora what will be the end  the tacoma is sinking was the cry from out of the darkness  are we really sinking gasped nellie as she clutched tom  yes we are came from sam cant you feel the deck settling  they could only too plainly and in a minute more the water seemed to be running all around them the cries continued but it was so black they could see next to nothing  what happened in the next few minutes the rover boys could scarcely tell afterward an effort was made to get out a lifeboat and it disappeared almost as soon as it left the side carrying some sailors with it then some redfire blazed up lighting up the tragic scene and revealing a schooner standing close by the steamer the sailing vessel had her bowsprit broken and part of her forward rail torn away  if we must die let us die together said dick and they kept together as well as they could old jerry was with them and said he would do all he could for them he had already passed around lifepreservers and these they put on with all possible speed  then followed a sudden plunge of the steamer and all found themselves in the waves of the ocean they went down together each holding the hand of somebody else when they came up tom was close to a lifeline thrown from the sailing vessel and this he clutched madly  haul us in he yelled haul us in and the line was pulled in with care and after ten minutes of extreme peril the boys and the girls and captain jerry found themselves on board of the sailing vessel which proved to be a large threemasted schooner  all of our friends were so exhausted that they had to be carried to the cabin and here dora and grace fainted away completely while nellie was little better off tom had had his left arm bruised and dick was suffering from an ugly scratch on the forehead it was fully an hour before any of them felt like moving around  in the meantime the two vessels had separated and though red fire was burned twice after that and rockets sent up nothing more was seen or heard of the tacoma or those left on board  but i dont think she went down said captain jerry she was too well built for that and he was right as events proved much crippled the steamer two days later entered honolulu harbor where she was laid up for repairs  worn out completely by what they had passed through the boys slept heavily for the rest of the night not caring what ship they were on or where they were going everybody was busy with the wreckage so they were left almost entirely to themselves  tom was the first to get up and going on deck found that the storm had cleared away and that the sun was shining brightly without delay he halted a sailor who happened to be passing  what ship is this he questioned  dis ship da golden wave replied the sailor who was a norwegian  and where are you bound  da ship sail for australia  great scott australia gasped tom this is the worst yet  whats up tom asked sam who had followed his brother  this sailor tells me this ship is bound for australia  why that is thousands of miles away  i know it  if we go to australia well never get back  not quite as bad as that sam but we certainly dont want to go to australia  who is the captain  captain blossom replied the sailor where is he  the sailor said he would take them to the captain and did so he proved to be a burly fellow with rather a soberlooking face  got around at last eh he said eying tom and sam shrewdly  we have and we must thank you for rescuing us replied tom  thats all right  one of your sailors tells me you are bound for australia put in sam  he told you the truth  wont you stop at some port in the hawaiian islands  no  but you might put us off  cant spare the time as it is this storm blew me away out of my course answered captain blossom  he had a twofold reason for not putting them ashore at or near honolulu it would not only take time but it might also lead to questioning concerning the fate of the steamer and he was afraid he would be hauled into some marine court for running into the tacoma for that was what he had done  do you know anything about the steamer asked sam  no she got away from us in the darkness after we hauled seven of you aboard  the steamer lost some of her crew said tom shuddering did you lose any men  one sailor and one of my passengers got hurt in the leg by the collision  by this time dick joined the party followed by old jerry and the three girls  will the captain carry us away to australia asked dora when the situation was explained  i suppose so said dick soberly if i had some money i might buy him off but i havent a dollar what little i did have i left on board of the tacoma  the others were equally destitute and when captain blossom heard of this his face grew dark he was a close man and his first mate jack lesher was no better  if you havent any money youll have to work your passage he growled i cant afford to carry you to australia for nothing  then let us off at some port in the hawaiian islands said tom  cant do it i told you retorted captain blossom angrily and youll either work while you are on board or starve  my what a tarter whispered sam  well well work said dick but you must not force the young ladies to do anything  im a sailor and will do my full share said old jerry but he did not like the situation any better than did the rovers  the matter was talked over and seeing that they were willing to work captain blossom became a little milder in his manner he said he would give the three girls one of the staterooms but the boys and old jerry would have to join the crew in the forecastle  fortunately the sailors on board the golden wave were a fairly clean lot so the forecastle was not so dirty a place as it might otherwise have been the boys did not like to be separated from the girls however and dick called the girls aside to talk the matter over  i want to know if anything goes wrong said he if there is the least thing out of the way let us know at once and the girls promised to keep their eyes open  once in the forecastle the boys were given three rough suits of clothes to wear while working then they were called out to work without delay for the storm had left much to do on board the golden wave  we have only one passenger said one of the sailors in reply to a question from tom he is a young fellow named robert brown he was hurt during the storm but i reckon hes all right now  tom was set to coiling some rope and sam and dick had to scrub down the deck this was by no means an agreeable task but nobody complained  we must take what comes said dick cheerfully so long as we get enough to eat and are not abused i shant say a word  the boys had been to work about an hour when sam saw a young fellow limping around the other end of the deck there was something strangely familiar about the party and the youngest rover drew closer to get a better look at him  dan baxter he cried in astonishment dan baxter  at this cry the person turned and his lower jaw dropped in equal astonishment  whoerwhere did you come from he stammered  so this is the vessel you shipped on went on sam and then he called out dick tom come here  for a brief instant dan baxters face was a study then a crafty look came into his eyes and he drew himself up  excuse me but you have made a mistake in your man he said coldly  whats that came from sam in bewilderment  i am not the party you just named my name is robert brown  it is came from the youngest rover if that is so you look exactly like somebody i know well  by this time dick and tom came hurrying to the spot followed by dora who happened to be on deck  dan baxter came from tom and dick simultaneously  he says he isnt dan baxter said sam  isnt dan baxter why baxter you fraud what new wrinkle is this said dick catching him by the arm  let go of me came fiercely from baxter let go i say or it will be the worse for you you have made a mistake  no mistake about it put in tom he is dan baxter beyond a doubt     chapter ix  in which the enemy is cornered   the loud talking had attracted the attention of captain blossom and now the master of the golden wave strode up to the crowd  whats going on here he demanded of the rover boys why are you not at work as i ordered  i have made an important discovery answered dick is this your passenger captain blossom  he is what of him  he is a thief and ran away from san francisco to escape the police  its a falsehood roared dan baxter they have made a mistake i am a respectable man just out of college and my father doctor l z brown is a wellknown physician of los angeles i am traveling to australia for my health  his real name is daniel baxter and his father is now in prison said tom he robbed us of our money and some diamonds while we were stopping at a hotel in san francisco the detectives followed him up but he slipped them by taking passage on your ship  i tell you my name is brownrobert brown stormed baxter this is some plot hatched up against me who are these fellows anyway he went on turning to the captain  they came from the steamer we ran into answered captain blossom  i never saw them before  at this moment dora touched the captain on the shoulder  please captain she said i knew dan baxter quite well and i am sure this young man is the same person  it aint so i tell you captain it is a plot  what kind of a plot could it be asked captain blossom he scarcely knew what to say  i dont know perhaps they want to get hold of my money went on baxter struck by a sudden idea  thats right we do want to get hold of the money cried sam for it belongs to usat least two hundred and seventyfive dollars of itnot counting what he may have got on the diamonds and the cuff buttons  you shant touch my money screamed baxter  captain he ought to be placed under arrest said dick  dora had gone back to the cabin and now she returned in great haste with nellie and grace  to be sure that is dan baxter said nellie  there can be no mistake put in grace we all know him only too well  you see captain blossom that we are six to one said tom and you will surely believe the ladies  how is you all happen to know him so well demanded the captain curiously  we know him because we all went to school together answered dick these young ladies lived in the vicinity of the school we had trouble with baxter at school and later on out west and ever since that time he has been trying to injure us we met him in san francisco in the hotel lobby and at night he went to our room cut open a traveling bag and unlocked our trunks and robbed us of two hundred and seventyfive dollars in cash some diamond studs a pair of cuff buttons and some clothing  ive got an idea almost shouted sam maybe he has some of the stolen stuff in his stateroom  yes yes let us search the stateroom by all means exclaimed tom  you shall not touch my room howled baxter turning pale i have nothing there but my own private property  if that is so you shouldnt object to having the stateroom searched observed captain blossom  if we get back our money we may be able to pay you something captain for our passage said dick  this was a forceful argument and set captain blossom to thinking he was a man who loved money dearly  i will go along and we will look around the stateroom he said after a pause  this is an outrage cried dan baxter i will have the law on you for it  shut up i am master on my own ship retorted captain blossom and led the way to the stateroom dan baxter occupied the door was locked and baxter refused to give up the key but the captain had a duplicate and soon he and the rover boys were inside the room baxter followed them still expostulating but in vain  here is a pocketbook full of bills cried tom bringing the article to light  here is my light overcoat came from dick see it has my initials embroidered in the hanger aunt martha did that for me  here are my gold cuff buttons exclaimed sam they were a present from my father and they have my monogram engraved on each and he showed the articles to the captain  i reckon its a pretty clear case against you said captain blossom turning to dan baxter  here are half a dozen letters said tom holding them up you can see they are all addressed to daniel baxter thats his name and hed be a fool to deny it any longer  well i wont deny it cried the big bully what would be the useyou are all against meeven the captain  i am not against you retorted captain blossom but if you are a thief i want to know it why did you give me your name as robert brown  thats my business baxter paused for a moment now you have found me out what are you going to do about it he went on brazenly you cant arrest me on shipboard  no but we can have you arrested when we land said dick and in the meantime we will take charge of what is our own  here are some pawn tickets for the diamonds said sam who was continuing the search they show he got seventyfive dollars on them  we will keep the ticketsand the seventyfive dollars tooif we can find the money said tom  but the money could not be found for the greater part had been turned over to captain blossom for baxters passage to australia and the rest spent before leaving shore the pocketbook contained only two hundred and thirty dollars  what did he pay you for the passage questioned dick of the captain  one hundred dollars  then you ought to turn that amount over to our credit  why what do you mean  i mean that dan baxter has no right to a free passage on your ship since he bought that passage with our money let him work his way and place that passage money to our credit  thats the way to talk put in tom make him work by all means  he deserves good hard labor came from sam  i dont think you can make me work burst out dan baxter i am a passenger and i demand that i be treated as such  you are an impostor returned captain blossom bluntly the fact that you used an assumed name proves it if i wanted to do so i could clap you in the ships brig until we reach port and chain you into the bargain i want no thieves on board my ship  here is more of our clothing came from tom  pick out all the things that are yours said the captain and take the other things that are yours too  this was done nobody paying any attention to baxters protests when the rovers had what there was of their things the captain turned to the bully  ive made up my mind about you he said speaking with great deliberation i am master here and a judge and jury into the bargain you can take your choice either sign articles as a foremast hand for the balance of the trip or be locked up as a prisoner on prison rations  do you mean ththat gasped baxter turning pale  i do  but the passage money goes to the credit of these young fellows  its an outrage  no its simply justice to my way of thinking ill give you until tomorrow to make up your mind what you will do  this ended the talk with dan baxter the captain said he wanted to see the rover boys in the cabin and they followed him to that place  captain i feel i must thank you for your fair way of managing this affair said dick feeling that a few good words at this point would not go amiss i hope you treat baxter as he deserves  i will try to do right was captain blossoms answer but what i want to know now is what do you intend to do with that money it seems to me i should be paid something for keeping you on board  i have a proposition to make captain we will give you two hundred dollars if you will allow us to consider ourselves passengers and by us i mean the young ladies as well as ourselves  its not very much  if we pay you that amount it will leave us but thirty dollars hardly enough with which to cable home for more of course when we get our money in australia we will pay you whatever balance is due youand something besides for saving us  this pleased captain blossom and he said he would accept the offer the matter was discussed for half an hour and it was decided that the boys should have two staterooms the one occupied by baxter and another next to that given over to the girls  when dora nellie and grace heard of the new arrangement that had been made they were highly pleased  i didnt want to see you do the work of a common sailor said dora to dick  oh it wouldnt kill me he returned lightly even as it is ill give a hand if it is necessary  its a wonder captain blossom took to your offer so quickly  he loves money thats why dora he would rather have that two hundred dollars than our services and with this remark dick hit the nail squarely on the head     chapter x  a blow in the darkness   it would be hard to describe dan baxters feelings after captain blossom and the rover boys left him alone in his stateroom at one instant he was fairly shaking with rage and at the next quaking with fear over what the future might hold in store for him  they have got the best of me again he muttered clenching his fists and after i felt sure i had escaped them it must have been fate that made captain blossom pick them up now ive either got to work as a common sailor or submit to being locked up in some dark foulsmelling hole on the ship and when we get to australia unless i watch my chance to skip out theyll turn me over to the police  he could not sleep that night for thinking over the situation and was up and dressed before daylight strolling on deck he came face to face with sam who had come up to get the morning air  i suppose you think you have got the best of me growled baxter  it looks like it doesnt it returned sam briefly  the game isnt ended yet  no but it will be when you land in prison baxter  ill get square  you have promised to get square times without numberand you have failed every time  i wont fail the next time  yes you will wrong never yet triumphed over right  oh dont preach sam rover  i am not preaching i am simply trying to show you how foolish it is to do wrong why dont you turn over a new leaf  oh such talk makes me sick growled the bully and turned away  a little while later captain blossom appeared and hunted up dan baxter who sat in his stateroom packing up his few belongings  well have you decided on your course young man demanded the master of the golden wave  do you mean to lock me up if i refuse to become a sailor asked dan baxter  i do and i wont argue with you either is it yes or no  i dont want to be locked up in some dark hole on your ship  then you are willing to become a sailor  ieri suppose so  very well you can remove your things to the forecastle jack lesher the first mate will give you your bunk  this was adding insult to injury as it is termed so far as baxter was concerned for it will be remembered that it was jack lesher who had obtained the passage on the golden wave for the bully  but dan baxter was given no chance to demur taking his traps he went on deck where jack lesher met him grinning in sickly fashion  so you are going to make a change eh said the mate  you neednt laugh at me if i am growled baxter  i shant laugh my boy its hard luck said lesher come along  he led the way to the forecastle and gave baxter a bunk next to that occupied by old jerry then he brought out an old suit of sailors clothing and tossed it over  youve run in hard luck boy he said in a low voice after he had made certain that nobody else was within hearing i am sorry for you  really queried dan baxter giving the mate a sharp look  yes i am and if i can do anything to make it easy for you count on me went on jack lesher  thank you  i suppose taking that money and the other things was more of boys sport than anything eh  thats the truth i wanted to get square with those rover boys they are my bitter enemies i didnt want the money  just then old jerry came in and the conversation came to an end but baxter felt that he had a friend on board and this eased him a little he did not know that the reason jack lesher liked him was because the first mate was a criminal himself and had once served a term in a michigan jail for knocking down a passenger on a boat and robbing him of his pocketbook as the old saying goes birds of a feather flock together  when the girls came on deck they found baxter doing some of the work which dick and tom had been doing the morning before at first they were inclined to laugh but dora stopped herself and her cousins  dont let us laugh at him she whispered it is hard enough for the poor fellow as it is  i am not going to notice him after this said nellie to me he shall be an entire stranger and the others agreed to treat dan baxter in the same manner  but the boys were not so considerate and tom laughed outright when he caught sight of baxter swabbing up some dirt on the rear deck this made the bullys passion arise on the instant and he caught up his bucket as if to throw it at toms head  dont you dare baxter cried tom if you do well have a redhot war  i can lick you tom rover  perhaps you can and perhaps you cant  baxter put up his fists but on the approach of dick and sam he promptly retreated but before he went he hissed in toms ear  you wait and see what i do  he had better keep his distance said dick if he doesnt somebody will get hurt  i suppose it galls him to work said sam he always was rather lazy  the day proved a nice one and the rover boys spent most of the time with the three girls who were glad of their company once more  all speculated on the question of what had become of the tacoma and of what the folks at home would think concerning their prolonged absence  id give a good deal to send a message home said dick  we must cable as soon as we reach shore added dora  they saw but little of dan baxter during the day and nothing whatever of him the day following  he is trying to avoid us said sam well i am just as well satisfied  through old jerry they learned that baxter hated the work given to him and that he was being favored a little by the first mate  tell ye what i hate that mate said jerry hes got a wicked eye and he drinks like a fish  i know he drinks answered tom i smelt the liquor in his breath  they were now getting down into warmer latitudes and the next night proved unusually hot it was dark with no stars shining and the air was close as if another storm was at hand  i cant sleep said tom after rolling around in his berth for half an hour im going on deck and he dressed himself and went up for some air he walked forward and leaned over the rail watching the waves as they slipped behind the noble ship  toms coming on deck had been noticed by dan baxter who sat on the side of the forecastle meditating on his troubles as the bully saw the youth leaning over the rail his face took on a look of bitter hatred  ill teach him to laugh at me he muttered  gazing around he saw that nobody was within sight and then he arose to his feet with a catlike tread he came up behind tom who still looked at the waves totally unconscious of danger  baxters heart beat so loudly that he was afraid tom would hear it again he looked around not a soul was near and the gloom of the night was growing thicker  hell laugh another way soon he muttered and stepped closer  his fist was raised to deliver a blow when tom happened to straighten up and look around he saw the form behind him and the upraised arm and leaped aside  the blow missed its mark and tom caught baxter by the shoulder  what do you mean dan baxter by this attack he began when the bully aimed another blow at him this struck tom full in the temple and partly dazed him then the two clenched awl fell heavily against the rail  ill fix you panted baxter striking another blow as best he could and then as tom struck him in return he forced toms head against the rail with a thump the blow made tom see stars and he was more dazed than ever  lelet up he gasped but baxter continued to crowd him against the rail which at this point was very weak because of the collision with the steamer suddenly there was a snap and a crack and the rail gave way baxter leaped back in time to save himself from falling but tom could not help himself and with a wild cry he went overboard     chapter xi  a call from the stern   for the instant after tom slipped over the side of the golden wave dan baxter was too dazed to do more than stare at the spot where he had last seen the boy with whom he had been struggling  gone he muttered presently gone he repeated and crouched back in the darkness  the great beads of perspiration came to his brow as he heard rapid footsteps approaching would he be accused of sending tom rover to his death  whats the trouble came in the voice of captain blossom  instead of answering dan baxter crept still further back then watching his chance he darted into the forecastle  hullo the rail is broken he heard the captain exclaim bring a lantern here quick  a sailor came running with a lantern which lit up the narrow circle of the deck near the rail and part of the sea beyond  somebody gave a cry said the captain to those who began to gather looks to me as if the rail gave way and let somebody overboard  tom rover was on deck came from old jerry do you reckon as how it was him  i dont know it was somebody thats certain call all hands at once  this was done and dan baxter had to come out with the rest he was pale and trembled so he could scarcely stand  all here said captain blossom must have been one of the rover boys or one of the young ladies  word was passed along and soon sam and dick came rushing on deck  tom is missing cried sam  if that is so im afraid boys you have seen the last of your brother said captain blossom he turned to his crew do any of you know anything of this affair  there was a dead silence then he questioned the man at the wheel  dont know a thing capn was the answer  its queer he must have pressed on the rail very hard here are half a dozen nails torn from the wood  while this talk was going on dick and sam had passed along the rail from the place of the accident to the stern  perhaps he caught hold somewhere said sam who was unwilling to believe that his brother had really perished  they had just gained the stern and were looking over when a call came from out of the darkness  hehelp help  its tom screamed dick in delight tom is that you  yes help  where are you  holding on to a rope help me quick ii cant hold on mumuch longer  well help you answered dick  captain blossom was called and more lanterns were lit and then a bengal light and tom was seen to be holding fast to a rope which had in some manner fallen overboard and become entangled in the rudder chain  by the aid of the boathook the rope was hauled up and to the side of the golden wave at the same time the sails were lowered and then a rope ladder was thrown down dick descended to the edge of the waves and watching his chance caught tom by the collar of his coat then the brothers came slowly to the deck  a cheer went up when it was found that tom was safe once more and nellie laning could not resist rushing forward and catching the wet youth in her arms tom was so exhausted he dropped on the nearest seat and it was several minutes before he had recovered strength enough to speak  i would have been drowned had it not been for that rope he said when questioned as i slid along the side of the ship the rope hit me in the face i clutched it and clung fast for dear life then when i came up and swept astern i called as loudly as i could but it seemed an age before anybody heard me  it was a narrow escape said dick you can thank a kind providence that your life was spared  you must have leaned on the rail awfully hard put in nellie  leaned on the rail repeated tom it wasnt my fault that i went overboard it was dan baxters  dan baxter came from several  exactly he tackled me in the dark and we had it hot and heavy for a minute then he crowded me on the rail and it gave way he jumped back and let me go overboard  the rascal ill settle with him cried dick ill teach him to keep his distance after this  he knew baxter was still forward and ran in that direction the bully saw him coming and tried to hide in the forecastle but dick was too quick for him and hauled him back on the deck  take that for shoving my brother overboard you scoundrel he exclaimed and hit baxter a staggering blow straight between the eyes  stop roared the bully and struck out in return but dick dodged the blow and then hit baxter in the chin and on the nose the elder rover boy was excited and hit with all of his force and the bully measured his length on the deck  good fer you cried old jerry who stood looking on thats the way to serve him the sarpint  slowly baxter arose to his knees and then his feet where he stood glaring at dick  dont you hit me again he muttered  but i will retorted dick and struck out once more this time his fist landed on the bullys left eye and once again baxter went down this time with a thud  the sailors were collecting and soon jack lesher rushed up he stepped between dick and the bully  stop it he ordered harshly we dont allow fighting on board of this craft  i wasnt fighting answered dick coolly i was just teaching a rascal a lesson  it amounts to the same thing if you have any fault to find tell the captain or tell me  well ill go to the captain not you retorted dick  all right growled the first mate but just remember you cant boss things when im around  when captain blossom understood the situation he was thoroughly angry  baxter certainly ought to be in prison he said ill clap him in the brig and feed him on bread and water for three days and see how he likes that  he ought not to be left at large said dora with a shudder he may try to murder somebody next  well watch him after this said the captain  he kept his word about putting baxter in the ships jail but through lesher the bully got much better fare than bread and water strange as it may seem a warm friendship sprang up between the bully and the first mate  i aint got nothing against you baxter said jack lesher when we get to australia perhaps we can work together eh and he closed one eye suggestively baxter had told him of his rich relative and the mate thought there might be a chance to get money from baxter hed rather give me money than have me tell his relation what sort of a duck he is said lesher to himself  after this incident the time passed pleasantly enough for over a week when baxter came from the brig he went to work without a word whenever he passed the rovers or the girls he acted as if he did not know they were there and they ignored him just as thoroughly but the boys watched every move the bully made  as mentioned before jack lesher was a drinking man and as the weather grew warmer the mate increased his potions until there was scarcely a day when he was thoroughly sober captain blossom remonstrated with him but this did little good  im attending to my duties said lesher and if i do that you cant expect more from me  i thought i hired a man that was sober said captain blossom i wont place my vessel in charge of a man who gets drunk  yet he was not willing to do the mates work or put that work onto others so jack lesher had to take his turn on deck no matter in what condition  i must say i dont like that first mate at all said tom to sam he is very friendly with baxter  i have noticed that replied the youngest rover such a friendship doesnt count in the mates favor  last night he was thoroughly drunk and wasnt fit to command  well that is captain blossoms lookout the captain cant be on deck all of the time  two nights after this talk jack lesher was again in command of the ship captain blossom having retired after an unusually hard day  it was hot and dark and the air betokened a storm the man at the wheel was following a course set by the captain and the sailors whose watch was on deck lay around taking it as easy as they could  the mate had been drinking but little in the afternoon but before coming on deck he took several draughts of rum he was in a partiallarly bad humor and ready to find fault with anybody or anything  some of the sails had been reefed and these he ordered shaken out although there was a stiff breeze blowing then he approached the man at the wheel and asked for the course  southwest by south was the answer  that aint right growled the mate it should be south by west  the captain gave it to me southwest by south answered the man  dont talk back to me roared jack lesher i know the course as well as the captain make it south by west or ill flog you for disobeying orders  aye aye sir answered the man at the wheel and the course was changed for the sailor stood greatly in fear of the mate then the mate sent below for another drink of rum     chapter xii  another accident at sea   it was four hours later and captain blossom was just preparing to come on deck when there came a fearful shock which threw the golden wave back and over on her side  we have struck we are on the rocks came a shrill cry from the deck and immediately there was an uproar  the rover boys were thrown to the floor from their berths and it was several seconds before they could realize what had happened  we have struck something that is sure gasped sam  as quickly as they could they donned their clothing and made their way to the large stateroom occupied by the girls  oh what a shock came from nellie  are you safe asked tom  i am but poor grace struck her head on the wall and is unconscious  without ceremony tom picked up the unconscious girl wrapped her in a blanket and aided by sam carried her to the deck the others following a minute later grace revived  on deck they found all in confusion the bowsprit of the golden wave was gone and also the main topmast while a mass of the rigging littered the forecastle it was also announced that the rudder was broken and the vessel was pounding helplessly on the rocks with a big hole in the bow directly below the waterline  who changed the course demanded captain blossom we should be fifty miles away from these rocks  the first mate made me change the course said the man who had been at the wheel i told him you had said southwest by south and he made it south by west  he dont know what hes talking about howled jack lesher the shock had partly sobered him he was steering due south and i told him to make it southwest by south  but little more could be said on the point for it was feared that the schooner would go down at any moment  we must man the boats said the captain bring up the provisions and the kegs of water and be quick about it  are we near land asked dick  there should be some islands four or five miles south of this spot answered captain blossom  now that there was danger of going down some of the sailors seemed to grow crazy half a dozen tumbled into one of the boats and began to lower it of their own accord  stand back there shouted the captain the girls must go first  not much shouted one of the sailors its everybody for himself now and in a moment more the small boat had left the ships side and disappeared in the darkness  there were three other boats and the remaining sailors along with the first mate and dan baxter wanted to crowd into these but captain blossom said he would shoot the first man who tried to row away without his orders then some provisions were put into the boats and the captain divided the whole company among the three boats  let us stay together captain pleaded dick we can row  and what of the girls rover  let us go with the rover boys pleaded dora and nellie and grace said the same old jerry also stood by his friends  while this talk was going on there was a rush for two of the boats and before captain blossom could do anything his men were off taking jack lesher and dan baxter with them  you can go down with the ship cried dan baxter mockingly an instant later the darkness hid the speaker from view  they have left us cried captain blossom but thank fortune the best and largest boat is also left  some provisions had been tumbled into this boat and a cask of water followed then the girls were placed on board the rover boys followed and the captain and old jerry came behind to cut away down went the small boat into the mighty waves and each of the boys caught up an oar  pull roared captain blossom pull for your lives and they did pull two boys on one side and sam and old jerry on the other the girls huddled in the stern expecting every moment to see the little craft turn bottom side up they scraped along the side of the doomed ship and then along some rocks captain blossom was in the bow peering ahead  to the left he yelled quick and then came a shock and the captain disappeared beneath the waves  the captain is gone screamed dora but she was hardly heard for the ship was pounding on the rocks and the spray was flying in all directions the boys and old jerry continued to pull knowing not what else to do and at last the spot was left behind and they found themselves on the bosom of the mighty pacific in the black darkness out of sight of everything with only the sounds of the wind and the waves filling their ears  do you think we will ever get out of this alive asked grace of dora  let us pray that we may all be spared answered dora and they did pray more earnestly than they had ever before prayed in their whole lives it was a moment that put their faith to a supreme test  the boys did not dare to stop rowing and they kept on until their backs ached and their arms seemed ready to drop from their sockets  we had better take turns said dick at last we cant keep this up all night and his suggestion was followed out two rowing at a time for a space of fifteen or twenty minutes  they thought they might see something of the other boats but nothing came to view and when they set up a shout at the top of their lungs no answer came back  they have either gone down or else got out of this neighborhood said tom  it was too bad to lose captain blossom said sam he was not such a bad sort after all  it was not long after this that a mass of wreckage drifted past them there was a bit of broken spar and some other woodwork but no human being and they let the wreckage go  by looking at his watch dick saw that it was three oclock in the morning  it will be light in another couple of hours he said if we can keep on top of the waves until then perhaps we can sight the islands the captain mentioned  i wish it was daylight now sighed nellie  fortunately a bundle of clothing had been brought along and as the water was warm nobody suffered much from the wetting received care was taken to keep the provisions as dry as possible for there was no telling how long it would be before they would be able to get more  slowly the night dragged by and with the coming of morning the wind went down the storm passing to the northward  it is growing lighter announced dora the sunlight is beginning to show over the rim of the sea  half an hour later the sun came up like a great ball of fire from a bath in the ocean capping the high waves with gold as the light spread around them dick stood up on a seat and gazed eagerly in all directions  what do you see demanded the others  nothing he answered with a sinking heart nothing but water on all sides of us  the islandsthey must be somewhere cried tom and he too took a look followed by the others the last to look was old jerry  cant see much said the old sailor slowly but i kind of reckon theres a dark spot directly southward  it must be one of the islands the captain mentioned exclaimed dora  we might as well row in that direction said dick there is nothing else to do  its queer what became of the other boats said sam  some of the provisions were brought forth and they ate sparingly and drank a little of the water then the boys and old jerry took up the oars once more and began to pull as nearly southward as they could make it steering by the sun  when the sun grew higher it became very warm so that the rowers were glad enough to lay aside their jackets by noon they reckoned that they had covered six or eight miles one after another stood up on the seats to take a look around  nothing in sight yet said dick with a sorry shake of his head we must have been mistaken in that dark spot  what will you do now asked grace the hot sun is beginning to make my head ache  sams head also ached but he said nothing nobody knew what to suggest  one thing is certain we cant remain out on the bosom of the ocean said dick  better continue to pull southward came from old jerry there are lots of islands down that way the map is full of em  yes the map is full of them answered dick but a quarter of an inch on the map means a hundred miles or two in reality  yet it was decided to row on trusting to luck to strike some island either large or small it was now fiercely hot and all hands perspired freely  by the end of the afternoon the boys were worn out and had to give up rowing the girls were dozing in the stern having covered their heads with a thin shawl stretched from one gunwale to another tom and sam were dizzy from the glare of the sun on the water  another day like this will set me crazy said the youngest rover id give ten dollars for a pair of blue goggles  old jerry had been looking intently to the westward now he pointed in that direction  see that trail of smoke he said unless i am mistaken a steamship is sailing toward us  a steamship cried tom and the words awoke the girls we must hail the vessel by all means  if she comes close enough said captain jerry pointedly dont be too hopeful my lads she may pass us by     chapter xiii  the crusoes of seven islands   all on board of the rowboat watched the thin trail of smoke with interest  i believe it is going away from us said dora  no it is coming closer said nellie  it is certainly moving to the northward put in sam  a quarter of an hour went by and the smoke came only a little nearer  she is a big steamer said captain jerry but she aint comin jest this way  you are sure cried tom  yes lad its too bad but it cant be helped  the old sailor was right half an hour later the smoke had shifted and after that it faded gradually from sight  it was a heavy blow after their expectations had been raised so high and tears stood in the eyes of all of the girls while the boys looked unusually sober  what was to do next all asked that question yet it was only captain jerry who answered it  let us pull southward said he  and they did so although with hearts that were as heavy as lead in their bosoms  slowly the night came on shortly after the sun set the moon showed itself and the sky became studded with stars the southern cross standing out boldly among them the pale light made the bosom of the ocean glisten like silver  a beautiful night said dora but who can enjoy it when we do not know what tomorrow will bring forth and she sighed deeply  the boys and old jerry continued to take turns at rowing while the girls sank into fitful slumber  presently the old sailor raised his head  listen he said and they did so and far away heard a strange booming  whats that questioned sam  its breakers cried tom we must be near some coast  the lad is right came from captain jerry we are near an island after all  dick stood on a seat and as the boat rode to the top of a wave took a look around  an island he cried dead ahead  hurrah we are saved ejaculated sam what is the matter questioned dora rousing up followed by the other girls  there is an island ahead  we must be careful how we approach the shore lads cautioned jerry if we strike the rocks it may cost us our lives perhaps we had better hold off until daylight  i see a stretch of sand came from tom who was standing up if we can reach that well be all right  old jerry took a careful look the sand was there true enough but there were dangerous breakers between the boat and that shore  if you say so we can run our chances he said the young ladies must hold tight and not mind a good ducking  the force of the waves was now carrying them closer and closer to the breakers under old jerrys directions the boys took a short sharp stroke keeping the rowboat straight up to the waves the noise was like thunder and soon the spray was flying all over them  now pull cried captain jerry one two three hold tight girls and away they went into the breakers one wave dashed over the craft but it was not swamped and before another could hit them they darted up a swell and onto a long sandy beach  in a twinkle the old sailor was out along with dick and aided by another wave they ran the boat well up the beach out of the harm of the waves it was a hard struggle and when it was over dick sank down almost exhausted  saved murmured dora as she leaped out on shore thank heaven and all of the others echoed the sentiment  the empty boat was pulled up out of harms way and chained fast to a palm tree growing near and then the party of seven sat down to rest and to talk over the new condition of affairs they were on a wild tropical coast with a long sandy beach running to the ocean and back of this a dense mass of tropical vegetation including palms plantains cocoanuts and date trees back of the heavy growth was a distant hill standing out dimly in the moonlight  this looks like a regular crusoelike island said dora as she gazed around there is not a sign of a habitation anywhere  a good many of the south sea islands are not inhabited said dick the natives wont live on them because they are subject to volcano eruptions earthquakes and tidal waves  well i hope we dont have any of those things while we stay here came from nellie an earthquake would scare me almost to death  i do not see that we can do better than to stay right here for the rest of the night said tom i am too tired out to walk very far  it was decided to follow toms advice and all made themselves as comfortable as circumstances permitted they had some matches in a waterproof safe and soon a campfire was started at which they dried some of their garments then after eating some of the provisions that were left they laid down to rest strange as it may seem all slept soundly until sunrise and nothing came to disturb them  when the girls arose they found the boys and captain jerry already preparing breakfast on the shore tom had found some oysters and shellfish and these were baking among the provisions were a little tea and coffee and old jerry had made a pot of coffee which did one good to smell sam had brought down some cocoanuts from a nearby tree and also found some ripe bananas  we wont starve to death here thats certain said dick when they all sat down to eat the island is full of good things if i had a gun i could bring down lots of birds and monkeys too  i dont think id care to eat a monkey said grace but i wouldnt mind eating birds  there must be plenty of fish here too said tom in fact i saw some sporting in the waters of a little bay up the coast  shall we go up and down the coast after breakfast asked sam  my advice is to climb yonder hill and take a squint around came from captain jerry  thats a splendid idea providing we can get to the tap said dick  there is no use of all of us going lad you can go with me while the rest stay here  what shall we do in the meantime asked sam  better try your hand at fishin lad and see if you can knock some birds over with sticks and stones if ye get anything let the girls cook us somethin for well be powerful hungry by the time we get back  half an hour later captain jerry and dick set out each carried a few ships biscuits and also a heavy stick which had been cut in the thickets each wished he had a gun or a pistol but those articles were not to be had  the climb up the hill was by no means an easy one the rocks were rough and in many spots the jungle of brush and vines was so thick that to get through was next to impossible it was very warm and they had to stop often to cool off and catch their breath  i dont wonder that people in hot countries move slowly said dick i feel more like resting than doing anything else  it was almost noon when they came in sight of the top of the hill there were still some rough rocks to climb and these they had to ascend by means of some vines that grew handy  what a magnificent view cried dick  it certainly was magnificent looking back in the direction they had come they could see the pacific ocean glittering in the bright sunlight and stretching miles and miles out of sight  the island they were on looked to be about half a mile in diameter northward eastward and westward was the ocean but to the southward was a circlet of six islands having a stretch of calm water between them between some of the islands the water was very shallow while elsewhere it looked deep  seven islands in all said old jerry and not a sign of a house or hut anywhere  we are the crusoes of seven islands said dick but do you really believe they are uninhabited  do ye see any signs of life lad  i must say i do not its queer too for i rather imagined one at least of the other boats had reached this place  i thought the same but it looks now as if they all went to davy joness locker eh  it certainly does look that way  from the top of the hill they took a careful survey of the situation the elevation was in the very center of the island down toward the other islands the slope was more abrupt than it was in the direction from which they had come  we can take a look at those other islands later on said old jerry reckon as how we have done enough for one day if we dont git back soon theyll become anxious about us  i wish we had a flag said dick here is a tall tree we could chop away the top branches and hang up a signal of distress if we did that perhaps some ship would come this way and rescue us  right ye are lad but it aint many ships come this way they are afraid o the rocks we run on  having looked around once more to git the lay o the land as captain jerry expressed it they started to descend the hill this proved as difficult as climbing up had been  dick went in advance and was halfway down when he stepped on a loose stick and went rolling into a perfect network of vines and brushwood  are ye hurt sang out old jerry  nonot much answered the eldest rover but my windoh goodness gracious  dick broke off short and small wonder as he arose from the hole into which he had tumbled a hissing sound caught his ears then up came the head of a snake at least eight feet long and in a twinkle the reptile had wound itself around the boys lower limbs     chapter xiv  settling down on the island   whats wrong lad  a snake it has wound itself around my legs  ye dont say gasped captain jerry and then leaped down to the hollow well by gosh take that ye beast  that was a blow aimed at the reptiles head with the sailors stick old jerrys aim was both swift and true and the head of the reptile received a blow which knocked out one eye and bruised its fang but the body wound itself around dick tighter than ever  fortunately the youth had not lost his wits completely and as the neck of the reptile came up he grasped it in his hand with the strongest grip he could command  cut itcut its head off he panted get your pocketknife  at once captain jerry dropped his stick and pulled out his jackknife a big affair such as many old sailors carry one pull opened the main blade and then old jerry started in to do as dick had suggested it was no easy job and the body of the snake squirmed and whipped in every direction lashing each on the neck and the cheek but the head came off at last and then they left the body where it fell and leaped out of the way of further danger  a close shave lad said the old sailor as he peered around for more snakes  ii should sasay it wawas panted dick he was deadly pale ii thought it would strangle me sure  if it had got around your neck that is what would have happened reckon as how we had better git out o this neighborhood eh  yes yes let us go at once and dick started off once more  after that both were very careful where they stepped and kept their eyes wide open for any new danger which might arise so they went on until they came in sight of the seashore  we had better say nothing about the snake said the eldest rover it will only scare the girls to death  no lad you are wrong we must warn them of danger otherwise they may run into it headlong  all of the others were glad to have them back and plied them with questions  so there are seven islands said tom well as there are seven of us that is one island apiece i dont think we need complain and his jolly manner made all laugh  when jerry told the story about the snake dora set up a scream  oh dick if it had really strangled you she gasped you must be very very careful in the future  yes and you must be careful too dora he answered  there is a nice beach right around the edge of the island said old jerry so when we want to visit the other islands we can walk around on the sand that is better than climbing the hill  but the beach doesnt run to the other islands does it asked sam  no but we can carry our rowboat around with us to that bay between the islands there the water is smooth enough for anybody to row in  the six islands are shaped exactly like a ring said dick and this island is the big stone on top  as the island is uninhabited i suppose well have to settle down and build ourselves huts or something came from nellie  to be sure well be regular robinson crusoes answered tom why i can tell you it will be jolly when we get used to it  where will we build our huts asked sam  we can build them here if we wish replied dick but i rather favor the side fronting the other islands  yes thats the best side said captain jerry if we build here a strong storm may knock our huts flat that side is more sheltered and consequently safer besides there is more fruit there and im sure better fishing in the bay and thats what counts too  of course it countssince we must live on fruits fish and what birds and animals we manage to knock over said tom  the boys had been fairly successful in hunting and fishing having knocked over half a dozen birds and caught four fairsized fish everything had been done to a turn over the campfire and dick and old jerry did full justice to what was set before themon some dried palm leaves nellie had found their coffee they drank out of some cocoanut shells they had no forks but used sharp sticks instead and the knives the boys carried in their pockets  the weather continued fine and that night the moon shone as brightly as ever the boys took a stroll on the beach to talk over their plans  i am sorry to say there is no telling how long we may have to stay here said dick it may be a day a week or for years  oh some ship is bound to pick us up some day returned tom and if we can find enough to live on in the meantime what is the use of complaining i am glad my life was spared  so am i tom  i would like to know what became of dan baxter put in sam can it be possible that all of the rest perished  certainly it is possible sam you know what a time we had of it  it is an awful death to diein the midst of the ocean and the youngest rover shuddered  i agree with you said tom but i am more sorry for captain blossom than for baxter  the wrecking of the ship was the fault of the mate he was drunk said dick the man at the wheel was doing what was right until jack lesher came along  well i guess the mate went down with the rest  look cried sam pointing to sea i see something dark on the water  all gazed in the direction he pointed out and made out a mass of wreckage they watched it steadily until the breakers cast it almost at their feet  some wreckage from the ship cried dick on examination see here is the name on some of the woodwork i reckon the vessel went to pieces on the rocks  the wreckage consisted mainly of broken spars and cordage but there were also some boxes which on being opened proved to contain provisions  its not such a bad find after all said tom i hope some more comes ashore but though they waited the best part of the night nothing more came to view  in the morning the boys felt tired and they did not rouse up until nearly noon they found old jerry at the beach inspecting the wreckage  the ropes may come in handy he said but the wood is of small account since we have all we want already to hand  it was decided to remain at the beach for the next day to look for more wreckage but none came in and then they started in a body to skirt the shore around to the south bay as old jerry called it at first they thought to carry the boat around but concluded to come back for that later  it was a journey full of interest for the sandy beach was dotted with many strange and beautiful seashells and just back of the sand was the rich tropical growth already mentioned the woods were full of monkeys and birds and once tom thought he caught sight of some goats or deer  they reached an ideal spot fronting the little bay a little before noon and then the girls were glad enough to sit down in the shade and rest the bay was full of fish and before long they had caught three of the finny tribe fruit was also to be had in plenty and a spring of fresh water gushed from the rocks of the hill behind them  this is certainly a beautiful place murmured dora as she gazed around were it not for the folks at home worrying about us i could spend quite some time here and enjoy it  well as our situation cannot be helped let us make the best of it said dick cheerfully there is no use in being downhearted when we ought to be glad that we were saved  close to the rocks they found several trees growing in something of two circles and they decided that these trees should form the corner posts of a double house or cabin  if we had an ax we might cut down some wood but as it is we will have to use strong vines and cover the huts with palm leaves said captain jerry  the boys were soon at work cutting the vines and gathering the palm leaves and the girls assisted as well as they were able in fastening up the vineropes and binding in the leaves it was slow work yet by nightfall one half the house was complete and the other had the roof covered  now if rain comes we can keep fairly dry said tom  it rained the very next day and they were glad enough to crowd into the completed part while the rain came down in torrents when the worst of the downpour was over the wind arose and it kept blowing fiercely all of the afternoon and the night  we can be thankful we are sheltered by the hill said sam were we on the other side of the island the wind would knock the hut flat and drench us in no time  the storm kept all awake until early morning and when it went down they were glad to sink to rest all slept soundly and it was not until ten oclock when the sun was struggling through the clouds that tom arose to find the others still slumbering  ill let them sleep he said to himself they need it and there is no need for them get to up  stretching himself he walked quietly from the hut and down to the beach his first thought was to try to collect some wood more or less dry and start a fire  gazing across the bay to one of the other islands he saw a sight which filled him with astonishment there on the beach of the island lay the wreck of the golden wave     chapter xv  another castaway brought to light   the golden wave hurrah  tom could not resist setting up a shout when he saw the familiar hull of the schooner resting quietly on the beach of an island on the other side of the bay  the cry awoke sam dick and old jerry and they came running out to learn what it meant  the schooner came from sam how did that get there  the storm must have driven her off the rocks and into this bay answered dick she didnt go down after all  its a fine thing for us put in captain jerry his broad face beaming with pleasure now we can have all the provisions we want and clothing and guns and if we can anchor the wreck in some way we can live on her just as comfortably as in a house at home  the excited talking brought the girls out one after another and they were equally pleased over the stroke of good fortune  she seems to be cast up pretty high on the sand said old jerry but even so the sooner we get to her the better or the sea may carry her off  i am ready to go now said tom but how are we to get to that island its a pity we didnt bring our boat around  there are two islands of the circle in between came from sam why cant we swim from one to the next and get around that way  we can try it lad but we want to be careful there may be sharks around in these parts  oh dont let the sharks eat you up cried grace  well keep our eyes open never fear said dick  a vote was taken and it was decided that sam should remain with the girls to protect them in case of unexpected danger while tom dick and old jerry should make their way as best they could to the wreck  the old sailor and the two boys were soon off they tramped down the beach a short distance and then reached a coral reef leading to the next island here the water was not over a foot and a half deep and as clear as crystal so the passage to island no 2 as tom named it was comparatively easy  the second island crossed they followed the shore around until they came opposite to the island upon which the wreck rested here there was a channel sixty or eighty feet wide and of unknown depth the channel through which the wreck had most likely entered the bay the water here was by no means smooth and captain jerry shook his head doubtfully  it wont be no easy swim he said reckon as how ill try it first  i can get over easily enough said dick and threw off part of his clothing and his shoes he was soon in the water and striking out boldly and the others followed  short as was the distance the swim was as hard as any of them looked for and when they reached the other side of the channel all were out of breath and had to rest for a moment  its a good thing no shark happened to be near said tom the monster would certainly have had us at his mercy  when they reached the wreck they found the stern well out of the water the golden wave lay partly on her left side and it was a comparatively easy matter to gain the deck  the masts were gone and there was a big hole in the bow but otherwise the craft had suffered little damage why she had not sunk was a mystery until later on old jerry discovered that some of the cargo consisting of flat cases had got wedged into the break thus cutting off a large portion of the leak  we can anchor her without trouble said the old sailor and perhaps straighten her up too so the deck wont be so slanty then shell be a reglar hotel for all hands  let us go below and see how things are down there said dick and he at once led the way  at that instant a loud sneeze reached their ears causing dick to pause on the companion way looking into the cabin he saw a man standing there partly dressed  captain blossom he ejaculated is it really you or your ghost  dick rover cried the master of the schooner then you werent drowned after all  no captain butbut how did you escape  is it really captain blossom came from tom and he rushed down into the cabin followed by old jerry all shook hands and the face of the captain showed his pleasure over the meeting  so you all escaped and are here he said i am downright glad to know it what of the others  we dont know what became of the other boats answered dick  saw nothing at all  not a thing  the captain shook his head sorrowfully  but how did you escape asked dick again  that is a short story lad when i went overboard from the rowboat i caught hold of some of the wreckage from the schooner this was still fast to the deck and by hauling myself in i soon got on board again as i had no boat i remained on board for i soon saw that the schooner would not go down immediately at daylight the ship left the rocks and drifted around on the ocean until the wind came up last night when we struck this island and got beached as you see i was worn out with watching and as soon as i found the boat was safe from sinking i went to bed and slept soundly until i heard you three tramping around the deck  we are stopping over on yonder island said tom when all went on deck and he pointed in the direction see sam and the girls are waving to us let us wave in return and stand apart so they can see that there are four of us  they did as the youngest rover advised and soon saw that they were seen then captain blossom held up his spyglass  i reckon they will know who i am by that he said and he was right for sam told the girls that the fourth man was captain blossom beyond a doubt  how is your stock of provisions asked old jerry we are getting just a bit tired of living on birds and fish and we want a gun or a pistol with which to protect ourselves  the golden wave has enough provisions to last this party a year answered the captain we havent anything very fine but we have plenty of flour dried beans salt and smoked meats and a good many cases of canned vegetables as well as sugar tea coffee salt and pepper with fresh fish and some game well be able to live as well here as if we were on shorethat is if we can find fresh water  we have all the fresh water we wanton the large island said tom and lots of tropical fruitcocoanuts bananas and the like  if we are going to live on the ship well have to bring fresh water over from the other island in a cask said dick that will not be very handy  cant we move the wreck over came from tom  no lad answered captain blossom she is here to stay until her timbers rot but if we wish we can move some of the provisions ashore there are the parts of a rowboat below and i reckon i am carpenter enough to put the parts together in a day or two  we have a boat on the north beach said old jerry we can bring it around  to do that well have to swim the channel again came from dick and i must say i dont like that  let us make a raft cried tom there must be plenty of material on board of the schooner for that  there certainly is answered captain blossom come we can make a raft in less than an hour  all set to work and in a short space of time they had the material together ropes and spikes were there aplenty and as captain blossom laid out one stick and another the boys and old jerry either nailed or tied them together a board flooring was placed on top of the spars and then the whole affair was dumped into the bay with a loud splash it floated very well with the flooring a good ten inches above the surface of the water and as the raft was nearly twenty feet long by ten wide it was capable of carrying considerable weight  thats better than a boat said dick we can pile a good deal more stuff on it  let us get on and paddle to where we left the others said tom they will be anxious to learn the news  captain blossom was willing and they took with them a variety of provisions and also some extra clothing and some firearms then the raft was moved to where the boys had left part of their own clothing when they had started to swim the channel  the coming of the big raft and its passengers to the shore where the cabin was located was greeted with shouts of joy from sam and the three girls  hurrah for the captain of the golden wave cried sam swinging his cap in the air we are very glad to see you safe and sound  and i am glad to see you answered captain blossom as he leaped ashore and grasped one and another by the hand last night i was thinking i would be a lonely castaway now i find i shall have plenty of company  we have brought along some provisions put in tom and in honor of this reunion and also in honor of the fact that the golden wave has not been sunk i move we invite the girls to get us up a regular feast i think all bands deserve it  second the motion cried sam  all right well cook you anything you want said nellie that is if you will supply the things  i will answered tom then he scratched his head well by gracious  whats the trouble tom asked grace did you forget to bring along some sugar  worse than that i brought along all sorts of good things to eat and not a single knife fork spoon or dish outside of some cooking utensils  oh dear burst out dora it will be a sorry feast if we havent anything to eat from  ill go back for the dishes replied tom promptly sam do you want to visit the wreck we can go and come by the time the things are cooked  to be sure ill go said sam and in a few minutes more the two boys were off on the clumsy raft     chapter xvi  sam and the shark  the golden wave looks like an old friend said sam as they paddled across the smooth waters of the bay  her coming here is the finest thing that could have happened answered his brother i didnt want to say anything before but if she hadnt come what would we have done for clothing and for eating we couldnt live on fish all the time and one can do mighty little hunting without a gun  we would have had to set traps tom and dig pitfalls for larger game but i admit it would have been hard work and i fancy a suit of goatskins like robinson crusoe wore wouldnt be half as comfortable as a suit of clothes such as i am wearing  if we could only float the schooner and sail away to some nearby port  there is no port within three hundred miles of us so the captain says  soon the boys were halfway across the bay but moving the big raft was a laborious task and they were glad enough to sit down and rest for a few minutes  there is no use of our hurrying said tom our time is our own in this outoftheway place and as we have next to nothing to do we want to make what little work there is last us  like a lazy man working by the day laughed sam im afraid i cant work that way when i have something to do im not content until it is done  are you hot sam here is something to cool you off  as tom spoke he playfully scooped up a handful of water and threw it at his brother  soon the two boys were having lots of sport throwing handfuls of the salty water at each other then sam made a motion as if he was going to push tom overboard with his paddle  hi none of that cried tom i dont mind a wetting by retail but i dont want it by wholesale  he continued to throw water at sam and the youngest rover tried to dodge the raft began to rock and of a sudden sam lost his balance and went into the bay with a splash  tom set up a laugh for it was a comical sight and it had been sams own fault that he went overboard but then toms laughter came to an end as he saw the form of a shark moving swiftly toward the spot  a shark a shark he screamed sam get on board quick a shark is after you  sam had gone far down beneath the surface and he did not reappear at once then he came up spluttering  gosh i didnt want a bath tom you  hurry and get aboard sam a shark is after you  sam was about ten feet from the raft and running to the spot nearest to him tom held out the end of his paddle  a shark gasped the youngest rover  yes yes catch the end of the paddle  sam made a frantic effort to do so in the meantime the shark came closer and tom could see his enormous mouth and sharp teeth clearly his blood turned to ice in his veins  sam made a clutch at the paddle missed it and disappeared once more from sight the shark rushed to the spot and turned in dismay and driven to desperation tom hit the monster over the head with the paddle then the shark disappeared also  the next few seconds were full of agony for poor tom he gazed in all directions for sam and for the shark but neither one nor the other was to be seen  he must have caught sam under the water he muttered oh sam what an awful death to die  a slight noise at the upper end of the raft disturbed him he turned swiftly to see a wet hand glide over the woodwork he made a leap and clutched the hand and then sams head appeared he gave a frantic yank and both lay on the flooring of the raft sam was saved  the shark gasped tom when he could speak did ititbite you  no but it grazed my shoulder answered sam if i had not dived down i would have lost an arm at the very least  when they felt able they looked around but the shark had disappeared  that settles it said tom we must be careful and keep out of this water in the future if we want to bathe we will have to build a pool  during the remainder of the trip to the wreck both were careful not to run the slightest chance of falling overboard  not such a very lovely place to live in after all said tom snakes on land and sharks in the water ugh and sam agreed with him  once on the wreck it was an easy thing to obtain the dishes and the knives forks and spoons and also some other things they thought they might require they also brought away another gun loading it up before leaving the ship  now if mr shark comes around again we can give him a dose of buckshot said tom  but the shark did not appear excepting at a great distance  when sam told his story all congratulated him on his narrow escape  tom is right said old jerry ye mustnt do no bathin in the bay we can fix two pools one for the ladies and one for ourselves and make another pool for fish and another for turtles if we can find any  the girls had cooked a splendid meal and soon the table was set on a big flat rock lying near the beach all sat down and captain blossom asked a blessing and then they all fell to with vigor for all were hungry  the salt air gives one an appetite said dick  the meal lasted the best part of an hour for as tom said there was no use of hurrying as they ate and for some time afterward they discussed their situation and tried to arrange plans for the future  it was decided that first of all dick and old jerry should climb to the top of the hill taking with them an ax and a flag and some halyards and fasten the flag to the top of the tree stars down as a signal of distress then the whole party was to assist in bringing from the wreck as much building material as was necessary to construct a comfortable dwelling of three large rooms one for the girls one for the boys and men and one as a general living room a storehouse was also to be built in which could be stored such provisions as were brought away from the wreck from time to time then they could live on shore or on the ship as they pleased  the following day was sunday and all rested the girls thought there should be some sort of religious exercises and all went to the wreck where captain blossom read some chapters from the bible and the others sang hymns  the week to follow was a busy one and the time slipped by rapidly a visit was paid to the hilltop and the flag raised and tom and old jerry also went to the north shore and brought around the rowboat beached there in the meantime captain blossom put together the rowboat parts stored on the golden wave so they now had two boats and the raft for service across the bay and to other points on the water  building the house was by no means an easy task but the rover boys thought it more fun than work especially with the girls to look on and by the end of the second week the building looked quite presentable when the two bedrooms were finished some berths were brought over from the wreck along with bedclothing and also some furniture for the living apartment outside the latter room a large porch was built where they might eat and rest when the weather was fine not to run the risk of burning down the building in a high wind it was decided that the cooking should be done in a shed some distance away in the shelter of the rocks and handy to the spring  who is going to be the cook asked dick it wont be fair to put it off on one person  we have decided to take turns said dora each one will be the main cook for a day at a time with the others to help and to wash the dishes we are going to do all the housework too so you men folks can hunt and fish and make garden if you will to your hearts content  what a lazy time we will have of it laughed dick  captain blossom says that as soon as we are settled we can explore all of the seven islands who knows we may find out something of importance came from tom who stood near  cannibals for instance put in sam  oh do you really think there are any cannibals here asked grace  i believe he is fooling said nellie he only wants to scare us and she tossed her pretty head  perhaps well stir up some lions or tigers said tom  or an elephant added dick but i dont think we will my opinion is that these islands have nothing on them but birds monkeys small game and snakes  youve forgotten one thing said dora with an odd smile  what dora  castaways     chapter xvii  exploring the seven islands   another rainy spell lasting three days followed but after that the sky cleared in a fashion which captain blossom thought betokened good weather for some time to come  we can now explore the seven islands and learn just what they contain he said  the question now arose as to who should go along and who should stay at home with the girls lots were cast and by this it was decided that the exploring party should consist of captain blossom sam and tom leaving dick and old jerry with dora nellie and grace  it was decided that the exploring party should take the lightest of the rowboats and enough provisions to last for a week each was also provided with a pistol and captain blossom carried a rifle in addition  if all goes well we will be back inside of four days said the captain when he and tom and sam were ready to depart but if we are not back at that time do not worry until at least a week has gone by and so it was arranged it was also arranged that three shots fired in succession should be a signal that one party or the other was in trouble  tom and sam were pleased over the prospect of going with the captain and they willingly took up the oars to row to the nearest island which as we already know was close at hand the boat was left on the beach and without delay the captain and the two boys plunged into the interior  the island was small with but a slight rise of ground in the center it was of small importance and they soon came out on the ocean side where there was a beach strewn with shells and with oysters scarcely fit to eat the growth on this island was mostly of young palms and the captain was of the opinion that the ground was not many years old  this has been thrown up by an earthquake or a volcano he said there is nothing here to interest us and he turned back  they already knew something of the island on which the wreck was located but nevertheless made a trip across it and up the outward coast here they found a number of orange and lemon trees and also a great quantity of tropical nuts and some spices the lemons proved to be very refreshing and tom said he meant to come back some day and get a bagful for general use  the next island was visited the next day the party spending the night on the wreck the passage to this island was rather a rough one and they had all they could do to keep from having their provisions spilt overboard  it is a blessing that the sea is comparatively calm said captain blossom otherwise we could never make such a trip in a small boat  this island was the largest of the group outside of the one on which the castaways had settled it was almost square in shape and had a double hill with a tiny valley running between in this valley the tropical growth was very dense and the monkeys and birds were thicker than they had before seen them there were also large quantities of blue and green parrots filling the air with their cawing and screaming  this is a very nice island said tom while they were resting under some calabash trees the wood is very valuableindigo rosewood mahogany and lots of others and what a sweet smell and he drew in a long breath of satisfaction  it is certainly a lazy mans paradise returned sam a fellow need do next to nothing to feed and clothe himself here and a house isnt absolutely necessary excepting when it storms real hard  on this island they found numerous land crabs some as large as their two hands and many fiercelooking spiders with long hairy legs and bulging eyes ants were also numerous and in one spot they located fifteen anthills each as large as a big beehive insects of all sorts were numerous and they had to continually slap at a specimen of red fly that annoyed them greatly  how those ants would like to get at our provisions said tom we can be thankful that we didnt locate here once they got at the stuff they would eat us out of house and home  after resting and partaking of some of the food brought along they continued their journey across the island  the way was up one of the hills and tom was slightly in advance when a noise ahead attracted his attention  something is there he called out as he came to a halt  what is it asked sam  i dont know perhaps some wild animal or else a snake  go slow there cautioned captain blossom coming up we dont want to run into unnecessary danger  what did it sound like tom  i cant describe it something like a snarl i guess  perhaps it was only a monkey  all stopped to listen but no sound reached their ears but the hum of insects and the chirping of some distant birds  i reckon i had best go first said captain blossom but he did not seem to relish the task  gun in hand the captain advanced very cautiously the boys came close behind him each with his pistol ready for use  of a sudden there was a snarl with a strange yowyawing and a great beast leaped up on allfours directly in their path and darted through the bushes the captain raised his gun and the boys their pistols but before they could fire the beast had disappeared  what was it asked sam trembling with excitement  i give it up unless it was a bear said tom  i think i know what it was said the captain a big baboon or a gorilla  i guess you are right captain answered tom i saw a gorilla in a menagerie and it was exactly like that beast but what a big fellow he was  gorillas are highly dangerous especially when cornered said captain blossom he himself was more frightened than he cared to admit they have been known to carry a man off in their arms and bite him to death  thanks but i want no gorillas around me declared sam  they waited several minutes before advancing again but the gorilla had disappeared nor did it show itself again during that trip on the island  half an hour brought them in sight of the seashore once more they were gazing at the sea when tom happened to glance back and on the hill behind them saw four goats standing in a bunch looking at them in astonishment  quick out of sight he cried and dragged the others behind some trees  what did you see  several goats perhaps if we are careful we can get a shot at them fresh goat meat wont go bad  whats the matter with capturing some of the goats and getting the milk came from sam  youll have a job catching wild goats answered captain blossom they are as fleet of foot as deer  it was decided to try two shots at the goats providing they could get close enough with care they plunged into the undergrowth and made their way back up the hillside until they thought they must be within fifty yards of the game  there they are cried tom softly  bang went the captains gun and crack tom fired immediately after two of the goats were hit and one fell dead the other staggered away with a broken foreleg  we must get that second fellow cried sam and rushed after the game the goat tried to turn on him but sam hit the beast over the head with a club he carried two other blows finished the animal  that isnt bad said the captain they both look to be young they ought to make good eating  we are going to have no easy work of it getting these animals down to the shore said tom  after we get them to the shore what then questioned his brother we cant keep them in the boat all the time that we are exploring the other islands  we had best make a trip back to the house answered captain blossom if the others heard the shots theyll be wondering what has happened besides a storm is coming up  the captain said he would carry the smaller of the goats alone leaving the two rovers to carry the larger game between them after a rest and another look around the vicinity they started for the boat and reached it after a walk which almost exhausted every one of the party  ill be glad enough to lay around our camp and rest for a day announced sam this task of exploring is not as easy as it looks  a little later they were in the boat and rowing back to where they had left the others little dreaming of the strange events that had happened in their absence     chapter xviii  unexpected visitors   it had been decided by the castaways to enlarge one of the rooms of the house and as soon as the captain tom and sam had departed on their exploring tour dick and old jerry set to work to cut down the posts necessary for the building  while this was going on the three girls were by no means idle there were meals to get dishes to wash and it had been found that outdoor life was very rough on clothing so there was a good bit of sewing and darning to be done fortunately all of the girls were handy with a needle so that a rent in a coat or a dress received immediate attention  now you must make the alteration in the house very nice said dora to dick remember we want a regular queen anne building with round bay windows and  and inlaid floors finished dick not to mention steam heat and  mercy on us burst in grace dont mention steam heat in this climate  of course we want hot and cold water in the kitchen put in nellie what sort of a mansion would it be without hot and cold waterand a dumb waiter from the cellar too and then all began to laugh  i know what i should like said dora after a pause that would be a refrigerator  if we had the ice finished nellie dick isnt there any ice on board of the golden wave  by jove i think there is cried the oldest rover boy i never once thought of it before  if there is i wish youd bring some the next time you go over we have lemons and we could make delicious lemonade  and we could make orange ice too put in grace i know there was an icecream freezer on board of the ship it was in the cooks galley  old jerry was coming to the house with a small tree he had cut down and dick sounded him about the ice  to be sure there was ice several tons of it said jerry it was stowed away near the bow i dont believe its all melted either  im going over to see cried dick weve got plenty of lemons and sugar and lemonade not to mention orange ice would just strike the spot in this awfully hot weather  but as it was now noon with the sun directly overhead dick decided to remain in the shade until four or five oclock dinner was had and then the work of enlarging the house went on as before  at halfpast four dick got out the rowboat and started for the wreck he had first thought to go alone but old jerry wanted to pick out certain tools needed for the housebuilding as well as hunt for a keg of nails and the two decided to go together going and coming as quickly as possible  you wont be afraid to be alone will you asked dick of the girls  not if you hurry answered nellie but dont stay away after dark  left to themselves the three girls swept up the chips the builders had left and started up the campfire then they tidied up the house generally and soon set about preparing the supper  dora was at the spring getting a pail of water when a sound on the rocks nearby caused her to look around in wonder to her amazement dan baxter stood there staring at her in openmouthed astonishment  dan baxter she gasped where in the world did you come from  for a moment the bully did not answer so great was his amazement dora noted that he was dirty and unkempt and that his clothing was almost in rags  is it you dora stanhope came slowly from the fellows lips is it really you  yes she answered  how did you get here are you alone went on baxter coming closer and then before she could answer he added got anything to eat  at the last question she looked at him more closely and saw that he appeared half starved she pitied him despite his character  yes we have plenty to eat she said  then give me something at once he cried give me something at once  come with me  there was now a crashing in the bushes back of dan baxter and in a second more jack lesher appeared on the scene he too was haggard and dirty and his eyes were much bloodshot the result of living almost entirely on liquor for several days after being wrecked on the islands  well is it possible cried the mate of the golden wave  theyve got lots to eat muttered dan baxter im going to have something to fill me up before i start to talk  how many more of you are here asked dora in something of dismay  we came along alone said baxter show us that grub  dora led the way to the campfire where nellie and grace were also surprised at the unexpected visitors some food was brought forth and both baxter and lesher ate like two famished wolves  got any liquor questioned the mate casting his eyes toward the house  we have a little answered nellie for captain blossom had brought over several bottles from the wreck  bring it out  when the liquor was brought jack lesher took a long draught and then handed the bottle to dan baxter  thats the stuff cried the mate with a sly wink at dora better than eatin twice over and he took another drink  the manner of the two newcomers was not at all pleasing to the girls and they were sorry that none of the men folks were at hand they asked the pair to tell their story and baxter spoke up while lesher applied himself to the bottle  we floated around the ocean for several days said the bully one sailor went crazy from the sunshine and leaped overboard and was drowned then a heavy wind came up and drove the boat in the night onto an island close to this one we were cast ashore with hardly any provisions and two of the sailors were sick we had to live on fish birds and fruit and weve had a hard lot of it i can tell you that yesterday lesher and i resolved to explore this island thinking that perhaps some of the wreckage from the schooner had washed ashore here we came over in the afternoon and tramped along the north shore until it grew dark but without finding anything we slept at the shore last night and this morning started to go over the hill back there but the snakes chased us off and then we came around over some rough rocks where both of us got our clothing torn we thought we saw a flag up there somewhere but we werent sure  yes we have a signal of distress up there answered dora she hardly knew how best to reply  who is here  captain blossom old jerry tolman and the three rover boys old jerry and dick have just gone over to the wreck en an errand the others have gone on an exploring tour among the islands which are seven in number  got the wreck have yer came in almost a grunt from jack lesher sure enough he staggered down to the beach dont see why you stay here when you might be aboard of her  it is cooler here answered nellie  how many sailors were saved asked grace  nine were saved besides lesher and myself answered dan baxter you see we picked up some of the men from one of the other boats  then your party numbers eleven in all said dora  yes came from jack lesher an i am the capn of the lot and he bobbed his head in satisfaction he had partaken of just enough liquor to make him foolish  i wish dick and old jerry would come back whispered grace to dora i do not like mr lesher at all  i never liked him replied dora when he gets intoxicated he is a bad fellow to deal with  reckon well make ourselves comfortable here said lesher staggering to a hammock dick had put up for the girls to rest in he pitched into the hammock carrying a bottle of liquor with him another drink was taken and soon he was fast asleep snoring loudly     chapter xix  hot words and blows   what a shame said nellie pointing to the slumbering mate  that shows what liquor will do came from dora  oh you mustnt blame him too much returned dan baxter who also liked the taste of the liquor remember that we have been living a dogs life since we came on shore while you have been living on the best the ship affords  i wouldnt touch liquor if i was starving cried grace  and neither would the rover boys added dora  oh you think the rover boys are regular saints grumbled the bully you dont know what they would do behind your back  if they said they wouldnt drink they wouldnt cried nellie her eyes flashing we can trust them every time  i suppose the rover boys run this place to suit themselves went on baxter eying the house and the general appearance of the camp sharply  we all run it together came from grace  isnt captain blossom in command  after a fashion yes we havent tried to decide that point yet have you a leader in your camp  not much of a one lesher is leader when he is sober of course well all come over here now weve found you and the wreck went on dan baxter  but why should you come here asked dora not at all pleased by the prospect we can let you have your share of whats on board of the schooner  dont want me here eh  i dont care for all of those rough sailors  well they are captain blossoms men you mustnt forget that  i suppose that is true and dora sighed with the coming of the sailors she was certain the camp would not be as pleasant as formerly  i dont think you ought to be down on me dora continued dan baxter after a pause i always liked you and you know it  thank you for nothing she replied coldly  im just as good a fellow as dick rover went on the bully and laid his hand on the girls shoulder  dont touch me dan baxter she cried  i wont hurt you come let us be friends surely you dont want any enemies here where there are only a handful of us all told  i want you to leave me alone  she tried to move away from him but he caught her by the arm and tried to hold her hands grace and nellie were out of sight the one having gone into the house for some dishes and the other to the spring for some water  say that youll be friends and ill let you go he said drawing her closer  i wont be friends with you dan baxter so there she cried now let me go and she tried to push him away  youyou little cat he cried and then as she let out a loud cry he let go of her what a little fool you are and he walked away to the trees and threw himself down to rest  red in the face and ready to cry dora ran into the house grace looked at her in wonder  what is the trouble dora  nothing  did dan baxter try toto  he wants to bebe friends sobbed dora he held my hand so i couldnt get away oh how i despise him  just wait till dick comes back hell make baxter mind his own business  oh dont tell him grace  but i shall dora baxter has got to keep his distance i hate him myself and so does nellie  i wish he and mr lesher had kept their distance  do you think they will really come herei mean all of the sailors  more than likely  the girls continued their work and for the time being dan baxter kept his distance jack lesher continued to snore away in the hammock nor did he rouse up when dick and old jerry returned  dan baxter cried dick as he leaped from the rowboat where did you come from and then the story of the newcomers had to be told over again  dick eyed jack lesher with open disgust a man who will act like that has no welcome in our camp he said to baxter  you dont mean you are going to turn him out said the bully in alarm  if he stays here he must behave himself  you forget that he was the first mate of the schooner dick rover  we are not on the schooner now  no but you are getting your livingor the largest part of itfrom the schooner  what do you mean baxter  i mean that its the same as if you were on the schooner and that being so mr lesher is the second in command here  at this statement the girls looked alarmed and even old jerrys face showed his uneasiness but dicks face was full of contempt  do you mean to say that thing pointing to the drunken mate that thing can command any of us if you do let me say right now that you are mistaken  well see about that later  this is our camp and it is not for you the mate or anybody else to come here and dictate to us if you try that well send you off in doublequick order  there was a pause and dick and old jerry began to unload the things they had brought from the wreck they had found a large cake of ice but the coming of baxter and jack lesher had taken away the pleasure of making lemonade and orange ice and the lump was placed in some water to cool it for drinking purposes  as soon as grace could get the chance she told dick of the way dan baxter had treated dora at once dicks face took on a stern look that boded the bully no good  ill have a talk with him and come to an understanding said the eldest rover and strode out of the house and to where baxter was walking up the beach picking up fancycolored seashells  look here baxter i want to have an understanding with you he said catching the bully by the arm  what do you want now  i want you to promise to leave dora stanhope alone in the future  how i treat her is none of your business blustered the bully  but it is my business baxter  see here dick rover i wont be bossed by you howled the tall youth you mind your own business  if you touch her again there will be trouble  what will you do  ill give you the worst thrashing you ever had in your life  two can play at that game  there will be only one in this game  do you want to fight me  i am perfectly willing responded dick recklessly his anger was deep at that moment  all right then come on howled baxter savagely and squaring off he aimed a blow at dicks face  the attack was so sudden that dick could scarcely prepare for it and though he dodged baxters fist landed glancingly on his cheek  there you are and heres another cried the bully and his other fist shot out catching dick on the shoulder  but now the oldest rover was on his guard and in a twinkle he let drive taking dan baxter in the eye it was a staggering blow and made the bully gasp with pain then dick followed it up by a crashing blow on the chin which sent the bully reeling into the low water on the beach  dontdont run me into the ocean he spluttered and watching his chance ran out of the water and up the beach  but dick was now thoroughly aroused and he made after baxter when he got close enough he put out his foot and sent the bully sprawling baxter came down on some rough seashells cutting his face and hands in several places  oh oh he howled stop it  i will not stop it dan baxter until you promise to let dora stanhope and the other girls alone in the future they want nothing to do with you and you must keep your distance  ii didnt hurt anybody  do you promise to let them alone  without replying the bully staggered to his feet the blood was running from his nose and from a cut on his chin and both of his hands were also bleeding  do you want to kill me dick rover  i want you to behave yourself come now are you going to promise  what if i dont  then ill give you the thrashing i promised  all right im cornered and cant help myself  will you let the girls alone in the future  yes if they dont want to be friends im sure i can get along without them answered baxter sulkily  very well now see that you keep your promise if you dont ill run you out of camp and never let you come near us again  with these words dick turned on his heel and walked away leaving baxter to wash his cuts and bruises in the ocean and otherwise care for them as best he could     chapter xx  the mate tries to take command   the fight had taken place around a bend of the shore so that it was not observed by old jerry and the girls but when dick got back to camp dora at once noticed that something unusual had happened  what is wrong dick she asked  oh nothing much dora i merely made dan baxter promise to keep his distance in the future  did you have a fight  it didnt amount to much he had to give in pretty quickly  oh dick she caught his arm  i wont have him annoying you or the others dora  you are so good she whispered  supper was ready and they sat down leaving jack lesher still in the hammock they had nearly finished when dan baxter came shuffling along  do you want some supper asked dick if you do come on  i dont want anything more tonight growled the bully and sat down beside jack lesher  it was rather an uncomfortable evening the thoughts of each of the party were busy at the first opportunity dick called old jerry to one side  jerry we must watch those two fellows closely he said  right ye are dick  i am afraid lesher will be ugly when he wakes up  moren likely ladhe always was on board ship the drink gives him an awful temper  i am going to put the liquor where he cant get it  hell make ye give it to him  will he just you wait and see replied dick firmly  it was decided to let lesher rest in the hammock all night baxter was given a cot in the living room of the house soon all had retired and the camp was quiet for the night  dan baxter was the first to stir in the morning his cuts smarted so he could not sleep and he walked out to bathe them and put on some salve nellie had generously turned over to him he found jack lesher stirring  hullo grumbled the mate sitting up and yawning where am i  dont you know we struck camp answered baxter  oh yes i remember now got some good liquor too where is that bottle  you emptied it lesher  did i too bad ill have to find another where are the girls  asleep in the house and so are dick rover and old jerry tolman  what of capn blossom and them other rover boys  they are not expected back for several days  humph say i feel bad i do i must have something to brace me up  youd better not disturb them lesher they are mighty stiffnecked since they landed here  what do you mean  they gave me to understand yesterday that they were going to run things to suit themselves they are not going to let us interfere in anything  i like that the mate yawned again rose and stretched himself baxter do you know where they keep the liquor  no  im bound to have what i want didnt it all come from the golden wave and aint i the first mate of that craft  to be sure you are lesher  they cant make me take a back seat went on the mate his head was still far from clear  i told them that you were second in commandcaptain blossom being firstbut they wouldnt listen they said they were on land and you didnt count  dont i count cried jack lesher his bloodshot eyes taking on an ugly look ill show em  just then old jerry came from the house jack lesher staggered toward him  ahoy there he called out  what do you want mr lesher questioned old jerry and touched his forelock  bring me some liquor and be quick about it  i havent any liquor  whats that  i said i havent any liquor  aint there any more liquor ashore  if there is i dont know where it is  then find out and be quick about it or ill give you the ropesend roared the unreasonable mate  the loud talking aroused dick and he soon came out  whats the matter here he asked oh so you have woke up he went on to jack lesher  yes im awake rover and i want to know where the liquor has been placed  its been placed where you wont get hold of it mr lesher  what this to me yelled the mate in fury to me the first mate  a first mate doesnt count for anything here this is a private camp and if you dont behave yourself well pitch you out of it  youyou jack lesher could not go on and shook his fist in dicks face  i told you what they intended to do whispered dan baxter in leshers ear they have the upper hand and mean to keep it but dont forget that we have nine sailors in our camp to back us up he went on suggestively  dont grow abusive mr lesher said dick as calmly as he could just think the matter over it may save a good deal of trouble  i dont have to think it over bellowed the mate during capn blossoms absence i am in command just as much as if we were on the deck of the wreck over there you were only passengers but jerry tolman was a sailor and hes under my command i told him to bring me some liquor and he has got to do it if he wont obey its mutiny just you remember that and he shook his finger warningly in old jerrys face  i told ye i dont know where the liquor is answered old jerry doggedly  and he tells the truth said dick i put it away myself  then i command you to bring it to me  i told you before your commands dont hold water here even old jerry hasnt got to obey you when the golden wave was abandoned that ended your authority we have simply made captain blossom our leader because he acted fair and square but we dont have to obey him if we dont want to  what of the nine sailors who are with me  well be pleased to give them their full share of what is on the wreck and if they behave themselves they can build a camp right next to this one but you must remember that we discovered the wreck first and that captain blossom was the only man left on board  well see what the men have to say about this growled lesher then you aint going to give me no liquor  you can have one glass with your breakfast and that is all after this you can have the regulation ships grog with the other sailors but getting drunk has got to be stopped even if we have to dump all the liquor into the ocean  by this time the girls had appeared on the scene and the talk came to an end dick turning in to help get breakfast jack lesher walked down to the beach followed by dan baxter  you see it is just as i told you said baxter they are going to ride right over us  they wouldnt ride over us if i had those other sailors here growled the mate  or if we were armed went on the bully i tried to get hold of a pistol but dick rover watches me like a cat watches a mouse  if we could get to the wreck we might arm ourselves said lesher here is a boat let us row over  im willing answered the bully  they walked to the boat shoved it into the water and leaped in just as lesher picked up the oars dick saw what they were doing  stop he cried  what do you want growled the mate  where are you going  over to the wreck  what for  that is our business put in dan baxter  you shant go over there until captain blossom comes back  well go when we please said lesher and started to row away  come back i say cried dick and rushing into the house he appeared with a shotgun  what are you going to do dick rover questioned baxter in alarm  i am going to make you come back was the oldest rovers very quiet but determined answer     chapter xxi  the attack on the wreck   the appearance of dick with the shotgun disturbed jack lesher quite as much as it did dan baxter and the mate stopped rowing instantly  hi dont you fire at us he cried  then come back here said dick  havent i a right to visit the wreck  i am not sure that you have anyway you must wait until captain blossom returns  it seems to me that you are carrying matters with a high hand young fellow  oh dick be careful whispered dora they may become desperate  dont worry dora he whispered in return unless i miss my guess one is as big a coward as the other  i hope ye aint goin too far dick said old jerry in a low tone  dont you intend to stand by me jerry  to be sure i do but the mate is the mate ye know  there was an uncertain pause all around  there is no harm in my visiting the wreck growled jack lesher presently  perhaps not but you had better wait until captain blossom gets back  i only want to get some things that belong to me  and i want to get my extra clothes said baxter these are in rags as you can see  then wait until after breakfast and well all go over said dick but he had scarcely spoken when he felt sorry for the words  oh dick dont trust yourself with them cautioned dora  we want to hurry for i want to go back to where i left the sailors before night answered lesher  then well have breakfast at once  rather reluctantly the mate turned back to the shore and he and baxter left the boat then the girls prepared breakfast with all haste lesher ate but little but eagerly tossed off the glass of liquor dick allowed him  give me one more he pleaded but dick was firm and the mate stalked away muttering under his breath  before dick entered the rowboat he called jerry aside and handed the old sailor a pistol  we had better go armed he said keep your eyes open for they may try to play us a foul trick and dont let lesher talk you into obeying him he has no authority whatever over you  all right dick ill stand by ye always from this minit on said jerry and the compact was sealed by a handshake  the girls came down to see them off and dora warned dick again to be on guard it was decided that lesher and old jerry should do the rowing baxter sat in the bow of the boat and dick in the stern  the trip to the wreck was accomplished in almost utter silence everybody was busy with his thoughts as they drew near dick showed the mate where a ladder hung from the side and as they drew close to this baxter was the first to mount to the deck  as dick had surmised leshers first hunt was for liquor and he drank several glasses at a gulp then he began to roam around the wreck noting the damage that had been done and the amount of stores still on board  might float her if the tide got extra high he said eleven men in our crowd and five in your own ought to be able to do something surely  the captain says the ship is too deep in the sand answered dick briefly  blossom dont know everything growled the mate  both he and baxter soon found some comfortable clothing and put it on then they made up a bundle of things they said the other sailors needed  when arming themselves the rovers and captain blossom had placed all of the remaining firearms in a stateroom and locked the door  what did you do with all of the guns and pistols asked lesher presently after looking in vain for them  they are packed away in a stateroom captain blossom thought it wouldnt do to leave them lying loose some savages might come to the islands and steal them and then wed be in a bad hole  weve got to have some guns and pistols rover  well you can see the captain about that  i shant wait which stateroom are they in  dick would not tell the mate and lesher went around trying the various doors coming to one that was locked he burst it open with his shoulder  dick scarcely knew what to do and while he was trying to make up his mind jack lesher secured a pistol and a rifle and also a pistol for dan baxter he would have taken more firearms but dick stopped him  that is enough he said  i want some for the men said the first mate  they can get pistols from captain blossom when they get here  humph you think you are in sole command dont you  i am not going to allow you to take away all the firearms that are here mr lesher  well see  the mate went into the pantry and secured another glass of liquor then he ordered old jerry to take the bundle of clothing and put it in the rowboat  ive got some money on this schooner he said i want to see if thats safe or if you have stolen it  we havent touched any money answered dick his face flushing it would be of no use to us on these islands  you come with me while i take a look said lesher  behind his back he waved his hand for baxter to follow all three went below again and into a stateroom the mate had occupied  the money was in that chest said the mate he threw open the lid its gone he cried  interested for the moment dick bent forward to look in the chest as he did so lesher suddenly hit him a savage blow over the head with the butt of a pistol the blow was a heavy one and dick fell like a log to the floor  oh came from baxter have you killed him  no only knocked the senses out of him answered lesher bending over his victim  what did you do it for  to teach him a lesson he shant boss me baxter come help me put him in the brig and be quick before jerry comes back  they lifted up the insensible form and made their way to where the ships brig was located a dirty closet once used for oil and lanterns dick was thrown on the floor and the mate shut the door on him and locked it  now he can stay there for a day or two he snarled reckon it will teach him a lesson  what will you do with the sailor  before lesher could answer old jerry appeared  where is dick rover he asked  none of your business growled jack lesher see here tolman are you going to obey me after this  i want to know where dick is said old jerry stubbornly  i put him in the brig to cool off hes too hotheaded for his own good  you had no right to lock him up mr lesher you must let him out at once  git out of here quick roared lesher on deck or ill flog you well  ye wont tech me cried jerry his temper rising i aint under orders no more mind that now you let him out or ill do it you was a fool to lock him up in the first place  he moved toward the brig but lesher caught him by the arm  lets teach this chap a lesson too came from baxter and like a flash he struck old jerry in the back of the head the first blow was followed by a second and down went the tar the blood oozing from one of his wounds  dont hit him again cried lesher hastily hes out already  baxter grew pale thinking he had gone too far but he soon discovered that jerry still breathed and then he felt relieved  it was decided by the pair that they should place old jerry beside dick in the brig and this was quickly done then they put into the prison a bucket of drinking water and a can of ships biscuits and another of baked beans  they wont starve on that said lesher and when they get out theyll understand that i am as much of a master here as anybody  it serves dick rover right said baxter hes the kind that ought to be kept under foot all the time     chapter xxii  a heavy tropical storm   those girls will ask some awkward questions i reckon said jack lesher as the two prepared to leave the wreck  we had better not say too much answered baxter  they were soon over the side and in the rowboat which contained the bundle of clothing and a number of other articles then an idea struck the mate  wait i am going back he said and disappeared on the deck one more  dan baxter imagined that lesher had gone for more liquor but he was mistaken when the mate reappeared he carried a box containing half a dozen pistols two guns and a quantity of ammunition  i am going to hide this in the woods on the other side of this island he said the firearms may come in handy before long  a good idea replied baxter and helped him place the case in a desirable spot under some rocks where the rain could not touch it  we are going to have a storm before long said the mate as they started to row back to the camp and if it is a heavy one well have to wait till it clears off before we rejoin the rest of our crowd  the sky was growing dark and by the time the beach in front of the house was gained the rain was falling  where are dick and old jerry asked dora in quick alarm she had noted long before that only baxter and the mate were in the rowboat  they stayed behind on the wreck answered lesher come help get the bundles out of the wet he added to his companion  why did they stay asked nellie  dont ask me growled lesher  he and baxter took the bundle to the house and dumped it on the floor of the living room then they brought in the other things from the boat by this time it was raining in torrents and from a distance came the rumble of thunder and occasionally the faint flash of lightning  not wishing to remain out in the storm the three girls came into the housedora was very much disturbed and nellie and grace were also anxious  it is queer that dick and old jerry remained behind whispered dora to her cousins they were so anxious to protect us before  i cannot understand it dora returned nellie  there has been foul play somewhere came from grace  oh do you think dora could not finish  see here burst in the voice of jack lesher we want some dinner dont be all day getting it for us  the liquor he had imbibed was beginning to tell upon him he looked ugly and the girls trembled before him  dinner will be ready in a quarter of an hour said grace who had been doing the cooking  all right lesher turned to the bully baxter join me in a glass of rum for luck  thanks i will answered dan baxter who did not particularly want the liquor but did not dream of offending the mate  lesher produced a bottle he had brought away from the wreck prepared two glasses of rum and drank with great relish then he threw himself into a chair at the rude diningtable  i am the master here and i want everybody to know it he exclaimed banging his fist savagely  there is dinner said grace and brought it in you can help yourself and she went into the next room to join nellie and dora  aint going to wait on us eh grumbled lesher with a hiccough all right my fine ladies but i am master dont you forget that  he began to eat leisurely while dan baxter began to bolt his food in the meantime the sky grew darker and the flashes of lightning more vivid the girls were greatly frightened and huddled together while tears stood on graces cheeks  oh if only somebody was with us sighed nellie  by the time lesher and baxter had finished eating the storm was on them in all of its violence the wind shrieked and tore through the jungle behind them and often they could hear some tall tree go down with a crash  this will tear our flag of distress to shreds said nellie and just when we need it so much too  i am thinking of the future as well as the present said dora what a rough time there will be if lesher brings those other sailors here some of them were heavy drinkers like himself and only two or three were americans  the storm had whipped the waters of the bay into a fury and the rain was so thick that to see even the island on which the wreck rested was impossible  dick cant come now said dora a boat on the bay would surely go down  having finished the meal lesher and baxter sat down in the living room to smoke and to talk over the situation the mate continued to drink and half an hour later he fell asleep sitting on the bench and with his head on the table  the beast said dora as she peeped out at him well there is one satisfaction she continued he cannot harm us while he is asleep  you girls better have your own dinner called out baxter i aint going to eat you up  we will get our dinner when we please said nellie as she came out we are not afraid of you dan baxter  no more was said for a long time the girls ate what little they wished and washed up the dishes the rain still continued to fall in torrents but the thunder and lightning drifted away to the eastward  dora was the most anxious of the trio and at every opportunity she tried to look through the driving rain toward the wreck  id give almost anything to know if dick is safe she murmured  dont be discouraged dora said grace perhaps he will return as soon as the storm is over  the girls were huddled close to a window looking out into the rain when dan baxter threw aside the pipe he had been smoking and approached them  see here girls he said why cant we be friends what is the use of being enemies in such a place as this  dan baxter we want you to keep your distance said nellie coldly  and if you do not it will be the worse for you when the others come back put in grace  humph i reckon you think it is fine to ride such a high horse sneered the bully what are you going to do when we bring the rest of the sailors over here well be eleven to seven then  never mind what well do said dora i would rather have the company of some of those sailors than your company  that is where you make a mistake the sailors are all rough fellows some of them worse than jack lesher now if you are willing to count me as a friend ill stand by you when the crowd comes over  we dont want your friendship dan baxter so there cried nellie we know your past and we know that you cannot be trusted  dont think i am as good as the rovers eh  we all know that you are not answered grace  what have you done to dick rover questioned dora he ought to be here long before this  oh i guess the storm is holding him back said baxter shifting uneasily as she gazed earnestly into his eyes  if anything has happened to dick i shall hold you responsible said dora  at that moment the fury of the storm cut off further talking a sudden rush of wind had come up whistling through the jungle and bringing down a palm close to the house with a crash the fall of the tree made baxter jump in alarm  the house is coming down he cried and ran outside  the wind made the waves in the bay rise higher and higher until they lashed furiously in all directions then came another downpour of rain which caused the bully to seek shelter again  hark said nellie suddenly and raised her hand for silence  what did you hear asked grace  somebody calling listen  all were silent once more and just then the wind fell a little  i dont hear anything said dora  but then followed a distant voicetwo voices calling desperately  help help our boat is sinking help     chapter xxiii  what happened on the bay   to go back to tom sam and captain blossom at the time that they placed the two dead goats in their rowboat and prepared to return to the camp  it was already raining by the time the shore of the bay was reached and scarcely had they begun to row when the water came pouring down in torrents  gracious i must say i dont like this cried tom the rain is running down my neck in a stream  i move we row into shore over yonder said sam pointing up the coast there are some trees which will shelter both us and the boat nicely  captain blossom was willing and in a few minutes they were under the trees and wringing out their clothes as best they could  if i know anything about it this storm is going to last for some time said the captain after a long look at the sky  such a downfall as this cant last said sam perhaps we can get home between showers  it was dry under the trees for about half an hour but then the water began to reach them once more and they had to shift their position again  this kept up for some time until all were wet through and thoroughly uncomfortable when tom proposed that they start for home regardless of the storm  we cant get any wetter than we are he declared and the sooner we reach the house the sooner well be able to change our clothes  the others agreed and when the worst of the lightning and thunder had passed they set off once more two rowing and the third steering the boat and bailing out the water which came in faster than was desirable  when it rains in the tropics it rains observed tom puts me in mind of that storm we met when we were in africa do you remember sam  indeed i do answered his brother i thought wed all be killed by the trees that fell in the jungle  have you been in africa came from captain blossom in astonishment  yes answered tom our father got lost there once and we went in search of him and he gave a few of the particulars as already related in another volume of this series entitled the rover boys in the jungle  well you boys have had some ups and downs said the captain but i reckon you werent cast away before like this  not like this answered sam but we were left on a lonely island once in lake huron and he related a few particulars of their exciting experiences with the baxters while on the great lakes  another downpour of rain cut off the talking and tom was kept busy bailing out the rowboat with three persons and the two dead goats the craft was pretty heavily loaded and more than once the rising wind swept some water over the bow  id give a little to be ashore again said tom presently it seems to me that the rain is shutting out everything  well have to land again lads put in the captain with a grave shake of his head this wind is growing worse we dont want to be swamped  they turned to what they thought must be the direction of the nearest shore but though they pulled with might and main for nearly quarter of an hour no land appeared  were mixed cried sam the storm has twisted us up  by this time the wind was blowing a regular gale on the bay it took off toms cap and in a twinkle the headgear was out of sight  my caps gone groaned the youth  the water is coming in over the bow came from sam we will be swamped  we must throw the goats overboard said the captain and overboard went the game much to the boys sorrow  this lightened the craft a little but still the waves swept over the gunwale and now both sam and tom set to bailing while the captain took both oars then came another blast of wind worse than before  i see land cried sam  we are going over yelled tom and the wind fairly whipped the words from his lips then came a mighty wave and on the instant the rowboat was upset and all three found themselves in the waters of the bay  as they went under the same thought was in the mind of each were there any sharks around  help help cried sam as soon as he came up our boat is sinking help and tom soon joined in the cry they had caught hold of the overturned boat but the craft for some reason failed to support them  captain blossom was close at hand and he advised them to strike out for the shore  its in this direction he said and led the way  ii cant swim very far with my clothes on gasped sam yet he struck out as best he could  hullo who calls came a cry from the shore and looking up they saw dora standing there with nellie and grace laning close beside her  its tom and sam cried nellie  and captain blossom added grace  perhaps we can throw them a rope came from dora and she ran to get the article she had mentioned  but by the time she returned the three swimmers had reached a point where they could touch bottom with their feet and watching for a favorable opportunity they rushed ashore almost into the arms of the girls  oh tom how glad i am that you are safe cried nellie while grace caught hold of sam and asked if he was all right  yes i amam all right butbut pretty well fagged out gasped sam  it was a close shave said captain blossom and our guns are gone  we had two dead goats too put in tom they went overboard first andgoodness graciousis that really dan baxter  dan baxter ejaculated sam and even captain blossom stared in amazement  i see youve had a rough time of it said baxter coming forward coolly how are you  he shook hands with captain blossom while the rover boys continued to stare at him  are you alone asked the master of the golden wave  no jack lesher is with me and we left nine of the sailors on another island  is that so where is lesher now  in the house asleep  he is intoxicated said nellie we has been drinking ever since he put in an appearance  humph thats like lesher muttered the captain and his brow darkened  all moved toward the house and entered to get out of the wet the mate was still at the table snoring loudly  might as well let him sleep it off said the captain but when he is sober ill have a talk with him  wet clothing was changed for dry and then the captain and the boys listened to what baxter and the girls had to tell the captain was glad to learn that so many of his men had been saved and asked for the names  i dont care much about peterson and mcglow he said they are tough customers i would rather have heard from peabody dickson and fearwell you dont know anything about them  no said dan baxter  this news about dick and old jerry worries me said tom  dan baxter i think you know more than you care to tell said sam boldly  the bully hardly knew how to reply he could not now fall back on jack lesher for support and he had thought to be on his way to rejoin the sailors ere this the storm had upset all of his calculations it had been a foolish movement to attack dick and old jerry and it now looked as if he must suffer for it  welleri dont mind telling you that dick and the mate had something of a quarrel he said hesitatingly  how did it end asked tom  i cant say exactly  why not you were with lesher at the time  no i wasnt he ordered me to get into the rowboat and wait for him while he went back to get a pistol or a gun i heard loud talking on the deck of the schooner and i knew a row was on i was just going back to the deck when the mate came and leaped into the rowboat he said the sailor and dick were going to remain behind and that we wouldnt wait any longer then we rowed over here  if thats the case ill make lesher tell us what happened cried tom and shook the mate roughly wake up here he cried wake up and give an account of yourself     chapter xxiv  in close quarters   slowly dick came to his senses he remembered little or nothing and only knew that all was dark around him and that his head was spinning like a top  for several minutes he remained quiet trying to collect his thoughts then he sat up and passed one hand slowly over his forehead  oh how my heed aches he murmured  it was fully five minutes before he felt like moving around then he arose and took a step forward and stumbled over old jerrys body  oh he murmured and felt of the body in the dark who is this can it be jerry he asked himself  then came a recollection of the cowardly attack but what had followed was a blank and he could not imagine where he was  dick remembered that he had a match safe in his pocket and soon he made a light by this he caught sight of a lantern in the brig and lit it then he bent over old jerry and saw that the sailor was still alive but suffering from his treatment  he must have been attacked too murmured dick the bucket of water was at hand and he took a drink and bathed captain jerrys forehead  it was fully half an hour before the old sailor felt at all like himself both sat down to review the situation  the cowards said dick what do you suppose they attacked us for  cant say as to that replied old jerry perhaps lesher wanted to show us he was master  hell settle with me if i ever get out of this hole jerry what place is this  the lockup of the golden wave i think it used to be an oil room  they gazed around them and soon discovered the can of ships biscuits and also the beans  they evidently meant to keep us prisoners for some time said dick hark what is that  both listened and made out the sounds of distant thunder and heard the patter of rain on the deck  a storm is brewing said old jerry it sounds as if it was putty heavy too  they tried the door to the brig but found it locked and bolted in vain dick kicked against it and shoved with his shoulder it refused to budge  this looks as if wed have to stay hereat least for the present said dick with a sigh i must say i dont like the prospect  how long do ye calculate weve been here lad  there is no telling unless by my watch but when he looked at the timepiece he found that it had stopped  they ate some of the biscuits and drank some water and rested for a while longer outside the wind blew furiously and they heard the rain and the waves dash in all directions then some water came trickling in slowly at one corner  it seems to me as if the wreck was shifting cried dick presently  it wont shift very far in this bed o sand lad but she may break up and go to pieces added old jerry  if she goes down well be drowned like rats in a trap said dick we must get out somehow  they talked the matter over and began a systematic examination of their prison the four walls were solid and so was the ceiling above them  the flooring has a couple of loose planks in it announced dick if we can get them up where will the opening lead to  the forward hold lad and that is now half full of sand and water  never mind im going to get the planks up if i can  with his head still aching dick set to work and old jerry helped him it was no easy matter to shift the heavy planking but after a while they got one plank up and then used this as a pry to bring up the second  a dark hole was revealed covered at the bottom with water then dick took the lantern and let himself down cautiously  the water is only about a foot deep he announced im going to make a search around with the lantern  hold on ill go with ye cried old jerry and came down with a splash  with great caution they moved around the hold wading through sand and water and climbing over boxes barrels and crates  what a mixture of cargo said dick and what a pity so much of it is going to ruin and he pointed to some valuable mining machinery which was rusting in the salt water  fortunately old jerry had been in the hold before the golden wave was wrecked so he knew something of the surroundings he led the way to some boxes directly beneath the forward hatch  i dont reckon the hatch is fastened down he said an if it aint we may be able to shove it up by standing one box on top of another  this was tried and after much difficulty the hatch was thrown to one side and they crawled to the deck of the schooner  im glad i am out of that ejaculated dick but how its raining let us go to the cabin for shelter  once in the cabin they proceeded to make themselves as comfortable as the state of affairs permitted  with no boat it is going to be no easy matter getting back to the house said dick he was much worried concerning the girls  well have to stay here until the storm is over said old jerry  but dick demurred and at last it was decided to try getting to the house by journeying from one island to the next  this was a dangerous proceeding as we already know they had to build themselves a small raft and carry this from one crossing to the next  by the time the last crossing was made the storm was clearing and the day was drawing to a close  we had best not show ourselves until we are sure how the land lays said dick as they came up the beach  captain jerry thought this good advice and they proceeded with caution until they came in sight of the house then dick set up a shout  tom sam and captain blossom are back hurrah  they look as if they were having a row with baxter and the mate came from old jerry  a row certainly was in progress and as they came closer they heard tom talking  yes lesher i want to know all about this quarrel with my brother dick i am sure he was not in the wrong  see here i know my own business the mate growled you shut up and leave me alone  we wont leave you alone came from sam we want to know the truth  yes tell us the truth lesher said captain blossom sternly  all against me aint you  we want the truth answered tom  well if you must have it all right he got cheeky and hit me on the head with an oar then i hit back and knocked him down then he got mad and so did jerry tolman and both refused to come back in the boat with baxter and me  ill wager you started to boss things said sam dick doesnt raise a row without just cause  good for sam murmured dick  your brother was entirely to blame grunted the mate he was still far from sober  jack lesher you tell what is not so said dick loudly and joined the group followed by old jerry  had a bombshell exploded lesher and baxter would not have been more astonished then stared at the newcomers as if they were ghosts  howerhow did you get here stammered baxter while the mate continued to stare in openmouthed astonishment  that is our affair responded dick he strode up to lesher you miserable villain how dare you say that i was to blame when you attacked me without warning take that for what you did  and hauling off dick hit the mate a fair and square blow in the nose which sent lesher flat on his back     chapter xxv  trying to come to terms   as the mate went down the girls gave a scream and even tom and sam looked at dick in wonder never had any of them seen the eldest rover so aroused  my lad that was a hard blow observed captain blossom as jack lesher lay where he had fallen  not half as hard as the blow he struck me answered dick  not hard as hard as thet chap hit me put in old jerry and turning quickly he flew at dan baxter and bore him to the ground  hi hi let up roared the bully let up take him off  ill let up when im done panted old jerry and he gave him a thump in the cheek another in the eye and a third on the chin now then dan baxter see how you like that and then the old sailor arose once more  illill began baxter in a terrible rage ill  shut up baxter until we hear what they have to say put in tom if you are not quiet ill give you a thumping on general principles  no more fighting commanded captain blossom dick rover tell us what happened on the wreck  dick told his story and then all listened to what old jerry had to say in the meantime jack lesher arose unsteadily to his feet  where is that boy he roared ill fix him and then he made a movement as if to draw his pistol but discovered that the weapon had been taken from him  who took my pistol he demanded  be quiet everybody said captain blossom lesher there will be no shootng here unless i have to make an example of somebody you had no business to attack dick rover on the wreck nor attack jerry tolman either it was a mean thing to do if we are to remain on these islands together we ought to keep friendly  i know my business growled the mate  and i know mine lesher please remember that i am captain  and i am first mate  your being first mate doesnt count with us came from tom  not for a minute added dick if i had my own way id pitch you out of this camp in doublequick order  and dan baxter with him put in sam  why cannot both of them go and live with the other sailors who were saved asked dora they could have their share of what is on the wreck  i see you dont care for their company said captain blossom well i cant say that i blame you miss after this they shall keep their distance they can either live on the wreck or build themselves their own house and so can the other sailors who were saved  you are not my master cried dan baxter on these islands all are equal  that may be so but you have got to let the others alone answered dick if you dont  what will you do  well punish you in a way you least expect  after this there was a general talk which almost ended in another allaround row but the rovers and captain blossom were firm and at last dan baxter and jack lesher said no more  we ought to remain on guard after this said dick to tom when they and sam were alone i dont want to trust our enemies for a single moment  and it was agreed that one or another should watch constantly  the storm cleared away as suddenly as it had come and the next morning the sun shone as brightly as ever  when baxter and lesher came to breakfast both were sullen the mate had wanted more liquor but captain blossom had refused to give him more than a single glass  you had better return to the others at once said the captain tell them they can come over here and then we will make arrangements as to how all hands shall live until some ship comes to take us away  the rovers suspected that dan baxter wished to remain behind leaving the mate to go after the others but lesher would not go alone and off they started at noon each carrying a good supply of food with him and also a pistol and some ammunition  i wish they werent coming back murmured dora  i wish the same dora said dick but it cant be helped and we must make the best of it  there was a general air of relief when the two had departed later on each told his or her story once more and a general conversation ensued regarding the future  lesher is not the man i thought he would be said captain blossom if he insists on getting drunk he will surely cause us a good deal of trouble and if i try to keep the liquor from him he will get ugly more than that he has several sailors with him who are old friends and they like their liquor just as much as he does  it was seen that the flag of distress was down as already mentioned and after baxter and lesher had departed tom and dick set off to put the flag up once more  the way was by no means easy for the storm had washed the dirt and stones in all directions and the path was strewn with broken branches and tornup bushes on the way they picked up hard a dozen dead birds and also saw three dead monkeys  when the spot where the flag had been was reached they found the tree still standing the halyard of the flag had snapped and the colors lay in a mass of bushes a hundred feet away  to get to the bushes the boys had to leap over something of a gully tom took the leap in safety but sam went down out of sight  help help cried the youngest rover  tom looked back to see sams fingers clutching at some brushwood which grew at the edge of the gully then the hand disappeared and he heard a crashing far below for though the gully was not wide it was very deep  sam sam he called are you hurt  no answer came back and much alarmed tom got on his knees and tried to look into the opening at first he could see nothing but when his eyes grew accustomed to the darkness he made out the form of his brother lying on some broken brushwood which the storm had swept into the opening  how to get down to sam was a problem and tom was revolving the matter in his mind when sam let out another cry  are you hurt sam  nnot much but mmy wind was knoknocked out of me  can you climb up to the top  hardly tom the sides are very steep andyes there is a regular cave down here went on sam  a cave  yes  where does it lead to  i dont know its on the south side of the opening  toms curiosity was aroused and bringing forth the new rope they had brought along for hoisting the flag he tied one end to a tree and lowered himself to his brothers side by this time sam was on his feet and inspecting some scratches his left hand had received  where is the cave sam  there and the youngest rover pointed it out  the opening was about two feet above the bottom of the gully it was perhaps four feet in diameter but appeared to grow larger within  if we had a torch we might investigate a bit said tom id like to know if the cave amounts to anything  it might have a pirates treasure in it eh  not likely sam i dont believe it has ever been used but if it was of good size it might prove handy for us at some time or another  they looked around and finding some dry brushwood made two rude torches with these flaring brightly they entered the opening the flooring of which was of rock and tolerably smooth  we could live in this cave if it wasnt that the opening to it is in the gully said sam as they advanced  there may be another opening at the other end said tom it is certainly quite long  they had advanced fully a hundred feet and now found themselves in a chamber forty or fifty feet square the ceiling was arched and so high that they could not touch it without jumping up  this is as good as a house said tom see how dry the flooring is that proves that it is waterproof  from the large chamber there were several passageways all leading toward the bay  which shall we investigate first asked sam  let us start at the right  all right tom the right ought to be right answered sam lightly  on they went once more the flooring now sloping before them here there was considerable moisture and they had to walk with care for fear of slipping down  suddenly a number of bats flew out of a hole nearby dashing against the torches and against the boys themselves the rush was so unexpected that each youth dropped his light and put up his hands to protect himself  get out let me alone spluttered sam  whoop roared tom confound the bats anyway get along and let us alone  lying on the flooring the torches soon went out and in their efforts to protect themselves from the bats the boys rushed blindly down the passageway then of a sudden both slipped on the wet rocks slid a distance of several yards and went down and down landing into a welllike opening with a loud splash     chapter xxvi  the cave on the island   tom  sam  are you safe  yes but i wasnt looking for such a cold bath as this  i guess we must have fallen into a regular well of spring water  never mind what we are in the question is how are we to get out  can you touch the top of the opening  no  neither can i  luckily the two boys could touch the bottom of the hole so they were in no danger of drowning they were in water up to their waists and calculated they had dropped a distance of two or three yards all was pitch dark around them and as silent as a tomb save for some water which trickled close at hand the bats had departed leaving them to their fate  this is caveinvestigating with a vengeance said tom with something like a shiver  never mind tom we wont die of thirst anyway  do you think this is a laughing matter sam  no i dont id give a good deal to be out of this hole and out of the cave also  ive got an idea let me climb on your shoulders and see if i can reach the top that way  sam was willing and soon tom was balancing himself as best he could he felt around with care sam moving from point to point as directed  here is a sharp rock i think i can pull myself up on that said tom he tried with all of his strength and went up off sams shoulders then the youngest rover heard him crawling around the wet flooring carefully  when tom felt fairly safe he brought out his waterproof match safe and lit a match then one of the torches was picked up and he lit that but kept it partly sheltered fearing another attack from the bats  by the aid of the torch sam was able to reach a sharp rock quite low down in the well hole and when tom gave him a hand he came up with ease both saw that the passage ended at the hole and hurried back to the main chamber of the cave  thats the time that right was not right said sam wringing the water from his trousers while tom did the same let us try the left after this  i trust we dont get left by it added sam  the passageway was small and winding but fairly level there were several sharp rocks to pass and then tom gave a cry  i see a light ahead  it must be an opening tam  exactly what i think  both hurried forward as they did this the opening appeared to grow larger and they saw a number of bushes ahead of them they pushed these aside and saw beyond a clear stretch of the bay and to the northward the house they had built the opening was twenty or thirty feet above the beach and hidden in the rocks and bushes  this is a short cut to the beach from the flagstaff said sam i wish we had put up the flag then we could carry the news of the cave to the others  let us hurry back sam it wont take so very long to put up the flag with the tree still standing  when they reached the gully they were careful that no further mishaps should befall them having picked up the flag they hoisted it once more stars down and then went back through the cave to the beach  as they had imagined the others were greatly interested in the news all left the house and visited the place the girls did not go any further than the main chamber but the captain dick and old jerry made a complete investigation taking care not to fall into the wellhole or any other unsafe place  as the boys say this cave may come in very handy some time said captain blossom in case of a very heavy wind storm it would be a good place for shelter  why couldnt the sailors lesher and baxter live here asked dick we dont want them and it will save them the trouble of building a house in case they dont want to live on the wreck  no i advise that we tell them nothing about the cave said tom if we should have a fight and get the worst of it we could hide here and they wouldnt be able to find us very readily  do you think it will get as far as that asked dora and her face showed she was much disturbed  i hope not dora said dick but you must remember that we have had some pretty sharp quarrels already  i think tom is right came from sam well not tell the others anything about the cave if they dont want to live on the wreck they can build a house or two just as we did  on returning to the shore of the bay captain blossom and tom went on a hunt along the beach and presently discovered the rowboat that had overturned with them during the storm  the craft was but little damaged and they soon had it mended and then the captain brought it around to the anchorage in front of the house  i wonder when baxter and lesher will arrive with the sailors said nellie  not before tomorrow night answered tom  then do you know what i would do if i were you went on the girl  what nellie  id bring some stores away from the wreck and hide them in the cave if you did that it might save us a good deal of trouble for all we know that mate might try to take command and refuse to let us get anything more from the ship  do you think hed do that while captain blossom was around came from grace  oh he might do anything when he is half full of liquor answered tom i think nellie is right ill talk it over with the others  tom lost no time in the matter and dick sam and old jerry agreed that nellies idea was very good captain blossom shrugged his shoulders and looked ugly  jack lesher shall not take the command from me he said if he tries it hell find himself in the biggest kind of a row  but you must admit that there is grave danger said dick  yes i admit that  then you are willing that we shall hide the stores  if you want to  wont you help us captain blossom of course we recognize the fact that those things belong to you since you remained on the ship up to the time she struck the island  this speech pleased the captain and he said he would help them willingly  without delay the two rowboats and the raft were called into commission and an hour later the men and boys were hard at work transferring goods from the wreck to the beach in front of the cave five trips were made back and forth the boats and the raft bringing over each time as much as could be conveniently floated  by the time the last trip was made and the goods piled on the beach and covered with a large tarpaulin it was dark and all were utterly worn out by their labors the girls had prepared an extra good supper and of this they ate heartily and then sat around a little while when they went to bed  at the beginning the castaways had kept guard during the night but of late this had been done away with everybody being satisfied that no harm could befall them during the darkness  but as the doorway to the house was an open one it had been considered the duty of one or the other to sleep directly in the opening this was dicks night and the eldest rover lay there sleeping soundly until about two in the morning  by this time the moon had disappeared and the stars were partly hidden by some clouds the night was quiet save for the hum of insects in the jungle back of the house and the soft laplap of the waves on the beach of the bay  suddenly dick awoke with a start he sat bolt upright wondering what had brought him to his senses so quickly he listened intently but nothing unusual greeted his ears  i must have been dreaming or something he thought but is queer i should be so wide awake  at first he was on the point of lying down again but then concluded to get up and get a drink of water  he arose to his feet and stood in the open doorway gazing into the darkness the faint light of a few stars shone in the waters of the bay and between the waters and himself he presently saw a dark form stealing along close to the ground  what could that be was it something real or only a shadow dick rubbed his eyes and peered out more sharply than ever it was not a shadow but a real form slowly moving around to the rear of the house  an animal or else a man crawling along said dick to himself and reached for his gun which stood close at hand then he made up his mind to investigate and stepped outside of the doorway for that purpose     chapter xxvii  a fight with a wild beast   as dick stepped out of the house gun in hand the form disappeared behind a small clump of bushes growing not fifty feet away  its gone he said to himself but waited patiently with his gun ready for use  the clouds were increasing making it darker than ever almost holding his breath the youth took several steps forward then he waited again  at last the form reappeared crouched lower than ever so that it was almost hidden by the rocks and low brushwood leading to the jungle at first dick imagined the beast or whatever it was was going to retreat to the timber but soon it appeared to turn back as if to make another semicircle this time around to the rear of the house  it must be admitted that dicks heart thumped madly in his breast the gun was raised and he kept his finger on the trigger but he did not dare to shoot until he was certain of the object of his aim  i dont want to kill anybody he reasoned and he thought of a story he had once read of a hunter shooting his companion who had got the nightmare and was crawling around in his sleep for all he knew it might be sam or tom or one of the others  but now came a sound which was not to be mistaken it was a low savage growl followed by the rustling of a bushy tail among the brushwood it was a wild animal and it was getting ready to make a leap for the boy  taking aim as best he could dick pulled the trigger bang went the firearm and a snarl of pain and rage rang out then the beast made its leap striking dick in the breast and knocking him over  hullo whats the row the cry came from old jerry who had been sleeping next to dick who fired that shot  help answered dick a wild beast has attacked me  a wild beast came from several throats at once  let me get a shot came from tom as he bounced out of the house pistol in hand followed by sam and captain blossom  by this time dick had gotten to his knees and was trying to fight off the animal which had fastened its teeth in the youths trouser leg for the boys slept with part of their garments on them  shoot him hit him over the head with a club screamed the eldest rover he expected every moment to have the beast fly at his throat and he knew that that would be his death  old jerry turned back to get a pistol or a club as he did this tom rushed past him and up to dicks side taking a hasty aim tom discharged the pistol twice  another growl rang out and the beast dropped back shot through the foreshoulder and the neck then tom let drive once more and the beast fell forward shot through the left front leg  good for you tom cried dick as he arose  what is it came from captain blossom as he appeared with a shotgun a shot from this finished the beast and it rolled over and over in its death agonies and sam finished it with a blow on the head with a big club  by this time the girls were crowding outside having clothed themselves with whatever was handiest torches were lit and a ships lantern and all went to examine the creature  it looks like a tiger declared tom only it is not quite so large  i should say it was a california puma came from old jerry hes a bad one too  i think they call them jaguars out here said dick they all belong to the same family you know some old american hunters would call it a painter  never mind what it is said dora with a shudder i am thankful that it is dead  you can be thankful that it didnt chew dick up added tom he was in a tight corner i can tell you that  i didnt want to shoot until i was certain of what i was shooting at answered dick then just as i fired the beast leaped for me if i hadnt wounded it it would have had me by the throat sure but my shot kind of made it fall back and it caught me by the trouser leg  are you sure you are not hurt lad asked the captain  not hurt in the least answered dick and all were thankful that this was so  the animal was dragged close to the cabin it measured about five feet in length regardless of the tail and was of a dull yellowish color its teeth were long and sharp and its face had a fierce bloodthirsty look about it that made all the girls shiver  i must confess that i am surprised to find such a beast on these islands said captain blossom usually they are to be found only on the mainland or on large islands  what i am wondering is are there any more around came from sam  if there are well have to be careful how we move around put in old jerry i dont want any of em to leap out at me from behind a rock  well have to be on the watch said tom im sure i dont want to furnish any tropical tiger cat with a square meal  oh tom how awful to even mention it cried nellie  i think i know a way to keep em away from the house at night said old jerry  how questioned several  keep a campfire burning close to the door all wild animals hate a fire  jerry is right said captain blossom well do it after this  what shall we do with the beast asked dick i dont think it is good to eat  save the skin said dora that will surely make an elegant rug  leave the carcass until morning said captain blossom we must get some more sleep if we want to go to work tomorrow  today you mean said tom looking at his watch it is already three oclock  a campfire was lit and then all but jerry retired it being agreed that the old sailor was to turn in once more when the others arose for breakfast all but dick slept soundly but even the eldest rover was benefited by the additional rest  the first work in the morning was to skin the wild beast this was rather a difficult task since no one had had any experience outside of the rover boys on small game old jerry said he would try a steak cut from the best part of the the animal but when he did he said it was too tough to eat then the carcass was dragged away and flung into a hole between the rocks  after breakfast the men and boys began in earnest to place the stores brought to the beach in the cave it was hard work getting the boxes and barrels up the incline to the mouth of the cave and the work took until the middle of the afternoon once at the entrance the stores were speedily shifted to the chamber previously mentioned and covered again with the tarpaulin with the stores were placed a cask of fresh water some dry pine torches and a box of matches captain blossom left a gun and some ammunition in the cave and the rover boys added two pistols and a couple of swords taken from the ship  now we will rearrange the entrance to the cave as it was before said dick then the sailors will never suspect what we have done  by sunset the work was over and all hands were back at the house taking it easy supper was ready but they waited hard an hour thinking that baxter lesher and their party would put in an appearance at any moment  i reckon they arent coming just yet said captain blossom at length let us wait no longer  im willing said tom the extra work had sharpened his appetite wonderfully  the evening passed quietly and soon one after another retired as agreed the campfire was left burning and each took his turn at remaining on guard  in the morning it was dora who made an announcement that startled all of them the girl had taken captain blossoms spyglass and was looking across the bay in the direction of the wreck  there are men on board of the golden wave she announced i can see them quite plainly  men on board of the wreck cried dick are you sure dora  look for yourself dick  the youth did so and saw that dora was right half a dozen figures could be seen walking to and fro  who are they asked tom lesher and his crowd  that i cant make out answered dick and handed over the glass to his brother  all could see the men on the wreck but at such a distance it was impossible to make out any faces  maybe they are savages came from grace  no they are dressed like white people said captain blossom  perhaps another ship has come in ejaculated tom if it has we are saved  i dont see any other ship said old jerry  it may be on the other side of yonder island came from sam  the best thing we can do is to row over and investigate said captain blossom if another ship has come in the captain may claim that wreck and everything on board  a hasty breakfast was prepared and eaten and it was agreed that the captain dick and old jerry should row over to the wreck in the best of the boats the three were soon on the way wondering whom they were to meet and what sort of a reception would be tendered to them     chapter xxviii  the mate shows his hand   captain blossom had taken the spyglass along and as they drew closer to the wreck he gazed long and earnestly at the men walking the deck of the golden wave  they are my crew he announced at last and they are in tatters  they must have had a hard time of it since you were cast ashore said dick  unless i am mistaken not a one of them is sober went on the captain they are cutting up like a band of wild indians  before long they were within hailing distance of those on the wreck then a voice from the rail hailed them  boat ahoy  ahoy answered the captain  what do you want demanded the sailor on the wreck he could scarcely talk straight  we want to come on board  sorry capn but i cant let you come aboard answered the sailor with something of a hiccough  cant let me come aboard repeated the captain why not  cause its agin orders  whose orders  captain leshers  captain lesher ejaculated captain blossom indignantly how long has he been a captain  we made him capn yesterday  thats right put in another sailor we lected him unannan nanmously yes sir unannannanmously  you are drunk bostwick  no sir aint drunk at alllesher hes drunkbut hes capn all the same  thats right put in a third sailor hurrah for captain lesher and the rum he let us have  got to keep off i tell you went on bostwick if you dont we haveerwe have strict orders to fire on you yes sir  to fire on us cried dickdo you mean to say you would fire on us  now see here dont you put in your oar said a fourth sailor you dont count with us its the capn that was were talkin to  i am captain still said captain blossom firmly if you dont want to obey me you must leave the ship  aint going to leave no ship was the cry she belongs to us you keep off  yes yes keep off added the others on the deck  the ship is mine said the captain if you refuse to let me come on board  at that moment two other figures appeared on deck  dan baxter and jack lesher murmured dick  captain blossom you had better keep your distance said lesher in a voice that showed he was just getting over a spell of drunkenness  so you too refuse to let me come on board  i do the boys have made me their captain and as such i am bound to look after their interests i have told them what you proposed to do and they dont intend to stand it  didnt i tell you wed get square put in dan baxter his evil face glowing with triumph we have all that is on board and we mean to keep everything  this is mutiny stormed captain blossom  call it what you please answered lesher recklessly i reckon i and the boys know what we are doing  thats right cried the halfdrunken sailors hurrah for capn lesher hes a man after our own hearts  supposing i demand to be let on board went on captain blossom  dont ye go capn whispered old jerry they are in jest a fit mood to kill ye the rum has put the old nick in em  you cant come on board and that settles it roared jack lesher drawing a pistol keep your distance  yes keep your distance added baxter and also showed a firearm  this is a fine way to treat us after what we did for you said dick but wait baxter the end is not yet  bah i am not afraid said the bully these men are all my friends and we know exactly what we are doing  do you expect to remain on the wreck asked the captain after a moment of silence  that is our business answered lesher  i think you will find that you are making a great mistake men to follow lesher when you ought to follow me i have always treated you fairly and  hi none of that roared the mate we wont listen to it  the men shall listen if they will i  say another word and ill fire cried the mate and pointed his pistol at captain blossoms head  dodo you mean that asked the captain in as steady a voice as he could command  of course he means it said dan baxter he isnt a fool we are all going to stand by him too he added  thats right came from part of the crew dick noticed that a few of the others looked doubtful  i mean it and i want you to leave right now stormed jack lesher ill give you one minute in which to turn your boat around and he pulled out his watch  might as well go back whispered old jerry you cant reason with a lot of halfdrunken men  very well well go back said captain blossom loudly but remember you havent seen the end of this affair  and remember another thing added dick in an equally loud voice dont any of you dare to come anywhere near our house if you do youll be sorry for it  then the three turned the boat around and rowed slowly back whence they had come  the rascals muttered captain blossom when they were out of hearing lesher and baxter have poisoned the minds of the crew against me and have bought over the men with liquor  its a mighty good thing ye put them stores in the cave came from old jerry if ye hadnt wed be awantin a good many things in a few days  that is true answered dick dora told me they must have another barrel of flour by day after tomorrow  how many at the cave  two  well it certainly was a good job done said the captain but it makes me boil to think they want to keep me off my own ship on the ocean that would be mutiny and i could hang every mothers son of them from the yardarm for it  lesher must have told em some putty strong stories said old jerry otherwise the men wouldnt be so dead set agin ye capn  no doubt he made out the strongest possible case  i wonder if they will stick to the wreck all the time said dick theyll find it mighty hot when the sun shines  oh theyll most likely take some of the things ashore and set up a camp nearby rover  well have to watch them closely  i agree with you now we have two kinds of enemiesbeasts and men and the captain laughed bitterly  the others were gathered on the shore awaiting their return and they listened attentively to what was told them  oh lesher wanted to be leader you could see that right off declared tom and baxter will do anything to make it disagreeable for us boys he continued  well there is one satisfaction said nellie we havent baxter with us  if only a ship would stop here and take us away sighed dora to her it seemed like an age since they had landed on the seven islands  after this we must keep a regular guard announced dick unless we do that somebody may play us foul when we least expect it  slowly the day wore away by the aid of the spyglass they could see the sailors still on the deck of the wreck nobody appeared to go ashore  that night it fell to sams lot to be on guard from nine to ten oclock the campfire was left burning brightly and the youngest rover sat near it on a log a gun in his lap  no wild beast shall surprise me he told himself and kept his eyes on the jungle back of the house  his time for guard duty had almost come to an end when a noise down on the beach attracted his attention by the faint light he made out a raft which had just come in bearing the figures of two sailors  stop he called out do not come closer at your peril  dont shoot called back one of the sailors dont shoot we mean no harm  sam had backed up toward the house and now he called to those within he was soon joined by captain blossom dick and several of the others  who is it asked the captain as he came forth pistol in hand  two of the sailors from the wreck i think  dont shoot us captain called one of the men we are unarmed and want to talk with you  they are gibson and marny said captain blossom they were generally pretty good sort of fellows i reckon we have nothing to fear from them  are you alone called out dick  yes  then come up to the fire but mind no treachery  we dont wonder at your being on guard said the sailor named gibson a tall thin yankee the others treated you like so many dogs  we have deserted lesher put in marny we came over here on the raft to see if you wouldnt take us in  were you alone asked captain blossom  no we had hackenhaven with us but he fell overboard just after we left the wreck and the sharks caught him answered gibson with a bitter shake of his face  what did lesher say to your leaving asked tom  he didnt know it until after we were a hundred yards or more from the wreck you see he and the others were drinking in the cabin so we got away without much trouble answered marny they might have shot at us but it was too dark for them we had a hard pull to get over here and when poor hackenhaven was gobbled up both of us felt bad i can tell you  it was now seen that both sailors were almost exhausted and captain blossom allowed them to rest while dick prepared a pot of coffee while they were drinking gibson told them the particulars of how the mate had made himself leader of the sailors now left on the wreck     chapter xxix  the burning of the wreck   when lesher and baxter got back to where they left us they were very bitter against you began gibson they told us that you had tried to make them work like niggers fixing up this house they said that they wanted to come right back and bring us here but you wouldnt let them go until the house was finished  which is not true as all of us here know said captain blossom  lesher also said that you were angry at us for leaving the ship before the rest and that you had said you would have us all tried for mutiny the first chance you got baxter said the same and also told us that you were going to dump all the rum and other liquor into the ocean so that the mate and none of the others could get a drop of it while they stayed on the islands  i didnt say that but i did say that lesher shouldnt have all he wanted replied the captain  this sort of talk made most of the sailors wild went on gibson then lesher made a speech to them and they voted to stick by him through thick and thin and not let you rule them he promised them all the liquor they wanted and told them that if they stuck by him the whole lot could swear in court that they had found the wreck deserted so that they could get whatever was coming in the way of salvage then he handed around some liquor he had brought along and some pistols and most of them said they would stick to him as i said before  what about going directly to the wreck asked tom  that was baxters idea and it wasnt thought of until we were on our way to this spot baxter said that if we captured the ship we would have you at our mercy for sooner or later your provisions would run out and youd be begging for something to eat  the scoundrel cried dick so he thought to starve us into submission eh well he shant do it  i said i didnt think it would be fair on the young ladies continued gibson but he told me hed take care of the girls after he had brought you to your knees  hell never take care of me cried dora  nor me came from nellie  id rather die than leave this place in dan baxters company added grace  captain i want you to understand that gibson and i didnt agree to what they wanted to do came from marny but we were overruled and we had to hold our tongues for fear of being knocked down or shot  do you want to join our crowd asked dick bluntly  we do and if youll take us in well promise to stand by you to the end no matter what comes we know theyve got the best of ithaving the ships storesbut we dont care for that they are a drunken goodfornothing crowd and we are done with them  all right men i think we can trust you said captain blossom its a pity that hackenhaven was lost overboard and eat up by the sharks we could rather have spared lesher  or dan baxter observed tom  with three gone they have but eight men left on the wreck said sam and we now number seven men and three ladies if we stand our ground i cant see as we have much to fear from them  it will be all right so long as they keep their distance said captain blossom but if they come over here in a body when they are half full of drink there is sure to be a row and probably some shooting still we neednt try to meet trouble halfway  the sailors gave some more of the details of their doings while in leshers company and then they were provided with additional clothing and each was given a pistol and some ammunition nothing was said to them about the cave or the provisions stored there captain blossom deeming it best to wait and make sure if they were to be thoroughly trusted  you see said he they may be straight enough or they may be spies sent by lesher to find out just what we propose to do  they look honest said dick i should trust them  the long pull on the bay had worn the two sailors out and they were soon sleeping soundly the girls followed and then the boys started to turn in  sam had just gone to rest and tom was following when dick who had stepped out on the beach uttered a cry  whats up asked captain blossom  look toward the wreck what does that light mean  the captain looked and then ran for his spyglass  the golden wave is afire he exclaimed that light is coming up out of the cabin  the wreck is on fire shouted tom and this cry brought everybody out once more  with remarkable rapidity the light grew brighter until the heavens and the entire bay were lit up by the conflagration there was a strong wind blowing which carried the sparks to the jungle back of the ship listening intently they could occasionally hear the roaring and crackling of the flames  the ship is doomed that is certain said sam i wonder if all who were on board escaped  the fire has caught in the brushwood on the shore announced captain blossom who had continued to use the spyglass  can you see any of the men moving around questioned dora  i thought i saw one or two but i am not certain most of the men must have escaped but if they were drunk as gibson says perhaps some have been caught like rats in a trap  the flames continued to roar upward and toward the island back of the ship for over an hour during that time they heard two dull explosions caused by some barrels of chemicals catching fire the second explosion sent the bits of burning wood and rigging flying in all directions  that will leave the mutineers without a home and without stores said old jerry theyre in a poor fix now  id like to know how the fire started said the captain can you explain it he went on to gibson and marny  ive got an idea said marny just before we came away old man shular went down in the hold with a light to look for some certain brand of liquor we were carrying he was more than half drunk and he most likely dropped his lantern and set something on fire  at the end of an hour and a half the flames had died down to the waters edge a few small bits of wreckage continued to burn and also a grove of trees and brushwood on the island but before morning every bit of the fire was out and only a heavy smoke showed where the golden wave had once rested  no one had thought of retiring again and sunrise found them all worn out and anxious to know what was going to happen next  you can rest assured that some of them will be over here sooner or later said dick now they have no place to shelter them and no provisions they will want us to help them out  what will you do dick asked dora  that depends on captain blossom dora personally i want nothing to do with any of them  but some may be badly burnt and they may need medicine and bandages came from nellie  we can send them whatever we can spare said tom but i object strongly to letting anybody come here  it was decided to remain on guard during the day and all were cautioned to keep within call of the house the bay was scanned for the sight of a rowboat but none put in an appearance  ill wager that those who did escape are sorry they quarreled with us said sam  especially dan baxter answered grace hell find that living out in the woods isnt so pleasant as it looks  by nightfall all grew anxious and sat in front of the house to discuss the situation  it cant be possible that all on board were burnt up said dick that would be horrible  oh some must have escaped answered captain blossom but they may be suffering from burns or they may have no means of getting here with the ship burnt up and all the tools gone it would be no easy matter to build even the roughest kind of a raft  what do you think about some of us rowing over to what is left of the wreck asked sam  i was thinking of that but if we do that we had better wait until tomorrow morning you cant see much in the dark  if i thought anybody was dying for the want of aid id go over said tom we all know what brutes lesher and baxter are they wouldnt hesitate to go off and leave some of the others to die where they had fallen  i think tom is right and some of us ought to go over said dick  im willing to go announced old jerry we can move around like cats in the dark so they wont know we are near until we tell em  you might take some medicines along and some bandages said nellie  take a bottle of sweet oil and some flour put in grace they are both good for burns  the matter was talked over until midnight and then it was settled that dick tom and old jerry should take the largest rowboat and some bandages and medicines and row over to the vicinity of the fire they were to land on the beach below what was left of the wreck and crawl through the bushes on a tour of discovery if they found that they were not absolutely needed they were to return without making their presence known to the mutineers and dan baxter  the two boys and the old sailor were soon on the way care had been taken to wrap cloth around the oars where they slipped in the rowlocks so that the boat moved through the water as noiselessly as a shadow  once out in the bay the boys and old jerry pulled with a will and in less than half an hour the beach north of what was left of the wreck was gained they approached with great caution  do you see or hear anything whispered tom  no answered dick and then the rowboat grated on the sand and all leaped ashore  with their medicines and bandages in their pockets and pistols in hand they commenced to crawl through the bushes before long they came to a point from which they could look toward the wreck all was dark and deserted and the air was filled with the smell of burnt wood and water  i dont see anybody do you whispered dick  nary a soul in sight answered old jerry  with equal care they moved around to the other side of the wreck over a mass of burnt brushwood  hark said tom  they listened and from a distance made out a faint groan  that is somebody and in great pain said dick come on and he led the way  around a pile of rocks they found a sailor he was propped up against a tree and was suffering from some burns on his legs and feet  bostwick said old jerry  oh oh help me groaned bostwick piteously give me a drink of water  where are the others asked dick  gone they left me to take care of myself oh the wretches please help me wont you for the love of heaven  yes we will help you answered tom  you are certain they have all gone went on dick as he got out some oil and bandages while tom ran for water  yes yes  where did they go  they wentoh my legs and feet how they smart they went to thethehouse lesher said you must have set the ship on fire and baxter said the same theyoh what a pain please be careful bostwick gulped down the water tom gave him that is good  what did they say bostwick asked dick as he continued to work over the hurt man  they said they were going to pay you back they all went armed that is all but me and shular shular was burnt up they said they were going to shoot you down on sight and then run the house to suit themselves i saidoh the pain iihow weak i am  and with those words the burnt sailor fell back in a dead faint     chapter xxx  the defense of the cavesaved   he has fainted poor fellow said dick as he bent over the unconscious form of bostwick  we ought to git back to the house at once put in old jerry we must warn the capn and the others of what lesher and his crowd intend to do  that is true but we cant leave this poor chap here he might die for the want of care came from tom  well take him along said dick come lift him up  as carefully as they could they lifted the unconscious form up and bore it to where the rowboat was lying soon all were on board and while tom did his best to revive bostwick dick and old jerry bent their back to the oars pulling as they had seldom pulled before  the beach in front of the house was almost gained when they heard a shot ring out followed by several others  just as i feared groaned dick lesher and the others have begun the attack  then well have to be careful how we land said old jerry if we aint we may run right into em  there was no moon but the stars shone brightly so the beach line was dimly visible in the distance standing up in the bow tom saw a flash of fire from the jungle below the house and heard the crack of a firearm then he saw some dark forms running along the beach  our party is making for the cave he cried we had better turn in that direction  several other shots followed but they could not tell if anybody was hit in the distance several rumcrazed sailors were yelling like so many indians  bostwick came to his senses just as the sand was reached  whewhere am i he asked feebly oh my feet  we have brought you with us bostwick answered dick keep still and we will do what we can for you  as soon as possible they took the hurt man up and all started for the entrance to the cave  who goes there cried a voice out of the darkness  is that you sam called back dick  dick i am glad you are back they attacked the house and we are going to the cave to  yes we know all about it sam we have brought one of the sailors along he is badly burnt are the girls safe  i guess so we told them to go ahead answered sam  carrying bostwick between them dick and old jerry soon reached the cave where they found the three girls standing in a group each full of dread over what was occurring hardly had they gotten inside when captain blossom came up on a run accompanied by gibson and marny  back are you he said i am glad to see it but it may put you in a tight hole hullo so youve got bostwick with you eh everybody get into the cave just as quick as you can  once inside of the cave captain blossom commanded everybody to he silent the hurt sailor was carried to the inner chamber where a lantern was lit for it would be impossible to see this light from outside then the girls set to work to make bostwick comfortable  has anybody been shot asked tom  i got a bullet scratch on the arm answered the captain and marny got a few buckshot in his shoulder but neither of the hurts amount to anything  what do you think the mutineers will do next  ransack the house first said sam oh but they are a bad crowd they came on like a lot of demons  of course baxter was with them  yes but he kept in the background for fear i suppose of being shot  with caution one after another left the mouth of the cave to look in the direction of the house no one outside of their own party was visible  suddenly a glare lit up the scene growing brighter each instant  by the great boots ejaculated captain blossom they have set the house on fire  that shows how crazy they are declared dick in their rage they are liable to do anything ten to one they get to fighting between themselves before this is over  the house being built of semigreen logs burnt slowly as it was consumed they heard some of the sailors singing and yelling and heard several pistol shots and a scream of pain  some of them are coming now announced sam half an hour later  everybody get back out of sight cried captain blossom  there was a wild scramble and in the rush tom tripped and fell his foot struck a stone which went rolling down to the mutineers feet  hi hi there they are came in a rough thick voice  where roared back the voice of jack lesher  up there among the rocks and bushes  lets go after em  shoot em down boys they deserve it for burning up the ship  up the rocks came the harddrunken sailors accompanied by lesher and with dan baxter in their rear  back back all of you stand back cried captain blossom come a step nearer at your peril we are all armed and ready to fire  at these words the sailors halted for a moment  say capn why did you set the ship afire asked an unsteady voice  we had nothing to do with that answered captain blossom we were all over on this island when the blaze started  its a lie came in the voice of lesher  of course its a lie added dan baxter they did their best to burn every one of us up  it is the truth cried dick now stand back or we shall fire on you  come on yelled lesher and fired a pistol at those near the mouth of the cave  if ever i get the chance to have you tried every one of you shall be hung for mutiny and murder cried captain blossom and then fired in return  the bullet hit dan baxter in the arm and he fell back with a shriek of pain  i am killed i am killed he moaned and ran down toward the beach  then came a volley from the mutineers followed by one from those in the cave  oh what a close shave muttered tom a bullet had grazed his ear cutting away one of his curly locks  lesher was wounded in the shoulder and in a moment more of the mutineers ran off feeling that they were at a disadvantage  they can see us out in the open while we cant see them for the rocks and bushes said one sailor let us wait till morning  and so it was decided  inside of the cave a council of war was held and it was decided to block up the entrance fronting the bay with large rocks leaving only two loopholes open for watching and for possible shooting  all of the wounded ones were cared for and then a watch was set in the meantime bostwick was put at ease and he told the particulars of what happened on the burning wreck and how lesher and baxter had urged the mutineers to attack those at the house  the remainder of the night wore away slowly nothing more was seen of the mutineers who had retired to the jungle drank more liquor and gone to sleep baxter with them moaning and groaning over his wound  i am going to take a look around said tom early in the morning  a look around where asked dick  from where we have the signal of distress i dont believe any of the mutineers are in that vicinity  ill go with you put in sam and so it was decided  it was an easy matter for the two boys to make their way to the gully entrance and with great caution they climbed out of the opening and walked to where the flag of distress floated in the breeze not a sight of the mutineers or dan baxter was to be had in any direction  they are either sleeping or else they are afraid well shoot at them if they show themselves said tom and he added i am going to climb the tree and take a look around  be careful cautioned sam nevertheless he went up the tall tree with his brother  once in the tree directly under the flag they took a careful look around the island and then out to sea  my gracious sam look screamed tom suddenly and pointed out to the ocean  a ship a ship ejaculated sam  yes and do you see what kind of a ship it is a warship and an american warship at that  hurrah tom we are saved  yes yes they are sailing this way our flag of distress has been seen hurrah  we must tell the others right away  both slid down the tree with all haste as they reached the bottom a gun boomed out across the waves  that is to let us know that our signal has been seen said tom wont the others be delighted when they know a ship an american ship at that is so close at hand  as quickly as they could they reentered the cave and ran to where they had left the others  the good news spread like lightning  a ship an american warship is coming was the cry  oh how thankful i am came from dora  what shall we do next asked nellie with tears of joy streaming down her cheeks  well go to the shore and meet the small boat that is sent in answered captain blossom  without delay he set out accompanied by dick and old jerry leaving the others to defend the cave during his absence  it was nearly two hours before he returned  the ship is the cruiser jefferson he said she is bound for honolulu to await orders the captain says he will take us on board willingly and he will do what he can to help us bring those other fellows to justice  hurrah cried tom if that is so then our troubles as castaways are over  and we are not sorry said grace not a bit sorry  and all of the others agreed with her    a few words more and i will bring to a close this story of the rover boys adventures on land and sea  the captain of the warship was true to his word and before nightfall all who had been in the cave were safe on board of the jefferson those who were wounded or hurt were given the best of medical attention and everybody was made comfortable  what attracted me to the islands was the bright reflection in the sky when the wreck was burnt said the captain of the cruiser i thought perhaps that a volcano had become active but at daybreak we saw nothing unusual and were about to turn away when the lookout discovered your flag of distress  what will you do about the mutineers and dan baxter asked dick  well bring them to justice if we can lad  when a visit was paid to the burnt house nobody was in sight but in the woods nearby a wounded sailor was discovered he was badly hurt and though given every care died two days later while on shipboard  youll have a job finding lesher baxter and the others he said when being attended they said they wouldnt give in to anybody and when they learned the warship was here they rowed away in a boat for one of the other islands theyll hide away until after you are gone  if thats the case let them stay here said captain blossom it will be punishment enough for them to live here without any stores  they may find those at the cave said tom  even so those stores wont last forever said dick yes they will be punished enough for there is no telling when another ship will stop here and take them away  more than likely theyll have to remain here a year or two said captain blossom  everything of value was taken to the warship and twentyfour hours later the jefferson steamed away on her journey to the hawaiian islands  how glad mother will be to learn that i am safe said dora to dick  it will be good news to all of our folks answered dick they will welcome us as from the grave  i hope we can get a steamer directly from honolulu to san francisco said tom our little vacation has proved unusually long  do you think that we will ever see dan baxter again questioned sam  i hardly think so said dick after what has happened he will not dare to show his face again but dan baxter did show himself and what he did to harm the rover boys in the future will be told in another volume of this series entitled the rover boys in camp or the rivals of pine island in which we shall meet many of our old friends again it may be as well to mention here that baxter and two sailors escaped from the seven islands just one week after our friends left it the others including jack lesher lost their lives while in a quarrel over the last bottle of rum which the mate had brought with him from the burning wreck their taking off was an awful example of the evils of intemperance  it was soon seen that bostwick was not seriously burnt and before the trip to honolulu was over he was able to sit up and to walk a little the wounds of those who had been shot proved slight  we are well out of that adventure said tom one evening as the rover boys and the girls sat on the deck in the starlight and i dont know as i want to go through anything like it again  all i am thinking of is home sweet home said sam  just what was in my mind answered dick how father and uncle randolph and aunt martha will welcome us  let us sing put in dora and in a moment more all were singing the first verse of home sweet home and here let us bid them goodby
