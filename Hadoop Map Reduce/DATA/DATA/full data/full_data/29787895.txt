224     a boys town     i  earliest experiences   i call it a boys town because i wish it to appear to the reader as a town appears to a boy from his third to his eleventh year when he seldom if ever catches a glimpse of life much higher than the middle of a man and has the most distorted and mistaken views of most things he may then indeed look up to the sky and see heaven open and angels ascending and descending but he can only grope about on the earth and he knows nothing aright that goes on there beyond his small boys world some people remain in this condition as long as they live and keep the ignorance of childhood after they have lost its innocence heaven has been shut but the earth is still a prison to them these will not know what i mean by much that i shall have to say but i hope that the ungrownup children will and that the boys who read harpers young people will like to know what a boy of forty years ago was like even if he had no very exciting adventures or threadbare escapes perhaps i mean hairbreadth escapes but it is the same thingthey have been used so often i shall try to describe him very minutely in his daily doings and dreamings and it may amuse them to compare these doings and dreamings with their own for convenience i shall call this boy my boy but i hope he might have been almost anybodys boy and i mean him sometimes for a boy in general as well as a boy in particular  illustration the first lock  it seems to me that my boys town was a town peculiarly adapted for a boy to be a boy in it had a river the great miami river which was as blue as the sky when it was not as yellow as gold and it had another river called the old river which was the miamis former channel and which held an island in its sluggish loop the boys called it the island and it must have been about the size of australia perhaps it was not so large then this town had a canal and a canalbasin and a first lock and a second lock you could walk out to the first lock but the second lock was at the edge of the known world and when my boy was very little the biggest boy had never been beyond it then it had a hydraulic which brought the waters of old river for mill power through the heart of the town from a big reservoir and a little reservoir the big reservoir was as far off as the second lock and the hydraulic ran under mysterious culverts at every streetcrossing all these streams and courses had fish in them at all seasons and all summer long they had boys in them and now and then a boy in winter when the thin ice of the mild southern ohio winter let him through with his skates then there were the commons a wide expanse of open fields where the cows were pastured and the boys flew their kites and ran races and practised for their circuses in the tanbark rings of the real circuses  there were flocks of wild ducks on the reservoirs and on old river and flocks of kildees on the commons and there were squirrels in the woods where there was abundant mast for the pigs that ran wild in them and battened on the nuts under the hickorytrees there were no other nuts except walnuts white and black but there was no end to the small sweetish acorns which the boys called chinquepins they ate them but i doubt if they liked them except as boys like anything to eat in the vast cornfields stretching everywhere along the river levels there were quails and rabbits in the sumac thickets and turnip patches there were places to swim to fish to hunt to skate if there were no hills for coasting that was not so much loss for there was very little snow and it melted in a day or two after it fell but besides these natural advantages for boys there were artificial opportunities which the boys treated as if they had been made for them gristmills on the river and canal cottonfactories and sawmills on the hydraulic ironfounderies by the commons breweries on the riverbank and not too many schoolhouses i must not forget the markethouse with its public market twice a week and its long rows of marketwagons stretching on either side of high street in the dim light of the summer dawn or the cold sun of the winter noon  the place had its brief history running back to the beginning of the century mad anthony wayne encamped on its site when he went north to avenge st clairs defeat on the indians it was at first a fort and it remained a military post until the tribes about were reduced and a fort was no longer needed to this time belonged a tragedy which my boy knew of vaguely when he was a child two of the soldiers were sentenced to be hanged for desertion and the officer in command hurried forward the execution although an express had been sent to lay the case before the general at another post the offence was only a desertion in name and the reprieve was promptly granted but it came fifteen minutes too late  i believe nothing more memorable ever happened in my boys town as the grownup world counts events but for the boys there every day was full of wonderful occurrence and thrilling excitement it was really a very simple little town of some three thousand people living for the most part in small onestory wooden houses with here and there a brick house of two stories and here and there a lingering logcabin when my boys father came to take charge of its whig newspaper in 1840 it stretched eastward from the river to the canalbasin with the markethouse the county buildings and the stores and hotels on one street and a few other stores and taverns scattering off on streets that branched from it to the southward but all this was a vast metropolis to my boys fancy where he might get lostthe sum of all disasterif he ventured away from the neighborhood of the house where he first lived on its southwestern border it was the great political year of tippecanoe and tyler too when the grandfather of our president harrison was elected president but the wild hardcider campaign roared by my boys little life without leaving a trace in it except the recollection of his father wearing a linseywoolsey huntingshirt belted at the waist and fringed at the skirt as a whig who loved his cause and honored the good old pioneer times was bound to do i dare say he did not wear it often and i fancy he wore it then in rather an ironical spirit for he was a man who had slight esteem for outward shows and semblances but it remained in my boys mind as clear a vision as the long cloak of blue broadcloth in which he must have seen his father habitually this cloak was such a garment as people still drape about them in italy and men wore it in america then instead of an overcoat to get under its border and hold by his fathers hand in the warmth and dark it made around him was something that the boy thought a great privilege and that brought him a sense of mystery and security at once that nothing else could ever give he used to be allowed to go as far as the street corner to enjoy it when his father came home from the printingoffice in the evening and one evening never to be forgotten after he had long been teasing for a little axe he wanted he divined that his father had something hidden under his cloak perhaps he asked him as usual whether he had brought him the little axe but his father said feel feel and he found his treasure he ran home and fell upon the woodpile with it in a zeal that proposed to leave nothing but chips before he had gone far he learned that this is a world in which you can sate but never satisfy yourself with anything even hard work some of my readers may have found that out too at any rate my boy did not keep the family in firewood with his axe and his abiding association with it in afterlife was a feeling of weariness and disgust so i fancy that he must have been laughed at for it besides the surfeit of this little axe he could recall when he grew up the glory of wearing his philadelphia suit which one of his grandmothers had brought him over the mountains as people said in those days after a visit to her pennsylvania german kindred beyond the alleghanies it was of some beatified plaid in gay colors and when once it was put on it never was laid aside for any other suit till it was worn out it testified unmistakably to the boys advance in years beyond the shameful period of skirts and no doubt it commended him to the shadowy little girl who lived so far away as to be even beyond the streetcorner and who used to look for him as he passed through the palings of a garden among hollyhocks and fouroclocks  the young people may have heard it said that a savage is a grownup child but it seems to me even more true that a child is a savage like the savage he dwells on an earth round which the whole solar system revolves and he is himself the centre of all life on the earth it has no meaning but as it relates to him it is for his pleasure his use it is for his pain and his abuse it is full of sights sounds sensations for his delight alone for his suffering alone he lives under a law of favor or of fear but never of justice and the savage does not make a crueller idol than the child makes of the power ruling over his world and having him for its chief concern what remained to my boy of that faint childish consciousness was the idea of some sort of supernal being who abode in the skies for his advantage and disadvantage and made winter and summer wet weather and dry with an eye single to him of a family of which he was necessarily the centre and of that far vast unknown town lurking all round him and existing on account of him if not because of him so unless i manage to treat my boys town as a part of his own being i shall not make others know it just as he knew it  some of his memories reach a time earlier than his third year and relate to the little ohio river hamlet where he was born and where his mothers people who were riverfaring folk all lived every two or three years the river rose and flooded the village and his grandmothers household was taken out of the secondstory window in a skiff but no one minded a trivial inconvenience like that any more than the romans have minded the annual freshet of the tiber for the last three or four thousand years when the waters went down the family returned and scrubbed out the five or six inches of rich mud they had left in the meantime it was a godsend to all boys of an age to enjoy it but it was nothing out of the order of providence so if my boy ever saw a freshet it naturally made no impression upon him what he remembered was something much more important and that was waking up one morning and seeing a peachtree in bloom through the window beside his bed and he was always glad that this vision of beauty was his very earliest memory all his life he has never seen a peachtree in bloom without a swelling of the heart without some fleeting sense that            heaven lies about us in our infancy  over the spot where the little house once stood a railroad has drawn its erasing lines and the house itself was long since taken down and built up brick by brick in quite another place but the blooming peachtree glows before his childish eyes untouched by time or change the tender pathetic pink of its flowers repeated itself many long years afterwards in the paler tints of the almond blossoms in italy but always with a reminiscence of that dim past and the little coalsmoky town on the banks of the ohio  illustration the passenger is a onelegged man  perversely blended with that vision of the blooming peach is a glimpse of a pet deer in the kitchen of the same little house with his head up and his antlers erect as if he meditated offence my boy might never have seen him so he may have had the vision at second hand but it is certain that there was a pet deer in the family and that he was as likely to have come into the kitchen by the window as by the door one of the boys uncles had seen this deer swimming the mississippi far to the southward and had sent out a yawl and captured him and brought him home he began a checkered career of uselessness when they were ferrying him over from wheeling in a skiff by trying to help wear the pantaloons of the boy who was holding him he put one of his forelegs in at the watchpocket but it was disagreeable to the boy and ruinous to the trousers he grew very tame and butted children over right and left in the village streets and he behaved like one of the family whenever he got into a house he ate the sugar out of the bowl on the table and plundered the pantry of its sweet cakes one day a dog got after him and he jumped over the riverbank and broke his leg and had to be shot  besides the peachtree and the pet deer there was only one other thing that my boy could remember or seem to remember of the few years before he came to the boys town he is on the steamboat which is carrying the family down the ohio river to cincinnati on their way to the boys town and he is kneeling on the windowseat in the ladies cabin at the stern of the boat watching the rain fall into the swirling yellow river and make the little men jump up from the water with its pelting drops he knows that the boat is standing still and they are bringing off a passenger to it in a yawl as they used to do on the western rivers when they were hailed from some place where there was no wharfboat if they were going down stream they turned the boat and headed up the river and then with a great deal of scurrying about among the deckhands and swearing among the mates they sent the yawl ashore and bustled the passenger on board in the case which my boy seemed to remember the passenger is a onelegged man and he is standing in the yawl with his crutch under his arm and his cane in his other hand his family must be watching him from the house when the yawl comes alongside he tries to step aboard the steamboat but he misses his footing and slips into the yellow river and vanishes softly it is all so smooth and easy and it is as curious as the little men jumping up from the raindrops what made my boy think when he grew a man that this was truly a memory was that he remembered nothing else of the incident nothing whatever after the man went down in the water though there must have been a great and painful tumult and a vain search for him his drowning had exactly the value in the childs mind that the jumping up of the little men had neither more nor less     ii  home and kindred   as the boys town was in one sense merely a part of the boy i think i had better tell something about my boys family first and the influences that formed his character so that the reader can be a boy with him there on the intimate terms which are the only terms of true friendship his greatgrandfather was a prosperous manufacturer of welsh flannels who had founded his industry in a pretty town called the hay on the river wye in south wales where the boy saw one of his mills still making welsh flannels when he visited his fathers birthplace a few years ago this greatgrandfather was a friend by convincement as the quakers say that is he was a convert and not a born friend and he had the zeal of a convert he loved equality and fraternity and he came out to america towards the close of the last century to prospect for these as well as for a good location to manufacture welsh flannels but after being presented to washington then president at philadelphia and buying a tract of land somewhere near the district of columbia his phantom rolls a shadowy barrel of dollars on board ship at baltimore and sails back in the flying dutchman to south wales i fancy from the tradition of the dollars that he had made good affairs here with the stock of flannels he brought over with him but all is rather uncertain about him especially the land he bought though the story of it is pretty sure to fire some descendant of his in each new generation with the wish to go down to washington and oust the people there who have unrightfully squatted on the ancestral property what is unquestionable is that this old gentleman went home and never came out here again but his son who had inherited all his radicalism sailed with his family for boston in 1808 when my boys father was a year old from boston he passed to one quaker neighborhood after another in new york virginia and ohio setting up the machinery of woollen mills and finally after much disastrous experiment in farming paused at the boys town and established himself in the drug and book business drugs and books are still sold together i believe in small places he had long ceased to be a quaker but he remained a friend to every righteous cause and brought shame to his grandsons soul by being an abolitionist in days when it was infamy to wish the slaves set free my boys father restored his selfrespect in a measure by being a henry clay whig or a constitutional antislavery man the grandfather was a fervent methodist but the father after many years of scepticism had become a receiver of the doctrines of emanuel swedenborg and in this faith the children were brought up it was not only their faith but their life and i may say that in this sense they were a very religious household though they never went to church because it was the old church they had no service of the new church the swedenborgians were so few in the place except when some of its ministers stopped with us on their travels my boy regarded these good men as all personally sacred and while one of them was in the house he had some relief from the fear in which his days seem mostly to have been passed as if he were for the time being under the protection of a spiritual lightningrod their religion was not much understood by their neighbors of the old church who thought them a kind of universalists but the boy once heard his father explain to one of them that the new church people believed in a hell which each cast himself into if he loved the evil rather than the good and that no mercy could keep him out of without destroying him for a mans love was his very self it made his blood run cold and he resolved that rather than cast himself into hell he would do his poor best to love the good the children were taught when they teased one another that there was nothing the fiends so much delighted in as teasing when they were angry and revengeful they were told that now they were calling evil spirits about them and that the good angels could not come near them if they wished while they were in that state my boy preferred the company of good angels after dark and especially about bedtime and he usually made the effort to get himself into an accessible frame of mind before he slept by day he felt that he could look out for himself and gave way to the natural man like other boys i suppose the children had their unwholesome spiritual pride in being different from their fellows in religion but on the other hand it taught them not to fear being different from others if they believed themselves right perhaps it made my boy rather like it  the grandfather was of a gloomy spirit but of a tender and loving heart whose usual word with a child when he caressed it was poor thing poor thing as if he could only pity it and i have no doubt the fathers religion was a true affliction to him the children were taken to visit their grandmother every sunday noon and then the father and grandfather never failed to have it out about the new church and the old i am afraid that the father would sometimes forget his own precepts and tease a little when the mother went with him she was sometimes troubled at the warmth with which the controversy raged the grandmother seemed to be bored by it and the boys who cared nothing for salvation in the abstract no matter how anxious they were about the main chance certainly shared this feeling with her she was a pale little largeeyed lady who always wore a dress of quakerish plainness with a white kerchief crossed upon her breast and her aquiline nose and jutting chin almost met she was very good to the children and at these times she usually gave them some sugarcakes and sent them out in the yard where there was a young newfoundland dog of loose morals and no religious ideas who joined them in having fun till the father came out and led them home he would not have allowed them to play where it could have aggrieved any one for a prime article of his religion was to respect the religious feelings of others even when he thought them wrong but he would not suffer the children to get the notion that they were guilty of any deadly crime if they happened to come short of the conventional standard of piety once when their grandfather reported to him that the boys had been seen throwing stones on sunday at the body of a dog lodged on some drift in the river he rebuked them for the indecorum and then ended the matter as he often did by saying boys consider yourselves soundly thrashed  i should be sorry if anything i have said should give the idea that their behavior was either fantastic or arrogant through their religion it was simply a pervading influence and i am sure that in the father and mother it dignified life and freighted motive and action here with the significance of eternal fate when the children were taught that in every thought and in every deed they were choosing their portion with the devils or the angels and that god himself could not save them against themselves it often went in and out of their minds as such things must with children but some impression remained and helped them to realize the serious responsibility they were under to their own afterselves at the same time the father who loved a joke almost as much as he loved a truth and who despised austerity as something owlish set them the example of getting all the harmless fun they could out of experience they had their laugh about nearly everything that was not essentially sacred they were made to feel the ludicrous as an alleviation of existence and the father and mother were with them on the same level in all this enjoyment  the house was pretty full of children big and little there were seven of them in the boys town and eight afterwards in all so that if there had been no boys town about them they would still have had a boys world indoors they lived in three different housesthe thomas house the smith house and the falconer houseseverally called after the names of their owners for they never had a house of their own of the first my boy remembered nothing except the woodpile on which he tried his axe and a closet near the front door which he entered into one day with his mothers leave to pray as the scripture bade it was very dark and hung full of clothes and his literal application of the text was not edifying he fancied with a childs vague suspicion that it amused his father and mother i dare say it also touched them of the smith house he could remember much more the little upper room where the boys slept and the narrow stairs which he often rolled down in the morning the front room where he lay sick with a fever and was bled by the doctor as people used to be in those days the woodshed where one dreadful afternoon when he had somehow been left alone in the house he took it into his head that the family dog tip was going mad the window where he traced the figure of a bull on greased paper from an engraving held up against the light none of them important facts but such as stick in the mind by the capricious action of memory while far greater events drop out of it my boys elder brother at once accused him of tracing that bull which he pretended to have copied but their father insisted upon taking the childs word for it though he must have known he was lying and this gave my boy a far worse conscience than if his father had whipped him the fathers theory was that people are more apt to be true if you trust them than if you doubt them i do not think he always found it work perfectly but i believe he was right  my boy was for a long time very miserable about that bull and the experience taught him to desire the truth and honor it even when he could not attain it five or six years after when his brother and he had begun to read stories they found one in the old new york mirror which had a great influence upon their daily conduct it was called the trippings of tom pepper or the effects of romancing and it showed how at many important moments the hero had been baulked of fortune by his habit of fibbing they took counsel together and pledged themselves not to tell the smallest lie upon any occasion whatever it was a frightful slavery for there are a great many times in a boys life when it seems as if the truth really could not serve him their great trial was having to take a younger brother with them whenever they wanted to go off with other boys and it had been their habit to get away from him by many little deceits which they could not practise now to tell him that their mother wanted him or to send him home upon some errand to his pretended advantage that had really no object but his absence i suppose there is now no boy living who would do this my boy and his brother groaned under their good resolution i do not know how long but the day came when they could bear it no longer though i cannot give just the time or the terms of their backsliding that elder brother had been hard enough on my boy before the period of this awful reform his uprightness his unselfishness his truthfulness were a daily reproach to him and it did not need this season of absolute sincerity to complete his wretchedness yet it was an experience which afterwards he would not willingly have missed for once in his little confused life he had tried to practise a virtue because the opposite vice had been made to appear foolish and mischievous to him and not from any superstitious fear or hope  as far as i can make out he had far more fears than hopes and perhaps every boy has it was in the smith house that he began to be afraid of ghosts though he never saw one or anything like one he never saw even the good genius who came down the chimney and filled the childrens stockings at christmas he wished to see him but he understood that st nicholas was a shy spirit and was apt to pass by the stockings of boys who lay in wait for him his mother had told him how the peltsnickel used to come with a bundle of rods for the bad children when the chriskingle brought the presents of the good ones among his grandmothers pennsylvania german kindred and he had got them all somehow mixed up together then st nicholas though he was so pleasant and friendly in the poem about the night before christmas was known to some of the neighbor boys as santa claus they called it centre claws and my boy imagined him with large talons radiating from the pit of his stomach but this was all nothing to the notion of dowds spectacles which his father sometimes joked him about and which were represented by a pair of hollow glassless iron rims which he had found in the street they may or may not have belonged to dowd and dowd may have been an irishman in the neighborhood or he may not he may have died or he may not but there was something in the mere gruesome mention of his spectacles which related itself to all the boy had conceived of the ghostly and ghastly and all that was alarming in the supernatural he could never say in the least how or why i fancy no child can ever explain just why it is affected in this way or that way by the things that are or are not in the world about it it is not easy to do this for ones self in afterlife at any rate it is certain that my boy dwelt most of his time amid shadows that were perhaps projected over his narrow outlook from some former state of being or from the gloomy minds of longdead ancestors his home was cheerful and most happy but he peopled all its nooks and corners with shapes of doom and horror the other boys were not slow to find this out and their invention supplied with ready suggestion of officers and prisons any little lack of misery his spectres and goblins left he often narrowly escaped arrest or thought so when they built a fire in the street at night and suddenly kicked it to pieces and shouted run run the constable will catch you nothing but flight saved my boy in these cases when he was small he grew bolder after a while concerning constables but never concerning ghosts they shivered in the autumnal evenings among the tall stalks of the cornfield that stretched a vast wilderness behind the house to the next street and they walked the night everywhere  illustration run run the constable will catch you  yet nothing more tragical that he could remember really happened while he lived in the smith house than something he saw one bright sunny morning while all the boys were hanging on the fence of the next house and watching the martins flying down to the ground from their box in the gable the birds sent out sharp cries of terror or anger and presently he saw a black cat crouching in the grass with halfshut eyes and an air of dreamy indifference the birds swept down in longer and lower loops towards the cat drawn by some fatal charm or by fear of the danger that threatened their colony from the mere presence of the cat but she did not stir suddenly she sprang into the air and then darted away with a martin in her mouth while my boys heart leaped into his own and the other boys rushed after the cat  as when something dreadful happens this seemed not to have happened but a lovely experience leaves a sense of enduring fact behind and remains a rich possession no matter how slight and simple it was my boys mother has been dead almost a quarter of a century but as one of the elder children he knew her when she was young and gay and his last distinct association with the smith house is of coming home with her after a visit to her mothers far up the ohio river in their absence the june grass which the childrens feet always kept trampled down so low had flourished up in purple blossom and now stood rank and tall and the mother threw herself on her knees in it and tossed and frolicked with her little ones like a girl the picture remains and the wonder of the world in which it was true once while all the phantasmagory of spectres has long vanished away  the boy could not recall the familys removal to the falconer house they were not there and then they were there it was a brick house at a corner of the principal street and in the gable there were places for mockwindows where there had never been blinds put but where the swallows had thickly built their nests i dare say my boy might have been willing to stone these nests but he was not allowed either he or his mates who must have panted with him to improve such an opportunity of havoc there was a real window in the gable from which he could look out of the garret such a garret as every boy should once have the use of some time in his life it was dim and low though it seemed high and the naked brown rafters were studded with wasps nests and the rain beat on the shingles overhead the house had been occupied by a physician and under the eaves the children found heaps of phials full of doctors stuff the garret abounded in their own family boxes and barrels but there was always room for a swing which the boys used in training for their circuses below the garret there were two unimportant stories with chambers diningroom parlor and so on then you came to the brickpaved kitchen in the basement and a perfectly glorious cellar with rats in it outside there was a large yard with five or six huge old cherrytrees and a garden plot where every spring my boy tried to make a garden with neverfailing failure  the house gave even to him a sense of space unknown before and he could recall his mothers satisfaction in it he has often been back there in dreams and found it on the old scale of grandeur but no doubt it was a very simple affair the fortunes of a whig editor in a place so overwhelmingly democratic as the boys town were not such as could have warranted his living in a palace and he must have been poor as the world goes now but the family always lived in abundance and in their way they belonged to the employing class that is the father had men to work for him on the other hand he worked with them and the boys as they grew old enough were taught to work with them too my boy grew old enough very young and was put to use in the printingoffice before he was ten years of age this was not altogether because he was needed there i dare say but because it was part of his fathers swedenborgian philosophy that every one should fulfil a use i do not know that when the boy wanted to go swimming or hunting or skating it consoled him much to reflect that the angels in the highest heaven delighted in uses nevertheless it was good for him to be of use though maybe not so much use  if his mother did her own work with help only now and then from a hired girl that was the custom of the time and country and her memory was always the more reverend to him because whenever he looked back at her in those dim years he saw her about some of those household offices which are so beautiful to a child she was always the best and tenderest mother and her love had the heavenly art of making each child feel itself the most important while she was partial to none in spite of her busy days she followed their father in his religion and literature and at night when her long toil was over she sat with the children and listened while he read aloud the first book my boy remembered to have heard him read was moores lalla rookh of which he formed but a vague notion though while he struggled after its meaning he took all its music in and began at once to make rhymes of his own he had no conception of literature except the pleasure there was in making it and he had no outlook into the world of it which must have been pretty open to his father the father read aloud some of dickenss christmas stories then new and the boy had a good deal of trouble with the haunted man one rarest night of all the family sat up till two oclock listening to a novel that my boy long ago forgot the name of if he ever knew its name it was all about a will forged or lost and there was a great scene in court and after that the mother declared that she could not go to bed till she heard the end his own first reading was in history at nine years of age he read the history of greece and the history of rome and he knew that goldsmith wrote them one night his father told the boys all about don quixote and a little while after he gave my boy the book he read it over and over again but he did not suppose it was a novel it was his elder brother who read novels and a novel was like handy andy or harry lorrequer or the bride of lammermoor his brother had another novel which they preferred to either it was in harpers old library of select novels and was called alamance or the great and final experiment and it was about the life of some sort of community in north carolina it bewitched them and though my boy could not afterwards recall a single fact or figure in it he could bring before his minds eye every trait of its outward aspect it was at this time that his father bought an englishspanish grammar from a returned volunteer who had picked it up in the city of mexico and gave it to the boy he must have expected him to learn spanish from it but the boy did not know even the parts of speech in english as the father had once taught english grammar in six lessons from a broadside of his own authorship he may have expected the principle of heredity to help the boy and certainly he did dig the english grammar out of that blessed book and the spanish language with it but after many long years and much despair over the difference between a preposition and a substantive  all this went along with great and continued political excitement and with some glimpses of the social problem it was very simple then nobody was very rich and nobody was in want but somehow as the boy grew older he began to discover that there were differences even in the little world about him some were higher and some were lower from the first he was taught by precept and example to take the side of the lower as the children were denied oftener than they were indulged the margin of their own abundance must have been narrower than they ever knew then but if they had been of the most prosperous their bent in this matter would have been the same once there was a church festival or something of that sort and there was a good deal of the provision left over which it was decided should be given to the poor this was very easy but it was not so easy to find the poor whom it should be given to at last a hardworking widow was chosen to receive it the ladies carried it to her front door and gave it her and she carried it to her back door and threw it into the alley no doubt she had enough without it but there were circumstances of indignity or patronage attending the gift which were recognized in my boys home and which helped afterwards to make him doubtful of all giving except the humblest and restive with a world in which there need be any giving at all     iii  the river   it seems to me that the best way to get at the heart of any boys town is to take its different watercourses and follow them into it  the house where my boy first lived was not far from the river and he must have seen it often before he noticed it but he was not aware of it till he found it under the bridge without the river there could not have been a bridge the fact of the bridge may have made him look for the river but the bridge is foremost in his mind it is a long wooden tunnel with two roadways and a footpath on either side of these there is a tollhouse at each end and from one to the other it is about as far as from the earth to the planet mars on the western shore of the river is a smaller town than the boys town and in the perspective the entrance of the bridge on that side is like a dim little doorway the timbers are of a hugeness to strike fear into the heart of the boldest little boy and there is something awful even about the dust in the roadways soft and thrillingly cool to the boys bare feet it lies thick in a perpetual twilight streaked at intervals by the sun that slants in at the high narrow windows under the roof it has a certain potent musty smell the bridge has three piers and at low water hardier adventurers than he wade out to the middle pier some heroes even fish there standing all day on the loose rocks about the base of the pier he shudders to see them and aches with wonder how they will get ashore once he is there when a big boy wades back from the middle pier where he has been to rob a gooses nest he has some loose silver change in his wet hand and my boy understands that it has come out of one of the goose eggs this fact which he never thought of questioning gets mixed up in his mind with an idea of riches of treasuretrove in the cellar of an old house that has been torn down near the end of the bridge  on the bridge he first saw the crazy man who belongs in every boys town in this one he was a hapless harmless creature whom the boys knew as solomon whistler perhaps because his name was whistler perhaps because he whistled though when my boy met him midway of the bridge he marched swiftly and silently by with his head high and looking neither to the right nor to the left with an insensibility to the boys presence that froze his blood and shrivelled him up with terror as his fancy early became the sport of playfellows not endowed with one so vivid he was taught to expect that solomon whistler would get him some day though what he would do with him when he had got him his anguish must have been too great even to let him guess some of the boys said solomon had gone crazy from fear of being drafted in the war of 1812 others that he had been crossed in love but my boy did not quite know then what either meant he only knew that solomon whistler lived at the poorhouse beyond the eastern border of the town and that he ranged between this sojourn and the illimitable wilderness north of the town on the western shore of the river the crazy man was often in the boys dreams the memories of which blend so with the memories of real occurrences he could not tell later whether he once crossed the bridge when the footway had been partly taken up and he had to walk on the girders or whether he only dreamed of that awful passage it was quite fearful enough to cross when the footway was all down and he could see the blue gleam of the river far underneath through the cracks between the boards it made his brain reel and he felt that he took his life in his hand whenever he entered the bridge even when he had grown old enough to be making an excursion with some of his playmates to the farm of an uncle of theirs who lived two miles up the river the farmer gave them all the watermelons they wanted to eat and on the way home when they lay resting under the sycamores on the riverbank solomon whistler passed by in the middle of the road silent swift straight onward i do not know why the sight of this afflicted soul did not slay my boy on the spot he was so afraid of him but the crazy man never really hurt any one though the boys followed and mocked him as soon as he got by  the boys knew little or nothing of the river south of the bridge and frequented mainly that milelong stretch of it between the bridge and the dam beyond which there was practically nothing for many years afterwards they came to know that this strange region was inhabited just above the bridge the hydraulic emptied into the river with a heartshaking plunge over an immense millwheel and there was a cluster of mills at this point which were useful in accumulating the waters into fishingholes before they rushed through the gates upon the wheel the boys used to play inside the big millwheel before the water was let into the hydraulic and my boy caught his first fish in the pool below the wheel the mills had some secondary use in making flour and the like but this could not concern a small boy they were as simply a part of his natural circumstance as the large cottonwoodtree which hung over the river from a point near by and which seemed to have always an oriole singing in it all along there the banks were rather steep and to him they looked very high the blue clay that formed them was full of springs which the boys dammed up in little ponds and let loose in glassy falls upon their fluttermills as with everything that boys do these mills were mostly failures the pins which supported the wheels were always giving way and though there were instances of boys who started their wheels at recess and found them still fluttering away at noon when they came out of school none ever carried his enterprise so far as to spin the cotton blowing from the balls of the cottonwoodtree by the shore as they all meant to do they met such disappointments with dauntless cheerfulness and lightly turned from some bursting bubble to some other where the glory of the universe was still mirrored the river shore was strewn not only with waste cotton but with drift which the water had made porous and which they called smokewood they made cigars for their own use out of it and it seemed to them that it might be generally introduced as a cheap and simple substitute for tobacco but they never got any of it into the market not even the market of that world where the currency was pins  the river had its own climate and this climate was of course much such a climate as the boys for whom nature intended the river would have chosen i do not believe it was ever winter there though it was sometimes late autumn so that the boys could have some use for the caves they dug at the top of the bank with a hole coming through the turf to let out the smoke of the fires they built inside they had the joy of choking and blackening over these flues and they intended to live on corn and potatoes borrowed from the household stores of the boy whose house was nearest they never got so far as to parch the corn or to bake the potatoes in their caves but there was the fire and the draft was magnificent the light of the red flames painted the little happy foolish faces so long since wrinkled and grizzled with age or mouldered away to dust as the boys huddled before them under the bank and fed them with the drift or stood patient of the heat and cold in the afternoon light of some vast saturday waning to nightfall  the riverclimate with these autumnal intervals was made up of a quick eventful springtime followed by the calm of a cloudless summer that seemed never to end but the spring short as it was had its great attractions and chief of these was the freshet which it brought to the river they would hear somehow that the river was rising and then the boys who had never connected its rise with the rains they must have been having would all go down to its banks and watch the swelling waters these would be yellow and thick and the boiling current would have smooth oily eddies where pieces of drift would whirl round and round and then escape and slip down the stream there were sawlogs and whole trees with their branching tops lengths of fence and hencoops and pigpens once there was a stable and if the flood continued there began to come swollen bodies of horses and cattle this must have meant serious loss to the people living on the riverbottoms above but the boys counted it all gain they cheered the objects as they floated by and they were breathless with the excitement of seeing the men who caught fencerails and cordwood and even sawlogs with iron prongs at the points of long poles as they stood on some jutting point of shore and stretched far out over the flood the boys exulted in the turbid spread of the stream which filled its low western banks and stole over their tops and washed into all the hollow places along its shores and shone among the trunks of the sycamores on deloracs island which was almost of the geographical importance of the island in old river when the water began to go down their hearts sank with it and they gave up the hope of seeing the bridge carried away once the river rose to within a few feet of it so that if the right piece of drift had been there to do its duty the bridge might have been torn from its piers and swept down the raging tide into those unknown gulfs to the southward many a time they went to bed full of hope that it would at least happen in the night and woke to learn with shame and grief in the morning that the bridge was still there and the river was falling it was a little comfort to know that some of the big boys had almost seen it go watching as far into the night as nine oclock with the men who sat up near the bridge till daylight men of leisure and public spirit but not perhaps the leading citizens  there must have been a tedious time between the going down of the flood and the first days when the water was warm enough for swimming but it left no trace the boys are standing on the shore while the freshet rushes by and then they are in the water splashing diving ducking it is like that so that i do not know just how to get in that period of fishing which must always have come between there were not many fish in that part of the miami my boys experience was full of the ignominy of catching shiners and suckers or at the best mudcats as they called the yellow catfish but there were boys of those who cursed and swore who caught sunfish as they called the bream and there were men who were reputed to catch at will as it were silvercats and riverbass they fished with minnows which they kept in battered tin buckets that they did not allow you even to touch or hardly to look at my boy scarcely breathed in their presence when one of them got up to cast his line in a new place the boys all ran and then came slowly back these men often carried a flask of liquid that had the property when taken inwardly of keeping the damp out the boys respected them for their ability to drink whiskey and thought it a fit and honorable thing that they should now and then fall into the river over the brinks where they had set their poles  but they disappear like persons in a dream and their fishingtime vanishes with them and the swimmingtime is in full possession of the river and of all the other waters of the boys town the river the canal basin the hydraulic and its reservoirs seemed all full of boys at the same moment but perhaps it was not the same for my boy was always in each place and so he must have been there at different times each place had its delights and advantages but the swimmingholes in the river were the greatest favorites he could not remember when he began to go into them though it certainly was before he could swim there was a time when he was afraid of getting in over his head but he did not know just when he learned to swim any more than he knew when he learned to read he could not swim and then he could swim he could not read and then he could read but i dare say the reading came somewhat before the swimming yet the swimming must have come very early and certainly it was kept up with continual practice he swam quite as much as he read perhaps more the boys had deep swimmingholes and shallow ones and over the deep ones there was always a springboard from which they threw somersaults or dived straight down into the depths where there were warm and cold currents mysteriously interwoven they believed that these deep holes were infested by watersnakes though they never saw any and they expected to be bitten by snappingturtles though this never happened fiery dragons could not have kept them out gallynippers whatever they were certainly did not they were believed to abound at the bottom of the deep holes but the boys never stayed long in the deep holes and they preferred the shallow places where the river broke into a long ripple they called it riffle on its gravelly bed and where they could at once soak and bask in the musical rush of the sunlit waters i have heard people in new england blame all the western rivers for being yellow and turbid but i know that after the spring floods when the miami had settled down to its summer business with the boys it was as clear and as blue as if it were spilled out of the summer sky the boys liked the riffle because they could stay in so long there and there were little landlocked pools and shallows where the water was even warmer and they could stay in longer at most places under the banks there was clay of different colors which they used for warpaint in their indian fights and after they had their indian fights they could rush screaming and clattering into the riffle when the stream had washed them clean down to their red sunburn or their leathern tan they could paint up again and have more indian fights  i do not know why my boys associations with deloracs island were especially wild in their character for nothing more like outlawry than the game of mumblethepeg ever occurred there perhaps it was because the boys had to get to it by water that it seemed beyond the bounds of civilization they might have reached it by the bridge but the temper of the boys on the western shore was uncertain they would have had to run the gauntlet of their riverguard on the way up to it and they might have been friendly or they might not it would have depended a good deal on the size and number of the interlopers besides it was more glorious to wade across to the island from their side of the river they undressed and gathered their clothes up into a bundle which they put on their heads and held there with one hand while they used the other for swimming when they came to a place beyond their depth then they dressed again and stretched themselves under the cottonwoodtrees and sycamores and played games and told stories and longed for a gun to kill the blackbirds which nested in the high tops and at nightfall made such a clamor in getting to roost that it almost deafened you  my boy never distinctly knew what formed that island but as there was a mill there it must have been made by the millrace leaving and rejoining the river it was enough for him to know that the island was there and that a parrota screaming whistling and laughing parrot which was a pretty poll and always wanted a crackerdwelt in a pretty cottage almost hidden in trees just below the end of the island this parrot had the old creole gentleman living with it who owned the island and whom it had brought from new orleans the boys met him now and then as he walked abroad with a stick and his large stomach bowed in front of him for no reason under the sun they were afraid of him perhaps they thought he resented their parleys with the parrot but he and the parrot existed solely to amuse and to frighten them and on their own side of the river just opposite the island there were established some small industries for their entertainment and advantage on a branch of the hydraulic i do not know just what it was they did with a mustardmill that was there but the turningshop supplied them with a deep bed of elastic shavings just under the bank which they turned somersaults into when they were not turning them into the river  i wonder what sign the boys who read this have for challenging or inviting one another to go in swimming the boys in the boys town used to make the motion of swimming with both arms or they held up the forefinger and middlefinger in the form of a swallowtail they did this when it was necessary to be secret about it as in school and when they did not want the whole crowd of boys to come along and often when they just pretended they did not want some one to know they really had to be secret at times for some of the boys were not allowed to go in at all others were forbidden to go in more than once or twice a day and as they all had to go in at least three or four times a day some sort of sign had to be used that was understood among themselves alone since this is a true history i had better own that they nearly all at one time or other must have told lies about it either before or after the fact some habitually some only in great extremity here and there a boy like my boys elder brother would not tell lies at all even about going in swimming but by far the greater number bowed to their hard fate and told them they promised that they would not go in and then they said that they had not been in but sin for which they had made this sacrifice was apt to betray them either they got their shirts on wrong side out in dressing or else while they were in some enemy came upon them and tied their shirts there are few cruelties which public opinion in the boys world condemns but i am glad to remember to their honor that there were not many in that boys town who would tie shirts and i fervently hope that there is no boy now living who would do it as the crime is probably extinct i will say that in those wicked days if you were such a miscreant and there was some boy you hated you stole up and tied the hardest kind of a knot in one arm or both arms of his shirt then if the evil one put it into your heart you soaked the knot in water and pounded it with a stone  i am glad to know that in the days when he was thoughtless and senseless enough my boy never was guilty of any degree of this meanness it was his brother i suppose who taught him to abhor it and perhaps it was his own suffering from it in part for he too sometimes shed bitter tears over such a knot as i have seen hapless little wretches do tearing at it with their nails and gnawing at it with their teeth knowing that the time was passing when they could hope to hide the fact that they had been in swimming and foreseeing no remedy but to cut off the sleeve above the knot or else put on their clothes without the shirt and trust to untying the knot when it got dry  there must have been a lurking anxiety in all the boys hearts when they went in without leave or as my boy was apt to do when explicitly forbidden he was not apt at lying i dare say and so he took the course of open disobedience he could not see the danger that filled the home hearts with fear for him and he must have often broken the law and been forgiven before justice one day appeared for him on the riverbank and called him away from his stolen joys it was an awful moment and it covered him with shame before his mates who heartlessly rejoiced as children do in the doom which they are escaping that sin at least he fully expiated and i will whisper to the young people here at the end of the chapter that somehow soon or late our sins do overtake us and insist upon being paid for that is not the best reason for not sinning but it is well to know it and to believe it in our acts as well as our thoughts you will find people to tell you that things only happen so and so it may be only i know that no good thing ever happened to happen to me when i had done wrong     iv  the canal and its basin   the canal came from lake erie two hundred miles to the northward and joined the ohio river twenty miles south of the boys town for a time my boys father was collector of tolls on it but even when he was old enough to understand that his father held this state office the canal belonged to the state because he had been such a good whig and published the whig newspaper he could not grasp the notion of the distance which the canalboats came out of and went into he saw them come and he saw them go he did not ask whence or whither his wonder if he had any about them did not go beyond the second lock it was hard enough to get it to the head of the basin which left the canal half a mile or so to the eastward and stretched down into the town a sheet of smooth water fifteen or twenty feet deep and a hundred wide his sense ached with the effort of conceiving of the other side of it the basin was bordered on either side near the end by porkhouses where the pork was cut up and packed and then lay in long rows of barrels on the banks with other long rows of saltbarrels and yet other long rows of whiskeybarrels coopershops where the barrels were made alternated with the porkhouses the boats brought the salt and carried away the pork and whiskey but the boys practical knowledge of them was that they lay there for the boys to dive off of when they went in swimming and to fish under the water made a soft tucktucking at the sterns of the boat and you could catch sunfish if you were the right kind of a boy or the wrong kind the luck seemed to go a good deal with boys who were not good for much else some of the boats were open their whole length with a little cabin at the stern and these pretended to be for carrying wood and stone but really again were for the use of the boys after a hard rain when they held a good deal of water and you could pole yourself up and down on the loose planks in them the boys formed the notion at times that some of these boats were abandoned by their owners and they were apt to be surprised by their sudden return a feeling of transgression was mixed up with the joys of this kind of navigation perhaps some of the boys were forbidden it no limit was placed on their swimming in the basin except that of the law which prohibited it in the daytime as the basin was quite in the heart of the town in the warm summer nights of that southerly latitude the water swarmed with laughing shouting screaming boys who plunged from the banks and rioted in the delicious water diving and ducking flying and following safe in the art of swimming which all of them knew they turned somersaults from the decks of the canalboats some of the boys could turn double somersaults and one boy got so far as to turn a somersault and a half it was long before the time of electric lighting but when he struck the water there came a flash that seemed to illumine the universe  i am afraid that the young people will think i am telling them too much about swimming but in the boys town the boys really led a kind of amphibious life and as long as the long summer lasted they were almost as much in the water as on the land the basin however unlike the river had a winter as well as a summer climate and one of the very first things that my boy could remember was being on the ice there when a young man caught him up into his arms and skated off with him almost as far away as the canal he remembered the fearful joy of the adventure and the pride too for he had somehow the notion that this young fellow was handsome and fine and did him an honor by his noticeso soon does some dim notion of worldly splendor turn us into snobs the next thing was his own attempt at skating when he was set down from the bank by his brother full of a vainglorious confidence in his powers and appeared instantly to strike on the top of his head afterwards he learned to skate but he did not know when any more than he knew just the moment of learning to read or to swim he became passionately fond of skating and kept at it all day long when there was ice for it which was not often in those soft winters they made a very little ice go a long way in the boys town and began to use it for skating as soon as there was a glazing of it on the basin none of them ever got drowned there though a boy would often start from one bank and go flying to the other trusting his speed to save him while the thin sheet sank and swayed but never actually broke under him usually the ice was not thick enough to have a fire built on it and it must have been on ice which was just strong enough to bear that my boy skated all one bitter afternoon at old river without a fire to warm by at first his feet were very cold and then they gradually felt less cold and at last he did not feel them at all he thought this very nice and he told one of the big boys why your feet are frozen said the big boy and he dragged off my boys skates and the little one ran all the long mile home crazed with terror and not knowing what moment his feet might drop off there in the road his mother plunged them in a bowl of icecold water and then rubbed them with flannel and so thawed them out but that could not save him from the pain of their coming to it was intense and there must have been a time afterwards when he did not use his feet  his skates themselves were of a sort that i am afraid boys would smile at nowadays when you went to get a pair of skates forty or fifty years ago you did not make your choice between a barney  berry and an acme which fastened on with the turn of a screw or the twist of a clamp you found an assortment of big and little sizes of solid wood bodies with guttered blades turning up in front with a sharp point or perhaps curling over above the toe in this case they sometimes ended in an acorn if this acorn was of brass it transfigured the boy who wore that skate he might have been otherwise all rags and patches but the brass acorn made him splendid from head to foot when you had bought your skates you took them to a carpenter and stood awestrickenly about while he pierced the wood with strapholes or else you managed to bore them through with a hot iron yourself then you took them to a saddler and got him to make straps for them that is if you were rich and your father let you have a quarter to pay for the job if not you put strings through and tied your skates on they were always coming off or getting crosswise of your foot or feeblemindedly slumping down on one side of the wood but it did not matter if you had a fire on the ice fed with old barrels and boards and coopers shavings and could sit round it with your skates on and talk and tell stories between your flights and races afar and come whizzing back to it from the frozen distance and glide with one foot lifted almost among the embers  beyond the porkhouses and up farther towards the canal there were some houses under the basin banks they were good places for the feverandague which people had in those days without knowing it was malaria or suffering it to interfere much with the pleasure and business of life but they seemed to my boy bowers of delight especially one where there was a bear chained to a weepingwillow and another where there was a fishpond with goldfish in it he expected this bear to get loose and eat him but that could not spoil his pleasure in seeing the bear stand on his hindlegs and open his red mouth as i have seen bears do when you wound them up by a keyhole in the side in fact a toy bear is very much like a real bear and safer to have round the boys were always wanting to go and look at this bear but he was not so exciting as the daily arrival of the dayton packet to my boys young vision this craft was of such incomparable lightness and grace as no yacht of mr burgesss could rival when she came in of a summer evening her deck was thronged with people and the captain stood with his right foot on the springcatch that held the towrope the water curled away on either side of her sharp prow that cut its way onward at the full rate of five miles an hour and the team came swinging down the towpath at a gallant trot the driver sitting the hindmost horse of three and cracking his longlashed whip with loud explosions as he whirled its snaky spirals in the air all the boys in town were there meekly proud to be ordered out of his way to break and fly before his volleyed oaths and far before his horses feet and suddenly the captain pressed his foot on the spring and released the towrope the driver kept on to the stable with unslackened speed and the line followed him swishing and skating over the water while the steersman put his helm hard aport and the packet rounded to and swam softly and slowly up to her moorings no steamer arrives from europe now with such thrilling majesty  the canalboatmen were all an heroic race and the boys humbly hoped that some day if they proved worthy they might grow up to be drivers not indeed packetdrivers they were not so conceited as that but freightboat drivers of two horses perhaps but gladly of one high or low the drivers had a great deal of leisure which commended their calling to the boyish fancy and my boy saw them with a longing to speak to them even to approach them never satisfied while they amused the long summer afternoon in the shade of the tavern by a game of skill peculiar to them they put a tack into a whiplash and then whirling it round and round drove it to the head in a target marked out on the weatherboarding some of them had a perfect aim and in fact it was a very pretty feat and well worth seeing  another feat which the pioneers of the region had probably learned from the indians was throwing the axe the thrower caught the axe by the end of the helve and with a dextrous twirl sent it flying through the air and struck its edge into whatever object he aimed atusually a tree two of the basin loafers were brothers and they were always quarrelling and often fighting one was of the unhappy fraternity of towndrunkards and somehow the boys thought him a finer fellow than the other whom somehow they considered mean and they were always of his side in their controversies one afternoon these brothers quarrelled a long time and then the sober brother retired to the doorway of a porkhouse where he stood probably brooding upon his injuries when the drunkard who had remained near the tavern suddenly caught up an axe and flung it the boys saw it sail across the corner of the basin and strike in the door just above his brothers head this one did not lose an instant while the axe still quivered in the wood he hurled himself upon the drunkard and did that justice on him which he would not ask from the law perhaps because it was a family affair perhaps because those wretched men were no more under the law than the boys were  i do not mean that there was no law for the boys for it was manifest to their terror in two officers whom they knew as constables and who may have reigned one after another or together with full power of life and death over them as they felt but who in a community mainly so peaceful acted upon dogberrys advice and made and meddled with rogues as little as they could from time to time it was known among the boys that you would be taken up if you went in swimming inside of the corporation line and for a while they would be careful to keep beyond it but this could not last they were soon back in the old places and i suppose no arrests were ever really made they did indeed hear once that old griffin as they called him caught a certain boy in the river before dark and carried him up through the town to his own home naked of course no such thing ever happened but the boys believed it and it froze my boys soul with fear all the more because this constable was a cabinetmaker and made coffins from his fathers printingoffice the boy could hear the long slide of his plane over the wood and he could smell the varnish on the boards  i dare say old griffin was a kindly man enough and not very old and i suppose that the other constable as known to his family and friends was not at all the gloomy headsman he appeared to the boys when he became constable they had not the least notion how a man became constable they heard that his rule was to be marked by unwonted severity against the crime of going in swimming inside the corporation line and so they kept strictly to the letter of the law but one day some of them found themselves in the water beyond the first lock when the constable appeared on the towpath suddenly as if he and his horse had come up out of the ground he told them that he had got them now and he ordered them to come along with him he remained there amusing himself with their tears their prayers and then vanished again heaven knows how they lived through it but they must have got safely home in the usual way and life must have gone on as before no doubt the man did not realize the torture he put them to but it was a cruel thing and i never have any patience with people who exaggerate a childs offence to it and make it feel itself a wicked criminal for some little act of scarcely any consequence if we elders stand here in the place of the heavenly father towards those younger children of his he will not hold us guiltless when we obscure for them the important difference between a great and a small misdeed or wring their souls fearclouded as they always are with a sense of perdition for no real sin  illustration the sixmile level  illustration he told them that he had got them now     v  the hydraulic and its reservoirsold river   there were two branches of the hydraulic one followed the course of the miami from some unknown point to the northward on the level of its high bank and joined the other where it emptied into the river just above the bridge this last came down what had been a street and it must have been very pretty to have these two swift streams of clear water rushing through the little town under the culverts and between the stone walls of its banks but what a boy mainly cares for in a thing is use and the boys tried to make some use of the hydraulic since it was there to find what they could do with it of course they were aware of the mills dotted along its course and they knew that it ran them but i do not believe any of them thought that it was built merely to run flourmills and sawmills and cottonmills they did what they could to find out its real use but they could make very little of it the current was so rapid that it would not freeze in winter and in summer they could not go in swimming in it by day because it was so public and at night the basin had more attractions there was danger of cutting your feet on the broken glass and crockery which people threw into the hydraulic and though the edges of the culverts were good for jumping off of the boys did not find them of much practical value sometimes you could catch sunfish in the hydraulic but it was generally too swift and the only thing you could depend upon was catching crawfish these abounded so that if you dropped a string with a bit of meat on it into the water anywhere you could pull it up again with two or three crawfish hanging to it the boys could not begin to use them all for bait which was the only use their creator seemed to have designed them for but they had vaguely understood that people somewhere ate them or something like them though they had never known even the name of lobsters and they always intended to get their mothers to have them cooked for them none of them ever did  they could sometimes under high favor of fortune push a dog into the hydraulic or get him to jump in after a stick and then have the excitement of following him from one culvert to another till he found a foothold and scrambled out once my boy saw a chicken cock sailing serenely down the currant he was told that he had been given brandy and that brandy would enable a chicken to swim but probably this was not true another time a tremendous time a boy was standing at the brink of a culvert when one of his mates dared another to push him in in those days the boys attached peculiar ideas of dishonor to taking a dare they said and in some sort they believed that a boy who would take a dare would steal sheep i do not now see why this should follow in this case the high spirit who was challenged felt nothing base in running up behind his unsuspecting friend and popping him into the water and i have no doubt the victim considered the affair in the right light when he found that it was a dare he drifted under the culvert and when he came out he swiftly scaled the wall below and took after the boy who had pushed him in of course this one had the start no great harm was done everybody could swim and a boys summer costume in that hot climate was made up of a shirt and trousers and a straw hat no boy who had any regard for his social standing wore shoes or stockings and as they were all pretty proud they all went barefoot from april till october  the custom of going barefoot must have come from the south where it used to be so common and also from the primitive pioneer times which were so near my boys time fifty years ago the south characterized the thinking and feeling of the boys town far more than the north most of the people were of southern extraction from kentucky or virginia when they were not from pennsylvania or new jersey there might have been other new england families but the boys only knew of onethat of the blacksmith whose shop they liked to haunt his children were heard to dispute about an animal they had seen and one of them said tell ye twant a squeerrel twas a maouse and the boys had that for a byword they despised yankees as a meanspirited race who were stingy and would cheat and would not hit you if you told them they lied a person must always hit a person who told him he lied but even if you called a yankee a fighting liar the worst form of this insult he would not hit you but just call you a liar back my boy long accepted these ideas of new england as truly representative of the sectional character perhaps they were as fair as some ideas of the west which he afterwards found entertained in new england but they were false and stupid all the same  if the boys could do little with the hydraulic they were at no loss in regard to the reservoirs into which its feeding waters were gathered and held in reserve i suppose against a time of drought there was the little reservoir first and then a mile beyond it the big reservoir and there was nearly always a large flat boat on each which was used for repairing the banks but which the boys employed as a pleasurebarge it seemed in some natural way to belong to them and yet they had a feeling of something clandestine in pushing out on the reservoir in it once they filled its broad shallow hold with straw from a neighboring oatfield and spent a long golden afternoon in simply lying under the hot september sun in the middle of the reservoir and telling stories my boy then learned for the first time that there was such a book as the arabian nights one of the other boys told stories out of it and he inferred that the sole copy in existence belonged to this boy he knew that they all had schoolbooks alike but it did not occur to him that a book which was not a reader or a speller was ever duplicated they did nothing with their boat except loll in it and tell stories and as there was no current in the reservoir they must have remained pretty much in the same place but they had a sense of the wildest adventure which mounted to frenzy when some men rose out of the earth on the shore and shouted at them hello there what are you doing with that boat they must have had an oar at any rate they got to the opposite bank and springing to land fled somewhere into the vaguest past  the boys went in swimming in the little reservoir when they were not in the river or the basin and they fished in the big reservoir where the sunfish bit eagerly there were large trees standing in the hollow which became the bed of the reservoir and these died when the water was let in around them and gave the stretch of quiet waters a strange weird look about their bases was the best kind of place for sunfish and even for bass of course the boys never caught any bass that honor was reserved for men of the kind i have mentioned it was several years before the catfish got in and then they were mudcats but the boys had great luck with sunfish there and in the pools about the floodgates where there was always some leakage and where my boy once caught a whole string of live fish which had got away from some other boy perhaps weeks before they were all swimming about in a lively way and the largest hungrily took his bait the great pleasure of fishing in these pools was that the waters were so clear you could see the fat gleaming fellows at the bottom nosing round your hook and going off and coming back several times before they made up their minds to bite it seems now impossible that my boy could ever have taken pleasure in the capture of these poor creatures i know that there are grown people and very good kind men too who defend and celebrate the sport and value themselves on their skill in it but i think it tolerable only in boys who are cruel because they are thoughtless it is not probable that any lower organism            in corporal sufferance feels a pang as great            as when a giant dies  but still i believe that even a fish knows a dumb agony from the barbs of the hook which would take somewhat from the captors joy if he could but realize it  illustration that honor was reserved for men of the kind i have mentioned  there was of course a time when the hydraulic and the reservoirs were not where they afterwards appeared always to have been my boy could dimly recall the day when the water was first let into the hydraulic and the little fellows ran along its sides to keep abreast of the current as they easily could and he could see more vividly the tumult which a break in the embankment of the little reservoir caused the whole town rushed to the spot or at least all the boys in it did and a great force of men besides with shovels and wheelbarrows and bundles of brush and straw and heavy logs and heaped them into the crevasse and piled earth on them the men threw off their coats and all joined in the work a great local politician led off in his shirtsleeves and it was as if my boy should now see the emperor of germany in his shirtsleeves pushing a wheelbarrow so high above all other men had that exalted whig always been to him but the hydraulic i believe was a town work and everybody felt himself an owner in it and hoped to share in the prosperity which it should bring to all it made the people so far one family as every public work which they own in common always does it made them brothers and equals as private property never does  of course the boys rose to no such conception of the fact before their eyes i suspect that in their secret hearts they would have been glad to have seen that whole embankment washed away for the excitements sake and for the hope of catching the fish that would be left flopping at the bottom of the reservoir when the waters were drained out i think that these waters were brought somehow from old river but i am not sure how old river was very far away and my boy was never there much and knew little of the weird region it bounded once he went in swimming in it but the still clear waters were strangely cold and not like those of the friendly miami once also when the boys had gone into the vast woods of that measureless continent which they called the island for pawpaws or for hickorynuts or maybe buckeyes they got lost and while they ran about in terror they heard the distant lowing and bellowing of cattle they knew somehow as boys know everything that the leader of the herd which ranged those woods in a halfsavage freedom was a vicious bull and as the lowing and bellowing sounded nearer they huddled together in the wildest dismay some were for running some for getting over a fence near by but they could not tell which side of the fence the herd was on in the primitive piety of childhood my boy suggested prayer as something that had served people in extremity and he believed that it was the only hope left another boy laughed and began to climb a tree the rest who had received my boys suggestion favorably instantly followed his example in fact he climbed a tree himself the herd came slowly up and when they reached the boys refuge they behaved with all the fury that could have been expectedthey trampled and tossed the bags that held the pawpaws or buckeyes or hickorynuts they gored the trees where the boys hung trembling they pawed and tossed the soft earth below and then they must have gone away and given them up as hopeless my boy never had the least notion how he got home and i dare say he was very young when he began these excursions to the woods  in some places old river was a stagnant pool covered with thick green scum and filled with frogs the son of one of the tavernkeepers was skilled in catching them and i fancy supplied them to his fathers table the important fact was his taking them which he did by baiting a cluster of three hooks with red flannel and dropping them at the end of a fishline before a frog the fated croaker plunged at the brilliant bait and was caught in the breast even as a small boy my boy thought it a cruel sight the boys pretended that the old frogs said whenever this frogcatching boy came in sight here comes hawkinshere comes hawkins look outlook out and a row of boys perched on a log in the water would sound this warning in mockery of the frogs or their foe and plump one after another in the depths as frogs follow their leader in swift succession they had nothing against hawkins they all liked him for he was a droll goodnatured fellow always up to some pleasantry one day he laughed out in school was that you laughed henry asked the teacher with unerring suspicion i was only smiling mr slack the next time see that you dont smile so loud said mr slack and forgave him as any one who saw his honest face must have wished to do they called him old hawkins for fondness and while my boy shuddered at him for his way of catching frogs he was in love with him for his laughing eyes and the kindly ways he had especially with the little boys     vi  schools and teachers   my boy had not a great deal to do with schools after his docile childhood when he began to run wild with the other boys he preferred their savage freedom and he got out of going to school by most of the devices they used he had never quite the hardihood to play truant but he was subject to sudden attacks of sickness which came on about schooltime and went off towards the middle of the forenoon or afternoon in a very strange manner i suppose that such complaints are unknown at the present time but the young peoples fathers can tell them how much suffering they used to cause among boys at the age when my boy was beginning to outgrow them he was taken into his fathers printingoffice and he completed his recovery and his education there but all through the years when he lived in the boys town he had intervals of schooling which broke in upon the swimming and the skating of course but were not altogether unpleasant or unprofitable  they began as they are apt to do with lessons in a private house where a lady taught several other children and where he possibly learned to read though he could only remember being set on a platform in punishment for some forgotten offence after that he went to school in the basement of a church where a number of boys and girls were taught by a master who knew how to endear study at least to my boy there was a garden outside of the schoolroom hollyhocks grew in it and the boys gathered the little cheeses as they called the seedbuttons which form when the flowers drop off and ate them because boys will eat anything and not because they liked them with the fact of this garden is mixed a sense of drowsy heat and summer light and that is all except the blackboard at the end of the room and a big girl doing sums at it and the wonder why the teacher smiled when he read in one of the girls compositions a phrase about forging puddings and pies my boy did not know what forging meant so he must have been very young but he had a zeal for learning and somehow he took a prize in geographya science in which he was never afterwards remarkable the prize was a little history of lexington mass which the teacher gave him perhaps because lexington may have been his native town but the history must have been very dryly told for not a fact of it remained in the boys mind he was vaguely disappointed in the book but he valued it for the teachers sake whom he was secretly very fond of and who had no doubt won the childs heart by some flattering notice he thought it a great happiness to follow him when the teacher gave up this school and took charge of one of the public schools but it was not the same there the teacher could not distinguish him in that multitude of boys and girls he did himself a little honor in spelling but he won no praise and he disgraced himself then as always in arithmetic he sank into the common herd of mediocrities and then when his family went to live in another part of the town he began to go to another school he had felt that the teacher belonged to him and it must have been a pang to find him so estranged but he was a kind man and long afterwards he had a friendly smile and word for the boy when they met and then all at once he ceased to be as men and things do in a boys world  the other school was another private school and it was doubtless a school of high grade in some things for it was called the academy but there was provision for the youngest beginners in a lower room and for a while my boy went there before school opened in the afternoon the children tried to roast apples on the stove but there never was time and they had to eat them half raw in the singingclass there was a boy who wore his hair so enviably long that he could toss it on his neck as he wheeled in the march of the class round the room his father kept a store and he brought candy to school they sang scotlands burning pour on water and home home dearest and happiest home no doubt they did other things but none of them remained in my boys mind and when he was promoted to the upper room very little more was added he studied philosophy as it was called and he learned as much from the picture as the text that you could not make a boat go by filling her sail from bellows on board he did not see why but he was chiefly concerned with his fears about the chemical room where i suppose some chemical apparatus must have been kept but where the big boys were taken to be whipped it was a place of dreadful execution to him and when he was once sent to the chemical boom and shut up there because he was crying and because as he explained he could not stop crying without a handkerchief and he had none with him he never expected to come out alive  in fact as i have said he dwelt in a world of terrors and i doubt if some of the big boys who were taken there to be whipped underwent so much as he in being merely taken to the place where they had been whipped at the same time while he cowered along in the shadow of unreal dangers he had a boys boldness with most of the real ones and he knew how to resent an indignity even at the hands of the teacher who could send him to the chemical room at pleasure he knew what belonged to him as a small boy of honor and one thing was not to be tamely put back from a higher to a lower place in his studies i dare say that boys do not mind this now they must have grown ever so much wiser since my boy went to school but in his time when you were put back say from the third reader to the second reader you took your books and left school that was what the other boys expected of you and it was the only thing for you to do if you had the least selfrespect for you were put back to the second reader after having failed to read the third and it was a public shame which nothing but leaving that school could wipe out the other boys would have a right to mock you if you did not do it and as soon as the class was dismissed you went to your desk as haughtily as you could and began putting your books and your slate and your inkstand together with defiant glances at the teacher and then when twelve oclock came or four oclock and the school was let out you tucked the bundle under your arm and marched out of the room with as much majesty as could be made to comport with a chip hat and bare feet and as you passed the teacher you gave a twist of the head that was meant to carry dismay to the heart of your enemy i note all these particulars carefully so as to show the boys of the present day what fools the boys of the past were though i think they will hardly believe it my boy was once that kind of fool but not twice he left school with all his things at twelve oclock and he returned with them at one for his father and mother did not agree with him about the teachers behavior in putting him back no boys father and mother agreed with him on this point every boy returned in just the same way but somehow the insult had been wiped out by the mere act of selfassertion and a boy kept his standing in the world as he could never have done if he had not left school when he was put back  the hydraulic ran alongside of the academy and at recess the boys had a good deal of fun with it one way and another sailing shingles with stones on them and watching them go under one end of the culvert and come out of the other or simply throwing rocks into the water it does not seem very exciting when you tell of it but it really was exciting though it was not so exciting as to go down to the mills where the hydraulic plunged over that great wheel into the miami a footbridge crossed it that you could jump up and down on and almost make touch the water and there were happier boys who did not go to school fishing there with men who had never gone sometimes the schoolboys ventured inside of the flourmill and the ironfoundry but i do not think this was often permitted and after all the great thing was to rush over to the riverbank all the boys and girls together and play with the fluttermills till the bell rang the markethouse was not far off and they went there sometimes when it was not marketday and played among the stalls and once a girl caught her hand on a meathook my boy had a vision of her hanging from it but this was probably one of those grisly fancies that were always haunting him and no fact at all the bridge was close by the markethouse but for some reason or no reason the children never played in the bridge perhaps the tollhouse man would not let them my boy stood in dread of the tollhouse man he seemed to have such a severe way of taking the money from the teamsters  some of the boys were said to be the beaux of some of the girls my boy did not know what that meant in his own mind he could not disentangle the idea of bows from the idea of arrows but he was in love with the girl who caught her hand on the meathook and secretly suffered much on account of her she had black eyes and her name long seemed to him the most beautiful name for a girl he said it to himself with flushes from his ridiculous little heart while he was still a boy of ten he heard that she was married and she must have been a great deal older than he in fact he was too small a boy when he went to the academy to remember how long he went there and whether it was months or years but probably it was not more than a year he stopped going there because the teacher gave up the school to become a new church minister and as my boys father and mother were new church people there must have been some intimacy between them and the teacher which he did not know of but he only stood in awe not terror of him and he was not surprised when he met him many long years after to find him a man peculiarly wise gentle and kind between the young and the old there is a vast gulf seldom if ever bridged the old can look backward over it but they cannot cross it any more than the young who can see no thither side  the next school my boy went to was a district school as they called a public school in the boys town he did not begin going there without something more than his usual fear and trembling for he had heard free schools and pay schools talked over among the boys and sharply distinguished in a pay school the teacher had only such powers of whipping as were given him by the parents and they were always strictly limited in a free school the teacher whipped as much and as often as he liked for this reason it was much better to go to a pay school but you had more fun at a free school because there were more fellows you must balance one thing against another the boy who philosophized the matter in this way was a merry unlucky fellow who fully tested the advantages and disadvantages of the freeschool system he was one of the besthearted boys in the world and the kindest to little boys he was always gay and always in trouble and forever laughing when he was not crying under that cruel rod sometimes he would not cry but when he was caught in one of his frequent offences and called up before the teachers desk in the face of the whole school and whipped over his thinly jacketed shoulders he would take it without wincing and go smiling to his seat and perhaps be called back and whipped more for smiling he was a sort of hero with the boys on this account but he was too kindhearted to be proud and mingled with the rest on equal terms one awful day just before school took up in the afternoon he and another boy went for a bucket of drinkingwater it always took two boys they were gone till long after school began and when they came back the teacher called them up and waited for them to arrive slowly at his desk while he drew his long lithe rod through his left hand they had to own that they had done wrong and they had no excuse but the one a boy always hasthey forgot he said he must teach them not to forget and their punishment began surely the most hideous and depraving sight except a hanging that could be offered to childrens eyes one of them howled and shrieked and leaped and danced catching his back his arms his legs as the strokes rained upon him imploring promising and getting away at last with a wild effort to rub himself all over all at once when it came the heros turn he bore it without a murmur and as if his fortitude exasperated him the teacher showered the blows more swiftly and fiercely upon him than before till a tear or two did steal down the boys cheek then he was sent to his seat and in a few minutes he was happy with a trap for catching flies which he had contrived in his desk  no doubt they were an unruly set of boys and i do not suppose the teacher was a hard man though he led the life of an executioner and seldom passed a day without inflicting pain that a fiend might shrink from giving my boy lived in an anguish of fear lest somehow he should come under that rod of his but he was rather fond of the teacher and so were all the boys the teacher took a real interest in their studies and if he whipped them well he taught them well and at most times he was kind and friendly with them anyway he did not blister your hand with a ruler as some teachers did or make you stand bent forward from the middle with your head hanging down so that the blood all ran into it under him my boy made great advances in reading and writing and he won some distinction in declamation but the old difficulties with the arithmetic remained he failed to make anything out of the parts of speech in his grammar but one afternoon while he sat in his stocking feet trying to ease the chilblains which every boy used to have from his snowsoaked boots before the days of indiarubbers he found something in the back of his grammar which made him forget all about the pain this was a part called prosody and it told how to make verses explained the feet the accents the stanzaseverything that had puzzled him in his attempts to imitate the poems he had heard his father read aloud he was amazed he had never imagined that such a science existed and yet here it was printed out with each principle reduced to practice he conceived of its reasons at the first reading so that i suppose nature had not dealt so charily with him concerning the rules of prosody as the rules of arithmetic and he lost no time in applying them in a poem of his own the afternoon air was heavy with the heat that quivered visibly above the great castiron wood stove in the centre of the schoolroom the boys drowsed in their seats or hummed sleepily over their lessons the chilblains gnawed away at the poets feet but heaven had opened to him and he was rapt far from all the world of sense the music which he had followed through those poems his father read was no longer a mystery he had its key its secret he might hope to wield its charm to lay its spell upon others he wrote his poem which was probably a simple unconscious imitation of something that had pleased him in his schoolreader and carried it proudly home with him but here he met with that sort of disappointment which more than any other dismays and baffles authorship a difference in the point of view his father said the verses were well made and he sympathized with him in his delight at having found out the way to make them though he was not so much astonished as the boy that such a science as prosody should exist he praised the childs work and no doubt smiled at it with the mother but he said that the poem spoke of heaven as a place in the sky and he wished him always to realize that heaven was a state and not a place and that we could have it in this world as well as the next the boy promised that he would try to realize heaven as a state but at the bottom of his heart he despaired of getting that idea into poetry everybody else who had made poetry spoke of heaven as a place they even called it a land and put it in the sky and he did not see how he was to do otherwise no matter what swedenborg said he revered swedenborg he had a religious awe of the seers lithograph portrait in a fullbottom wig which hung in the frontroom but he did not see how even swedenborg could have helped calling heaven a place if he had been making poetry  the next year or the next quarter maybe there was a new teacher they seem to have followed each other somewhat as people do in a dream they were not there and then they were there but however the new one came the boys were some time in getting used to his authority it appeared to them that several of his acts were distinctly tyrannical and were encroachments upon rights of theirs which the other teacher with all his severity had respected my boy was inspired by the common mood to write a tragedy which had the despotic behavior of the new teacher for its subject and which was intended to be represented by the boys in the hayloft of a boy whose father had a stable without any horse in it the tragedy was written in the measure of the lady of the lake which was the last poem my boy had heard his father reading aloud it was very easy kind of verse at the same time the boys were to be dressed as roman conspirators and one of them was to give the teacher a petition to read while another plunged a dagger into his vitals and still another shouted strike stephanos strike it seemed to my boy that he had invented a situation which he had lifted almost bodily out of goldsmiths history and he did not feel that his lines            come one come all this rock shall flee            from its firm base as soon as we  were too closely modelled upon scotts lines            come one come all this rock shall fly            from its firm base as soon as i  the tragedy was never acted there may have been some trouble about the hayloft for the boy whose father owned the stable was to have got the use of it without his fathers knowing it and the poet found that the boys themselves scarcely entered into the spirit of his work but after that there came a real tragedy which most of them had part in without realizing it and that was their persecution of a teacher until he had to give up the school he must have come next after that usurper but at any rate the word had been passed round even before school took up the first morning he began that he was to be resisted to the death he could not have had any notion of what was in the air for in that opening speech to the school which a new teacher always used to make he talked to the boys in the friendliest manner and with more sense and reason than they could feel though i hope they felt some secret shame for the way they meant to behave he took up some old dry rods which he had lying on his desk and which he said he had found in it and he told them he hoped never to use such a thing as a rod in that school and never to strike any boy a blow he broke the rods into small pieces and put them into the stove and called the school to order for the studies before it but the school never came to order either then or afterwards as soon as the teacher took his seat the whispering and giggling the scuffling and pushing began the boys passed notes to the girls and held up their slates with things written on them to make the girls laugh and they threw chewedpaper balls at one another they asked to go out and they stayed out as long as they pleased and came back with an easy air as if they had done nothing they would not study they did not care how much they missed in the class and they laughed when they had to go to the foot they made faces at the teacher and mocked him when his back was turned they even threw paper wads at him  it went on day after day till the school became a babel the teacher tried reasoning and such mild punishment as standing up in the middle of the floor and keeping in after school one big boy whom he stood up winked at the girls and made everybody titter another whom he bade stay after school grabbed his hat and ran out of the room the fellows played hookey as much as they wanted to and did not give any excuse for being late or for not coming at all at last when the teacher was driven desperate and got in a rod which he said he was ashamed to use but they left him no hope of ruling them by reason the big boys fought him and struck back when he began to whip them this gentle soul had not one friend among all those little savages whom he had given no cause to hate but only cause to love him none of them could have told why they used him so ill for nobody knew only the word had gone out that you were not to mind him but to mock him and fight him nobody knew where the word first came from  not even my boy i grieve to say was the poor mans friend though he too had received only kindness from him one day when the teacher had set him his copy and found him doing it badly as he came by he gave him a slight tap on his head with his penknife and addressed him some halfjoking reproof this fired my boys wicked little heart with furious resentment he gathered up his books after school and took them home a good many other boys had done it and the school was dwindling he was sent back with his books the next morning and many other parents behaved as wisely as his one of the leading men in the town whose mere presence in the schoolroom sent a thrill of awe through the fellows brought his son in after such an escapade and told the teacher that he had just given him a sound thrashing and he hoped the teacher would give him another but the teacher took the hand of the snivelling wretch and called him affectionately by name and said they would try to get along without that and sent him to his seat forgiven it ought to have touched a heart of stone but in that barbarous republic of boys there was no gratitude sometimes they barred the teacher out by nailing the doors and windows and at last he gave up the school  but even then his persecution did not end the word went out that you were not to speak to him if you met him and if he spoke to you you were not to say anything back one day he came up to my boy where he sat fishing for crawfish in the hydraulic with his bare legs dangling over the edge of a culvert and unawed by this august figure asked him pleasantly what luck he had the boy made no sign of seeing or hearing him and he ignored some other kindly advances i hope the teacher thought it merely his shyness the boy went home and told gleefully how he had refused to speak to old manton but here he met his reward he was made to feel how basely rude he had been and to tingle with a wholesome shame there was some talk of sending him to the teacher to ask his forgiveness but this was given up for fear of inflicting pain where possibly none had been felt i wish now the boy could have gone to him for perhaps the teacher is no longer living     vii  manners and customs   i sometimes wonder how much these have changed since my boys time of course they differ somewhat from generation to generation and from east to west and north to south but not so much i believe as grown people are apt to think everywhere and always the world of boys is outside of the laws that govern grownup communities and it has its unwritten usages which are handed down from old to young and perpetuated on the same level of years and are lived into and lived out of but are binding through all personal vicissitudes upon the great body of boys between six and twelve years old no boy can violate them without losing his standing among the other boys and he cannot enter into their world without coming under them he must do this and must not do that he obeys but he does not know why any more than the faroff savages from whom his customs seem mostly to have come his world is all in and through the world of men and women but no man or woman can get into it any more than if it were a world of invisible beings it has its own ideals and superstitions and these are often of a ferocity a depravity scarcely credible in afterlife it is a great pity that fathers and mothers cannot penetrate that world but they cannot and it is only by accident that they can catch some glimpse of what goes on in it no doubt it will be civilized in time but it will be very slowly and in the meanwhile it is only in some of its milder manners and customs that the boys world can be studied  the first great law was that whatever happened to you through another boy whatever hurt or harm he did you you were to right yourself upon his person if you could but if he was too big and you could not hope to revenge yourself then you were to bear the wrong not only for that time but for as many times as he chose to inflict it to tell the teacher or your mother or to betray your tormentor to any one outside of the boys world was to prove yourself a crybaby without honor or selfrespect and unfit to go with the other fellows they would have the right to mock you to point at you and call eee eee eee at you till you fought them after that whether you whipped them or not there began to be some feeling in your favor again and they had to stop  every boy who came to town from somewhere else or who moved into a new neighborhood had to fight the old residents there was no reason for this except that he was a stranger and there appeared to be no other means of making his acquaintance if he was generally whipped he became subject to the local tribe as the delawares were to the iroquois in the last century if he whipped the other boys then they adopted him into their tribe and he became a leader among them when you moved away from a neighborhood you did not lose all your rights in it you did not have to fight when you went back to see the boys or anything but if one of them met you in your new precincts you might have to try conclusions with him and perhaps if he was a boy who had been in the habit of whipping you you were quite ready to do so when my boys family left the smith house one of the boys from that neighborhood came up to see him at the falconer house and tried to carry things with a high hand as he had always done then my boy fought him quite as if he were not a delaware and the other boy not an iroquois with sovereign rights over him my boy was beaten but the difference was that if he had not been on new ground he would have been beaten without daring to fight his mother witnessed the combat and came out and shamed him for his behavior and had in the other boy and made them friends over some sugarcakes but after that the boys of the smith neighborhood understood that my boy would not be whipped without fighting the home instruction was all against fighting my boy was taught that it was not only wicked but foolish that if it was wrong to strike it was just as wrong to strike back that two wrongs never made a right and so on but all this was not of the least effect with a hot temper amid the trials and perplexities of life in the boys town  there were some boys of such standing as bullies and such wide fame that they could range all neighborhoods of the town not only without fear of being molested or made to pass under the local yoke anywhere but with such plenary powers of intimidation that the other boys submitted to them without question my boy had always heard of one of these bullies whose very name buz simpson carried terror with it but he had never seen him because he lived in the unknown region bordering on the river south of the thomas house one day he suddenly appeared when my boy was playing marbles with some other fellows in front of the falconer house attended by two or three other boys from below the sycamore grove he was small and insignificant but such was the fear his name inspired that my boy and his friends cowered before him though some of them were no mean fighters themselves they seemed to know by instinct that this was buz simpson and they stood patiently by while he kicked their marbles out of the ring and broke up their game and after staying awhile to cover them with ignominy and insult passed on with his retainers to other fields of conquest if it had been death to resist him they could not have dreamed less of doing so and though this outrage took place under my boys own windows and a single word would have brought efficient aid for the mere sight of any boys mother could put to flight a whole army of other boys he never dreamed of calling for help  that would have been a weakness which would not only have marked him forever as a crybaby but an indecorum too gross for words it would have been as if when once the boys were playing trip at school and a big boy tripped him and he lay quivering and panting on the ground he had got up as soon as he could catch his breath and gone in and told the teacher or as if when the fellows were playing soakabout and he got hit in the pit of the stomach with a hard ball he had complained of the fellow who threw it there were some things so base that a boy could not do them and what happened out of doors and strictly within the boys world had to be kept sacredly secret among the boys for instance if you had been beguiled as a little boy into being the last in the game of snapthewhip and the snap sent you rolling head over heels on the hard ground and skinned your nose and tore your trousers you could cry from the pain without disgrace and some of the fellows would come up and try to comfort you but you were bound in honor not to appeal to the teacher and you were expected to use every device to get the blood off you before you went in and to hide the tear in your trousers of course the tear and the blood could not be kept from the anxious eyes at home but even there you were expected not to say just what boys did it  they were by no means the worst boys who did such things but only the most thoughtless still there was a public opinion in the boys town which ruled out certain tricks and gave the boys who played them the name of being mean one of these was boring a hole in the edge of your schooldesk to meet a shaft sunk from the top which you filled with slatepencil dust then if you were that kind of boy you got some little chap to put his eye close to the shaft with the hope of seeing niagara falls and set your lips to the hole in the edge and blew his eye full of pencildust this was mean and it was also mean to get some unsuspecting child to close the end of an elderwood tube with his thumb and look hard at you while you showed him germany you did this by pulling a string below the tube and running a needle into his thumb my boy discovered germany in this way long before he had any geographical or political conception of it  i do not know why if these abominable cruelties were thought mean it was held lawful to cover a stone with dust and get a boy not in the secret to kick the pile over with his bare foot it was perfectly good form also to get a boy if you could to shut his eyes and then lead him into a mudpuddle or a thicket of briers or nettles or to fool him in any heartless way such as promising to pump easy when he put his mouth to the pumpspout and then coming down on the pumphandle with a rush that flooded him with water and sent him off blowing the tide from his nostrils like a whale perhaps these things were permitted because the sight of the victims suffering was so funny half the pleasure in fighting wasps or bumblebees was in killing them and destroying their nests the other half was in seeing the fellows get stung if you could fool a fellow into a massmeeting of bumblebees and see him lead them off in a steeplechase it was right and fair to do so but there were other cases in which deceit was not allowable for instance if you appeared on the playground with an apple and all the boys came whooping round you know me jimmy you know your uncle you know your grandfather and you began to sell out bites at three pins for a ladybite and six pins for a hogbite and a boy bought a ladybite and then took a hogbite he was held in contempt and could by no means pass it off for a good joke on you it was considered mean  in the boys town there was almost as much stonethrowing as there was in florence in the good old times there was a great abundance of the finest kind of pebbles from the size of a robins egg upward smooth and shapely which the boys called rocks they were always stoning something birds or dogs or mere inanimate marks but most of the time they were stoning one another they came out of their houses or frontyards and began to throw stones when they were on perfectly good terms and they usually threw stones in parting for the day they stoned a boy who left a group singly and it was lawful for him to throw stones back at the rest if the whim took him when he got a little way off with all this stonethrowing very little harm was done though now and then a stone took a boy on the skull and raised a lump of its own size then the other boys knew by the roar of rage and pain he set up that he had been hit and ran home and left him to his fate  their fights were mostly informal scuffles on and off in a flash and conducted with none of the ceremony which i have read of concerning the fights of english boys it was believed that some of the fellows knew how to box and all the fellows intended to learn but nobody ever did the fights sprang usually out of some trouble of the moment but at times they were arranged to settle some question of moral or physical superiority then one boy put a chip on his shoulder and dared the other to knock it off it took a great while to bring the champions to blows and i have known the mere preparatory insults of a fight of this kind to wear out the spirit of the combatants and the patience of the spectators so that not a blow was struck finally and the whole affair fell through  though they were so quarrelsome among themselves the boys that my boy went with never molested girls they mostly ignored them but they would have scorned to hurt a girl almost as much as they would have scorned to play with one of course while they were very little they played with girls and after they began to be big boys eleven or twelve years old they began to pay girls some attention but for the rest they simply left them out of the question except at parties when the games obliged them to take some notice of the girls even then however it was not good form for a boy to be greatly interested in them and he had to conceal any little fancy he had about this girl or that unless he wanted to be considered soft by the other fellows when they were having fun they did not want to have any girls around but in the backyard a boy might play teeter or seesaw or some such thing with his sisters and their friends without necessarily losing caste though such things were not encouraged on the other hand a boy was bound to defend them against anything that he thought slighting or insulting and you did not have to verify the fact that anything had been said or done you merely had to hear that it had it once fell to my boy to avenge such a reported wrong from a boy who had not many friends in school a timid creature whom the mere accusation frightened half out of his wits and who wildly protested his innocence he ran and my boy followed with the other boys after him till they overtook the culprit and brought him to bay against a high board fence and there my boy struck him in his imploring face he tried to feel like a righteous champion but he felt like a brutal ruffian he long had the sight of that terrified weeping face and with shame and sickness of heart he cowered before it it was pretty nearly the last of his fighting and though he came off victor he felt that he would rather be beaten himself than do another such act of justice in fact it seems best to be very careful how we try to do justice in this world and mostly to leave retribution of all kinds to god who really knows about things and content ourselves as much as possible with mercy whose mistakes are not so irreparable  the boys had very little to do with the inside of one anothers houses they would follow a boy to his door and wait for him to come out and they would sometimes get him to go in and ask his mother for crullers or sugarcakes when they came to see him they never went indoors for him but stood on the sidewalk and called him with a peculiar cry something like eoowe eoowe and threw stones at trees or anything till he came out if he did not come after a reasonable time they knew he was not there or that his mother would not let him come a fellow was kept in that way now and then if a fellows mother came to the door the boys always ran  the mother represented the family sovereignty the father was seldom seen and he counted for little or nothing among the outside boys it was the mother who could say whether a boy might go fishing or in swimming and she was held a good mother or not according as she habitually said yes or no there was no other standard of goodness for mothers in the boys world and could be none and a bad mother might be outwitted by any device that the other boys could suggest to her boy such a boy was always willing to listen to any suggestion and no boy took it hard if the other fellows made fun when their plan got him into trouble at home if a boy came out after some such experience with his face wet and his eyes red and his lips swollen of course you had to laugh he expected it and you expected him to stone you for laughing  when a boys mother had company he went and hid till the guests were gone or only came out of concealment to get some sort of shy lunch if the other fellows mothers were there he might be a little bolder and bring out cake from the second table but he had to be pretty careful how he conformed to any of the usages of grownup society a fellow who brushed his hair and put on shoes and came into the parlor when there was company was not well seen among the fellows he was regarded in some degree as a girlboy a boy who wished to stand well with other boys kept in the woodshed and only went in as far as the kitchen to get things for his guests in the backyard yet there were mothers who would make a boy put on a collar when they had company and disgrace him before the world by making him stay round and help they acted as if they had no sense and no pity but such mothers were rare  most mothers yielded to public opinion and let their boys leave the house and wear just what they always wore i have told how little they wore in summer of course in winter they had to put on more things in those days knickerbockers were unknown and if a boy had appeared in short pants and long stockings he would have been thought dressed like a circusactor boys wore long pantaloons like men as soon as they put off skirts and they wore jackets or roundabouts such as the english boys still wear at eton when the cold weather came they had to put on shoes and stockings or rather longlegged boots such as are seen now only among lumbermen and teamsters in the country most of the fellows had stoga boots as heavy as iron and as hard they were splendid to skate in they kept your ankles so stiff sometimes they greased them to keep the water out but they never blacked them except on sunday and before saturday they were as red as a rusty stovepipe at night they were always so wet that you could not get them off without a bootjack and you could hardly do it anyway sometimes you got your brother to help you off with them and then he pulled you all round the room in the morning they were dry but just as hard as stone and you had to soap the heel of your woollen sock which your grandmother had knitted for you or maybe some of your aunts before you could get your foot in and sometimes the ears of the boot that you pulled it on by would give way and you would have to stamp your foot in and kick the toe against the mopboard then you gasped and limped round with your feet like fire till you could get out and limber your boots up in some water somewhere about noon your chilblains began  my boy had his secret longing to be a dandy and once he was so taken with a little silk hat at the hatstore that he gave his father no peace till he got it for him but the very first time he wore it the boys made fun of it and that was enough after that he wore it several times with streaming tears and then he was allowed to lay it aside and compromise on an unstylish cap of velvet which he had despised before i do not know why a velvet cap was despised but it was a cap with a tassel was babyish the most desired kind of cap was a flat one of blue broadcloth with a patentleather peak and a removable cover of oilcloth silk if you were rich cotton if you were poor when you had pulled the top of such a cap over on one side you were dressed for conquest especially if you wore your hair long my boy had such a cap with a silk oilcloth cover but his splendor was marred by his short hair  at one time boots with long sharppointed toes were the fashion and he so ardently desired a pair of these that fate granted his prayer but in the ironical spirit which fate usually shows when granting a persons prayers these boots were of calfskin and they had red leather tops which you could show by letting your pantaloonlegs carelessly catch on the ears but the smallest pair in town was several sizes too large for my boy the other boys were not slow to discover the fact and his martyrdom with these boots began at once but he was not allowed to give them up as he did the silk hat he had to wear them out however it did not take long to wear out a pair of boots in the boys town a few weeks scuffling over the gravelly ground or a single days steady sliding made them the subjects for halfsoling and then it was a question of only a very little time  a good many of the boys though wore their boots long after they were worn out and so they did with the rest of their clothes i have tried to give some notion of the general distribution of comfort which was never riches in the boys town but i am afraid that i could not paint the simplicity of things there truly without being misunderstood in these days of great splendor and great squalor everybody had enough but nobody had too much the richest man in town might be worth twenty thousand dollars there were distinctions among the grown people and no doubt there were the social cruelties which are the modern expression of the savage spirit otherwise repressed by civilization but these were unknown among the boys savages they were but not that kind of savages they valued a boy for his character and prowess and it did not matter in the least that he was ragged and dirty their mothers might not allow him the run of their kitchens quite so freely as some other boys but the boys went with him just the same and they never noticed how little he was washed and dressed the best of them had not an overcoat and underclothing was unknown among them when a boy had buttoned up his roundabout and put on his mittens and tied his comforter round his neck and over his ears he was warmly dressed     viii  plays and pastimes   about the time fate cursed him with a granted prayer in those boots my boy was deep in the reading of a book about grecian mythology which he found perpetually fascinating he read it over and over without ever thinking of stopping merely because he had already been through it twenty or thirty times it had pictures of all the gods and goddesses demigods and heroes and he tried to make poems upon their various characters and exploits but apollo was his favorite and i believe it was with some hope of employing them in a personation of the god that he coveted those redtopped sharptoed calfskin boots he had a notion that if he could get up a chariot by sawing down the sides of a storebox for the body and borrowing the hindwheels of the babys willow wagon and then drawn by the family dog tip at a mad gallop come suddenly whirling round the corner of the schoolhouse wearing spangled circustights and bearing apollos bow and shaft while a silken scarf which he had seen in a bureaudrawer at home blew gallantly out behind him it would have a fine effect with the boys some of the fellows wished to be highway robbers and outlaws one who intended to be a pirate afterwards got so far in a maritime career as to invent a steamengine governor now in use on the seagoing steamers my boy was content to be simply a god the god of poetry and sunshine he never realized his modest ambition but then boys never realize anything though they have lots of fun failing  illustration a citizens character for cleverness or meanness was fixed by his walking round or over the rings  in the boys town they had regular games and plays which came and went in a stated order the first thing in the spring as soon as the frost began to come out of the ground they had marbles which they played till the weather began to be pleasant for the game and then they left it off there were some meanspirited fellows who played for fun but any boy who was anything played for keeps that is keeping all the marbles he won as my boy was skilful at marbles he was able to start out in the morning with his toy or the marble he shot with and a commy or a brown marble of the lowest value and come home at night with a pocketful of whitealleys and bloodalleys striped plasters find bullseyes and crystals clear and clouded his gambling was not approved of at home but it was allowed him because of the hardness of his heart i suppose and because it was not thought well to keep him up too strictly and i suspect it would have been useless to forbid his playing for keeps though he came to have a bad conscience about it before he gave it up there were three kinds of games at marbles which the boys played one with a long ring marked out on the ground and a base some distance off which you began to shoot from another with a round ring whose line formed the base and another with holes three or five hollowed in the earth at equal distances from each other which was called knucks you could play for keeps in all these games and in knucks if you won you had a shot or shots at the knuckles of the fellow who lost and who was obliged to hold them down for you to shoot at fellows who were mean would twitch their knuckles away when they saw your toy coming and run but most of them took their punishment with the savage pluck of so many little sioux as the game began in the raw cold of the earliest spring every boy had chapped hands and nearly every one had the skin worn off the knuckle of his middle finger from resting it on the ground when he shot you could use a knuckledabster of fur or cloth to rest your hand on but it was considered effeminate and in the excitement you were apt to forget it anyway marbles were always very exciting and were played with a clamor as incessant as that of a blackbird roost a great many points were always coming up whether a boy tookup or edged beyond the very place where his toy lay when he shot whether he knuckled down or kept his hand on the ground in shooting whether when another boys toy drove one marble against another and knocked both out of the ring he holloed fen doubs before the other fellow holloed doubs whether a marble was in or out of the ring and whether the umpires decision was just or not the gambling and the quarrelling went on till the secondbell rang for school and began again as soon as the boys could get back to their rings when school let out the rings were usually marked on the ground with a stick but when there was a great hurry or there was no stick handy the side of a fellows boot would do and the hollows for knucks were always bored by twirling round on your bootheel this helped a boy to wear out his boots very rapidly but that was what his boots were made for just as the sidewalks were made for the boys marblerings and a citizens character for cleverness or meanness was fixed by his walking round or over the rings cleverness was used in the virginia sense for amiability a person who was clever in the english sense was smart  there were many games of ball twocornered cat was played by four boys two to bat and two behind the batters to catch and pitch threecornered cat was i believe the game which has since grown into baseball and was even then sometimes called so but soakabout was the favorite game at school and it simply consisted of hitting any other boy you could with the ball when you could get it football was always played with a bladder and it came in season with the cold weather when the putting up of beef began the business was practically regarded by the boys as one undertaken to supply them with bladders for footballs  when the warm weather came on in april and the boys got off their shoes for good there came races in which they seemed to fly on wings life has a good many innocent joys for the human animal but surely none so ecstatic as the boy feels when his bare foot first touches the breast of our mother earth in the spring something thrills through him then from the heart of her inmost being that makes him feel kin with her and cousin to all her dumb children of the grass and trees his blood leaps as wildly as at that kiss of the waters when he plunges into their arms in june there is something even finer and sweeter in the rapture of the earlier bliss the day will not be long enough for his flights his races he aches more with regret than with fatigue when he must leave the happy paths under the stars outside and creep into his bed it is all like some glimpse some foretaste of the heavenly time when the earth and her sons shall be reconciled in a deathless love and they shall not be thankless nor she a stepmother any more  about the only drawback to going barefoot was stumping your toe which you were pretty sure to do when you first took off your shoes and before you had got used to your new running weight when you struck your toe against a rock or anything you caught it up in your hand and hopped about a hundred yards before you could bear to put it to the ground then you sat down and held it as tight as you could and cried over it till the fellows helped you to the pump to wash the blood off then as soon as you could you limped home for a rag and kept pretty quiet about it so as to get out again without letting on to your mother  with the races came the other plays which involved running like hideandgowhoop and tag and dogonwood and horse which i dare say the boys of other times and other wheres know by different names the smithhouse neighborhood was a famous place for them all both because there were such lots of boys and because there were so many sheds and stables where you could hide and everything there was a town pump there for you so that you would not have to go into the house for a drink when you got thirsty and perhaps be set to doing something and there were plenty of boards for teeter and seesaw and somehow that neighborhood seemed to understand boys and did not molest them in any way in a vacant lot behind one of the houses there was a whirligig that you could ride on and get sick in about a minute it was splendid there was a family of german boys living across the street that you could stone whenever they came out of their front gate for the simple and sufficient reason that they were dutchmen and without going to the trouble of a quarrel with them my boy was not allowed to stone them but when he was with the other fellows and his elder brother was not along he could not help stoning them  there were shade trees all along that street that you could climb if you wanted to or that you could lie down under when you had run yourself out of breath or play mumblethepeg my boy distinctly remembered that under one of these trees his elder brother first broached to him that awful scheme of reform about fibbing and applied to their own lives the moral of the trippings of tom pepper he remembered how a conviction of the righteousness of the scheme sank into his soul and he could not withhold his consent under the same tree and very likely at the same time a solemn conclave of boys all the boys there were discussed the feasibility of tying a tin can to a dogs tail and seeing how he would act they had all heard of the thing but none of them had seen it and it was not so much a question of whether you ought to do a thing that on the very face of it would be so much fun and if it did not amuse the dog as highly as anybody could certainly do him no harm as it was a question of whose dog you should get to take the dogs part in the sport it was held that an old dog would probably not keep still long enough for you to tie the can on he would have his suspicions or else he would not run when the can was tied on but very likely just go and lie down somewhere the lot finally fell to a young yellow dog belonging to one of the boys and the owner at once ran home to get him and easily lured him back to the other boys with flatteries and caresses the flatteries and caresses were not needed for a dog is always glad to go with boys upon any pretext and so far from thinking that he does them a favor he feels himself greatly honored but i dare say the boy had a guilty fear that if his dog had known why he was invited to be of that party of boys he might have pleaded a previous engagement as it was he came joyfully and allowed the can to be tied to his tail without misgiving if there had been any question with the boys as to whether he would enter fully into the spirit of the affair it must have been instantly dissipated by the dogs behavior when he felt the loop tighten on his tail and looked round to see what the matter was the boys hardly had a chance to cheer him before he flashed out of sight round the corner and they hardly had time to think before he flashed into sight again from the other direction he whizzed along the ground and the can hurtled in the air but there was no other sound and the cheers died away on the boys lips the boy who owned the dog began to cry and the other fellows began to blame him for not stopping the dog but he might as well have tried to stop a streak of lightning the only thing you could do was to keep out of the dogs way as an experiment it was successful beyond the wildest dreams of its projectors though it would have been a sort of relief if the dog had taken some other road for variety or had even reversed his course but he kept on as he began and by a common impulse the boys made up their minds to abandon the whole affair to him they all ran home and hid or else walked about and tried to ignore it but at this point the grownup people began to be interested the mothers came to their doors to see what was the matter yet even the mothers were powerless in a case like that and the enthusiast had to be left to his fate he was found under a barn at last breathless almost lifeless and he tried to bite the man who untied the can from his tail eventually he got well again and lived to be a solemn warning to the boys he was touchingly distrustful of their advances for a time but he finally forgot and forgave everything they did not forget and they never tried tying a tin can to a dogs tail again among all the things they tried and kept trying once was enough and they never even liked to talk of it the sight was so awful they were really fond of the dog and if they could have thought he would take the matter so seriously they would not have tried to have that kind of fun with him it cured them of ever wanting to have that kind of fun with any dog  as the weather softened tops came in some weeks after marbles went out and just after footraces were over and a little before swimming began at first the boys bought their tops at the stores but after a while the boy whose father had the turningshop on the hydraulic learned to turn their tops and did it for nothing which was cheaper than buying tops especially as he furnished the wood too and you only had to get the wire peg yourself i believe he was the same boy who wanted to be a pirate and ended by inventing a steamgovernor he was very ingenious and he knew how to turn a top out of beech or maple that would outspin anything you could get in a store the boys usually chose a firm smooth piece of sidewalk under one of the big trees in the smith neighborhood and spun their tops there a fellow launched his top into the ring and the rest waited till it began to go to sleep that is to settle in one place and straighten up and spin silently as if standing still then any fellow had a right to peg at it with his top and if he hit it he won it and if he split it as sometimes happened the fellow that owned it had to give him a top the boys came with their pockets bulged out with tops but before long they had to go for more tops to that boy who could turn them from this it was but another step to go to the shop with him and look on while he turned the tops and then in process of time the boys discovered that the smooth floor of the shop was a better place to fight tops than the best piece of sidewalk they would have given whole saturdays to the sport there but when they got to holloing too loudly the boys father would come up and then they would all run it was considered mean in him but the boy himself was awfully clever and the first thing the fellows knew they were back there again some few of the boys had hummingtops but though these pleased by their noise they were not much esteemed and could make no head against the good old turnipshaped tops solid and weighty that you could wind up with a stout cotton cord and launch with perfect aim from the flat button held between your fore finger and middle finger some of the boys had a very pretty art in the twirl they gave the top and could control its course somewhat as a skilful pitcher can govern that of a baseball  i do not know why a certain play went out but suddenly the fellows who had been playing ball or marbles or tops would find themselves playing something else kites came in just about the time of the greatest heat in summer and lasted a good while but could not have lasted as long as the heat which began about the first of june and kept on well through september no play could last so long as that and i suppose kiteflying must have died into swimming after the fourth of july the kites were of various shapes bow kites twostick kites and house kites a bow kite could be made with half a barrel hoop carried over the top of a cross but it was troublesome to make and it did not fly very well and somehow it was thought to look babyish but it was held in greater respect than the twostick kite which only the smallest boys played with and which was made by fastening two sticks in the form of a cross any fellow more than six years old who appeared on the commons with a twostick kite would have been met with jeers as a kind of girl the favorite kite the kite that balanced best took the wind best and flew best and that would stand all day when you got it up was the house kite which was made of three sticks and shaped nearly in the form of the gable of a gambrelroofed house only smaller at the base than at the point where the roof would begin the outline of all these kites was given and the sticks stayed in place by a string carried taut from stick to stick which was notched at the ends to hold it sometimes the sticks were held with a tack at the point of crossing and sometimes they were mortised into one another but this was apt to weaken them the frame was laid down on a sheet of paper and the paper was cut an inch or two larger and then pasted and folded over the string most of the boys used a paste made of flour and cold water but my boy and his brother could usually get paste from the printingoffice and when they could not they would make it by mixing flour and water creamthick and slowly boiling it that was a paste that would hold till the cows came home the boys said and my boy was courted for his skill in making it but after the kite was pasted and dried in the sun or behind the kitchen stove if you were in very much of a hurry and you nearly always were it had to be hung with bellybands and tailbands that is with strings carried from stick to stick over the face and at the bottom to attach the cord for flying it and to fasten on the tail by this took a good deal of art and unless it were well done the kite would not balance but would be always pitching and darting then the tail had to be of just the right weight if it was too heavy the kite kept sinking even after you got it up where otherwise it would stand if too light the kite would dart and dash itself to pieces on the ground a very pretty tail was made by tying twists of paper across a string a foot apart till there were enough to balance the kite but this sort of tail was apt to get tangled and the best tail was made of a long streamer of cotton rags with a gay tuft of dogfennel at the end dogfennel was added or taken away till just the right weight was got and when this was done after several experimental tests the kite was laid flat on its face in the middle of the road or on a long stretch of smooth grass the bands were arranged and the tail stretched carefully out behind where it would not catch on bushes you unwound a great length of twine running backward and letting the twine slip swiftly through your hands till you had run enough out then you seized the ball and with one look over your shoulder to see that all was right started swiftly forward the kite reared itself from the ground and swaying gracefully from side to side rose slowly into the air with its long tail climbing after it till the fennel tuft swung free if there was not much surface wind you might have to run a little way but as soon as the kite caught the upper currents it straightened itself pulled the twine taut and steadily mounted while you gave it more and more twine if the breeze was strong the cord burned as it ran through your hands till at last the kite stood still in the sky at such a height that the cord holding it sometimes melted out of sight in the distance  if it was a hot july day the sky would be full of kites and the commons would be dotted over with boys holding them or setting them up or winding them in and all talking and screaming at the tops of their voices under the roasting sun one might think that kiteflying at least could be carried on quietly and peaceably but it was not besides the wild debate of the rival excellences of the different kites there were always quarrels from getting the strings crossed for as the boys got their kites up they drew together for company and for an easier comparison of their merits it was only a mean boy who would try to cross another fellows string but sometimes accidents would happen two kites would become entangled and both would have to be hauled in while their owners cried and scolded and the other fellows cheered and laughed now and then the tail of a kite would part midway and then the kite would begin to dart violently from side to side and then to whirl round and round in swifter and narrower circles till it dashed itself to the ground sometimes the kitestring would break and the kite would waver and fall like a bird shot in the wing and the owner of the kite and all the fellows who had no kites would run to get it where it came down perhaps a mile or more away it usually came down in a tree and they had to climb for it but sometimes it lodged so high that no one could reach it and then it was slowly beaten and washed away in the winds and rains and its long tail left streaming all winter from the naked bough where it had caught it was so good for kites on the commons because there were no trees there and not even fences but a vast open stretch of level grass which the cows and geese kept cropped to the earth and for the most part the boys had no trouble with their kites there some of them had paper fringe pasted round the edges of their kites this made a fine rattling as the kite rose and when the kite stood at the end of its string you could hear the humming if you put your ear to the twine but the most fun was sending up messengers the messengers were cut out of thick paper with a slit at one side so as to slip over the string which would be pulled level long enough to give the messenger a good start and then released when the wind would catch the little circle and drive it up the long curving incline till it reached the kite  illustration kite time  it was thought a great thing in a kite to pull and it was a favor to another boy to let him take hold of your string and feel how your kite pulled if you wanted to play mumblethepeg or anything while your kite was up you tied it to a stake in the ground or gave it to some other fellow to hold there were always lots of fellows eager to hold it but you had to be careful how you let a little fellow hold it for if it was a very powerful kite it would take him up it was not certain just how strong a kite had to be to take a small boy up and nobody had ever seen a kite do it but everybody expected to see it     ix  circuses and shows   what every boy expected to do some time or other was to run off he expected to do this because the scheme offered an unlimited field to the imagination and because its fulfilment would give him the highest distinction among the other fellows to run off was held to be the only way for a boy to right himself against the wrongs and hardships of a boys life as far as the boys town was concerned no boy had anything to complain of the boys had the best time in the world there and in a manner they knew it but there were certain things that they felt no boy ought to stand and these things were sometimes put upon them at school but usually at home in fact nearly all the things that a fellow intended to run off for were done to him by those who ought to have been the kindest to him some boys mothers had the habit of making them stop and do something for them just when they were going away with the fellows others would not let them go in swimming as often as they wanted and if they saw them with their shirts on wrong side out would not believe that they could get turned in climbing a fence others made them split kindling and carry in wood and even saw wood none of these things in a simple form was enough to make a boy run off but they prepared his mind for it and when complicated with whipping they were just cause for it weeding the garden though was a thing that almost in itself was enough to make a fellow run off  not many of the boys really had to saw wood though a good many of the fellows fathers had saws and bucks in their woodsheds there were public sawyers who did most of the woodsawing and they came up with their bucks on their shoulders and asked for the job almost as soon as the wood was unloaded before your door the most popular one with the boys was a poor halfwit known among them as morn and he was a favorite with them because he had fits and because when he had a fit he would seem to fly all over the woodpile the boys would leave anything to see morn in a fit and he always had a large crowd round him as soon as the cry went out that he was beginning to have one they watched the hapless creature with grave unpitying yet not unfriendly interest too ignorant of the dark ills of life to know how deeply tragic was the spectacle that entertained them and how awfully present in morns contortions was the mystery of gods ways with his children some of whom he gives to happiness and some to misery when morn began to pick himself weakly up with eyes of pathetic bewilderment they helped him find his cap and tried to engage him in conversation for the pleasure of seeing him twist his mouth when he said of a famous town drunkard whom he admired hes a strong man he eats liquor it was probably poor morns ambition to eat liquor himself and the boys who followed that drunkard about to plague him had a vague respect for his lamentable appetite  none of the boys ever did run off except the son of one of the preachers he was a big boy whom my boy remotely heard of but never saw for he lived in another part of the town but his adventure was known to all the boys and his heroism rated high among them it took nothing from this in their eyes that he was found homesick and crying in cincinnati and was glad to come backthe great fact was that he had run off nothing could change or annul that if he had made any mistake it was in not running off with a circus for that was the true way of running off then if you were ever seen away from home you were seen tumbling through a hoop and alighting on the crupper of a barebacked piebald and if you ever came home you came home in a gilded chariot and you flashed upon the domestic circle in fleshcolored tights and spangled breechcloth as soon as the circusbills began to be put up you began to hear that certain boys were going to run off with that circus and the morning after it left town you heard they had gone but they always turned up at school just the same it was believed that the circusmen would take any boy who wanted to go with them and would fight off his friends if they tried to get him away  the boys made a very careful study of the circusbills and afterwards when the circus came they held the performance to a strict account for any difference between the feats and their representation for a fortnight beforehand they worked themselves up for the arrival of the circus into a fever of fear and hope for it was always a question with a great many whether they could get their fathers to give them the money to go in the full price was two bits and the halfprice was a bit or a spanish real then a commoner coin than the american dime in the west and every boy for that time only wished to be little enough to look young enough to go in for a bit editors of newspapers had a free ticket for every member of their families and my boy was sure of going to the circus from the first rumor of its coming but he was none the less deeply thrilled by the coming event and he was up early on the morning of the great day to go out and meet the circus procession beyond the corporation line  i do not really know how boys live through the wonder and the glory of such a sight once there were two chariotsone held the band in redandblue uniforms and was drawn by eighteen piebald horses and the other was drawn by a troop of shetland ponies and carried in a vast mythical seashell little boys in spangled tights and little girls in the gauze skirts and wings of fairies there was not a flaw in this splendor to the young eyes that gloated on it and that followed it in rapture through every turn and winding of its course in the boys town nor in the magnificence of the actors and actresses who came riding two by two in their circusdresses after the chariots and looking some haughty and contemptuous and others quiet and even bored as if it were nothing to be part of such a procession the boys tried to make them out by the pictures and names on the bills which was rivers the bareback rider and which was odale the champion tumbler which was the indiarubber man which the ringmaster which the clown covered with dust gasping with the fatigue of a three hours run beside the procession but fresh at heart as in the beginning they arrived with it on the commons where the tentwagons were already drawn up and the ring was made and mighty men were driving the ironheaded tentstakes and stretching the ropes of the great skeleton of the pavilion which they were just going to clothe with canvas the boys were not allowed to come anywhere near except three or four who got leave to fetch water from a neighboring well and thought themselves richly paid with halfprice tickets the other boys were proud to pass a word with them as they went by with their brimming buckets fellows who had money to go in would have been glad to carry water just for the glory of coming close to the circusmen they stood about in twos and threes and lay upon the grass in groups debating whether a tanbark ring was better than a sawdust ring there were different opinions they came as near the wagons as they dared and looked at the circushorses munching hay from the tailboards just like common horses the wagons were left standing outside of the tent but when it was up the horses were taken into the dressingroom and then the boys with many a backward look at the wide spread of canvas and the flags and streamers floating over it from the centrepole the centrepole was revered almost like a distinguished personage ran home to dinner so as to get back good and early and be among the first to go in all round before the circus doors were open the doorkeepers of the sideshows were inviting people to come in and see the giants and fat woman and boaconstrictors and there were stands for peanuts and candy and lemonade the vendors cried icecold lemonade from fifteen hundred miles under ground walk up roll up tumble up any way to get up the boys thought this brilliant drolling but they had no time to listen after the doors were open and they had no money to spend on sideshows or dainties anyway inside the tent they found it dark and cool and their hearts thumped in their throats with the wild joy of being there they recognized one another with amaze as if they had not met for years and the excitement kept growing as other fellows came in it was lots of fun too watching the countryjakes as the boys called the farmerfolk and seeing how green they looked and how some of them tried to act smart with the circusmen that came round with oranges to sell but the great thing was to see whether fellows that said they were going to hook in really got in the boys held it to be a high and creditable thing to hook into a show of any kind but hooking into a circus was something that a fellow ought to be held in special honor for doing he ran great risks and if he escaped the vigilance of the massive circusman who patrolled the outside of the tent with a cowhide and a bulldog perhaps he merited the fame he was sure to win  i do not know where boys get some of the notions of morality that govern them these notions are like the sports and plays that a boy leaves off as he gets older to the boys that are younger he outgrows them and other boys grow into them and then outgrow them as he did perhaps they come down to the boyhood of our time from the boyhood of the race and the unwritten laws of conduct may have prevailed among the earliest aryans on the plains of asia that i now find so strange in a retrospect of the boys town the standard of honor there was in a certain way very high among the boys they would have despised a thief as he deserved and i cannot remember one of them who might not have been safely trusted none of them would have taken an apple out of a marketwagon or stolen a melon from a farmer who came to town with it but they would all have thought it fun if not right to rob an orchard or hook a watermelon out of a patch this would have been a foray into the enemys country and the fruit of the adventure would have been the same as the plunder of a city or the capture of a vessel belonging to him on the high seas in the same way if one of the boys had seen a circusman drop a quarter he would have hurried to give it back to him but he would only have been proud to hook into the circusmans show and the other fellows would have been proud of his exploit too as something that did honor to them all as a person who enclosed bounds and forbade trespass the circusman constituted himself the enemy of every boy who respected himself and challenged him to practise any sort of strategy there was not a boy in the crowd that my boy went with who would have been allowed to hook into a circus by his parents yet hooking in was an ideal that was cherished among them that was talked of and that was even sometimes attempted though not often once when a fellow really hooked in and joined the crowd that had ignobly paid one of the fellows could not stand it he asked him just how and where he got in and then he went to the door and got back his money from the doorkeeper upon the plea that he did not feel well and in five or ten minutes he was back among the boys a hero of such moral grandeur as would be hard to describe not one of the fellows saw him as he really wasa little lying thievish scoundrel not even my boy saw him so though he had on some other point of personal honesty the most fantastic scruples  the boys liked to be at the circus early so as to make sure of the grand entry of the performers into the ring where they caracoled round on horseback and gave a delicious foretaste of the wonders to come the fellows were united in this but upon other matters feeling variedsome liked tumbling best some the slackrope some bareback riding some the feats of tossing knives and balls and catching them there never was more than one ring in those days and you were not tempted to break your neck and set your eyes forever askew by trying to watch all the things that went on at once in two or three rings the boys did not miss the smallest feats of any performance and they enjoyed them every one not equally but fully they had their preferences of course as i have hinted and one of the most popular acts was that where a horse has been trained to misbehave so that nobody can mount him and after the actors have tried him the ringmaster turns to the audience and asks if some gentleman among them wants to try it nobody stirs till at last a tipsy countryjake is seen making his way down from one of the topseats towards the ring he can hardly walk he is so drunk and the clown has to help him across the ringboard and even then he trips and rolls over on the sawdust and has to be pulled to his feet when they bring him up to the horse he falls against it and the little fellows think he will certainly get killed but the big boys tell the little fellows to shut up and watch out the ringmaster and the clown manage to get the countryjake on to the broad platform on the horses back and then the ringmaster cracks his whip and the two supes who have been holding the horses head let go and the horse begins cantering round the ring the little fellows are just sure the countryjake is going to fall off he reels and totters so but the big boys tell them to keep watching out and pretty soon the countryjake begins to straighten up he begins to unbutton his long gray overcoat and then he takes it off and throws it into the ring where one of the supes catches it then he sticks a short pipe into his mouth and pulls on an old wool hat and flourishes a stick that the supe throws to him and you see that he is an irishman just come across the sea and then off goes another coat and he comes out a british soldier in white duck trousers and red coat that comes off and he is an american sailor with his hands on his hips dancing a hornpipe suddenly away flash wig and beard and falseface the pantaloons are stripped off with the same movement the actor stoops for the reins lying on the horses neck and james rivers the greatest threehorse rider in the world nimbly capers on the broad pad and kisses his hand to the shouting and cheering spectators as he dashes from the ring past the braying and bellowing brassband into the dressingroom  the big boys have known all along that he was not a real countryjake but when the trained mule begins and shakes everybody off just like the horse and another countryjake gets up and offers to bet that he can ride that mule nobody can tell whether he is a real countryjake or not this is always the last thing in the performance and the boys have seen with heavy hearts many signs openly betokening the end which they knew was at hand the actors have come out of the dressingroom door some in their everyday clothes and some with just overcoats on over their circusdresses and they lounge about near the bandstand watching the performance in the ring some of the people are already getting up to go out and stand for this last act and will not mind the shouts of down in front down there which the boys eagerly join in to eke out their bliss a little longer by keeping away even the appearance of anything transitory in it the countryjake comes stumbling awkwardly into the ring but he is perfectly sober and he boldly leaps astride the mule which tries all its arts to shake him off plunging kicking rearing he sticks on and everybody cheers him and the owner of the mule begins to get mad and to make it do more things to shake the countryjake off at last with one convulsive spring it flings him from its back and dashes into the dressingroom while the countryjake picks himself up and vanishes among the crowd  a man mounted on a platform in the ring is imploring the ladies and gentlemen to keep their seats and to buy tickets for the negrominstrel entertainment which is to follow but which is not included in the price of admission the boys would like to stay but they have not the money and they go out clamoring over the performance and trying to decide which was the best feat as to which was the best actor there is never any question it is the clown who showed by the way he turned a double somersault that he can do anything and who chooses to be clown simply because he is too great a creature to enter into rivalry with the other actors  there will be another performance in the evening with real fights outside between the circusmen and the countryjakes and perhaps some of the basin rounders but the boys do not expect to come that would be too much the boys brother once stayed away in the afternoon and went at night with one of the jour printers but he was not able to report that the show was better than it was in the afternoon he did not get home till nearly ten oclock though and he saw the sides of the tent dropped before the people got out that was a great thing and what was greater yet and reflected a kind of splendor on the boy at second hand was that the jour printer and the clown turned out to be old friends after the circus the boy actually saw them standing near the centrepole talking together and the next day the jour showed the grease that had dripped on his coat from the candles otherwise the boy might have thought it was a dream that some one he knew had talked on equal terms with the clown the boys were always intending to stay up and see the circus go out of town and they would have done so but their mothers would not let them this may have been one reason why none of them ever ran off with a circus  as soon as a circus had been in town the boys began to have circuses of their own and to practise for them everywhere you could see boys upside down walking on their hands or standing on them with their legs dangling over or stayed against house walls it was easy to stand on your head one boy stood on his head so much that he had to have it shaved in the brain fever that he got from standing on it but that did not stop the other fellows another boy fell head downwards from a rail where he was skinningthecat and nearly broke his neck and made it so sore that it was stiff ever so long another boy who was playing samson almost had his leg torn off by the fellows that were pulling at it with a hook and he did have the leg of his pantaloons torn off nothing could stop the boys but time or some other play coming in and circuses lasted a good while some of the boys learned to turn handsprings anybody could turn cartwheels one fellow across the river could just run along and throw a somersault and light on his feet lots of fellows could light on their backs but if you had a springboard or shavings under a bank like those by the turningshop you could practise for somersaults pretty safely  all the time you were practising you were forming your circus company the great trouble was not that any boy minded paying five or ten pins to come in but that so many fellows wanted to belong there were hardly any left to form an audience you could get girls but even as spectators girls were a little too despicable they did not know anything they had no sense if a follow got hurt they cried then another thing was where to have the circus of course it was simply hopeless to think of a tent and a boys circus was very glad to get a barn the boy whose father owned the barn had to get it for the circus without his father knowing it and just as likely as not his mother would hear the noise and come out and break the whole thing up while you were in the very middle of it then there were all sorts of anxieties and perplexities about the dress you could do something by turning your roundabout inside out and rolling your trousers up as far as they would go but what a fellow wanted to make him a real circus actor was a long pair of white cotton stockings and i never knew a fellow that got a pair i heard of many a fellow who was said to have got a pair but when you came down to the fact they vanished like ghosts when you try to verify them i believe the fellows always expected to get them out of a bureaudrawer or the clothesline at home but failed in most other ways a boys circus was always a failure like most other things boys undertake they usually broke up under the strain of rivalry everybody wanted to be the clown or ringmaster or else the boy they got the barn of behaved badly and went into the house crying and all the fellows had to run  there were only two kinds of show known by that name in the boys town a nigger show or a performance of burntcork minstrels and an animal show or a strolling menagerie and the boys always meant a menagerie when they spoke of a show unless they said just what sort of show the only perfect joy on earth in the way of an entertainment of course was a circus but after the circus the show came unquestionably next it made a processional entry into the town almost as impressive as the circuss and the boys went out to meet it beyond the corporation line in the same way it always had two elephants at least and four or five camels and sometimes there was a giraffe these headed the procession the elephants in the very front with their keepers at their heads and then the camels led by halters dangling from their sneering lips and contemptuous noses after these began to come the showwagons with pictures on their sides very flattered portraits of the wild beasts and birds inside lions first then tigers never meaner than royal bengal ones which the boys understood to be a superior breed then leopards then pumas and panthers then bears then jackals and hyenas then bears and wolves then kangaroos muskoxen deer and such harmless cattle and then ostriches emus lyrebirds birdsofparadise and all the rest from time to time the boys ran back from the elephants and camels to get what good they could out of the scenes in which these hidden wonders were dramatized in acts of rapine or the chase but they always came forward to the elephants and camels again even with them they had to endure a degree of denial for although you could see most of the camels figures the elephants were so heavily draped that it was a kind of disappointment to look at them the boys kept as close as they could and came as near getting under the elephants feet as the keepers would allow but after all they were driven off a good deal and had to keep stealing back they gave the elephants apples and bits of cracker and cake and some tried to put tobacco into their trunks though they knew very well that it was nearly certain death to do so for any elephant that was deceived that way would recognize the boy that did it and kill him the next time he came if it was twenty years afterwards the boys used to believe that the miami bridge would break down under the elephants if they tried to cross it and they would have liked to see it do it but no one ever saw it perhaps because the elephants always waded the river some boys had seen them wading it and stopping to drink and squirt the water out of their trunks if an elephant got a boy that had given him tobacco into the river he would squirt water on him till he drowned him still some boys always tried to give the elephants tobacco just to see how they would act for the time being  a show was not so much in favor as a circus because there was so little performance in the ring you could go round and look at the animals mostly very sleepy in their cages but you were not allowed to poke them through the bars or anything and when you took your seat there was nothing much till herr driesbach entered the lions cage and began to make them jump over his whip it was some pleasure to see him put his head between the jaws of the great african king of beasts but the lion never did anything to him and so the act wanted a true dramatic climax the boys would really rather have seen a bareback rider like james rivers turn a backsomersault and light on his horses crupper any time though they respected herr driesbach too they did not care much for a woman who once went into the lions cage and made them jump round  if you had the courage you could go up the ladder into the curtained tower on the elephants back and ride round the ring with some of the other fellows but my boy at least never had the courage and he never was of those who mounted the trick pony and were shaken off as soon as they got on it seemed to be a good deal of fun but he did not dare to risk it and he had an obscure trouble of mind when the last thing four or five ponies were brought out with as many monkeys tied on their backs and set to run a race round the ring the monkeys always looked very miserable and even the one who won the race and rode round afterwards with an american flag in his hand and his cap very much cocked over his left eye did not seem to cheer up any  the boys had their own beliefs about the different animals and one of these concerned the inappeasable ferocity of the zebra i do not know why the zebra should have had this repute for he certainly never did anything to deserve it but for the matter of that he was like all the other animals bears were not much esteemed but they would have been if they could have been really seen hugging anybody to death it was always hoped that some of the fiercest animals would get away and have to be hunted down and retaken after they had killed a lot of dogs if the elephants some of them had gone crazy it would have been something for then they would have roamed up and down the turnpike smashing buggies and wagons and had to be shot with the sixpound cannon that was used to celebrate the fourth of july with  another thing that was against the show was that the animals were fed after it was out and you could not see the tigers tearing their prey when the great lumps of beef were thrown them there was somehow not so much chance of hooking into a show as a circus because the seats did not go all round and you could be seen under the cages as soon as you got in under the canvas i never heard of a boy that hooked into a show perhaps nobody ever tried  a show had the same kind of smell as a circus up to a certain point and then its smell began to be different both smelt of tanbark or sawdust and trodden grass and both smelt of lemonade and cigars but after that a show had its own smell of animals i have found in later life that this is a very offensive smell on a hot day but i do not believe a boy ever thinks so for him it is just a different smell from a circus smell there were two other reasons why a show was not as much fun as a circus and one was that it was thought instructive and fellows went who were not allowed to go to circuses but the great reason of all was that you could not have an animal show of your own as you could a circus you could not get the animals and no boy living could act a camel or a royal bengal tiger or an elephant so as to look the least like one  of course you could have negro shows and the boys often had them but they were not much fun and you were always getting the black on your shirtsleeves  illustration the circus     x  highdays and holidays   illustration the boys began to celebrate it with guns and pistols  the greatest day of all in the boys town was christmas in that part of the west the boys had never even heard of thanksgiving and their elders knew of it only as a festival of faroff new england christmas was the day that was kept in all churches and families whether they were methodists or episcopalians baptists or universalists catholics or protestants and among boys of whatever persuasion it was kept in a fashion that i suppose may have survived from the early pioneer times when the means of expressing joy were few and primitive on christmas eve before the churchbells began to ring in the day the boys began to celebrate it with guns and pistols with shootingcrackers and torpedoes and they never stopped as long as their ammunition lasted a fellow hardly ever had more than a bit to spend and after he had paid ten cents for a pack of crackers he had only two cents and a half for powder and if he wanted his pleasure to last he had to be careful of course he wanted his pleasure to last but he would rather have had no pleasure at all than be careful and most of the boys woke christmas morning emptyhanded unless they had burst their pistols the night before then they had a little powder left and could go pretty well into the forenoon if they could find some other boy who had shot off his powder but had a whole pistol left lots of fellows pistols got out of order without bursting and that saved powder but generally a fellow kept putting in bigger and bigger loads till his pistol blew to pieces there were all sorts of pistols but the commonest was one that the boys called a christmascrack it was of brass and when it burst the barrel curled up like a dandelion stem when you split it and put it in water a christmascrack in that shape was a trophy but of course the little boys did not have pistols they had to put up with shootingcrackers or maybe just torpedoes even then the big boys would get to fire them off on one pretext or another some fellows would hold a cracker in their hands till it exploded nearly everybody had burned thumbs and some of the boys had their faces blackened with powder now and then a fellow who was nearly grown up would set off a whole pack of crackers in a barrel it seemed almost incredible to the little boys  it was glorious and i do not think any of the boys felt that there was anything out of keeping in their way of celebrating the day for i do not think they knew why they were celebrating it or if they knew they never thought it was simply a holiday and was to be treated like a holiday after all perhaps there are just as strange things done by grown people in honor of the loving and lowly saviour of men but we will not enter upon that question when they had burst their pistols or fired off their crackers the boys sometimes huddled into the back part of the catholic church and watched the service awed by the dim altar lights the rising smoke of incense and the grimness of the sacristan an old german who stood near to keep order among them they knew the fellows who were helping the priest one of them was the boy who stood on his head till he had to have it shaved they would have liked to mock him then and there for wearing a petticoat and most of them had the bitterest scorn and hate for catholics in their hearts but they were afraid of the sacristan and they behaved very well as long as they were in the church but as soon as they got out they whooped and yelled and stoned the sacristan when he ran after them  my boy would have liked to do all that too just to be with the crowd but at home he had been taught to believe that catholics were as good as anybody and that you must respect everybodys religion his father and the priest were friendly acquaintances and in a dim way he knew that his father had sometimes taken the catholics part in his paper when the prejudice against foreigners ran high he liked to go to the catholic church though he was afraid of the painted figure that hung full length on the wooden crucifix with the blooddrops under the thorns on its forehead and the red wound in its side he was afraid of it as something both dead and alive he could not keep his eyes away from the awful beautiful suffering face and the body that seemed to twist in agony and the hands and feet so cruelly nailed to the cross  but he never connected the thought of that anguish with christmas his head was too full of st nicholas who came down the chimney and filled your stockings the day belonged to st nicholas the first thing when you woke you tried to catch everybody and you caught a person if you said christmas gift before he or she did and then the person you caught had to give you a present nobody ever said merry christmas as people do now and i do not know where the custom of saying christmas gift came from it seems more sordid and greedy than it really was the pleasure was to see who could say it first and the boys did not care for what they got if they beat any more than they cared for what they won in fighting eggs at easter  at newyears the great thing was to sit up and watch the old year out but the little boys could not have kept awake even if their mothers had let them in some families perhaps of dutch origin the day was kept instead of christmas but for most of the fellows it was a dull time you had spent all your money at christmas and very likely burst your pistol anyway it was some consolation to be out of school which did not keep on newyears and if it was cold you could have fires on the ice or anyway you could have fires on the riverbank or down by the shore where there was always plenty of driftwood  but newyears could not begin to compare with easter all the boys mothers colored eggs for them at easter i do not believe there was a mother in the boys town mean enough not to by easter day in that southern region the new grass was well started and grass gave a beautiful yellow color to the eggs boiled with it onions colored them a soft pale green and logwood black but the most esteemed egg of all was a calicoegg you got a piece of new calico from your mother or maybe some of your aunts and you got somebody most likely your grandmother if she was on a visit at the time to sew an egg up in it and when the egg was boiled it came out all over the pattern of the calico my boys brother once had a calicoegg that seemed to my boy a more beautiful piece of color than any titian he has seen since it was kept in a bureaudrawer till nobody could stand the smell but most easter eggs never outlasted easter day as soon as the fellows were done breakfast they ran out of the house and began to fight eggs with the other fellows they struck the little ends of the eggs together and if your egg broke another fellows egg then you had a right to it sometimes an egg was so hard that it would break every other egg in the street and generally when a little fellow lost his egg he began to cry and went into the house this did not prove him a crybaby it was allowable like crying when you stumped your toe i think this custom of fighting eggs came from the pennsylvania germans to whom the boys town probably owed its protestant observance of easter there was nothing religious in the way the boys kept it any more than there was in their way of keeping christmas  i do not think they distinguished between it and allfools day in character or dignity about the best thing you could do then was to write april fool on a piece of paper and pin it to a fellows back or maybe a girls if she was a big girl and stuckup or anything i do not suppose there is a boy now living who is silly enough to play this trick on anybody or mean enough to fill an old hat with rocks and brickbats and dare a fellow to kick it but in the boys town there were some boys who did this and then the fellow had to kick the hat or else come under the shame of having taken a dare most of the aprilfoolings were harmless enough like saying oh see that flock of wildgeese flying over and what have you got on the back of your coat and holloing april fool as soon as the person did it sometimes a crowd of boys got a bit with a hole in it and tied a string in it and laid it on the sidewalk and then hid in a cellar and when anybody stooped to pick it up they pulled it in that was the greatest fun especially if the person was stingy but the difficulty was to get the bit whether it had a hole in it or not  from the first of april till the first of may was a long stretch of days and you never heard any one talk about a may party till april fool was over then there always began to be talk of a may party and who was going to be invited it was the big girls that always intended to have it and it was understood at once who was going to be the queen at least the boys had no question for there was one girl in every school whom all the boys felt to be the most beautiful but probably there was a good deal of rivalry and heartburning among the girls themselves very likely it was this that kept a may party from hardly ever coming to anything but the talk besides the queen there were certain little girls who were to be lambs i think there were maids of honor too but i am not sure the lambs had to keep very close to the queens person and to wait upon her and there were boys who had to hold the tassels of the banners which the big boys carried these boys had to wear white pantaloons and shoes and stockings and very likely gloves and to suffer the jeers of the other fellows who were not in the procession the may party was a girls affair altogether though the boys were expected to help and so there were distinctions made that the boys never dreamed of in their rude republic where one fellow was as good as another and the lowestdown boy in town could make himself master if he was bold and strong enough the boys did not understand those distinctions and nothing of them remained in their minds after the moment but the girls understood them and probably they were taught at home to feel the difference between themselves and other girls and to believe themselves of finer clay at any rate the may party was apt to be poisoned at its source by questions of class and i think it might have been in the talk about precedence and who should be what that my boy first heard that such and such a girls father was a mechanic and that it was somehow dishonorable to be a mechanic he did not know why and he has never since known why but the girls then knew why and the women seem to know now he was asked to be one of the boys who held the bannertassels and he felt this a great compliment somehow though he was so young that he had afterwards only the vaguest remembrance of marching in the procession and going to a raw and chilly grove somewhere and having untimely lemonade and cake yet these might have been the associations of some wholly different occasion  no aristocratic reserves marred the glory of fourth of july my boy was quite a wellgrown boy before he noticed that there were ever any clouds in the sky except when it was going to rain at all other times especially in summer it seemed to him that the sky was perfectly blue from horizon to horizon and it certainly was so on the fourth of july he usually got up pretty early and began firing off torpedoes and shootingcrackers just as at christmas everybody in town had been wakened by the salutes fired from the sixpounder on the riverbank and by the noise of guns and pistols and right after breakfast you heard that the butler guards were out and you ran up to the courthouse yard with the other fellows to see if it was true it was not true just yet perhaps but it came true during the forenoon and in the meantime the courthouse yard was a scene of festive preparation there was going to be an oration and a public dinner and they were already setting the tables under the locusttrees there may have been some charge for this dinner but the boys never knew of that or had any question of the bounty that seemed free as the air of the summer day  high street was thronged with people mostly countryjakes who had come to town with their wagons and buggies for the celebration the young fellows and their girls were walking along hand in hand eating gingerbread and here and there a farmer had already begun his spree and was whooping up and down the sidewalk unmolested by authority the boys did not think it at all out of the way for him to be in that state they took it as they took the preparations for the public dinner and no sense of the shame and sorrow it meant penetrated their tough ignorance of life he interested them because after the regular town drunkards he was a novelty but otherwise he did not move them by and by they would see him taken charge of by his friends and more or less brought under control though if you had the time to follow him up you could see him wanting to fight his friends and trying to get away from them whiskey was freely made and sold and drunk in that time and that region but it must not be imagined that there was no struggle against intemperance the boys did not know it but there was a very strenuous fight in the community against the drunkenness that was so frequent and there were perhaps more people who were wholly abstinent then than there are now the forces of good and evil were more openly arrayed against each other among people whose passions were strong and still somewhat primitive and those who touched not tasted not handled not far outnumbered those who looked upon the wine when it was red the pity for the boys was that they saw the drunkards every day and the temperance men only now and then and out of the group of boys who were my boys friends many kindly fellows came to know how strong drink could rage how it could bite like the serpent and sting like an adder  but the temperance men made a show on the fourth of july as well as the drunkards and the sons of temperance walked in the procession with the masons and the oddfellows sometimes they got hold of a whole fourth and then there was nothing but a temperance picnic in the sycamore grove which the boys took part in as sundayschool scholars it was not gay there was no good reason why it should leave the boys with the feeling of having been cheated out of their holiday but it did a boys fourth of july seemed to end about four oclock anyhow after that he began to feel gloomy no matter what sort of a time he had that was the way he felt after almost any holiday  marketday was a highday in the boys town and it would be hard to say whether it was more so in summer than in winter in summer the market opened about four or five oclock in the morning and by this hour my boys father was off twice a week with his marketbasket on his arm all the people did their marketing in the same way but it was a surprise for my boy when he became old enough to go once with his father to find the other boys fathers at market too he held on by his fathers hand and ran by his side past the lines of wagons that stretched sometimes from the bridge to the courthouse in the dim morning light the markethouse where the german butchers in their white aprons were standing behind their meatblocks was lit up with candles in sconces that shone upon festoons of sausage and cuts of steak dangling from the hooks behind them but without all was in a vague obscurity broken only by the lanterns in the farmers wagons there was a marketmaster who rang a bell to open the market and if anybody bought or sold anything before the tap of that bell he would be fined people would walk along the line of wagons where the butter and eggs apples and peaches and melons were piled up inside near the tailboards and stop where they saw something they wanted and stand near so as to lay hands on it the moment the bell rang my boy remembered stopping that morning by the wagon of some nice old quaker ladies who used to come to his house and whom his father stood chatting with till the bell rang they probably had an understanding with him about the rolls of fragrant butter which he instantly lifted into his basket but if you came long after the bell rang you had to take what you could get  there was a smell of cantaloupes in the air along the line of wagons that morning and so it must have been towards the end of the summer after the nights began to lengthen and to be too cold for the farmers to sleep in their wagons as they did in summer on the market eves the market time was changed to midday then it was fun to count the wagons on both sides of the street clear to where they frayed off into woodwagons and to see the great heaps of apples and cabbages and potatoes and turnips and all the other fruits and vegetables which abounded in that fertile country there was a great variety of poultry for sale and from time to time the air would be startled with the clamor of fowls transferred from the coops where they had been softly crrcrring in soliloquy to the hand of a purchaser who walked off with them and patiently waited for their wellgrounded alarm to die away all the time the marketmaster was making his rounds and if he saw a pound roll of butter that he thought was under weight he would weigh it with his steelyards and if it was too light he would seize it my boy once saw a confiscation of this sort with such terror as he would now perhaps witness an execution     xi  musters and elections   the butler guards were the finest military company in the world i do not believe there was a fellow in the boys town who ever even tried to imagine a more splendid body of troops when they talked of them as they did a great deal it was simply to revel in the recognition of their perfection i forget just what their uniform was but there were white pantaloons in it and a tuft of whiteandred cockerel plumes that almost covered the front of the hat and swayed when the soldier walked and blew in the wind i think the coat was gray and the skirts were buttoned back with buff but i will not be sure of this and somehow i cannot say how the officers differed from the privates in dress it was impossible for them to be more magnificent they walked backwards in front of the platoons with their swords drawn and held in their whitegloved hands at hilt and point and kept holloing shoulderrrarms carryarms presentarms and then faced round and walked a few steps forward till they could think of something else to make the soldiers do  illustration the butler guards  every boy intended to belong to the butler guards when he grew up and he would have given anything to be the drummer or the marker these were both boys and they were just as much dressed up as the guards themselves only they had caps instead of hats with plumes it was strange that the other fellows somehow did not know who these boys were but they never knew or at least my boy never knew they thought more of the marker than of the drummer for the marker carried a little flag and when the officers holloed out by the left flankleft wheel he set his flag against his shoulder and stood marking time with his feet till the soldiers all got by him and then he ran up to the front rank with the flag fluttering behind him the fellows used to wonder how he got to be marker and to plan how they could get to be markers in other companies if not in the butler guards there were other companies that used to come to town on the fourth of july and muster day from smaller places round about and some of them had richer uniforms one company had blue coats with gold epaulets and gold braid going down in loops on the sides of their legs all the soldiers of course had braid straight down the outer seams of their pantaloons one muster day a captain of one of the country companies came home with my boys father to dinner he was in full uniform and he put his plumed helmet down on the entry table just like any other hat  there was a company of germans or dutchmen as the boys always called them and the boys believed that they each had hay in his right shoe and straw in his left because a dutchman was too dumb as the boys said for stupid to know his feet apart any other way and that the dutch officers had to call out to the men when they were marching up mit de hayfoot down mit de strawfootlinks links links left left left but the boys honored even these imperfect intelligences so much in their quality of soldiers that they would any of them have been proud to be marker in the dutch company and they followed the dutchmen round in their march as fondly as any other body of troops of course school let out when there was a regular muster and the boys gave the whole day to it but i do not know just when the muster day came they fired the cannon a good deal on the riverbank and they must have camped somewhere near the town though no recollection of tents remained in my boys mind he believed with the rest of the boys that the right way to fire the cannon was to get it so hot you need not touch it off but just keep your thumb on the touchhole and take it away when you wanted the cannon to go off once he saw the soldiers ram the piece full of dogfennel on top of the usual charge and then he expected the cannon to burst but it only roared away as usual  the boys had their own ideas of what that cannon could do if aptly fired into a force of british or bridish as they called them they wished there could be a war with england just to see and their national feeling was kept hot by the presence of veterans of the war of 1812 at all the celebrations one of the boys had a grandfather who had been in the revolutionary war and when he died the butler guards fired a salute over his grave it was secret sorrow and sometimes open shame to my boy that his grandfather should be an englishman and that even his father should have been a year old when he came to this country but on his mothers side he could boast a grandfather and a greatgrandfather who had taken part however briefly or obscurely in both the wars against great britain he hated just as much as any of the boys or perhaps more to be the bridish when they were playing war and he longed as truly as any of them to march against the hereditary or halfhereditary enemy  playing war was one of the regular plays and the sides were always americans and bridish and the bridish always got whipped but this was a different thing and a far less serious thing than having a company the boys began to have companies after every muster of course but sometimes they began to have them for no external reason very likely they would start having a company from just finding a roosters tailfeather and begin making plumes at once it was easy to make a plume you picked up a lot of feathers that the hens and geese had dropped and you whittled a pine stick and bound the feathers in spirals around it with white thread that was a firstrate plume but the uniform offered the same difficulties as the circus dress and you could not do anything towards it by rolling up your pantaloons it was pretty easy to make swords out of laths but guns again were hard to realize some fellows had little toy guns left over from christmas but they were considered rather babyish and any kind of stick was better the right kind of a gun for a boys company was a wooden gun such as some of the big boys had with the barrel painted different from the stock the little fellows never had any such guns and if the question of uniform could have been got over this question of arms would still have remained in these troubles the fellows mothers had to suffer almost as much as the fellows themselves the fellows teased them so much for bits of finery that they thought they could turn to account in eking out a uniform once it came to quite a lot of fellows getting their mothers to ask their fathers if they would buy them some little soldierhats that one of the hatters had laid in perhaps after a muster when he knew the boys would begin recruiting my boy was by when his mother asked his father and stood with his heart in his mouth while the question was argued it was decided against him both because his father hated the tomfoolery of the thing and because he would not have the child honor any semblance of soldiering even such a feeble image of it as a boys company could present but after all a paper chapeau with a panache of slitted paper was no bad soldierhat it went far to constitute a whole uniform and it was this that the boys devolved upon at last it was the only company they ever really got together for everybody wanted to be captain and lieutenant just as they wanted to be clown and ringmaster in a circus i cannot understand how my boy came to hold either office perhaps the fellows found that the only way to keep the company together was to take turnabout but at any rate he was marshalling his forces near his grandfathers gate one evening when his grandfather came home to tea the old methodist classleader who had been born and brought up a quaker stared at the poor little apparition in horror then he caught the paper chapeau from the boys head and saying dear me dear me trampled it under foot it was an awful moment and in his hot and bitter heart the boy who was put to shame before all his fellows did not know whether to order them to attack his grandfather in a body or to engage him in single combat with his own lathsword in the end he did neither his grandfather walked on into tea and the boy was left with a wound that was sore till he grew old enough to know how true and brave a man his grandfather was in a cause where so many warlike hearts wanted courage  it was already the time of the mexican war when that part of the west at least was crazed with a dream of the conquest which was to carry slavery wherever the flag of freedom went the volunteers were mustered in at the boys town and the boys who understood that they were real soldiers and were going to a war where they might get killed suffered a disappointment from the plain blue of their uniform and the simplicity of their caps which had not the sign of a feather in them it was a consolation to know that they were going to fight the mexicans not so much consolation as if it had been the bridish though still something the boys were proud of them and they did not realize that most of these poor fellows were just countryjakes somehow they effaced even the butler guards in their fancy though the guards paraded with them in all their splendor as escort  but this civic satisfaction was alloyed for my boy by the consciousness that both his father and his grandfather abhorred the war that the volunteers were going to his grandfather as an abolitionist and his father as a henry clay whig had both been opposed to the annexation of texas which the boy heard talked of without knowing in the least what annexation meant and they were both of the mind that the war growing out of it was wanton and wicked his father wrote against it in every number of his paper and made himself hated among its friends who were the large majority in the boys town my boy could not help feeling that his father was little better than a mexican and whilst his filial love was hurt by things that he heard to his disadvantage he was not sure that he was not rightly hated it gave him a trouble of mind that was not wholly appeased by some pieces of poetry that he used to hear his father reading and quoting at that time with huge enjoyment the pieces were called the biglow papers and his father read them out of a boston newspaper and thought them the wisest and wittiest things that ever were the boy always remembered how he recited the lines            ez fur war i call it murder              there ye hev it plain and flat            n i dont want to go no furder              then my testament fur that            god hez said so plump and fairly              its as long as it is broad            and yell hev to git up airly              ef ye want to take in god  he thought this fine too but still it seemed to him in the narrow little world where a child dwells that his father and his grandfather were about the only people there were who did not wish the mexicans whipped and he felt secretly guilty for them before the other boys  it was all the harder to bear because up to this time there had been no shadow of difference about politics between him and the boys he went with they were whig boys and nearly all the fellows in the boys town seemed to be whigs there must have been some locofoco boys of course for my boy and his friends used to advance on their side the position that            democrats            eat dead rats  the counterargument that            whigs            eat dead pigs  had no force in a porkraising country like that but it was urged and there must have been democratic boys to urge it still they must have been few in number or else my boy did not know them at any rate they had no club and the whig boys always had a club they had a henry clay club in 1844 and they had buckeye clubs whenever there was an election for governor and they had clubs at every exciting town or county or district election the business of a whig club among the boys was to raise ash flagpoles in honor of henry clays home at ashland and to learn the whig songs and go about singing them you had to have a wagon too and some of the club pulled while the others rode it could be such a wagon as you went walnutting with and you had to wear strands of buckeyes round your neck then you were a real whig boy and you had a right to throw fireballs and roll tarbarrels for the bonfires on election nights  i do not know why there should have been so many empty tarbarrels in the boys town or what they used so much tar for but there were barrels enough to celebrate all the whig victories that the boys ever heard of and more too the boys did not always wait for the victories but celebrated every election with bonfires in the faith that it would turn out right  maybe the boys nowadays do not throw fireballs or know about them they were made of cotton rags wound tight and sewed and then soaked in turpentine when a ball was lighted a boy caught it quickly up and threw it and it made a splendid streaming blaze through the air and a thrilling whir as it flew a boy had to be very nimble not to get burned and a great many boys dropped the ball for every boy that threw it i am not ready to say why these fireballs did not set the boys town on fire and burn it down but i know they never did there was no law against them and the boys were never disturbed in throwing them any more than they were in building bonfires and this shows as much as anything what a glorious town that was for boys the way they used to build their bonfires was to set one tarbarrel on top of another as high as the biggest boy could reach and then drop a match into them in a moment a dusky smoky flame would burst from the top and fly there like a crimson flag while all the boys leaped and danced round it and hurrahed for the whig candidates sometimes they would tumble the blazing barrels over and roll them up and down the street  the reason why they wore buckeyes was that the buckeye was the emblem of ohio and ohio they knew was a whig state i doubt if they knew that the local elections always went heavily against the whigs but perhaps they would not have cared what they felt was a high public spirit which had to express itself in some way one night out of pure zeal for the common good they wished to mob the negro quarter of the town because the dumb negro a deafmute of color who was a very prominent personage in their eyes was said to have hit a white boy i believe the mob never came to anything i only know that my boy ran a long way with the other fellows and when he gave out had to come home alone through the dark and was so afraid of ghosts that he would have been glad of the company of the lowestdown black boy in town  there were always fights on electionday between wellknown whig and democratic champions which the boys somehow felt were as entirely for their entertainment as the circuses my boy never had the heart to look on but he shared the excitement of the affair and rejoiced in the triumph of whig principles in these contests as cordially as the hardiest witness the fighting must have come from the drinking which began as soon as the polls were opened and went on all day and night with a devotion to principle which is now rarely seen in fact the politics of the boys town seem to have been transacted with an eye single to the diversion of the boys or if not that quite they were marked by traits of a primitive civilization among the men the traditions of a rude hospitality in the pioneer times still lingered and once there was a whig barbecue which had all the profusion of a civic feast in mediæval italy every whig family contributed loaves of bread and boiled hams the whig farmers brought in barrels of cider and wagonloads of apples there were heaps of pies and cakes sheep were roasted whole and young roast pigs with oranges in their mouths stood in the act of chasing one another over the long tables which were spread in one of the largest porkhouses where every comer was freely welcome i suppose boys though were not allowed at the dinner all that my boy saw of the barbecue were the heaps of loaves and hams left over that piled the floor in one of the rooms to the ceiling  he remained an ardent whig till his eleventh year when his father left the party because the whigs had nominated as their candidate for president general taylor who had won his distinction in the mexican war and was believed to be a friend of slavery though afterwards he turned out otherwise my boy then joined a freesoil club and sang songs in support of van buren and adams his faith in the purity of the whigs had been much shaken by their behavior in trying to make capital out of a war they condemned and he had been bitterly disappointed by their preferring taylor to tom corwin the favorite of the antislavery whigs the biglow papers and their humor might not have moved him from his lifelong allegiance but the eloquence of corwins famous speech against the mexican war had grounded him in principles which he could not afterwards forsake he had spoken passages of that speech at school he had warned our invading hosts of the vengeance that has waited upon the lust of conquest in all times and has driven the conquerors back with trailing battleflags so shall it be with yours he had declaimed you may carry them to the loftiest peaks of the cordilleras they may float in insolent triumph in the halls of montezuma but the weakest hand in mexico uplifted in prayer can call down a power against you before which the iron hearts of your warriors shall be turned into ashes it must have been a terrible wrench for him to part from the whig boys in politics and the wrench must have been a sudden one at last he was ashamed of his father for opposing the war and then all at once he was proud of him for it and was roaring out songs against taylor as the hero of that war and praising little van whom he had hitherto despised as the fox of kinderhook  the fox was the emblem totem of the democrats in the campaigns of 1840 and 1844 and in their processions they always had a fox chained to the hickory flagpoles which they carried round on their wagons together with a cock reconciled probably in a common terror the whigs always had the best processions and one of the most signal days of my boys life was the day he spent in following round a henry clay procession where the different trades and industries were represented in the wagons there were coopers hatters shoemakers blacksmiths bakers tinners and others all hard at work and from time to time they threw out to the crowd something they had made my boy caught a tin cup and if it had been of solid silver he could not have felt it a greater prize he ran home to show it and leave it in safekeeping and then hurried back so as to walk with the other boys abreast of a great platform on wheels where an old woman sat spinning inside of a logcabin and a pioneer in a huntingshirt stood at the door with his long rifle in his hand in the window sat a raccoon which was the whig emblem and which on all their banners was painted with the legend that same old coon to show that they had not changed at all since the great days when they elected the pioneer general harrison president of the united states another proof of the fact was the barrel of hardcider which lay under the cabin window     xii  pets   as there are no longer any whig boys in the world the coon can no longer be kept anywhere as a political emblem i dare say even in my boys time the boys kept coons just for the pleasure of it and without meaning to elect whig governors and presidents with them i do not know how they got themthey traded for them perhaps with fellows in the country that had caught them or perhaps their fathers bought them in market some people thought they were very good to eat and like poultry and other things for the table they may have been brought alive to market but anyhow when a boy had a coon he had to have a storebox turned open side down to keep it in behind the house and he had to have a little door in the box to pull the coon out through when he wanted to show it to other boys or to look at it himself which he did forty or fifty times a day when he first got it he had to have a small collar for the coon and a little chain because the coon would gnaw through a string in a minute the coon himself never seemed to take much interest in keeping a coon or to see much fun or sense in it he liked to stay inside his box where he had a bed of hay and whenever the boy pulled him out he did his best to bite the boy he had no tricks his temper was bad and there was nothing about him except the rings round his tail and his political principles that anybody could care for he never did anything but bite and try to get away or else run back into his box which smelt pretty soon like an animalshow he would not even let a fellow see him eat  my boys brother had a coon which he kept a good while at a time when there was no election for the mere satisfaction of keeping a coon during his captivity the coon bit his keeper repeatedly through the thumb and upon the whole seemed to prefer him to any other food i do not really know what coons eat in a wild state but this captive coon tasted the blood of nearly that whole family of children besides biting and getting away he never did the slightest thing worth remembering as there was no election he did not even take part in a whig procession he got away two or three times the first thing his owner would know when he pulled the chain out was that there was no coon at the end of it and then he would have to poke round the inside of the box pretty carefully with a stick so as not to get bitten after that he would have to see which tree the coon had gone up it was usually the tall locusttree in front of the house and in about half a second all the boys in town would be there telling the owner of the coon how to get him of course the only way was to climb for the coon which would be out at the point of a high and slender limb and would bite you awfully even if the limb did not break under you while the boys kept whooping and yelling and holloing out what to do and tip the dog just howled with excitement i do not know how that coon was ever caught but i know that the last time he got away he was not found during the day but after nightfall he was discovered by moonlight in the locusttree his owner climbed for him but the coon kept shifting about and getting higher and higher and at last he had to be left till morning in the morning he was not there nor anywhere  it had been expected perhaps that tip would watch him and grab him if he came down and tip would have done it probably if he had kept awake he was a dog of the greatest courage and he was especially fond of hunting he had been bitten oftener by that coon than anybody but the coons owner but he did not care for biting he was always getting bitten by rats but he was the greatest dog for rats that there almost ever was the boys hunted rats with him at night when they came out of the stables that backed down to the hydraulic for water and a dog who liked above all things to lie asleep on the backstep by day and would no more think of chasing a pig out of the garden than he would think of sitting up all night with a coon would get frantic about rats and would perfectly wear himself out hunting them on land and in the water and keep on after the boys themselves were tired he was so fond of hunting anyway that the sight of a gun would drive him about crazy he would lick the barrel all over and wag his tail so hard that it would lift his hindlegs off the ground  i do not know how he came into that family but i believe he was given to it full grown by somebody it was some time after my boy failed to buy what he called a confoundland dog from a colored boy who had it for sale a pretty puppy with white and black spots which he had quite set his heart on but tip more than consoled him tip was of no particular breed and he had no personal beauty he was of the color of a mouse of an elephant and his tail was without the smallest grace it was smooth and round but it was so strong that he could pull a boy all over the town by it and usually did and he had the best and kindest and truest ugly old face in the world he loved the whole human race and as a watchdog he was a failure through his trustful nature he would no more have bitten a person than he would have bitten a pig but where other dogs were concerned he was a lion he might be lying fast asleep in the backyard and he usually was but if a dog passed the front of the house under a wagon he would be up and after that dog before you knew what you were about he seemed to want to fight country dogs the worst but any strange dog would do a good half the time he would come off best but however he came off he returned to the backyard with his tongue hanging out and wagging his tail in goodhumor with all the world nothing could stop him however where strange dogs were concerned he was a whig dog of course as any one could tell by his name which was tippecanoe in full and was given him because it was the nickname of general harrison the great whig who won the battle of tippecanoe the boys henry clay club used him to pull the little wagon that they went about in singing whig songs and he would pull five or six boys guided simply by a stick which he held in his mouth and which a boy held on either side of him but if he caught sight of a dog that he did not know he would drop that stick and start for that dog as far off as he could see him spilling the henry clay club out of the wagon piecemeal as he went and never stopping till he mixed up the strange dog in a fight where it would have been hard to tell which was either champion and which was the club wagon when the fight was over tip would come smilingly back to the fragments of the henry clay club with pieces of the vehicle sticking about him and profess himself in a dogs way ready to go on with the concert  any crowd of boys could get tip to go off with them in swimming or hunting or simply running races he was known through the whole town and beloved for his many endearing qualities of heart as to his mind it was perhaps not much to brag of and he certainly had some defects of character he was incurably lazy and his laziness grew upon him as he grew older till hardly anything but the sight of a gun or a bone would move him he lost his interest in politics and though there is no reason to suppose that he ever became indifferent to his principles it is certain that he no longer showed his early ardor he joined the freesoil movement in 1848 and supported van buren and adams but without the zeal he had shown for henry clay once a year as long as the family lived in the boys town the children were anxious about tip when the doglaw was put in force and the constables went round shooting all the dogs that were found running at large without muzzles at this time when tip was in danger of going mad and biting people he showed a most unseasonable activity and could hardly be kept in bounds a dog whose sole delight at other moments was to bask in the summer sun or dream by the winter fire would now rouse himself to an interest in everything that was going on in the dangerous world and make forays into it at all unguarded points the only thing to do was to muzzle him and this was done by my boys brother with a piece of heavy twine in such a manner as to interfere with tips happiness as little as possible it was a muzzle that need not be removed for either eating drinking or fighting but it satisfied the law and tip always came safely through the dogdays perhaps by favor or affection with the officers who were so inexorable with some dogs  my boy long remembered with horror and remorse his part in giving up to justice an unconscious offender and seeing him pay for his transgression with his life the boy was playing before his door when a constable came by with his rifle on his shoulder and asked him if he had seen any unmuzzled dogs about and partly from pride at being addressed by a constable partly from a nervous fear of refusing to answer and partly from a childish curiosity to see what would happen he said yes one over there by the porkhouse the constable whistled and the poor little animal which had got lost from the farmer it had followed to town came running into sight round the corner of the porkhouse and sat up on its haunches to look about it was a small red dog the size of a fox and the boy always saw it afterwards as it sat there in the gray afternoon and fascinated him with its deadly peril the constable swung his rifle quickly to his shoulder the sharp whiplike report came and the dog dropped over and its hearts blood flowed upon the ground and lay there in a pool the boy ran into the house with that picture forever printed in his memory for him it was as if he had seen a fellowbeing slain and had helped to bring him to his death  whilst tip was still in his prime the family of children was further enriched by the possession of a goat but this did not belong to the whole family or it was at least nominally the property of that eldest brother they all looked up to i do not know how they came by the goat any more than i know how they came by tip i only know that there came a time when it was already in the family and that before it was got rid of it was a presence there was no mistaking nobody who has not kept a goat can have any notion of how many different kinds of mischief a goat can get into without seeming to try either but merely by following the impulses of its own goatishness this one was a nannygoat and it answered to the name of nanny with an intelligence that was otherwise wholly employed in making trouble it went up and down stairs from cellar to garret and in and out of all the rooms like anybody with a faint cynical indifference in the glance of its cold gray eyes that gave no hint of its purposes or performances in the chambers it chewed the sheets and pillowcases on the beds and in the diningroom if it found nothing else it would do its best to eat the tablecloth washingday was a perfect feast for it for then it would banquet on the shirtsleeves and stockings that dangled from the clothesline and simply glut itself with the family linen and cotton in default of these dainties nanny would gladly eat a chiphat she was not proud she would eat a splitbasket if there was nothing else at hand once she got up on the kitchentable and had a perfect orgy with a lot of freshbaked pumpkinpies she found there she cleaned all the pumpkin so neatly out of the pastry shells that if there had been any more pumpkin left they could have been filled up again and nobody could have told the difference the grandmother who was visiting in the house at the time declared to the mother that it would serve the father and the boys just right if she did fill these very shells up and give them to the father and the boys to eat but i believe this was not done and it was only suggested in a moment of awful exasperation and because it was the father who was to blame for letting the boys keep the goat the mother was always saying that the goat should not stay in the house another day but she had not the heart to insist on its banishment the children were so fond of it i do not know why they were fond of it for it never showed them the least affection but was always taking the most unfair advantages of them and it would butt them over whenever it got the chance it would try to butt them into the well when they leaned down to pull up the bucket from the curb and if it came out of the house and saw a boy cracking nuts at the low flat stone the children had in the backyard to crack nuts on it would pretend that the boy was making motions to insult it and before he knew what he was about it would fly at him and send him spinning head over heels it was not of the least use in the world and could not be but the children were allowed to keep it till one fatal day when the mother had a number of other ladies to tea as the fashion used to be in small towns when they sat down to a comfortable gossip over dainty dishes of stewed chicken hot biscuit peachpreserves sweet tomatopickles and poundcake that day they all laid off their bonnets on the halltable and the goat after demurely waiting and watching with its faded eyes which saw everything and seemed to see nothing discerned a golden opportunity and began to make such a supper of bonnetribbons as perhaps never fell to a goats lot in life before it was detected in its stolen joys just as it had chewed the ribbon of a best bonnet up to the bonnet and was chased into the backyard but as it had swallowed the ribbon without being able to swallow the bonnet it carried that with it the boy who specially owned the goat ran it down in a frenzy of horror and apprehension and managed to unravel the ribbon from its throat and get back the bonnet then he took the bonnet in and laid it carefully down on the table again and decided that it would be best not to say anything about the affair but such a thing as that could not be kept the goat was known at once to have done the mischief and this time it was really sent away all the children mourned it and the boy who owned it the most used to go to the house of the people who took it and who had a high board fence round their yard and try to catch sight of it through the cracks when he called nanny it answered him instantly with a plaintive baa and then after a vain interchange of lamentations he had to come away and console himself as he could with the pets that were left him  among these were a family of white rabbits which the boys kept in a little hutch at the bottom of the yard they were of no more use than the goat was but they were at least not mischievous and there was only one of them that would bite and he would not bite if you would take him up close behind the ears so that he could not get at you the rest were very goodnatured and would let you smooth them or put them inside of your shirtbosom or anything they would eat cabbage or bread or apples out of your hand and it was fun to see their noses twitch otherwise they had no accomplishments all you could do with them was to trade with other boys or else keep the dogs from them it was pretty exciting to keep the dogs from them tip was such a good dog that he never dreamed of touching the rabbits  of course these boys kept chickens the favorite chicken in those days was a small white bantam and the more feathers it had down its legs the better my boy had a bantam hen that was perfectly white and so tame that she would run up to him whenever he came into the yard and follow him round like a dog when she had chickens she taught them to be just as fond of him and the tiny little balls of yellow down tumbled fearlessly about in his hands and pecked the crumbs of bread between his fingers as they got older they ran with their mother to meet him and when he sat down on the grass they clambered over him and crept into his shirtbosom and crooned softly as they did when their mother hovered them the boy loved them better than anything he ever had he always saw them safe in the coop at night and he ran out early in the morning to see how they had got through the night and to feed them one fatal morning he found them all scattered dead upon the grass the mother and every one of her pretty chicks with no sign upon them of how they had been killed he could only guess that they had fallen a prey to rats or to some owl that had got into their coop but as they had not been torn or carried away he guessed in vain he buried them with the sympathy of all the children and all the fellows at school who heard about the affair it was a real grief it was long before he could think of his loss without tears and i am not sure there is so much difference of quality in our bereavements the loss can hurt more or it can hurt less but the pang must be always the same in kind  besides his goat my boys brother kept pigeons which again were like the goat and the rabbits in not being of very much use they had to be much more carefully looked after than chickens when they were young they were so helpless in their nests such mere weak wads of featherless flesh at first you had to open their bills and poke the food in and you had to look out how you gave them water for fear you would drown them but when they got a little larger they would drink and eat from your mouth and that was some pleasure for they did not seem to know you from an old pigeon when you took your mouth full of corn or water and fed them afterwards when they began to fly it was a good deal of fun to keep them and make more cots for them and build them nests in the cots  but they were not very intelligent pets hardly more intelligent than the fish that the boys kept in the large wooden hogshead of rainwater at the corner of the house they had caught some of these fish when they were quite small and the fish grew very fast for there was plenty of food for them in the mosquitotadpoles that abounded in the hogshead then the boys fed them every day with breadcrumbs and worms there was one big sunfish that was not afraid of anything if you held a worm just over him he would jump out of the water and snatch it besides the fish there was a turtle in the hogshead and he had a broad chip that he liked to sun himself on it was fun to watch him resting on this chip with his nose barely poked out of his shell and his eyes with the skin dropped over them just showing he had some tricks he would snap at a stick if you teased him with it and would let you lift him up by it that was a good deal of pleasure  but all these were trifling joys except maybe tip and nanny compared with the pony which the boys owned in common and which was the greatest thing that ever came into their lives i cannot tell just how their father came to buy it for them or where he got it but i dare say he thought they were about old enough for a pony and might as well have one it was a mexican pony and as it appeared on the scene just after the mexican war some volunteer may have brought it home one volunteer brought home a mexican dog that was smooth and hairless with a skin like an elephant and that was always shivering round with the cold he was not otherwise a remarkable dog and i do not know that he ever felt even the warmth of friendship among the boys his manners were reserved and his temper seemed doubtful but the pony never had any trouble with the climate of southern ohio which is indeed hot enough to fry a salamander in summer and though his temper was no better than other ponies he was perfectly approachable i mean that he was approachable from the side for it was not well to get where he could bite you or kick you he was of a bright sorrel color and he had a brand on one haunch my boy had an ideal of a pony conceived from pictures in his readingbooks at school that held its head high and arched its neck and he strove by means of checks and martingales to make this real pony conform to the illustrations but it was of no use the real pony held his neck straight out like a ewe or if reined up like a camel and he hung his big head at the end of it with no regard whatever for the ideal his caparison was another mortification and failure what the boy wanted was an english saddle embroidered on the morocco seat in crimson silk and furnished with shining steel stirrups what he had was the framework of a mexican saddle covered with rawhide and cushioned with a blanket the stirrups were mexican too and clumsily fashioned out of wood the boys were always talking about getting their father to get them a pad but they never did it and they managed as they could with the saddle they had for the most part they preferred to ride the pony barebacked for then they could ride him double and when they first got him they all wanted to ride him so much that they had to ride him double they kept him going the whole day long but after a while they calmed down enough to take him one at a time and to let him have a chance for his meals  they had no regular stable and the father left the boys to fit part of the cowshed up for the pony which they did by throwing part of the hencoop open into it the pigeoncots were just over his head and he never could have complained of being lonesome at first everybody wanted to feed him as well as ride him and if he had been allowed time for it he might have eaten himself to death or if he had not always tried to bite you or kick you when you came in with his corn after a while the boys got so they forgot him and nobody wanted to go out and feed the pony especially after dark but he knew how to take care of himself and when he had eaten up everything there was in the cowshed he would break out and eat up everything there was in the yard  the boys got lots of good out of him when you were once on his back you were pretty safe for he was so lazy that he would not think of running away and there was no danger unless he bounced you off when he trotted he had a hard trot the boys wanted to ride him standing up like circusactors and the pony did not mind but the boys could not stay on though they practised a good deal turn about when the other fellows were riding their horses standing up on the commons he was not of much more use in indian fights for he could seldom be lashed into a gallop and a pony that proposed to walk through an indian fight was ridiculous still with the help of imagination my boy employed him in some scenes of wild arab life and hurled the moorish javelin from him in midcareer when the pony was flying along at the mad pace of a canalboat the pony early gave the boys to understand that they could get very little out of him in the way of herding the family cow he would let them ride him to the pasture and he would keep up with the cow on the way home when she walked but if they wanted anything more than that they must get some other pony they tried to use him in carrying papers but the subscribers objected to having him ridden up to their front doors over the sidewalk and they had to give it up  when he became an old story and there was no competition for him among the brothers my boy sometimes took him into the woods and rode him in the wandering bridlepaths with a thrilling sense of adventure he did not like to be alone there and he oftener had the company of a boy who was learning the trade in his fathers printingoffice this boy was just between him and his elder brother in age and he was the good comrade of both all the family loved him and made him one of them and my boy was fond of him because they had some tastes in common that were not very common among the other boys they liked the same books and they both began to write historical romances my boys romance was founded on facts of the conquest of granada which he had read of again and again in washington irving with a passionate pity for the moors and yet with pride in the grave and noble spaniards he would have given almost anything to be a spaniard and he lived in a dream of some day sallying out upon the vega before granada in silk and steel with an arabian charger under him that champed its bit in the meantime he did what he could with the family pony and he had long rides in the woods with the other boy who used to get his fathers horse when he was not using it on sunday and race with him through the dangling wild grapevines and pawpaw thickets and over the reedy levels of the river their hearts both bounding with the same high hopes of a world that could never come true     xiii  guns and gunning   all round the boys town stood the forest with the trees that must have been well grown when mad anthony wayne drove the indians from their shadow forever the white people had hewn space for their streets and houses for their fields and farmsteads out of the woods but where the woods had been left they were of immemorial age they were not very dense and the timber was not very heavy the trees stood more like trees in a park than trees in a forest there was little or no undergrowth except here and there a pawpaw thicket and there were sometimes grassy spaces between them where the mayapples pitched their pretty tents in the spring perhaps at no very great distance of time it had been a prairie country with those wide savannahs of waving grass that took the eyes of the firstcomers in the ohio wilderness with an image of nature long tamed to the hand of man but this is merely my conjecture and what i know does not bear me out in it for the wall of forest that enclosed the boys town was without a break except where the axe had made it at some points it was nearer and at some farther but nearer or farther the forest encompassed the town and it called the boys born within its circuit as the sea calls the boys born by its shore with mysterious alluring voices kindling the blood taking the soul with love for its strangeness there was not a boy in the boys town who would not gladly have turned from the town and lived in the woods if his mother had let him and in every vague plan of running off the forest had its place as a city of refuge from pursuit and recapture the pioneer days were still so close to those times that the love of solitary adventure which took the boys fathers into the sylvan wastes of the great west might well have burned in the boys hearts and if their ideal of life was the free life of the woods no doubt it was because their near ancestors had lived it at any rate that was their ideal and they were always talking among themselves of how they would go farther west when they grew up and be trappers and hunters i do not remember any boy but one who meant to be a sailor they lived too hopelessly far from the sea and i dare say the boy who invented the marineengine governor and who wished to be a pirate would just as soon have been a bandit of the osage in those days oregon had just been opened to settlers and the boys all wanted to go and live in oregon where you could stand in your door and shoot deer and wild turkey while a salmon big enough to pull you in was tugging away at the line you had set in the river that ran before the logcabin  illustration all at once there the indians were  if they could the boys would rather have been indians than anything else but as there was really no hope of this whatever they were willing to be settlers and fight the indians they had rather a mixed mind about them in the meantime but perhaps they were not unlike other idolaters in both fearing and adoring their idols perhaps they came pretty near being indians in that and certainly they came nearer than they knew when they played war and the war was between the whites and the indians it was almost as low a thing to be white as it was to be british when there were americans on the other side in either case you had to be beaten the boys lived in the desire if not the hope of some time seeing an indian and they made the most of the indians in the circus whom they knew to be just white men dressed up but none of them dreamed that what really happened one day could ever happen this was at the arrival of several canalboat loads of genuine indians from the wyandot reservation in the northwestern part of the state on their way to new lands beyond the mississippi the boys fathers must have known that these indians were coming but it just shows how stupid the most of fathers are that they never told the boys about it all at once there the indians were as if the canalboats had dropped with them out of heaven there they were crowding the decks in their blankets and moccasins braves and squaws and pappooses standing about or squatting in groups not saying anything and looking exactly like the pictures the squaws had the pappooses on their backs and the men and boys had bows and arrows in their hands and as soon as the boats landed the indians all except the squaws and pappooses came ashore and went up to the courthouse yard and began to shoot with their bows and arrows it almost made the boys crazy  of course they would have liked to have the indians shoot at birds or some game but they were mighty glad to have them shoot at cents and bits and quarters that anybody could stick up in the ground the indians would all shoot at the mark till some one hit it and the one who hit it had the money whatever it was the boys ran and brought back the arrows and they were so proud to do this that i wonder they lived through it my boy was too bashful to bring the indians their arrows he could only stand apart and long to approach the filthy savages whom he revered to have touched the border of one of their blankets would have been too much some of them were rather handsome and two or three of the indian boys were so pretty that the boys town boys said they were girls they were of all ages from old withered men to children of six or seven but they were all alike grave and unsmiling the old men were not a whit more dignified than the children and the children did not enter into their sport with more zeal and ardor than the wrinkled sages who shared it in fact they were old and young alike savages and the boys who looked on and envied them were savages in their ideal of a world where people spent their lives in hunting and fishing and ranging the woods and never grew up into the toils and cares that can alone make men of boys they wished to escape these as many foolish persons do among civilized nations and they thought if they could only escape them they would be happy they did not know that they would be merely savage and that the great difference between a savage and a civilized man is work they would all have been willing to follow these indians away into the far west where they were going and be barbarians for the rest of their days and the wonder is that some of the fellows did not try it after the red men had flitted away like red leaves their memory remained with the boys and a plague of bows and arrows raged among them and it was a good while before they calmed down to their old desire of having a gun  but they came back to that at last for that was the normal desire of every boy in the boys town who was not a girlboy and there were mighty few girlboys there up to a certain point a pistol would do especially if you had bulletmoulds and could run bullets to shoot out of it only your mother would be sure to see you running them and just as likely as not would be so scared that she would say you must not shoot bullets then you would have to use buckshot if you could get them anywhere near the right size or small marbles but a pistol was always a makeshift and you never could hit anything with it not even a board fence it always kicked or burst or something very few boys ever came to have a gun though they all expected to have one but seven or eight boys would go hunting with one shotgun and take turnabout shooting some of the little fellows never got to shoot at all but they could run and see whether the big boys had hit anything when they fired and that was something this was my boys privilege for a long time before he had a gun of his own and he went patiently with his elder brother and never expected to fire the gun except perhaps to shoot the load off before they got back to town they were not allowed to bring the gun home loaded it was a gun that was pretty safe for anything in front of it but you never could tell what it was going to do it began by being simply an old gunbarrel which my boys brother bought of another boy who was sick of it for a fip as the halfreal piece was called and it went on till it got a lock from one gunsmith and a stock from another and was a complete gun but this took time perhaps a month for the gunsmiths would only work at it in their leisure they were delinquent subscribers and they did it in part pay for their papers when they got through with it my boys brother made himself a ramrod out of a straight piece of hickory or at least as straight as the gunbarrel which was rather swaybacked and had a little twist to one side so that one of the jour printers said it was a firstrate gun to shoot round a corner with then he made himself a powderflask out of an oxhorn that he got and boiled till it was soft it smelt the whole house up and then scraped thin with a piece of glass it hung at his side and he carried his shot in his pantaloons pocket he went hunting with this gun for a good many years but he had never shot anything with it when his uncle gave him a smoothbore rifle and he in turn gave his gun to my boy who must then have been nearly ten years old it seemed to him that he was quite old enough to have a gun but he was mortified the very next morning after he got it by a citizen who thought differently he had risen at daybreak to go out and shoot kildees on the common and he was hurrying along with his gun on his shoulder when the citizen stopped him and asked him what he was going to do with that gun he said to shoot kildees and he added that it was his gun this seemed to surprise the citizen even more than the boy could have wished he asked him if he did not think he was a pretty small boy to have a gun and he took the gun from him and examined it thoughtfully and then handed it back to the boy who felt himself getting smaller all the time the man went his way without saying anything more but his behavior was somehow so sarcastic that the boy had no pleasure in his sport that morning partly perhaps because he found no kildees to shoot at on the common he only fired off his gun once or twice at a fence and then he sneaked home with it through alleys and byways and whenever he met a person he hurried by for fear the person would find him too small to have a gun  afterwards he came to have a bolder spirit about it and he went hunting with it a good deal it was a very curious kind of gun you had to snap a good many caps on it sometimes before the load would go off and sometimes it would hang fire and then seem to recollect itself and go off maybe just when you were going to take it down from your shoulder the barrel was so crooked that it could not shoot straight but this was not the only reason why the boy never hit anything with it he could not shut his left eye and keep his right eye open so he had to take aim with both eyes or else with the left eye which was worse yet till one day when he was playing shinny or hockey at school and got a blow over his left eye from a shinnystick at first he thought his eye was put out he could not see for the blood that poured into it from the cut above it he ran homeward wild with fear but on the way he stopped at a pump to wash away the blood and then he found his eye was safe it suddenly came into his mind to try if he could not shut that eye now and keep the right one open he found that he could do it perfectly by help of his handkerchief he stanched his wound and made himself presentable with the glassy pool before the pump for a mirror and went joyfully back to school he kept trying his left eye to make sure it had not lost its newfound art and as soon as school was out he hurried home to share the joyful news with his family he went hunting the very next saturday and at the first shot he killed a bird it was a suicidal sapsucker which had suffered him to steal upon it so close that it could not escape even the vagaries of that wandering gunbarrel and was blown into such small pieces that the boy could bring only a few feathers of it away in the evening when his father came home he showed him these trophies of the chase and boasted of his exploit with the minutest detail his father asked him whether he had expected to eat this sapsucker if he could have got enough of it together he said no sapsuckers were not good to eat then you took its poor little life merely for the pleasure of killing it said the father was it a great pleasure to see it die the boy hung his head in shame and silence it seemed to him that he would never go hunting again of course he did go hunting often afterwards but his brother and he kept faithfully to the rule of never killing anything that they did not want to eat to be sure they gave themselves a wide range they were willing to eat almost anything that they could shoot even blackbirds which were so abundant and so easy to shoot but there were some things which they would have thought it not only wanton but wicked to kill like turtledoves which they somehow believed were sacred because they were the symbols of the holy ghost it was quite their own notion to hold them sacred they would not kill robins either because robins were hallowed by poetry and they kept about the house and were almost tame so that it seemed a shame to shoot them they were very plentiful and so were the turtledoves which used to light on the basinbank and pick up the grain scattered there from the boats and wagons one of the apprentices in the printingoffice kept a shotgun loaded beside the press while he was rolling and whenever he caught the soft twitter that the doves make with their wings he rushed out with his gun and knocked over two or three of them he was a good shot and could nearly always get them in range when he brought them back it seemed to my boy that he had committed the unpardonable sin and that something awful would surely happen to him but he just kept on rolling the forms of type and exchanging insults with the pressman and at the first faint twitter of doves wings he would be off again  my boy and his brother made a fine distinction between turtledoves and wild pigeons they would have killed wild pigeons if they had got a chance though you could not tell them from turtledoves except by their size and the sound they made with their wings but there were not many pigeons in the woods around the boys town and they were very shy there were snipe along the river and flocks of kildees on the commons but the bird that was mostly killed by these boys was the yellowhammer they distinguished again in its case and decided that it was not a woodpecker and might be killed sometimes they thought that woodpeckers were so nearly yellowhammers that they might be killed but they had never heard of any ones eating a woodpecker and so they could not quite bring themselves to it there were said to be squirrels in the hickory woods near the poorhouse but that was a great way off for my boy besides the squirrels there was a cross bull in those woods and sometimes solomon whistler passed through them on his way to or from the poorhouse so my boy never hunted squirrels sometimes he went with his brother for rabbits which you could track through the cornfields in a light snow and sometimes if they did not turn out to be cats you could get a shot at them now and then there were quail in the wheatstubble and there were meadowlarks in the pastures but they were very wild  after all yellowhammers were the chief reliance in the chase they were preoccupied unsuspecting birds and lit on fence rails and dead trees so that they were pretty easy to shoot if you could bring home a yellowhammer you felt that you had something to show for your long days tramp through the woods and fields and for the five cents worth of powder and five cents worth of shot that you had fired off at other game sometimes you just fired it off at mulleinstalks or barns or anything you came to there were a good many things you could do with a gun you could fire your ramrod out of it and see it sail through the air you could fill the muzzle up with water on top of a charge and send the water in a straight column at a fence the boys all believed that you could fire that column of water right through a man and they always wanted to try whether it would go through a cow but they were afraid the owner of the cow would find it out there was a good deal of pleasure in cleaning your gun when it got so foul that your ramrod stuck in it and you could hardly get it out you poured hot water into the muzzle and blew it through the nipple till it began to show clear then you wiped it dry with soft rags wound on your gunscrew and then oiled it with greasy tow sometimes the tow would get loose from the screw and stay in the barrel and then you would have to pick enough powder in at the nipple to blow it out of course i am talking of the old muzzleloading shotgun which i dare say the boys never use nowadays  but the great pleasure of all in hunting was getting home tired and footsore in the evening and smelling the supper almost as soon as you came in sight of the house there was nearly always hot biscuit for supper with steak and with coffee such as nobody but a boys mother ever knew how to make and just as likely as not there was some kind of preserves at any rate there was applebutter you could hardly take the time to wash the powdergrime off your hands and face before you rushed to the table and if you had brought home a yellowhammer you left it with your gun on the back porch and perhaps the cat got it and saved you the trouble of cleaning it a cat can clean a bird a good deal quicker than a boy can and she does not hate to do it half as badly  next to the pleasure of getting home from hunting late was the pleasure of starting early as my boy and his brother sometimes did to shoot ducks on the little reservoir in the fall his brother had an alarmclock which he set at about four and he was up the instant it rang and pulling my boy out of bed where he would rather have stayed than shot the largest mallard duck in the world they raked the ashes off the bed of coals in the fireplace and while the embers ticked and bristled and flung out little showers of sparks they hustled on their clothes and ran down the back stairs into the yard with their guns tip the dog was already waiting for them there for he seemed to know they were going that morning and he began whimpering for joy and twisting himself sideways up against them and nearly wagging his tail off and licking their hands and faces and kissing their guns all over he was about crazy when they started he knew where they were going and he rushed ahead through the silent little sleeping town and led the way across the wide commons where the cows lay in dim bulks on the grass and the geese waddled out of his way with wild clamorous cries till they came in sight of the reservoir then tip fell back with my boy and let the elder brother go ahead for he always had a right to the first shot and while he dodged down behind the bank and crept along to the place where the ducks usually were my boy kept a hold on tips collar and took in the beautiful mystery of the early morning the place so familiar by day was estranged to his eyes in that pale light and he was glad of old tips company for it seemed a time when there might very well be ghosts about the water stretched a sheet of smooth gray silver with little tufts of mist on its surface and through these at last he could see the ducks softly gliding to and fro and he could catch some dreamy sound from them his heart stood still and then jumped wildly in his breast as the still air was startled with the rush of wings and the water broke with the plunge of other flocks arriving then he began to make those bets with himself that a boy hopes he will lose he bet that his brother would not hit any of them he bet that he did not even see them he bet that if he did see them and got a shot at them they would not come back so that he could get a chance himself to kill any it seemed to him that he had to wait an hour and just when he was going to hollo and tell his brother where the ducks were the old smoothbore sent out a red flash and a white puff before he heard the report tip tore loose from his grasp and he heard the splashing rise of the ducks and the hurtling rush of their wings and he ran forward yelling how many did you hit where are they where are you are they coming back its my turn now and making an outcry that would have frightened away a fleet of ironclads but much less a flock of ducks  one shot always ended the mornings sport and there were always good reasons why this shot never killed anything     xiv  foraging   the foraging began with the first relenting days of winter which usually came in february then the boys began to go to the woods to get sugarwater as they called the maple sap and they gave whole saturdays to it as long as the sap would run it took at least five or six boys to go for sugarwater and they always had to get a boy whose father had an auger to come along so as to have something to bore the trees with on their way to the woods they had to stop at an elder thicket to get elderwood to make spiles of and at a straw pile to cut straws to suck the sap through if the spiles would not work they always brought lots of tin buckets to take the sap home in and the big boys made the little fellows carry these for they had to keep their own hands free to whittle the elder sticks into the form of spouts and to push the pith out and make them hollow they talked loudly and all at once and they ran a good deal of the way from the excitement if it was a good sugarday there were patches of snow still in the fence corners and shady places which they searched for rabbittracks but the air was so warm that they wanted to take their shoes off and begin going barefoot at once overhead the sky was a sort of pale milky blue with the sun burning softly through it and casting faint shadows when they got into the woods it was cooler and there were more patches of snow with birdtracks and squirreltracks in them they could hear the bluejays snarling at one another and the yellowhammer chuckling on some dead tree a redheaded woodpecker hammered noisily and if the boys had only had a gun with them they could have killed lots of things now and then they passed near some woodchoppers whose axes made a pleasant sound without frightening any of the wild things they had got so used to them sometimes the boys heard the long hollow crash of a tree they were felling but all the time they kept looking out for a good sugartree and when they saw a maple stained black from the branches down with the sap running from the little holes that the sapsuckers had made they burst into a shout and dashed forward and the fellow with the auger began to bore away while the other fellows stood round and told him how and wanted to make him let them do it up and down the tree there was a soft murmur from the bees that had found it out before the boys and every now and then they wove through the air the straight lines of their coming and going and made the fellows wish they could find a beetree but for the present these were intent upon the sugartree and kept hurrying up the boy with the auger when he had bored in deep enough they tried to fit a spile to the hole but it was nearly always crooked and too big or else it pointed downward and the water would not run up through the spile then some of them got out their straws and began to suck the sap up from the hole through them and to quarrel and push till they agreed to take turnabout and others got the auger and bunted for another blackened tree they never could get their spiles to work and the water gathered so slowly in the holes they bored and some of the fellows took such long turns that it was very little fun they tried to get some good out of the small holes the sapsuckers had made but there were only a few drops in them mixed with bark and moss if it had not been for the woodchoppers foraging for sugarwater would always have been a failure but one of them was pretty sure to come up with his axe in his hand and show the boys how to get the water he would choose one of the roots near the foot of the tree and chop a clean square hole in it the sap flew at each stroke of his axe and it rose so fast in the well he made that the thirstiest boy could not keep it down and three or four boys with their heads jammed tight together and their straws plunged into its depths lay stretched upon their stomachs and drank their fill at once when every one was satisfied or as nearly satisfied as a boy can ever be they began to think how they could carry some of the sugarwater home but by this time it would be pretty late in the afternoon and they would have to put it off till some other day when they intended to bring something to dip the water out with the buckets they had brought were all too big then if they could get enough they meant to boil it down and make sugarwax i never knew of any boys who did so  the next thing after going for sugarwater was gathering mayapples as they called the fruit of the mandrake in that country they grew to their full size nearly as large as a pullets egg some time in june and they were gathered green and carried home to be ripened in the cornmealbarrel the boys usually forgot about them before they were ripe when now and then one was remembered it was a thin watery sour thing at the best but the boys gathered them every spring in the pleasant open woods where they grew just beyond the densest shade of the trees among the tall straggling grasses and they had that joyous sense of the bounty of nature in hoarding them up which is one of the sweetest and dearest experiences of childhood through this the boy comes close to the heart of the mother of us all and rejoices in the wealth she never grudges to those who are willing to be merely rich enough  there were not many wild berries in the country near the boys town or what seemed near but sometimes my boys father took him a great way off to a region long lost from the map where there were blackberries the swimming lasted so late into september however that the boys began to go for nuts almost as soon as they left off going into the water they began with the little acorns that they called chinquepins and that were such a pretty black streaked upward from the cup with yellow that they gathered them half for the unconscious pleasure of their beauty they were rather bitter and they puckered your mouth but still you ate them they were easy to knock off the low oaks where they grew and they were so plentiful that you could get a peck of them in no time there was no need of anybodys climbing a tree to shake them but one day the boys got to telling what they would do if a bear came and one of them climbed a chinquepintree to show how he would get out on such a small limb that the bear would be afraid to follow him and he went so far out on the limb that it broke under him perhaps he was heavier than he would have been if he had not been carrying the load of guilt which must burden a boy who is playing hookey at any rate he fell to the ground and lay there helpless while the other boys gathered round him and shared all the alarm he felt for his life his despair of now hiding the fact that he had been playing hookey was his own affair but they reasoned with him that the offence would be overlooked in the anxiety which his disaster must arouse he was prepared to make the most of this and his groans grew louder as he drew near home in the arms of the boys who took turns two and two in carrying him the whole long way from dayton lane with a terrified procession of alternates behind them these all ran as soon as they came in sight of his house and left the last pair to deliver him to his mother they never knew whether she forgave him fully or merely waited till he got well you never could tell how a boys mother was going to act in any given case mothers were so very apt to act differently  red haws came a little before chinquepins the trees grew mostly by the first lock and the boys gathered the haws when they came out from swimming in the canal they did not take bags to gather haws as they did chinquepins the fruit was not thought worthy of that honor but they filled their pockets with them and ate them on the way home they were rather nice with a pleasant taste between a small apple and a rose seedpod only you had to throw most of them away because they were wormy once when the fellows were gathering haws out there they began to have fun with a flock of turkeys especially the gobblers and one boy got an old gobbler to following him while he walked slowly backward and teased him the other boys would not have told him for anything when they saw him backing against a low stump when he reached it his head went down and his heels flew into the air and then the gobbler hopped upon him and began to have some of the fun himself the boys always thought that if they had not rushed up all together and scared the gobbler off he would have torn the boy to pieces but very likely he would not he probably intended just to have fun with him  the woods were pretty full of the kind of hickorytrees called pignuts and the boys gathered the nuts and even ate their small bitter kernels and around the poorhouse woods there were some shagbarks but the boys did not go for them because of the bull and the crazy people their great and constant reliance in foraging was the abundance of black walnuts which grew everywhere along the roads and on the riverbanks as well as in the woods and the pastures long before it was time to go walnutting the boys began knocking off the nuts and trying whether they were ripe enough and just as soon as the kernels began to fill out the fellows began making walnut wagons i do not know why it was thought necessary to have a wagon to gather walnuts but i know that it was and that a boy had to make a new wagon every year no boys walnut wagon could last till the next year it did very well if it lasted till the next day he had to make it nearly all with his pocketknife he could use a saw to block the wheels out of a pine board and he could use a hatchet to rough off the corners of the blocks but he had to use his knife to give them any sort of roundness and they were not very round then they were apt to be oval in shape and they always wabbled he whittled the axles out with his knife and he made the hubs with it he could get a tongue readymade if he used a broomhandle or a hooppole but that had in either case to be whittled so it could be fastened to the wagon he even bored the linchpin holes with his knife if he could not get a gimlet and if he could not get an auger he bored the holes through the wheels with a redhot poker and then whittled them large enough with his knife he had to use pine for nearly everything because any other wood was too hard to whittle and then the pine was always splitting it split in the axles when he was making the linchpin holes and the wheels had to be kept on by linchpins that were tied in the wheels themselves split and had to be strengthened by slats nailed across the rifts the wagonbed was a candlebox nailed to the axles and that kept the frontaxle tight so that it took the whole width of a street to turn a very little wagon in without upsetting  illustration foraging  when the wagon was all done the boy who owned it started off with his brothers or some other boys who had no wagon to gather walnuts he started early in the morning of some bright autumn day while the frost still bearded the grass in the backyard and bristled on the fencetops and the roof of the woodshed and hurried off to the woods so as to get there before the other boys had got the walnuts the best place for them was in some woodspasture where the trees stood free of one another and around them in among the tall frosty grass the tumbled nuts lay scattered in groups of twos and threes or fives some still yellowishgreen in their hulls and some black but all sending up to the nostrils of the delighted boy the incense of their clean keen wildwoody smell to be a memory forever the leaves had dropped from the trees overhead and the branches outlined themselves against the blue sky and dangled from their outer stems clusters of the unfallen fruit as large as oranges and only wanting a touch to send them plumping down into the grass where sometimes their fat hulls burst and the nuts almost leaped into the boys hands the boys ran some of them to gather the fallen nuts and others to get clubs and rocks to beat them from the trees one was sure to throw off his jacket and kick off his shoes and climb the tree to shake every limb where a walnut was still clinging when they had got them all heaped up like a pile of grapeshot at the foot of the tree they began to hull them with blows of a stick or with stones and to pick the nuts from the hulls where the grubs were battening on their assured ripeness and to toss them into a little heap a very little heap indeed compared with the bulk of that they came from the boys gloried in getting as much walnut stain on their hands as they could for it would not wash off and it showed for days that they had been walnutting sometimes they got to staining one anothers faces with the juice and pretending they were indians  the sun rose higher and higher and burned the frost from the grass and while the boys worked and yelled and chattered they got hotter and hotter and began to take off their shoes and stockings till every one of them was barefoot then about three or four oclock they would start homeward with half a bushel of walnuts in their wagon and their shoes and stockings piled in on top of them that is if they had good luck in a story they would always have had good luck and always gone home with half a bushel of walnuts but this is a history and so i have to own that they usually went home with about two quarts of walnuts rattling round under their shoes and stockings in the bottom of the wagon they usually had no such easy time getting them as they always would in a story they did not find them under the trees or ready to drop off but they had to knock them off with about six or seven clubs or rocks to every walnut and they had to pound the hulls so hard to get the nuts out that sometimes they cracked the nuts that was because they usually went walnutting before the walnuts were ripe but they made just as much preparation for drying the nuts on the woodshed roof whether they got half a gallon or half a bushel for they did not intend to stop gathering them till they had two or three barrels they nailed a cleat across the roof to keep them from rolling off and they spread them out thin so that they could look more than they were and dry better they said they were going to keep them for christmas but they had to try pretty nearly every hour or so whether they were getting dry and in about three days they were all eaten up  i dare say boys are very different nowadays and do everything they say they are going to do and carry out all their undertakings but in that day they never carried out any of their undertakings perhaps they undertook too much but the failure was a part of the pleasure of undertaking a great deal and if they had not failed they would have left nothing for the men to do and a more disgusting thing than a world full of idle men who had done everything there was to do while they were boys i cannot imagine the fact is boys have to leave a little for men to do or else the race would go to ruin and this almost makes me half believe that perhaps even the boys of the present time may be prevented from doing quite as much as they think they are going to do until they grow up even then they may not want to do it all but only a small part of it i have noticed that men do not undertake half so many things as boys do and instead of wanting to be circusactors and indians and soldiers and boatdrivers and politicians and robbers and to run off and go in swimming all the time and out hunting and walnutting they keep to a very few things and are glad then if they can do them it is very curious but it is true and i advise any boy who doubts it to watch his father awhile     xv  my boy   every boy is two or three boys or twenty or thirty different kinds of boys in one he is all the time living many lives and forming many characters but it is a good thing if he can keep one life and one character when he gets to be a man he may turn out to be like an onion when he is grown up and be nothing but hulls that you keep peeling off one after another till you think you have got down to the heart at last and then you have got down to nothing  all the boys may have been like my boy in the boys town in having each an inward being that was not the least like their outward being but that somehow seemed to be their real self whether it truly was so or not but i am certain that this was the case with him and that while he was joyfully sharing the wild sports and conforming to the savage usages of the boys world about him he was dwelling in a wholly different world within him whose wonders no one else knew i could not tell now these wonders any more than he could have told them then but it was a world of dreams of hopes of purposes which he would have been more ashamed to avow for himself than i should be to avow for him it was all vague and vast and it came out of the books that he read and that filled his soul with their witchery and often held him aloof with their charm in the midst of the plays from which they could not lure him wholly away or at all away he did not know how or when their enchantment began and he could hardly recall the names of some of them afterwards first of them was goldsmiths history of greece which made him an athenian of pericless time and goldsmiths history of rome which naturalized him in a roman citizenship chiefly employed in slaying tyrants from the time of appius claudius down to the time of domitian there was hardly a tyrant that he did not slay after he had read these books not once or twice but twenty times over his father thought fit to put into his hands the travels of captain ashe in north america to encourage or perhaps to test his taste for useful reading but this was a failure the captains travels were printed with long esses and the boy could make nothing of them for other reasons the fancy nourished upon            the glory that was greece            and the grandeur that was rome  starved amidst the robust plenty of the englishmans criticisms of our early manners and customs neither could money hire the boy to read maltebruns geography in three large folios of a thousand pages each for which there was a standing offer of fifty cents from the father who had never been able to read it himself but shortly after he failed so miserably with captain ashe the boy came into possession of a priceless treasure it was that little treatise on greek and roman mythology which i have mentioned and which he must literally have worn out with reading since no fragment of it seems to have survived his boyhood heaven knows who wrote it or published it his father bought it with a number of other books at an auction and the boy who had about that time discovered the chapter on prosody in the back part of his grammar made poems from it for years and appeared in many transfigurations as this and that god and demigod and hero upon imagined occasions in the boys town to the fancied admiration of all the other fellows i do not know just why he wished to appear to his grandmother in a vision now as mercury with winged feet now as apollo with his drawn bow now as hercules leaning upon his club and resting from his twelve labors perhaps it was because he thought that his grandmother who used to tell the children about her life in wales and show them the picture of a castle where she had once slept when she was a girl would appreciate him in these apotheoses if he believed they would make a vivid impression upon the sweet old quaker lady no doubt he was right  there was another book which he read about this time and that was the greek soldier it was the story of a young greek a glorious athenian who had fought through the greek war of independence against the turks and then come to america and published the narrative of his adventures they fired my boy with a retrospective longing to have been present at the battle of navarino when the allied ships of the english french and russians destroyed the turkish fleet but it seemed to him that he could not have borne to have the allies impose a king upon the greeks when they really wanted a republic and so he was able to console himself for having been absent he did what he could in fighting the war over again and he intended to harden himself for the long struggle by sleeping on the floor as the greek soldier had done but the children often fell asleep on the floor in the warmth of the hearthfire and his preparation for the patriotic strife was not distinguishable in its practical effect from a reluctance to go to bed at the right hour  captain rileys narrative of his shipwreck on the coast of africa and his captivity among the arabs was a book which my boy and his brother prized with a kind of personal interest because their father told them that he had once seen a son of captain riley when he went to get his appointment of collector at columbus and that this son was named william willshire riley after the good english merchant william willshire who had ransomed captain riley william willshire seemed to them almost the best man who ever lived though my boy had secretly a greater fondness for the arab sidi hamet who was kind to captain riley and kept his brother seid from illtreating him whenever he could probably the boy liked him better because the arab was more picturesque than the englishman the whole narrative was very interesting it had a vein of sincere and earnest piety in it which was not its least charm and it was written in a style of oldfashioned stateliness which was not without its effect with the boys  somehow they did not think of the arabs in this narrative as of the same race and faith with the arabs of bagdad and the other places in the arabian nights they did not think whether these were mohammedans or not they naturalized them in the fairy world where all boys are citizens and lived with them there upon the same familiar terms as they lived with robinson crusoe their father once told them that robinson crusoe had robbed the real narrative of alexander selkirk of the place it ought to have held in the remembrance of the world and my boy had a feeling of guilt in reading it as if he were making himself the accomplice of an impostor he liked the arabian nights but oddly enough these wonderful tales made no such impression on his fancy as the stories in a wretchedly inferior book made he did not know the name of this book or who wrote it from which i imagine that much of his reading was of the purblind sort that ignorant grownup people do without any sort of literary vision he read this book perpetually when he was not reading his greek and roman mythology and then suddenly one day as happens in childhood with so many things it vanished out of his possession as if by magic perhaps he lost it perhaps he lent it at any rate it was gone and he never got it back and he never knew what book it was till thirty years afterwards when he picked up from a friends librarytable a copy of gesta romanorum and recognized in this collection of old monkish legends the longmissing treasure of his boyhood these stories without beauty of invention without art of construction or character without spirituality in their crude materialization which were read aloud in the refectories of mediæval cloisters while the monks sat at meat laid a spell upon the soul of the boy that governed his life he conformed his conduct to the principles and maxims which actuated the behavior of the shadowy people of these dryasdust tales he went about drunk with the fumes of fables about roman emperors that never were in an empire that never was and though they tormented him by putting a mixed and impossible civilization in the place of that he knew from his goldsmith he was quite helpless to break from their influence he was always expecting some wonderful thing to happen to him as things happened there in fulfilment of some saying or prophecy and at every trivial moment he made sayings and prophecies for himself which he wished events to fulfil one sunday when he was walking in an alley behind one of the stores he found a fur cap that had probably fallen out of the storeloft window he ran home with it and in his simplehearted rapture he told his mother that as soon as he picked it up there came into his mind the words he who picketh up this cap picketh up a fortune and he could hardly wait for monday to come and let him restore the cap to its owner and receive an enduring prosperity in reward of his virtue heaven knows what form he expected this to take but when he found himself in the store he lost all courage his tongue clove to the roof of his mouth and he could not utter a syllable of the fine phrases he had made to himself he laid the cap on the counter without a word the storekeeper came up and took it in his hand whats this he said why this is ours and he tossed the cap into a loose pile of hats by the showcase and the boy slunk out cut to the heart and crushed to the dust it was such a cruel disappointment and mortification that it was rather a relief to have his brother mock him and come up and say from time to time he who picketh up this cap picketh up a fortune and then split into a jeering laugh at least he could fight his brother and when he ran could stone him and he could throw quads and quoins and pieces of riglet at the jour printers when the story spread to them and one of them would begin he who picketh  he was not different from other boys in his desire to localize to realize what he read and he was always contriving in fancy scenes and encounters of the greatest splendor in which he bore a chief part inwardly he was all thrones principalities and powers the foe of tyrants the friend of good emperors and the intimate of magicians and magnificently apparelled outwardly he was an incorrigible little sloven who suffered in all social exigencies from the direst bashfulness and wished nothing so much as to shrink out of the sight of men if they spoke to him he could not help revealing sometimes to the kindness of his father and mother the world of foolish dreams one half of him lived in while the other half swam and fished and hunted and ran races and played tops and marbles and squabbled and scuffled in the boys town very likely they sympathized with him more than they let him know they encouraged his reading and the father directed his taste as far as might be especially in poetry the boy liked to make poetry but he preferred to read prose though he listened to the poems his father read aloud so as to learn how they were made he learned certain pieces by heart like the turk lay dreaming of the hour and pity the sorrows of a poor old man and he was fond of some passages that his father wished him to know in thomsons seasons there were some of moores songs too that he was fond of such as when in death i shall calm recline and it was noon and on flowers that ranged all around he learned these by heart to declaim at school where he spoke on the banks of the danube fair adelaide hied from campbell but he could hardly speak the soldiers dream for the lump that came into his throat at the lines            my little ones kissed me a thousand times oer              and my wife sobbed aloud in her fulness of heart            stay stay with us stay thou art weary and worn              and fain was their warbroken soldier to stay            but sorrow returned at the dawning of morn              and the voice in my dreaming ear melted away  he was himself both the warbroken soldier and the little ones that kissed him in the rapture of this now oldfashioned music and he woke with pangs of heartbreak in the very person of the dreamer  but he could not make anything either of byron or cowper and he did not even try to read the little treecalf volumes of homer and virgil which his father had in the versions of pope and dryden the small copperplates with which they were illustrated conveyed no suggestion to him afterwards he read goldsmiths deserted village and he formed a great passion for popes pastorals which he imitated in their easy heroics but till he came to read longfellow and tennyson and heine he never read any long poem without more fatigue than pleasure his father used to say that the taste for poetry was an acquired taste like the taste for tomatoes and that he would come to it yet but he never came to it or so much of it as some people seemed to do and he always had his sorrowful misgivings as to whether they liked it as much as they pretended i think too that it should be a flavor a spice a sweet a delicate relish in the high banquet of literature and never a chief dish and i should not know how to defend my boy for trying to make long poems of his own at the very time when he found it so hard to read other peoples long poems  he had no conception of authorship as a vocation in life and he did not know why he wanted to make poetry after first flaunting his skill in it before the boys and getting one of them into trouble by writing a loveletter for him to a girl at school and making the girl cry at a thing so strange and puzzling as a loveletter in rhyme he preferred to conceal his gift it became            his shame in crowdshis solitary pride  and he learned to know that it was considered soft to write poetry as indeed it mostly is he himself regarded with contempt a young man who had printed a piece of poetry in his fathers newspaper and put his own name to it he did not know what he would not have done sooner than print poetry and put his name to it and he was melted with confusion when a girl who was going to have a party came to him at the printingoffice and asked him to make her the invitations in verse the printers laughed and it seemed to the boy that he could never get over it  but such disgraces are soon lived down even at ten years and a great new experience which now came to him possibly helped the boy to forget this was the theatre which he had sometimes heard his father speak of there had once been a theatre in the boys town when a strolling company came up from cincinnati and opened for a season in an empty porkhouse but that was a long time ago and though he had written a tragedy all that the boy knew of a theatre was from a picture in a sundayschool book where a stage scene was given to show what kind of desperate amusements a person might come to in middle life if he began by breaking the sabbath in his youth his brother had once been taken to a theatre in pittsburgh by one of their rivergoing uncles and he often told about it but my boy formed no conception of the beautiful reality from his accounts of a burglar who jumped from a roof and was chased by a watchman with a pistol up and down a street with houses painted on a curtain  illustration the beacon of death  the company which came to the boys town in his time was again from cincinnati and it was under the management of the father and mother of two actresses afterwards famous who were then children just starting upon their career these pretty little creatures took the leading parts in bombastes furioso the first night my boy ever saw a play and he instantly fell impartially in love with both of them and tacitly remained their abject slave for a great while after when the smaller of them came out with a large pair of stage boots in one hand and a drawn sword in the other and said            whoever dares these boots displace            shall meet bombastes face to face  if the boy had not already been bereft of his senses by the melodrama preceding the burlesque he must have been transported by her beauty her grace her genius he indeed gave her and her sister his heart but his mind was already gone rapt from him by the adorable pirate who fought a losing fight with broadswords two up and two downclickclick clickclickand died all over the deck of the pirate ship in the opening piece this was called the beacon of death and the scene represented the forecastle of the pirate ship with a lantern dangling from the rigging to lure unsuspecting merchantmen to their doom afterwards the boy remembered nothing of the story but a scrap of the dialogue meaninglessly remained with him and when the pirate captain appeared with his bloody crew and said hoarsely let us go below and get some brandy the boy would have bartered all his hopes of bliss to have been that abandoned ruffian in fact he always liked and longed to be the villain rather than any other person in the play and he so glutted himself with crime of every sort in his tender years at the theatre that he afterwards came to be very tired of it and avoided the plays and novels that had very marked villains in them  he was in an ecstasy as soon as the curtain rose that night and he lived somewhere out of his body as long as the playing lasted which was well on to midnight for in those days the theatre did not meanly put the public off with one play but gave it a heartful and its moneys worth with three on his first night my boy saw the beacon of death bombastes furioso and blackeyed susan and he never afterwards saw less than three plays each night and he never missed a night as long as the theatre languished in the unfriendly air of that mainly calvinistic community where the theatre was regarded by most good people as the eighth of the seven deadly sins the whole day long he dwelt in a dream of it that blotted out or rather consumed with more effulgent brightness all the other daydreams he had dreamed before and his heart almost burst with longing to be a villain like those villains on the stage to have a moustachea black moustachesuch as they wore at a time when every one off the stage was clean shaven and somehow to end bloodily murderously as became a villain  i dare say this was not quite a wholesome frame of mind for a boy of ten years but i do not defend it i only portray it being the boy he was he was destined somehow to dwell half the time in a world of dreamery and i have tried to express how when he had once got enough of villainy he reformed his ideals and rather liked virtue at any rate it was a phase of being that could not have been prevented without literally destroying him and i feel pretty sure that his father did well to let him have his fill of the theatre at once he could not have known of the riot of emotions behind the childs shy silence or how continually he was employed in dealing death to all the good people in the pieces he saw or imagined this the boy could no more have suffered to appear than his passion for those lovely little girls for whose sake he somehow perpetrated these wicked deeds the theatre bills large and small were printed in his fathers office and sometimes the amiable manager and his wife strolled in with the copy the boy always wildly hoped and feared they would bring the little girls with them but they never did and he contented himself with secretly adoring the father and mother doubly divine as their parents and as actors they were on easy terms with the rollerboy the wretch who shot turtledoves with no regard for their symbolical character and they joked with him in a light giveandtake that smote my boy with an anguish of envy it would have been richly enough for him to pass the least word with them a look a smile from them would have been bliss but he shrank out of their way and once when he met them in the street and they seemed to be going to speak to him he ran so that they could not     xvi  other boys   i cannot quite understand why the theatre which my boy was so full of and so fond of did not inspire him to write plays to pour them out tragedy upon tragedy till the world was filled with tears and blood perhaps it was because his soul was so soaked and as it were waterlogged with the drama that it could only drift sluggishly in that welter of emotions and make for no point no port where it could recover itself and direct its powers again the historical romance which he had begun to write before the impassioned days of the theatre seems to have been lost sight of at this time though it was an enterprise that he was so confident of carrying forward that he told all his family and friends about it and even put down the opening passages of it on paper which he cut in large quantity and ruled himself so as to have it exactly suitable the story as i have said was imagined from events in irvings history of the conquest of granada a book which the boy loved hardly less than the monkish legends of gesta romanorum and it concerned the rival fortunes of hamet el zegri and boabdil el chico the uncle and nephew who vied with each other for the crumbling throne of the moorish kingdom but i have not the least notion how it all ended perhaps the boy himself had none  i wish i could truly say that he finished any of his literary undertakings but i cannot they were so many that they cumbered the house and were trodden under foot and sometimes they brought him to open shame as when his brother picked one of them up and began to read it out loud with affected admiration he was apt to be ashamed of his literary efforts after the first moment and he shuddered at his brothers burlesque of the high romantic vein in which most of his neverended beginnings were conceived one of his riverfaring uncles was visiting with his family at the boys home when he laid out the scheme of his great fiction of hamet el zegri and the kindly young aunt took an interest in it which he poorly rewarded a few months later when she asked how the story was getting on and he tried to ignore the whole matter and showed such mortification at the mention of it that the poor lady was quite bewildered  the trouble with him was that he had to live that kind of double life i have spoken ofthe boys town life and the cloud dwellers lifeand that the last which he was secretly proud of abashed him before the first this is always the way with doublelived people but he did not know it and he stumbled along through the glory and the ignominy as best he could and as he thought alone  he was often kept from being a fool and worse by that elder brother of his and i advise every boy to have an elder brother have a brother about four years older than yourself i should say and if your temper is hot and your disposition revengeful and you are a vain and ridiculous dreamer at the same time that you are eager to excel in feats of strength and games of skill and to do everything that the other fellows do and are ashamed to be better than the worst boy in the crowd your brother can be of the greatest use to you with his larger experience and wisdom my boys brother seemed to have an ideal of usefulness while my boy only had an ideal of glory to wish to help others while my boy only wished to help himself my boy would as soon have thought of his fathers doing a wrong thing as of his brothers doing it and his brother was a calm light of commonsense of justice of truth while he was a fantastic flicker of gaudy purposes which he wished to make shine before men in their fulfilment his brother was always doing for him and for the younger children while my boy only did for himself he had a very gray moustache before he began to have any conception of the fact that he was sent into the world to serve and to suffer as well as to rule and enjoy but his brother seemed to know this instinctively he bore the yoke in his youth patiently if not willingly he shared the anxieties as he parted the cares of his father and mother yet he was a boy among boys too he loved to swim to skate to fish to forage and passionately above all he loved to hunt but in everything he held himself in check that he might hold the younger boys in check and my boy often repaid his conscientious vigilance with hard words and hard names such as embitter even the most selfforgiving memories he kept mechanically within certain laws and though in his rage he hurled every other name at his brother he would not call him a fool because then he would be in danger of hellfire if he had known just what raca meant he might have called him raca for he was not so much afraid of the council but as it was his brother escaped that insult and held through all a rein upon him and governed him through his scruples as well as his fears  his brother was full of inventions and enterprises beyond most other boys and his undertakings came to the same end of nothingness that awaits all boyish endeavor he intended to make fireworks and sell them he meant to raise silkworms he prepared to take the contract of clearing the new cemetery grounds of stumps by blasting them out with gunpowder besides this he had a plan with another big boy for making money by getting slabs from the sawmill and sawing them up into stovewood and selling them to the cooks of canalboats the only trouble was that the cooks would not buy the fuel even when the boys had a halfcord of it all nicely piled up on the canalbank they would rather come ashore after dark and take it for nothing he had a good many other schemes for getting rich that failed and he wanted to go to california and dig gold only his mother would not consent he really did save the canalbasin once when the banks began to give way after a long rain he saw the break beginning and ran to tell his father who had the firebells rung the fire companies came rushing to the rescue but as they could not put the basin out with their engines they all got shovels and kept it in they did not do this before it had overflowed the street and run into the cellars of the nearest houses the water stood two feet deep in the kitchen of my boys house and the yard was flooded so that the boys made rafts and navigated it for a whole day my boys brother got drenched to the skin in the rain and lots of fellows fell off the rafts  he belonged to a military company of big boys that had real wooden guns such as the little boys never could get and silk oilcloth caps and nankeen roundabouts and white pantaloons with black stripes down the legs and once they marched out to a boys that had a father that had a farm and he gave them all a free dinner in an arbor before the house bread and butter and applebutter and molasses and pound cake and peaches and apples it was splendid when the excitement about the mexican war was the highest the company wanted a fort and they got a farmer to come and scale off the sod with his plough in a grassy place there was near a piece of woods where a good many cows were pastured they took the pieces of sod and built them up into the walls of a fort about fifteen feet square they intended to build them higher than their heads but they got so eager to have the works stormed that they could not wait and they commenced having the battle when they had the walls only breast high there were going to be two parties one to attack the fort and the other to defend it and they were just going to throw sods but one boy had a real shotgun that he was to load up with powder and fire off when the battle got to the worst so as to have it more like a battle he thought it would be more like yet if he put in a few shot and he did it on his own hook it was a splendid gun but it would not stand cocked long and he was resting it on the wall of the fort ready to fire when the stormingparty came on throwing sods and yelling and holloing and all at once his gun went off and a cow that was grazing broadside to the fort gave a frightened bellow and put up her tail and started for home when they found out that the gun if not the boy had shot a cow the mexicans and americans both took to their heels and it was a good thing they did so for as soon as that cow got home and the owner found out by the blood on her that she had been shot though it was only a very slight wound he was so mad that he did not know what to do and very likely he would have half killed those boys if he had caught them he got a plough and he went out to their fort and he ploughed it all down flat so that not one sod remained upon another  my boys brother had a good many friends who were too old for my boy to play with one of them had a father that had a flourmill out at the first lock and for a while my boys brother intended to be a miller i do not know why he gave up being one he did stay up all night with his friend in the mill once and he found out that the water has more power by night than by day or at least he came to believe so he knew another boy who had a father who had a stonequarry and a canalboat to bring the stone to town it was a scow and it was drawn by one horse sometimes he got to drive the horse and once he was allowed to steer the boat this was a great thing and it would have been hard to believe of anybody else the name of the boy that had the father that owned this boat was piccolo or rather that was his nickname given him because he could whistle like a piccoloflute once the fellows were disputing whether you could jump halfway across a narrow stream and then jump back without touching your feet to the other shore piccolo tried it and sat down in the middle of the stream  my boys brother had a scheme for preserving ripe fruit by sealing it up in a stone jug and burying the jug in the ground and not digging it up till christmas he tried it with a jug of cherries which he dug up in about a week but the cherries could not have smelt worse if they had been kept till christmas he knew a boy that had a father that had a bakery and that used to let him come and watch them making bread there was a fat boy learning the trade there and they called him the doughbaby because he looked so white and soft and the boy whose father had a mill said that down at the german brewery they had a dutch boy that they were teaching to drink beer so they could tell how much beer a person could drink if he was taken early but perhaps this was not true  my boys brother went to all sorts of places that my boy was too shy to go to and he associated with much older boys but there was one boy who as i have said was the dear friend of both of them and that was the boy who came to learn the trade in their fathers printingoffice and who began an historical romance at the time my boy began his great moorish novel the first day he came he was put to roll or ink the types while my boys brother worked the press and all day long my boy from where he was setting type could hear him telling the story of a book he had read it was about a person named monte cristo who was a count and who could do anything my boy listened with a gnawing literary jealousy of a boy who had read a book that he had never heard of he tried to think whether it sounded as if it were as great a book as the conquest of granada or gesta romanorum and for a time he kept aloof from this boy because of his envy afterwards they came together on don quixote but though my boy came to have quite a passionate fondness for him he was long in getting rid of his grudge against him for his knowledge of monte cristo he was as great a laughter as my boy and his brother and he liked the same sports so that two by two or all three together they had no end of jokes and fun he became the editor of a country newspaper with varying fortunes but steadfast principles and when the war broke out he went as a private soldier he soon rose to be an officer and fought bravely in many battles then he came back to a countrynewspaper office where ever after he continued to fight the battles of right against wrong till he died not long ago at his post of dutya true generous and lofty soul he was one of those boys who grow into the men who seem commoner in america than elsewhere and who succeed far beyond our millionaires and statesmen in realizing the ideal of america in their nobly simple lives if his story could be faithfully written out word for word deed for deed it would be far more thrilling than that of monte cristo or any hero of romance and so would the common story of any common life but we cannot tell these stories somehow  my boy knew nearly a hundred boys more or less but it is no use trying to tell about them for all boys are a good deal alike and most of these did not differ much from the rest they were pretty good fellows that is to say they never did half the mischief they intended to do and they had moments of intending to do right or at least they thought they did and when they did wrong they said they did not intend to but my boy never had any particular friend among his schoolmates though he played and fought with them on intimate terms and was a good comrade with any boy that wanted to go in swimming or out hunting his closest friend was a boy who was probably never willingly at school in his life and who had no more relish of literature or learning in him than the open fields or the warm air of an early spring day i dare say it was a sense of his kinship with nature that took my boy with him and rested his soul from all its wild dreams and vain imaginings he was like a piece of the genial earth with no more hint of toiling or spinning in him willing for anything but passive and without force or aim he lived in a belated logcabin that stood in the edge of a cornfield on the riverbank and he seemed one day when my boy went to find him there to have a mother who smoked a cobpipe and two or three large sisters who hulked about in the one dim low room but the boys had very little to do with each others houses or for that matter with each others yards his friend seldom entered my boys gate and never his door for with all the toleration his father felt for every manner of human creature he could not see what good the boy was to get from this queer companion it is certain that he got no harm for his companion was too vague and void even to think evil socially he was as low as the ground under foot but morally he was as good as any boy in the boys town and he had no bad impulses he had no impulses at all in fact and of his own motion he never did anything or seemed to think anything when he wished to get at my boy he simply appeared in the neighborhood and hung about the outside of the fence till he came out he did not whistle or call eoowe as the other fellows did but waited patiently to be discovered and to be gone off with wherever my boy listed he never had any plans himself and never any will but to go in swimming he neither hunted nor foraged he did not even fish and i suppose that money could not have hired him to run races he played marbles but not very well and he did not care much for the game the two boys soaked themselves in the river together and then they lay on the sandy shore or under some tree and talked but my boy could not have talked to him about any of the things that were in his books or the fume of dreams they sent up in his mind he must rather have soothed against his soft caressing ignorance the ache of his fantastic spirit and reposed his intensity of purpose in that lax and easy aimlessness their friendship was not only more innocent than any other friendship my boy had but it was wholly innocent they loved each other and that was all and why people love one another there is never any satisfactory telling but this friend of his must have had great natural good in him and if i could find a man of the make of that boy i am sure i should love him  my boys other friends wondered at his fondness for him and it was often made a question with him at home if not a reproach to him so that in the course of time it ceased to be that comfort it had been to him he could not give him up but he could not help seeing that he was ignorant and idle and in a fatal hour he resolved to reform him i am not able now to say just how he worked his friend up to the point of coming to school and of washing his hands and feet and face and putting on a new check shirt to come in but one day he came and my boy as he had planned took him into his seat and owned his friendship with him before the whole school this was not easy for though everybody knew how much the two were together it was a different thing to sit with him as if he thought him just as good as any boy and to help him get his lessons and stay him mentally as well as socially he struggled through one day and maybe another but it was a failure from the first moment and my boy breathed freer when his friend came one halfday and then never came again the attempted reform had spoiled their simple and harmless intimacy they never met again upon the old ground of perfect trust and affection perhaps the kindly earthspirit had instinctively felt a wound from the shame my boy had tried to brave out and shrank from their former friendship without quite knowing why perhaps it was my boy who learned to realize that there could be little in common but their common humanity between them and could not go back to that at any rate their friendship declined from this point and it seems to me somehow a pity  among the boys who were between my boy and his brother in age was one whom all the boys liked because he was clever with everybody with little boys as well as big boys he was a laughing pleasant fellow always ready for fun but he never did mean things and he had an open face that made a friend of every one who saw him he had a father that had a house with a lightningrod so that if you were in it when there was a thunderstorm you could not get struck by lightning as my boy once proved by being in it when there was a thunderstorm and not getting struck this in itself was a great merit and there were grapearbors and peachtrees in his yard which added to his popularity with clingstone peaches almost as big as oranges on them he was a fellow who could take you home to meals whenever he wanted to and he liked to have boys stay all night with him his mother was as clever as he was and even the sight of his father did not make the fellows want to go and hide his father was so clever that he went home with my boy one night about midnight when the boy had come to pass the night with his boys and the youngest of them had said he always had the nightmare and walked in his sleep and as likely as not he might kill you before he knew it my boy tried to sleep but the more he reflected upon his chances of getting through the night alive the smaller they seemed and so he woke up his potential murderer from the sweetest and soundest slumber and said he was going home but he was afraid and the boy had to go and wake his father very few fathers would have dressed up and gone home with a boy at midnight and perhaps this one did so only because the mother made him but it shows how clever the whole family was  it was their oldest boy whom my boy and his brother chiefly went with before that boy who knew about monte cristo came to learn the trade in their fathers office one saturday in july they three spent the whole day together it was just the time when the apples are as big as walnuts on the trees and a boy wants to try whether any of them are going to be sweet or not the boys tried a great many of them in an old orchard thrown open for buildinglots behind my boys yard but they could not find any that were not sour or that they could eat till they thought of putting salt on them if you put salt on it you could eat any kind of green apple whether it was going to be a sweet kind or not they went up to the basin bank and got lots of salt out of the holes in the barrels lying there and then they ate all the apples they could hold and after that they cut limber sticks off the trees and sharpened the points and stuck apples on them and threw them you could send an apple almost out of sight that way and you could scare a dog almost as far as you could see him  on monday my boy and his brother went to school but the other boy was not there and in the afternoon they heard he was sick then towards the end of the week they heard that he had the flux and on friday just before school let out the teacherit was the one that whipped so and that the fellows all likedrapped on his desk and began to speak very solemnly to the scholars he told them that their little mate whom they had played with and studied with was lying very sick so very sick that it was expected he would die and then he read them a serious lesson about life and death and tried to make them feel how passing and uncertain all things were and resolve to live so that they need never be afraid to die  some of the fellows cried and the next day some of them went to see the dying boy and my boy went with them his spirit was stricken to the earth when he saw his gay kind playmate lying there white as the pillow under his wasted face in which his sunken blue eyes showed large and strange the sick boy did not say anything that the other boys could hear but they could see the wan smile that came to his dry lips and the light come sadly into his eyes when his mother asked him if he knew this one or that and they could not bear it and went out of the room  in a few days they heard that he was dead and one afternoon school did not keep so that the boys might go to the funeral most of them walked in the procession but some of them were waiting beside the open grave that was dug near the grave of that man who believed there was a hole through the earth from pole to pole and had a perforated stone globe on top of his monument     xvii  fantasies and superstitions   my boy used to be afraid of this monument which stood a long time or what seemed to him a long time in the yard of the tombstone cutter before it was put up at the grave of the philosopher who imagined the earth as hollow as much of the life is on it he was a brave officer in the army which held the region against the indians in the pioneer times he passed the latter part of his life there and he died and was buried in the boys town my boy had to go by the yard when he went to see his grandmother and even at high noon the sight of the officers monument and the other gravestones standing and leaning about made his flesh creep and his blood run cold when there were other boys with him he would stop at the door of the shed where a large fair german was sawing slabs of marble with a long saw that had no teeth and that he eased every now and then with water from a sponge he kept by him but if the boy was alone and it was getting at all late in the afternoon he always ran by the place as fast as he could he could hardly have told what he was afraid of but he must have connected the gravestones with ghosts  illustration he always ran by the place as fast as he could  his superstitions were not all of the ghastly kind some of them related to conduct and character it was noted long ago how boys throw stones for instance at a tree and feign to themselves that this thing or that of great import will happen or not as they hit or miss the tree but my boy had other fancies which came of things he had read and half understood in one of his schoolbooks was a story that began charles was an honest boy but robert was the name of a thief and it went on to show how charles grew up in the respect and affection of all who knew him by forbearing to steal some oranges which their owner had set for safekeeping at the heels of his horse while robert was kicked at once there was a picture that showed him holding his stomach with both hands and afterwards came to a bad end through attempting to take one my boy conceived from the tale that the name of robert was necessarily associated with crime it was long before he outgrew the prejudice and this tale and others of a like vindictive virtuousness imbued him with such a desire to lead an upright life that he was rather a bother to his friends with his scruples a girl at school mislaid a pencil which she thought she had lent him and he began to have a morbid belief that he must have stolen it he became frantic with the mere dread of guilt he could not eat or sleep and it was not till he went to make good the loss with a pencil which his grandfather gave him that the girl said she had found her pencil in her desk and saved him from the despair of a selfconvicted criminal after that his father tried to teach him the need of using his reason as well as his conscience concerning himself and not to be a little simpleton but he was always in an anguish to restore things to their owners like the good boys in the storybooks and he suffered pangs of the keenest remorse for the part he once took in the disposition of a piece of treasuretrove this was a brownpaper parcel which he found behind a leaning gravestone in the stonecutters yard and which he could not help peeping into it was full of raisins and in the amaze of such a discovery he could not help telling the other boys they flocked round and swooped down upon the parcel like birds of prey and left not a raisin behind in vain he implored them not to stain their souls with this misdeed neither the law nor the prophets availed neither the awful shadow of the prison which he cast upon them nor the fear of the last judgment which he invoked they said that the raisins did not belong to anybody that the owner had forgotten all about them that they had just been put there by some one who never intended to come back for them he went away sorrowing without touching a raisin he felt that the touch must have stricken him with death and far heavier in soul than the hardened accomplices of his sin of whom he believed himself the worst in having betrayed the presence of the raisins to them  he used to talk to himself when he was little but one day his mother said to him jokingly dont you know that he who talks to himself has the devil for a listener and after that he never dared whisper above his breath when he was alone though his father and mother had both taught him that there was no devil but his own evil will he shuddered when he heard a dog howling in the night for that was a sign that somebody was going to die if he heard a hen crow as a hen sometimes unnaturally would he stoned her because it was a sign of the worst kind of luck he believed that warts came from playing with toads but you could send them away by saying certain words over them and he was sorry that he never had any warts so that he could send them away and see them go but he never could bear to touch a toad and so of course he could not have warts other boys played with toads just to show that they were not afraid of having warts but every one knew that if you killed a toad your cow would give bloody milk i dare say the far forefathers of the race knew this too when they first began to herd their kine in the birthplace of the aryan peoples and perhaps they learned then that if you killed a snake early in the day its tail would live till sundown my boy killed every snake he could he thought it somehow a duty all the boys thought so they dimly felt that they were making a just return to the serpenttribe for the bad behavior of their ancestor in the garden of eden once in a cornfield near the little reservoir the boys found on a thawing day of early spring knots and bundles of snakes writhen and twisted together in the torpor of their long winter sleep it was a horrible sight that afterwards haunted my boys dreams he had nightmares which remained as vivid in his thoughts as anything that happened to him by day there were no poisonous snakes in the region of the boys town but there were some large blacksnakes and the boys said that if a blacksnake got the chance he would run up your leg and tie himself round your body so that you could not breathe nobody had ever seen a blacksnake do it and nobody had ever seen a hoopsnake but the boys believed there was such a snake and that he would take his tail in his mouth when he got after a person and roll himself along swifter than the fastest racehorse could run he did not bite but when he came up with you he would take the point of his tail out of his mouth and strike it into you if he struck his tail into a tree the tree would die my boy had seen a boy who had been chased by a hoopsnake but he had not seen the snake though for the matter of that the boy who had been chased by it had not seen it either he did not stop to see it another kind of snake that was very strange was a hairsnake no one had ever seen it happen but every one knew that if you put long horsehairs into a puddle of water and let them stay they would turn into hairsnakes and when you drank out of a spring you had to be careful not to swallow a hairsnake or it would remain in your stomach and grow there  when you saw a lizard you had to keep your mouth tight shut or else the lizard would run down your throat before you knew it that was what all the boys said and my boy believed it though he had never heard of anybody that it happened to he believed that if you gave a chickencock burnt brandy it could lay eggs and that if you gave a boy burnt brandy it would stop his growing that was the way the circusmen got their dwarfs and the indiarubber man kept himself limber by rubbing his joints with rattlesnake oil  a snake could charm a person and when you saw a snake you had to kill it before it could get its eye on you or it would charm you snakes always charmed birds and there were mysterious powers of the air and forces of nature that a boy had to be on his guard against just as a bird had to look out for snakes you must not kill a granddaddylonglegs or a ladybug it was bad luck my boy believed or was afraid he believed that            what you dream monday morning before daylight            will come true before saturday night  but if it was something bad you could keep it from coming true by not telling your dream till you had eaten breakfast he governed his little foolish frightened life not only by the maxims he had learned out of his gesta romanorum but by common sayings of all sorts such as            see a pin and leave it lay            youll have bad luck all the day  and if ever he tried to rebel against this slavery and went by a pin in the path his fears tormented him till he came back and picked it up he would not put on his left stocking first for that was bad luck but besides these superstitions which were common to all the boys he invented superstitions of his own with which he made his life a burden he did not know why but he would not step upon the cracks between the pavingstones and some days he had to touch every tree or post along the sidewalk as doctor johnson did in his time though the boy had never heard of doctor johnson then  while he was yet a very little fellow he had the distorted mistaken piety of childhood he had an abject terror of dying but it seemed to him that if a person could die right in the centre isle of the churchthe methodist church where his mother used to go before she became finally a new churchwomanthe chances of that persons going straight to heaven would be so uncommonly good that he need have very little anxiety about it he asked his mother if she did not think so too holding by her hand as they came out of church together and he noticed the sort of gravity and even pain with which she and his father received this revelation of his darkling mind they tried to teach him what they thought of such things but though their doctrine caught his fancy and flattered his love of singularity he was not proof against the crude superstitions of his mates he thought for a time that there was a bad man but this belief gave way when he heard his father laughing about a certain clergyman who believed in a personal devil  the boys said the world was going to be burned up some time and my boy expected the end with his full share of the trouble that it must bring to every sinner his fears were heightened by the fact that his grandfather believed this end was very near at hand and was prepared for the second coming of christ at any moment those were the days when the minds of many were stirred by this fear or hope the believers had their ascension robes ready and some gave away their earthly goods so as not to be cumbered with anything in their heavenward flight at home my boy heard his father jest at the crazy notion and make fun of the believers but abroad among the boys he took the tint of the prevailing gloom one awful morning at school it suddenly became so dark that the scholars could not see to study their lessons and then the boys knew that the end of the world was coming there were no clouds as for a coming storm but the air was blackened almost to the dusk of night the school was dismissed and my boy went home to find the candles lighted and a strange gloom and silence on everything outside he remembered entering into this awful time but he no more remembered coming out of it than if the earth had really passed away in fire and smoke  he early heard of forebodings and presentiments and he tried hard against his will to have them because he was so afraid of having them for the same reason he did his best or his worst to fall into a trance in which he should know everything that was going on about him all the preparations for his funeral all the sorrow and lamentation but should be unable to move or speak and only be saved at the last moment by some one putting a mirror to his lips and finding a little blur of mist on it sometimes when he was beginning to try to write things and to imagine characters if he imagined a characters dying then he became afraid he was that character and was going to die  once he woke up in the night and found the full moon shining into his room in a very strange and phantasmal way and washing the floor with its pale light and somehow it came into his mind that he was going to die when he was sixteen years old he could then only have been nine or ten but the perverse fear sank deep into his soul and became an increasing torture till he passed his sixteenth birthday and entered upon the year in which he had appointed himself to die the agony was then too great for him to bear alone any longer and with shame he confessed his doom to his father why his father said you are in your seventeenth year now it is too late for you to die at sixteen and all the longgathering load of misery dropped from the boys soul and he lived till his seventeenth birthday and beyond it without further trouble if he had known that he would be in his seventeenth year as soon as he was sixteen he might have arranged his presentiment differently     xviii  the nature of boys   i tell these things about my boy not so much because they were peculiar to him as because i think they are many of them common to all boys one tiresome fact about boys is that they are so much alike or used to be they did not wish to be so but they could not help it they did not even know they were alike and my boy used to suffer in ways that he believed no boy had ever suffered before but as he grew older he found that boys had been suffering in exactly the same way from the beginning of time in the world you will find a great many grownup boys with gray beards and grandchildren who think that they have been different their whole lives through from other people and are the victims of destiny that is because with all their growing they have never grown to be men but have remained a sort of crybabies the first thing you have to learn here below is that in essentials you are just like every one else and that you are different from others only in what is not so much worth while if you have anything in common with your fellowcreatures it is something that god gave you if you have anything that seems quite your own it is from your silly self and is a sort of perversion of what came to you from the creator who made you out of himself and had nothing else to make any one out of there is not really any difference between you and your fellowcreatures but only a seeming difference that flatters and cheats you with a sense of your strangeness and makes you think you are a remarkable fellow  there is a difference between boys and men but it is a difference of selfknowledge chiefly a boy wants to do everything because he does not know he cannot a man wants to do something because he knows he cannot do everything a boy always fails and a man sometimes succeeds because the man knows and the boy does not know a man is better than a boy because he knows better he has learned by experience that what is a harm to others is a greater harm to himself and he would rather not do it but a boy hardly knows what harm is and he does it mostly without realizing that it hurts he cannot invent anything he can only imitate and it is easier to imitate evil than good you can imitate war but how are you going to imitate peace so a boy passes his leisure in contriving mischief if you get another fellow to walk into a wasps camp you can see him jump and hear him howl but if you do not then nothing at all happens if you set a dog to chase a cat up a tree then something has been done but if you do not set the dog on the cat then the cat just lies in the sun and sleeps and you lose your time if a boy could find out some way of doing good so that he could be active in it very likely he would want to do good now and then but as he cannot he very seldom wants to do good  or at least he did not want to do good in my boys time things may be changed now for i have been talking of boys as they were in the boys town forty years ago for anything that i really know to the contrary a lot of fellows when they get together now may plot good deeds of all kinds but when more than a single one of them was together then they plotted mischief when i see five or six boys now lying under a tree on the grass and they fall silent as i pass them i have no right to say that they are not arranging to go and carry some poor widows winter wood into her shed and pile it neatly up for her and wish to keep it a secret from everybody but forty years ago i should have had good reason for thinking that they were debating how to tie a piece of her clothesline along the ground so that when her orphan boy came out for an armload of wood after dark he would trip on it and send his wood flying all over the yard  this would not be a sign that they were morally any worse than the boys who read harpers young people and who would every one die rather than do such a cruel thing but that they had not really thought much about it i dare say that if a crowd of the young peoples readers from eight to eleven years old got together they would choose the best boy among them to lead them on in works of kindness and usefulness but i am very sorry to say that in the boys town such a crowd of boys would have followed the lead of the worst boy as far as they dared not all of them would have been bad and the worst of them would not have been very bad but they would have been restless and thoughtless i am not ready to say that boys now are not wise enough to be good but in that time and town they certainly were not in their ideals and ambitions they were foolish and in most of their intentions they were mischievous without realizing that it was evil they meant more evil than it would have been possible for ten times as many boys to commit if the half of it were now committed by men the united states would be such an awful place that the decent people would all want to go and live in canada  i have often read in stories of boys who were fond of nature and loved her sublimity and beauty but i do not believe boys are ever naturally fond of nature they want to make use of the woods and fields and rivers and when they become men they find these aspects of nature endeared to them by association and so they think that they were dear for their own sakes but the taste for nature is as purely acquired as the taste for poetry or the taste for tomatoes i have often seen boys wondering at the rainbow but it was wonder not admiration that moved them and i have seen them excited by a storm but because the storm was tremendous not because it was beautiful  i never knew a boy who loved flowers or cared for their decorative qualities if any boy had gathered flowers the other boys would have laughed at him though boys gather every kind of thing that they think will be of the slightest use or profit i do not believe they appreciate the perfume of flowers and i am sure that they never mind the most noisome stench or the most loathsome sight a dead horse will draw a crowd of small boys who will dwell without shrinking upon the details of his putrefaction when they would pass by a rosetree in bloom with indifference hideous reptiles and insects interest them more than the loveliest form of leaf or blossom their senses have none of the delicacy which they acquire in afterlife  they are not cruel that is they have no delight in giving pain as a general thing but they do cruel things out of curiosity to see how their victims will act still even in this way i never saw many cruel things done if another boy gets hurt they laugh because it is funny to see him hop or hear him yell but they do not laugh because they enjoy his pain though they do not pity him unless they think he is badly hurt then they are scared and try to comfort him to bait a hook they tear an angleworm into small pieces or impale a grub without flinching they go to the slaughterhouse and see beeves knocked in the head without a tremor they acquaint themselves at any risk with all that is going on in the great strange world they have come into and they do not pick or choose daintily among the facts and objects they encounter to them there is neither foul nor fair clean nor unclean they have not the least discomfort from being dirty or unkempt and they certainly find no pleasure in being washed and combed and clad in fresh linen they do not like to see other boys so if a boy looking sleek and smooth came among the boys that my boy went with in the boys town they made it a reproach to him and hastened to help him spoil his clothes and his nice looks some of those boys had hands as hard as horn cracked open at the knuckles and in the palms and the crevices blackened with earth or grime and they taught my boy to believe that he was an inferior and unmanly person almost of the nature of a crybaby because his hands were not hornlike and cracked open and filled with dirt  he had comrades enough and went with everybody but till he formed that friendship with the queer fellow whom i have told of he had no friend among the boys and i very much doubt whether small boys understand friendship or can feel it as they do afterwards in its tenderness and unselfishness in fact they have no conception of generosity they are wasteful with what they do not want at the moment but their instinct is to get and not to give in the boys town if a fellow appeared at his gate with a piece of bread spread with applebutter and sugar on top the other fellows flocked round him and tried to flatter him out of bites of it though they might be at that moment almost bursting with surfeit to get a bite was so much clear gain and when they had wheedled one from the owner of the bread they took as large a bite as their mouths could stretch to and they had neither shame nor regret for their behavior but mocked his just resentment  the instinct of getting of hoarding was the motive of all their foraging they had no other idea of property than the bounty of nature and this was well enough as far as it went but their impulse was not to share this bounty with others but to keep it each for himself they hoarded nuts and acorns and hips and haws and then they wasted them and they hoarded other things merely from the greed of getting and with no possible expectation of advantage it might be well enough to catch bees in hollyhocks and imprison them in underground cells with flowers for them to make honey from but why accumulate fireflies and even dorbugs in small brick pens why heap together musselshells and what did a boy expect to do with all the marbles he won you could trade marbles for tops but they were not money like pins and why were pins money why did the boys instinctively choose them for their currency and pay everything with them there were certain very rigid laws about them and a bent pin could not be passed among the boys any more than a counterfeit coin among men there were fixed prices three pins would buy a bite of apple six pins would pay your way into a circus and so on but where did these pins come from or go to and what did the boys expect to do with them all no boy knew from time to time several boys got together and decided to keep store and then other boys decided to buy of them with pins but there was no calculation in the scheme and though i have read of boys especially in english books who made a profit out of their fellows i never knew any boy who had enough forecast to do it they were too wildly improvident for anything of the kind and if they had any virtue at all it was scorn of the vice of stinginess  they were savages in this as in many other things but noble savages and they were savages in such bravery as they showed that is they were venturesome but not courageous with the steadfast courage of civilized men they fought and then ran and they never fought except with some real or fancied advantage they were grave like indians for the most part and they were noisy without being gay they seldom laughed except at the pain or shame of some one i think they had no other conception of a joke though they told what they thought were funny stories mostly about some irishman just come across the sea but without expecting any one to laugh in fact life was a very serious affair with them they lived in a state of outlawry in the midst of invisible terrors and they knew no rule but that of might  i am afraid that harpers young people or rather the mothers of harpers young people may think i am painting a very gloomy picture of the natives of the boys town but i do not pretend that what i say of the boys of forty years ago is true of boys nowadays especially the boys who read harpers young people i understand that these boys always like to go tidily dressed and to keep themselves neat and that a good many of them carry canes they would rather go to school than fish or hunt or swim any day and if one of their teachers were ever to offer them a holiday they would reject it by a vote of the whole school they never laugh at a fellow when he hurts himself or tears his clothes they are noble and selfsacrificing friends and they carry out all their undertakings they often have very exciting adventures such as my boy and his mates never had they rescue one another from shipwreck and indians and if ever they are caught in a burning building or cast away on a desolate island they know just exactly what to do  but i am ashamed to say it was all very different in the boys town and i might as well make a clean breast of it while i am about it the fellows in that town were every one dreadfully lazythat is they never wanted to do any thing they were set to do but if they set themselves to do anything they would work themselves to death at it in this alone i understand that they differed by a whole worlds difference from the boys who read harpers young people i am almost afraid to confess how little moral strength most of those longago boys had a fellow would be very good at home really and truly good and as soon as he got out with the other fellows he would yield to almost any temptation to mischief that offered and if none offered he would go and hunt one up and would never stop till he had found one and kept at it till it overcame him the spirit of the boys world is not wicked but merely savage as i have often said in this book it is the spirit of not knowing better that is the prevailing spirit is so here and there a boy does know better but he is seldom a leader among boys and usually he is ashamed of knowing better and rarely tries to do better than the rest he would like to please his father and mother but he dreads the other boys and what they will say and so the light of home fades from his ignorant soul and leaves him in the outer darkness of the street it may be that it must be so but it seems a great pity and it seems somehow as if the father and the mother might keep with him in some word some thought and be there to help him against himself whenever he is weak and wavering the trouble is that the father and mother are too often children in their way and little more fit to be the guide than he  but while i am owning to a good deal that seems to me lamentably wrong in the behavior of the boys town boys i ought to remember one or two things to their credit they had an ideal of honor false enough as far as resenting insult went but true in some other things they were always respectful to women and if a boys mother ever appeared among them to interfere in behalf of her boy when they were abusing him they felt the indecorum but they were careful not to let her feel it they would not have dreamed of uttering a rude or impudent word to her they obeyed her and they were even eager to serve her if she asked a favor of them  for the most part also they were truthful and they only told lies when they felt obliged to do so as when they had been in swimming and said they had not or as when they wanted to get away from some of the boys or did not wish the whole crowd to know what they were doing but they were generally shamefaced in these lies and the fellows who could lie boldly and stick to it were few in the abstract lying was held in such contempt that if any boy said you were a liar you must strike him that was not to be borne for an instant any more than if he had called you a thief  i never knew a boy who was even reputed to have stolen anything among all the boys high and low who met together and played in a perfect social equality and cheating in any game was despised to break bounds to invade an orchard or garden was an adventure which might be permitted but even this was uncommon and most of the boys saw the affair in the true light and would not take part in it though it was considered fair to knock apples off a tree that hung over the fence and if you were out walnutting you might get over the fence in extreme cases and help yourself if the owner of the orchard was supposed to be stingy you might do it to plague him but the standard of honesty was chivalrously high among those boys and i believe that if ever we have the equality in this world which so many good men have hoped for theft will be unknown dishonesty was rare even among men in the boys town because there was neither wealth nor poverty there and all had enough and few too much     xix  the town itself   of course i do not mean to tell what the town was as men knew it but only as it appeared to the boys who made use of its opportunities for having fun the civic centre was the courthouse with the county buildings about it in the courthouse yard and the great thing in the courthouse was the town clock it was more important in the boys esteem than even the wooden woman who had a sword in one hand and a pair of scales in the other her eyes were blinded and the boys believed that she would be as high as a house if she stood on the ground she was above the clock which was so far up in the air against the summer sky which was always blue that it made your neck ache to look up at it and the bell was so large that once when my boy was a very little fellow and was in the belfry with his brother to see if they could get some of the pigeons that nested there and the clock began to strike it almost smote him dead with the terror of its sound and he felt his heart quiver with the vibration of the air between the strokes it seemed to him that he should never live to get down and he never knew how he did get down he could remember being in the courthouse after that one night when a wandering professor gave an exhibition in the courtroom and showed the effects of laughinggas on such men and boys as were willing to breathe it it was the same gas that dentists now give when they draw teeth but it was then used to make people merry and truthful to make them laugh and say just what they thought my boy was too young to know whether it did either but he was exactly the right age when on another night there was a large picture of death on a pale horse shown to be harrowed to the bottom of his soul by its ghastliness when he was much older his father urged him to go to the courthouse and hear the great corwin whose mexican war speech he had learned so much of by heart arguing a case but the boy was too bashful to go in when he got to the door and came back and reported that he was afraid they would make him swear he was sometimes in the courthouse yard at elections and celebrations and once he came from school at recess with some other boys and explored the region of the jail two or three prisoners were at the window and they talked to the boys and joked and the boys ran off again and played and the prisoners remained like unreal things in my boys fancy perhaps if it were not for this unreality which misery puts on for the happy when it is out of sight no one could be happy in a world where there is so much misery  the school was that first one which he went to in the basement of a church it was the episcopal church and he struggled for some meaning in the word episcopal he knew that the seceder church was called so because the spire was cedar a boy who went to sundayschool there told him so there was a methodist church where his grandfather went and a catholic church where that awful figure on the cross was no doubt there were other churches but he had nothing to do with them  besides his grandfathers drug and book store there was another drug store and there were eight or ten drygoods stores where every spring the boys were taken to be fitted with new straw hats but the store that they knew best was a toystore near the markethouse kept by a quaint old german where they bought their marbles and tops and jewsharps the store had a high sharp gable to the street and showed its timbers through the roughcast of its wall which was sprinkled with broken glass that glistened in the sun after a while the building disappeared like a scene shifted at the theatre and it was probably torn down then the boys found another toy store but they considered the dealer mean he asked very high prices and he said when a boy hung back from buying a thing that it was a very superior article and the boys had that for a byword and they holloed it at the storekeepers boy when they wanted to plague him there were two bakeries and at the american bakery there were small spongecakes which were the nicest cakes in the world for a cent apiece at the dutch bakery there were pretzels with salt and ashes sticking on them that the dutch boys liked but the american boys made fun of them and the bread at the dutch bakery was always sour there were four or five taverns where drink was always sold and drunkards often to be seen and there was one dutch tavern but the dutchmen generally went to the brewery for their beer and drank it there the boys went to the brewery to get yeast for their mothers and they liked to linger among the great heaps of malt and the huge vats wreathed in steam and sending out a pleasant smell the floors were always wet and the fat pale dutchmen working about in the vapory air never spoke to the boys who were afraid of them they took a boys bottle and filled it with foaming yeast and then took his cent all in a silence so oppressive that he scarcely dared to breathe my boy wondered where they kept the boy they were bringing up to drink beer but it would have been impossible to ask the brewery overlooked the river and you could see the south side of the bridge from its back windows and that was very strange it was just like the picture of the bridge in howes history of ohio and that made it seem like a bridge in some faroff country  there were two fireengines in the boys town but there seemed to be something always the matter with them so that they would not work if there was a fire when there was no fire the companies sometimes pulled them up through the town to the basin bank and practised with them against the roofs and fronts of the porkhouses it was almost as good as a muster to see the firemen in their red shirts and black trousers dragging the engine at a run two and two together one on each side of the rope my boy would have liked to speak to a fireman but he never dared and the foreman of the neptune which was the larger and feebler of the engines was a figure of such worshipful splendor in his eyes that he felt as if he could not be just a common human being he was a storekeeper to begin with and he was tall and slim and his black trousers fitted him like a glove he had a patentleather helmet and a brass speakingtrumpet and he gave all his orders through this it did not make any difference how close he was to the men he shouted everything through the trumpet and when they manned the breaks and began to pump he roared at them down on her down on her boys so that you would have thought the neptune could put out the world if it was burning up instead of that there was usually a feeble splutter from the nozzle and sometimes none at all even if the hose did not break it was fun to see the hose break the neptune was a favorite with the boys though they believed that the tremont could squirt farther and they had a belief in its quiet efficiency which was fostered by its reticence in public it was small and black but the neptune was large and painted of a gay color lit up with gilding that sent the blood leaping through a boys veins the boys knew the neptune was out of order but they were always expecting it would come right and in the meantime they felt that it was an honor to the town and they followed it as proudly back to the enginehouse after one of its magnificent failures as if it had been a magnificent success the boys were always making magnificent failures themselves and they could feel for the neptune  illustration the artist seemed satisfied himself  before the hydraulic was opened the porkhouses were the chief public attraction to the boys and they haunted them with a thrilling interest in the mysteries of porkpacking which none of their sensibilities revolted from afterwards the cottonmills which were rather small brick factories though they looked so large to the boys eclipsed the porkhouse in their regard they were all wild to work in the mills at first and they thought it a hardship that their fathers would not let them leave school and do it some few of the fellows that my boy knew did get to work in the mills and one of them got part of his finger taken off in the machinery it was thought a distinction among the boys and something like having been in war my boys brother was so crazy to try milllife that he was allowed to do so for a few weeks but a few weeks were enough of it and pretty soon the feeling about the mills all quieted down and the boys contented themselves with their flumes and their wheelpits and the headgates that let the water in on the wheels sometimes you could find fish under the wheels when the mills were not running the milldoors all had no admittance painted on them and the mere sight of the forbidding words would have been enough to keep my boy away for he had a great awe of any sort of authority but once he went into the mill to see his brother and another time he and some other boys got into an empty mill where they found a painter on an upper floor painting a panorama of paradise lost this masterpiece must have been several hundred feet long the boys disputed whether it would reach to the sawmill they could see from the windows if it was stretched out and my boy was surprised by the effects which the painter got out of some strips of tinsel which he was attaching to the scenery of the lake of fire and brimstone at different points the artist seemed satisfied himself with this simple means of suggesting the gleam of infernal fires he walked off to a distance to get it in perspective and the boys ventured so close to the paints which he had standing about by the bucketful that it seemed as if he must surely hollo at them but he did not say anything or seem to remember that they were there they formed such a favorable opinion of him and his art that they decided to have a panorama but it never came to anything in the first place they could not get the paints let alone the muslin  besides the bridge the schoolhouses the courthouse and jail the porthouses and the mills there was only one other public edifice in their town that concerned the boys or that they could use in accomplishing the objects of their life and this was the hall that was built while my boy could remember its rise for public amusements it was in this hall that he first saw a play and then saw so many plays for he went to the theatre every night but for a long time it seemed to be devoted to the purposes of mesmerism a professor highly skilled in that science which has reappeared in these days under the name of hypnotism made a sojourn of some weeks in the town and besides teaching it to classes of learners who wished to practise it gave nightly displays of its wonders he mesmerized numbers of the boys and made them do or think whatever he said he would give a boy a cane and then tell him it was a snake and the boy would throw it away like lightning he would get a lot of boys and mount them on chairs and then tell them that they were at a horserace and the boys would gallop astride of their chairs round and round till he stopped them sometimes he would scare them almost to death with a thunderstorm that he said was coming on at other times he would make them go in swimming on the dusty floor and they would swim all over it in their best clothes and would think they were in the river  there were some people who did not believe in the professor or the boys either one of these people was an officer of the army who was staying a while in the boys town and perhaps had something to do with recruiting troops for the mexican war he came to the lecture one night and remained with others who lingered after it was over to speak with the professor my boy was there with his father and it seemed to him that the officer smiled mockingly at the professor angry words passed and then the officer struck out at the professor in an instant the professor put up both his fists they flashed towards the officers forehead and the officer tumbled backwards the boy could hardly believe it had happened it seemed unreal and of the dreamlike quality that so many facts in a childs bewildered life are of  there were very few places of amusement or entertainment in the boys town that were within a boys reach there were at least a dozen places where a man could get whiskey but only one where he could get icecream and the boys were mostly too poor and too shy to visit this resort but there used to be a pleasuregarden on the outskirts of the town which my boy remembered visiting when he was a very little fellow with his brother there were two large old mulberrytrees in this garden and one bore white mulberries and the other black mulberries and when you had paid your fip to come in you could eat all the mulberries you wanted for nothing there was a tame crow that my boy understood could talk if it liked but it only ran after him and tried to bite his legs besides this attraction there was a labyrinth or puzzle as the boys called it of paths that wound in and out among bushes so that when you got inside you were lucky if you could find your way out my boy though he had hold of his brothers hand did not expect to get out he expected to perish in that labyrinth and he had some notion that his end would be hastened by the tame crow his first visit to the pleasuregarden was his last and it passed so wholly out of his consciousness that he never knew what became of it any more than if it had been taken up into the clouds  he tasted icecream there for the first time and had his doubts about it though a sherryglass full of it cost a fip and it ought to have been good for such a sum as that later in life he sometimes went to the saloon where it was sold in the town and bashfully gasped out a demand for a glass and ate it in some sort of chilly backparlor but the boys in that town if they cared for such luxuries did not miss them much and their lives were full of such vivid interests arising from the woods and waters all about them that they did not need public amusements other than those which chance and custom afforded them i have tried to give some notion of the pleasure they got out of the daily arrival of the packet in the canal basin and it would be very unjust if i failed to celebrate the omnibus which was put on in place of the oldfashioned stagecoaches between the boys town and cincinnati i dare say it was of the size of the ordinary city omnibus but it looked as large to the boys then as a pullman car would look to a boy now and they assembled for its arrivals and departures with a thrill of civic pride such as hardly any other fact of the place could impart  my boy remembered coming from cincinnati in the stage when he was so young that it must have been when he first came to the boys town the distance was twenty miles and the stage made it in four hours it was this furious speed which gave the child his earliest illusion of trees and fences racing by while the stage seemed to stand still several times after that he made the journey with his father seeming to have been gone a long age before he got back and always so homesick that he never had any appetite at the tavern where the stage stopped for dinner midway when it started back he thought it would never get off the city pave and out from between its lines of houses into the free country the boys always called cincinnati the city they supposed it was the only city in the world  illustration my boy remembers coming from cincinnati in the stage  of course there was a whole state of things in the boys town that the boys never knew of or only knew by mistaken rumors and distorted glimpses they had little idea of its politics or commerce or religion that was not wrong and they only concerned themselves with persons and places so far as they expected to make use of them but as they could make very little use of grown persons or public places they kept away from them and the boys town was for the most part an affair of watercourses and fields and woods and the streets before the houses and the alleys behind them  nearly all the houses had vegetable gardens and some of them had flowergardens that appeared princelier pleasaunces to my boy than he has ever seen since in europe or america very likely they were not so vast or so splendid as they looked to him then but one of them at least had beds of tulips and nasturtiums and borders of flags and pinks with clumps of tigerlilies and hollyhocks and in the grassy yard beside it there were high bushes full of snowballs and rosetrees with mossroses on them in this superb domain there were two summerhouses and a shed where beehives stood at the end of the garden was a bathhouse and you could have a showerbath if you were of a mind to bring the water for it from the pump in the barnyard but this was all on a scale of unequalled magnificence and most of the houses which were mostly of wood just had a good big yard with plumtrees and cherrytrees in it and a vegetable garden at one side that the boy hated to weed my boys grandfather had a large and beautiful garden with long arbors of grapes in it that the old gentleman trimmed and cared for himself they were delicious grapes and there were black currants which the grandfather liked because he had liked them when he was a boy himself in the old country but which no boys town boy could have been induced to take as a gracious gift another boy had a father that had a greenhouse he was a boy that would let you pull pieplant in the garden and would bring out sugar to let you eat it with in the greenhouse his cleverness was rewarded when his father was elected governor of the state and what made it so splendid was that his father was a whig  every house whether it had a flowergarden or not had a woodshed which was the place where a boy mostly received his friends and made his kites and wagons and laid his plots and plans for all the failures of his life the other boys waited in the woodshed when he went in to ask his mother whether he might do this or that or go somewhere a boy always wanted to have a stove in the woodshed and fit it up for himself but his mother would not let him because he would have been certain to set the house on fire  each fellow knew the inside of his own house tolerably well but seldom the inside of another fellows house and he knew the backyard better than the frontyard if he entered the house of a friend at all it was to wait for him by the kitchendoor or to get up to the garret with him by the kitchenstairs if he sometimes and by some rare mischance found himself in the livingrooms or the parlor he was very unhappy and anxious to get out yet those interiors were not of an oppressive grandeur and one was much like another the parlor had what was called a floweredcarpet or gay pattern of ingrain on its floor and the other rooms had ragcarpets woven by some woman who had a loom for the work and dyed at home with such native tints as butternut and foreign colors as logwood the rooms were all heated with fireplaces where wood was burned and coal was never seen they were lit at night with tallowcandles which were mostly made by the housewife herself or by lardoil glass lamps in the winter the oil would get so stiff with the cold that it had to be thawed out at the fire before the lamp would burn there was no such thing as a hotair furnace known and the fire on the hearth was kept over from day to day all winter long by covering a log at night with ashes in the morning it would be a bed of coals there were no fires in bedrooms or at least not in a boys bedroom and sometimes he had to break the ice in his pitcher before he could wash it did not take him very long to dress  i have said that they burned wood for heating in the boys town but my boy could remember one winter when they burned ears of corn in the printingoffice stove because it was cheaper i believe they still sometimes burn corn in the west when they are too far from a market to sell it at a paying price but it always seems a sin and a shame that in a state pretending to be civilized food should ever be destroyed when so many are hungry when one hears of such things one would almost think that boys could make a better state than this of the men     xx  traits and characters   in the boys town a great many men gave nearly their whole time to the affairs of the state and did hardly anything but talk politics all day they even sat up late at night to do it among these politicians the whigs were sacred in my boys eyes but the democrats appeared like enemies of the human race and one of the strangest things that ever happened to him was to find his father associating with men who came out of the democratic party at the time he left the whig party and joining with them in a common cause against both but when he understood what a good cause it was and came to sing songs against slavery he was reconciled though he still regarded the whig politicians as chief among the great ones if not the good ones of the earth when he passed one of them on the street he held his breath for awe till he got by which was not always so very soon for sometimes a whig statesman wanted the whole sidewalk to himself and it was hard to get by him there were other people in that town who wanted the whole sidewalk and these were the professional drunkards whom the boys regarded as the keystones if not cornerstones of the social edifice there were three or four of them and the boys held them all rich and poor alike in a deep interest if not respect as persons of peculiar distinction i do not think any boy realized the tragedy of those hopeless wasted slavish lives the boys followed the wretched creatures at a safe distance and plagued them and ran whenever one of them turned and threatened them that was because the boys had not the experience to enable them to think rightly or to think at all about such things or to know what images of perdition they had before their eyes and when they followed them and teased them they did not know they were joining like fiends in the torment of lost souls some of the towndrunkards were the outcasts of good homes which they had desolated and some had merely destroyed in themselves that hope of any home which is the light of heaven in every human heart but from time to time a good man held out a helping hand to one of them and gave him the shelter of his roof and tried to reclaim him then the boys saw him going about the streets pale and tremulous in a secondhand suit of his benefactors clothes and fighting hard against the tempter that beset him on every side in that town and then some day they saw him dead drunk in a fence corner and they did not understand how seven devils worse than the first had entered in the place which had been swept and garnished for them  besides the towndrunkards there were other persons in whom the boys were interested like the two or three dandies whom their splendor in dress had given a public importance in a community of carelessly dressed men then there were certain genteel loafers young men of good families who hung about the principal hotel and whom the boys believed to be fighters of singular prowess far below these in the social scale the boys had yet other heroes such as the dumb negro and his family between these and the white people among whom the boys knew of no distinctions they were aware that there was an impassable gulf and it would not be easy to give a notion of just the sort of consideration in which they held them but they held the dumb negro himself in almost superstitious regard as one who though a deafmute knew everything that was going on and could make you understand anything he wished he was in fact a master of most eloquent pantomime he had gestures that could not be mistaken and he had a graphic dumbshow for persons and occupations and experiences that was delightfully vivid for a dentist he gave an upward twist of the hand from his jaw and uttered a howl which left no doubt that he meant toothpulling and for what would happen to a boy if he kept on misbehaving he crossed his fingers before his face and looked through them in a way that brought the jailwindow clearly before the eyes of the offender  the boys knew vaguely that his family helped runaway slaves on their way north and in a community that was for the most part bitterly proslavery these negroes were held in a sort of respect for their courageous fidelity to their race the men were swarthy handsome fellows not much darker than spaniards and they were so little afraid of the chances which were often such fatal mischances to colored people in that day that one of them travelled through the south and passed himself in very good company as a cherokee indian of rank and education  as far as the boys knew the civic affairs of the place were transacted entirely by two constables of mayors and magistrates such as there must have been they knew nothing and they had not the least notion what the whigs whom they were always trying to elect were to do when they got into office they knew that the constables were both democrats but if they thought at all about the fact they thought their democracy the natural outcome of their dark constabulary nature and by no means imagined that they were constables because they were democrats the worse of the two or the more merciless was also the towncrier whose office is now not anywhere known in america i believe though i heard a towncrier in a swiss village not many years ago in the boys town the crier carried a goodsized bell when he started out he rang it till he reached the street corner and then he stopped and began some such proclamation as o yes o yes o yes there will be an auction this evening at early candlelight at brown  robinsons store dry goods boots and shoes hats and caps hardware queens ware and so forth and so forth richard roe auctioneer come one come all come everybody then the crier rang his bell and went on to the next corner where he repeated his proclamation after a while the constable got a deputy to whom he made over his business of towncrier this deputy was no other than that reckless boy who used to run out from the printingoffice and shoot the turtledoves and he decorated his proclamation with quips and quirks of his own invention and with personal allusions to his employer who was auctioneer as well as constable but though he was hailfellow with every boy in town and although every boy rejoiced in his impudence he was so panoplied in the awfulness of his relation to the constabulary functions that however remote it was no boy would have thought of trifling with him when he was on duty if ever a boy holloed something at him when he was out with his criers bell he turned and ran as hard as he could and as if from the constable himself  the boys knew just one other official and that was the gauger whom they watched at a respectful distance when they found him employed with his mysterious instruments gauging the whiskey in the long rows of barrels on the basin bank they did not know what the process was and i own that i do not know to this day what it was my boy watched him with the rest and once he ventured upon a bold and reckless act he had so long heard that it was whiskey which made people drunk that at last the notion came to have an irresistible fascination for him and he determined to risk everything even life itself to know what whiskey was like as soon as the gauger had left them he ran up to one of the barrels where he had seen a few drops fall from his instrument when he lifted it from the bunghole and plunged the tip of his little finger into the whiskey and then put it to his tongue he expected to become drunk instantly if not to end a towndrunkard there on the spot but the whiskey only tasted very disgusting and he was able to get home without help still i would not advise any other boy to run the risk he took in this desperate experiment  there was a time not long after that when he really did get drunk but it was not with whiskey one morning after a rain when the boys were having fun in one of those open canalboats with the loose planks which the overnight shower had set afloat a fellow came up and said he had got some tobacco that was the best kind to learn to chew with every boy who expected to be anything in the world expected to chew tobacco for all the packetdrivers chewed and it seemed to my boy that his father and grandfather and uncles were about the only people who did not chew if they had only smoked it would have been something but they did not even smoke and the boy felt that he had a long arrears of manliness to bring up and that he should have to retrieve his family in spite of itself from the shame of not using tobacco in any form he knew that his father abhorred it but he had never been explicitly forbidden to smoke or chew for his father seldom forbade him anything explicitly and he gave himself such freedom of choice in the matter that when the boy with the tobacco began to offer it around he judged it right to take a chew with the rest the boy said it was a peculiar kind of tobacco and was known as molassestobacco because it was so sweet the other boys did not ask how he came to know its name or where he got it boys never ask anything that it would be well for them to know but they accepted his theory and his further statement that it was of a mildness singularly adapted to learners without misgiving the boy was himself chewing vigorously on a large quid and launching the juice from his lips right and left like a grown person and my boy took as large a bite as his benefactor bade him he found it as sweet as he had been told it was and he acknowledged the aptness of its name of molassestobacco it seemed to him a golden opportunity to acquire a noble habit on easy terms he let the quid rest in his cheek as he had seen men do when he was not crushing it between his teeth and for some moments he poled his plank up and down the canalboat with a sense of triumph that nothing marred then all of a sudden he began to feel pale the boat seemed to be going round and the sky wheeling overhead the sun was dodging about very strangely drops of sweat burst from the boys forehead he let fall his pole and said that he thought he would go home the fellow who gave him the tobacco began to laugh and the other fellows to mock but my boy did not mind them somehow he did not know how he got out of the canalboat and started homeward but at every step the ground rose as high as his knees before him and then when he got his foot high enough and began to put it down the ground was not there he was deathly sick as he reeled and staggered on and when he reached home and showed himself white and haggard to his frightened mother he had scarcely strength to gasp out a confession of his attempt to retrieve the family honor by learning to chew tobacco in another moment nature came to his relief and then he fell into a deep sleep which lasted the whole afternoon so that it seemed to him the next day when he woke up glad to find himself alive if not so very lively perhaps he had swallowed some of the poisonous juice of the tobacco perhaps it had acted upon his brain without that his father made no very close inquiry into the facts and he did not forbid him the use of tobacco it was not necessary in that one little experiment he had got enough for a whole lifetime it shows that after all a boy is not so hard to satisfy in everything  there were some people who believed that tobacco would keep off the feverandague which was so common then in that country or at any rate that it was good for the toothache in spite of the tobacco there were few houses where ague was not a familiar guest however unwelcome if the family was large there was usually a chill every day one had it one day and another the next so that there was no lapse this was the case in my boys family after they moved to the faulkner house which was near the basin and its watersoaked banks but they accepted the ague as something quite in the course of nature and duly broke it up with quinine some of the boys had chills at school and sometimes after they had been in swimming they would wait round on the bank till a fellow had his chill out and then they would all go off together and forget about it the next day that fellow would be as well as any one the third day his chill would come on again but he did not allow it to interfere with his business or pleasure and after a while the ague would seem to get tired of it and give up altogether that strange earthspirit who was my boys friend simply beat the ague as it were on its own ground he preferred a sunny spot to have his chill in a cosy fencecorner or a warm back doorstep or the like but as for the fever that followed the chill he took no account of it whatever or at least made no provision for it  the miasm which must have filled the air of the place from so many natural and artificial bodies of fresh water showed itself in low fevers which were not so common as ague but common enough the only long sickness that my boy could remember was intermittent fever which seemed to last many weeks and which was a kind of bewilderment rather than a torment when it was beginning he appeared to glide down the stairs at school without touching the steps with his feet and afterwards his chief trouble was in not knowing when he slept whether he had really been asleep or not but there was rich compensation for this mild suffering in the affectionate petting which a sick boy always gets from his mother when his malady takes him from his rough little world and gives him back helpless to her tender arms again then she makes everything in the house yield to him none of the others are allowed to tease him or cross him in the slightest thing they have to walk lightly and when he is going to sleep if they come into the room they have got to speak in a whisper she sits by his bed and fans him she smooths the pillow and turns its cool side up under his hot and aching head she cooks dainty dishes to tempt his sick appetite and brings them to him herself she is so good and kind and loving that he cannot help having some sense of it all and feeling how much better she is than anything on earth his little ruffian world drifts far away from him he hears the yells and shouts of the boys in the street without a pang of envy or longing in his weakness his helplessness he becomes a gentle and innocent child again and heaven descends to him out of his mothers heart     xxi  last days   i have already told that my boys father would not support general taylor the whig candidate for president because he believed him as the hero of a proslavery war to be a friend of slavery at this time he had a large family of little children and he had got nothing beyond a comfortable living from the newspaper which he had published for eight years if he must give that up he must begin life anew heavily burdened perhaps he thought it need not come to his giving up his paper that somehow affairs might change but his newspaper would have gone to nothing in his hands if he had tried to publish it as a free soil paper after the election of the whig candidate so he sold it and began to cast about for some other business how anxiously my boy was too young to know he only felt the relief that the whole family felt for a while at getting out of the printing business the boys wanted to go into almost anything else the drugbusiness or farming or a papermill or anything the elder brother knew all the anxiety of the time and shared it fully with the mother whose acquiescence in what the father thought right was more than patient she abode courageously in the suspense the uncertainty of the time and she hoped for something from the fathers endeavors in the different ways he turned at one time there was much talk in the family of using the fibre of a common weed in making paper which he thought he could introduce perhaps it was the milkweed but he could not manage it somehow and after a year of inaction he decided to go into another newspaper by this time the boys had made their peace with the printing business and the father had made his with the whig party he had done what it must have been harder to do than to stand out against it he had publicly owned that he was mistaken in regard to taylor who had not become the tool of the slaveholders but had obeyed the highest instincts of the party and served the interests of freedom though he was himself a slaveholder and the hero of an unjust war  it was then too late however for the father to have got back his old newspaper even if he had wished and the children heard with the elation that novelty brings to all children old or young that they were going away from the boys town to live in another place it was a much larger place and was even considered a city though it was not comparable to cincinnati so long the only known city in the world  my boy was twelve years old by that time and was already a swift compositor though he was still so small that he had to stand on a chair to reach the case in setting type on taylors inaugural message but what he lacked in stature he made up in gravity of demeanor and he got the name of the old man from the printers as soon as he began to come about the office which he did almost as soon as he could walk his first attempt in literature an essay on the vain and disappointing nature of human life he set up and printed off himself in his sixth or seventh year and the printingoffice was in some sort his home as well as his school his university he could no more remember learning to set type than he could remember learning to read and in afterlife he could not come within smell of the ink the dusty types the humid paper of a printingoffice without that tender swelling of the heart which so fondly responds to any memorybearing perfume his youth his boyhood almost his infancy came back to him in it he now looked forward eagerly to helping on the new paper and somewhat proudly to living in the larger place the family were going to the moment it was decided he began to tell the boys that he was going to live in a city and he felt that it gave him distinction he had nothing but joy in it and he did not dream that as the time drew near it could be sorrow but when it came at last and he was to leave the house the town the boys he found himself deathly homesick the parting days were days of gloom the parting was an anguish of bitter tears nothing consoled him but the fact that they were going all the way to the new place in a canalboat which his father chartered for the trip my boy and his brother had once gone to cincinnati in a canalboat with a friendly captain of their acquaintance and though they were both put to sleep in a berth so narrow that when they turned they fell out on the floor the glory of the adventure remained with him and he could have thought of nothing more delightful than such another voyage the household goods were piled up in the middle of the boat and the family had a cabin forward which seemed immense to the children they played in it and ran races up and down the long canalboat roof where their father and mother sometimes put their chairs and sat to admire the scenery  as my boy could remember very few incidents of this voyage afterwards i dare say he spent a great part of it with his face in a book and was aware of the landscape only from time to time when he lifted his eyes from the story he was reading that was apt to be the way with him and before he left the boys town the world within claimed him more and more he ceased to be that eager comrade he had once been sometimes he left his book with a sigh and he saw much of the outer world through a veil of fancies quivering like an autumn haze between him and its realities softening their harsh outlines and giving them a fairy coloring i think he would sometimes have been better employed in looking directly at them but he had to live his own life and i cannot live it over for him the season was the one of all others best fitted to win him to the earth and in a measure it did it was spring and along the towpath strutted the large glossy blackbirds which had just come back and made the boys sick with longing to kill them they offered such good shots but the boys had no powder with them and at any rate the captain would not have stopped his boat which was rushing on at the rate of two miles an hour to let them pick up a bird if they had hit it they were sufficiently provisioned without the game however the mother had baked bread and boiled a ham and provided sugarcakes in recognition of the holiday character of the voyage and they had the use of the boat cookingstove for their tea and coffee the boys had to content themselves with such sense of adventure as they could get out of going ashore when the boat was passing through the locks or staying aboard and seeing the water burst and plunge in around the boat they had often watched this thrilling sight at the first lock but it had a novel interest now as their boat approached the lock the lower gates were pushed open by men who set their breasts to the long sweeps or handles of the gates and when the boat was fairly inside of the stonewalled lock they were closed behind her then the upper gates which opened against the dull current and were kept shut by its pressure were opened a little and the waters rushed and roared into the lock and began to lift the boat the gates were opened wider and wider till the waters poured a heavy cataract into the lock where the boat tossed on their increasing volume and at last calmed themselves to the level within then the boat passed out through the upper gates on even water and the voyage to the next lock began at first it was rather awful and the little children were always afraid when they came to a lock but the boys enjoyed it after the first time they would have liked to take turns driving the pair of horses that drew the boat but it seemed too bold a wish and i think they never proposed it they did not ask either to relieve the man at the helm  they arrived safely at their journeys end without any sort of accident they had made the whole forty miles in less than two days and were all as well as when they started without having suffered for a moment from seasickness the boat drew up at the towpath just before the stable belonging to the house which the father had already taken and the whole family at once began helping the crew put the things ashore the boys thought it would have been a splendid stable to keep the pony in only they had sold the pony but they saw in an instant that it would do for a circus as soon as they could get acquainted with enough boys to have one  the strangeness of the house and street and the necessity of meeting the boys of the neighborhood and paying with his person for his standing among them kept my boy interested for a time and he did not realize at first how much he missed the boys town and all the familiar fellowships there and all the manifold privileges of the place then he began to be very homesick and to be torn with the torment of a divided love his mother whom he loved so dearly so tenderly was here and wherever she was that was home and yet home was yonder far off at the end of those forty inexorable miles where he had left his lifelong mates the first months there was a dumb heartache at the bottom of every pleasure and excitement there were many excitements not the least of which was the excitement of helping get out a triweekly and then a daily newspaper instead of the weekly that his father had published in the boys town then that dear friend of his brother and himself the apprentice who knew all about monte cristo came to work with them and live with them again and that was a great deal but he did not bring the boys town with him and when they each began to write a new historical romance the thought of the beloved scenes amidst which they had planned their first was a pang that nothing could assuage during the summer the cholera came the milkman though naturally a cheerful person said that the people around where he lived were dying off like flies and the funerals three and four five and six ten and twelve a day passed before the door and all the brooding horror of the pestilence sank deep into the boys morbid soul then he fell sick of the cholera himself and though it was a mild attack he lay in the valley of the shadow of death while it lasted and waited the worst with such terror that when he kept asking her if he should get well his mother tried to reason with him and to coax him out of his fear was he afraid to die she asked him when he knew that heaven was so much better and he would be in the care of such love as never could come to him on earth he could only gasp back that he was afraid to die and she could only turn from reconciling him with the other world to assuring him that he was in no danger of leaving this  i sometimes think that if parents would deal rightly and truly with children about death from the beginning some of the fear of it might be taken away it seems to me that it is partly because death is hushed up and ignored between them that it rests such a burden on the soul but if children were told as soon as they are old enough that death is a part of nature and not a calamitous accident they would be somewhat strengthened to meet it my boy had been taught that this world was only an illusion a shadow thrown from the real world beyond and no doubt his father and mother believed what they taught him but he had always seen them anxious to keep the illusion and in his turn he clung to the vain shadow with all the force of his being  he got well of the cholera but not of the homesickness and after a while he was allowed to revisit the boys town it could only have been three or four months after he had left it but it already seemed a very long time and he figured himself returning as stageheroes do to the scenes of their childhood after an absence of some fifteen years he fancied that if the boys did not find him grown they would find him somehow changed and that he would dazzle them with the light accumulated by his residence in a city he was going to stay with his grandmother and he planned to make a long stay for he was very fond of her and he liked the quiet and comfort of her pleasant house he must have gone back by the canalpacket but his memory kept no record of the fact and afterwards he knew only of having arrived and of searching about in a ghostly fashion for his old comrades they may have been at school at any rate he found very few of them and with them he was certainly strange enough too strange even they received him with a kind of surprise and they could not begin playing together at once in the old way he went to all the places that were so dear to him but he felt in them the same kind of refusal or reluctance that he felt in the boys his heart began to ache again he did not quite know why only it ached when he went up from his grandmothers to look at the faulkner house he realized that it was no longer home and he could not bear the sight of it there were other people living in it strange voices sounded from the open doors strange faces peered from the windows  he came back to his grandmothers bruised and defeated and spent the morning indoors reading after dinner he went out again and hunted up that queer earthspirit who had been so long and closely his only friend he at least was not changed he was as unwashed and as unkempt as ever but he seemed shy of my poor boy he had probably never been shaken hands with in his life before he dropped my boys hand and they stood looking at each other not knowing what to say my boy had on his best clothes which he wore so as to affect the boys town boys with the full splendor of a city boy after all he was not so very splendid but his presence altogether was too much for the earthspirit and he vanished out of his consciousness like an apparition  after school was out in the afternoon he met more of the boys but none of them knew just what to do with him the place that he had once had in their lives was filled he was an outsider who might be suffered among them but he was no longer of them he did not understand this at once nor well know what hurt him but something was gone that could not be called back something lost that could not be found  at teatime his grandfather came home and gravely made him welcome the uncle who was staying with them was jovially kind but a heavy homesickness weighed down the childs heart which now turned from the boys town as longingly as it had turned towards it before  they all knelt down with the grandfather before they went to the table there had been a good many deaths from cholera during the day and the grandfather prayed for grace and help amidst the pestilence that walketh in darkness and wasteth at noonday in such a way that the boy felt there would be very little of either for him unless he got home at once all through the meal that followed he was trying to find the courage to say that he must go home when he managed to say it his grandmother and aunt tried to comfort and coax him and his uncle tried to shame him out of his homesickness to joke it off to make him laugh but his grandfathers tender heart was moved he could not endure the childs mute misery he said he must go home if he wished  in half an hour the boy was on the canalpacket speeding homeward at the highest pace of the threehorse team and the boys town was out of sight he could not sleep for excitement that night and he came and spent the time talking on quite equal terms with the steersman one of the canalers whom he had admired afar in earlier and simpler days he found him a very amiable fellow by no means haughty who began to tell him funny stories and who even let him take the helm for a while the rudderhandle was of polished iron very different from the clumsy wooden affair of a freightboat and the packet made in a single night the distance which the boys family had been nearly two days in travelling when they moved away from the boys town  he arrived home for breakfast a travelled and experienced person and wholly cured of that longing for his former home that had tormented him before he revisited its scenes he now fully gave himself up to his new environment and looked forward and not backward i do not mean to say that he ceased to love the boys town that he could not do and never did but he became more and more aware that the past was gone from him forever and that he could not return to it he did not forget it but cherished its memories the more fondly for that reason  there was no bitterness in it and no harm that he could not hope would easily be forgiven him he had often been foolish and sometimes he had been wicked but he had never been such a little fool or such a little sinner but he had wished for more sense and more grace there are some great fools and great sinners who try to believe in afterlife that they are the manlier men because they have been silly and mischievous boys but he has never believed that he is glad to have had a boyhood fully rounded out with all a boys interests and pleasures and he is glad that his lines were cast in the boys town but he knows or believes he knows that whatever is good in him now came from what was good in him then and he is sure that the town was delightful chiefly because his home in it was happy the town was small and the boys there were hemmed in by their inexperience and ignorance but the simple home was large with vistas that stretched to the ends of the earth and it was serenely bright with a fathers reason and warm with a mothers love   the end
