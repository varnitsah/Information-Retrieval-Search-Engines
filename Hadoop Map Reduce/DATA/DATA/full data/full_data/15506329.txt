fact        as this tell tale was told us      william tell     chapter i   once upon a time more years ago than anybody can remember before the first hotel had been built or the first englishman had taken a photograph of mont blanc and brought it home to be pasted in an album and shown after tea to his envious friends switzerland belonged to the emperor of austria to do what he liked with  one of the first things the emperor did was to send his friend hermann gessler to govern the country gessler was not a nice man and it soon became plain that he would never make himself really popular with the swiss the point on which they disagreed in particular was the question of taxes the swiss who were a simple and thrifty people objected to paying taxes of any sort they said they wanted to spend their money on all kinds of other things gessler on the other hand wished to put a tax on everything and being governor he did it he made everyone who owned a flock of sheep pay a certain sum of money to him and if the farmer sold his sheep and bought cows he had to pay rather more money to gessler for the cows than he had paid for the sheep gessler also taxed bread and biscuits and jam and buns and lemonade and in fact everything he could think of till the people of switzerland determined to complain they appointed walter fürst who had red hair and looked fierce werner stauffacher who had gray hair and was always wondering how he ought to pronounce his name and arnold of melchthal who had lightyellow hair and was supposed to know a great deal about the law to make the complaint they called on the governor one lovely morning in april and were shown into the hall of audience  well said gessler and whats the matter now  the other two pushed walter fürst forward because he looked fierce and they thought he might frighten the governor  walter fürst coughed  well asked gessler  erahem said walter fürst  thats the way whispered werner give it him  erahem said walter fürst again the fact is your governorship  its a small point interrupted gessler but im generally called your excellency yes  the fact is your excellency it seems to the people of switzerland  whom i represent whispered arnold of melchthal  whom i represent that things want changing  what things inquired gessler  the taxes your excellent governorship  change the taxes why dont the people of switzerland think there are enough taxes  arnold of melchthal broke in hastily  they think there are many too many he said what with the tax on sheep and the tax on cows and the tax on bread and the tax on tea and the tax  i know i know gessler interrupted i know all the taxes come to the point what about em  well your excellency there are too many of them  too many  yes and we are not going to put up with it any longer shouted arnold of melchthal  gessler leaned forward in his throne  might i ask you to repeat that remark he said  we are not going to put up with it any longer  gessler sat back again with an ugly smile  oh he saidoh indeed you arent arent you desire the lord high executioner to step this way he added to a soldier who stood beside him  the lord high executioner entered the presence he was a kindlooking old gentleman with white hair and he wore a beautiful black robe tastefully decorated with deathsheads  your excellency sent for me he said  just so replied gessler this gentleman herehe pointed to arnold of melchthalsays he does not like taxes and that he isnt going to put up with them any longer  tuttut murmured the executioner  see what you can do for him  certainly your excellency robert he cried is the oil on the boil  just this minute boiled over replied a voice from the other side of the door  then bring it in and mind you dont spill any  enter robert in a suit of armour and a black mask carrying a large caldron from which the steam rose in great clouds  now sir if you please said the executioner politely to arnold of melchthal  arnold looked at the caldron  why its hot he said  warmish admitted the executioner  its against the law to threaten a man with hot oil  illustration plate i  you may bring an action against me said the executioner now sir if you please we are wasting time the forefinger of your left hand if i may trouble you thank you i am obliged  he took arnolds left hand and dipped the tip of the first finger into the oil  ow cried arnold jumping  dont let him see hes hurting you whispered werner stauffacher pretend you dont notice it  gessler leaned forward again  have your views on taxes changed at all he asked do you see my point of view more clearly now  arnold admitted that he thought that after all there might be something to be said for it  thats right said the governor and the tax on sheep you dont object to that  no  and the tax on cows  i like it  and those on bread and buns and lemonade  i enjoy them  excellent in fact youre quite contented  quite  and you think the rest of the people are  oh quite quite  and do you think the same he asked of walter and werner  oh yes your excellency they cried  then thats all right said gessler i was sure you would be sensible about it now if you will kindly place in the tambourine which the gentleman on my left is presenting to you a mere trifle to compensate us for our trouble in giving you an audience and if you to arnold of melchthal will contribute an additional trifle for use of the imperial boiling oil i think we shall all be satisfied youve done it thats right goodbye and mind the step as you go out  and as he finished this speech the three spokesmen of the people of switzerland were shown out of the hall of audience     chapter ii   they were met in the street outside by a large body of their fellowcitizens who had accompanied them to the palace and who had been spending the time since their departure in listening by turns at the keyhole of the frontdoor but as the hall of audience was at the other side of the palace and cut off from the frontdoor by two other doors a flight of stairs and a long passage they had not heard very much of what had gone on inside and they surrounded the three spokesmen as they came out and questioned them eagerly  has he taken off the tax on jam asked ulric the smith  what is he going to do about the tax on mixed biscuits shouted klaus von der flue who was a chimneysweep of the town and loved mixed biscuits  never mind about tea and mixed biscuits cried his neighbour meier of sarnen what i want to know is whether we shall have to pay for keeping sheep any more  what did the governor say asked jost weiler a practical man who liked to go straight to the point  the three spokesmen looked at one another a little doubtfully  weell said werner stauffacher at last as a matter of fact he didnt actually say very much it was more what he did if you understand me than what he said  i should describe his excellency the governor said walter fürst as a man who has got a way with hima man who has got all sorts of arguments at his fingertips  at the mention of fingertips arnold of melchthal uttered a sharp howl  in short continued walter after a few minutes very interesting conversation he made us see that it really wouldnt do and that we must go on paying the taxes as before  there was a dead silence for several minutes while everybody looked at everybody else in dismay  the silence was broken by arnold of sewa arnold of sewa had been disappointed at not being chosen as one of the three spokesmen and he thought that if he had been so chosen all this trouble would not have occurred  the fact is he said bitterly that you three have failed to do what you were sent to do i mention no namesfar from itbut i dont mind saying that there are some people in this town who would have given a better account of themselves what you want in little matters of this sort is if i may say so tact tact thats what you want of course if you will go rushing into the governors presence  but we didnt rush said walter fürst  shouting out that you want the taxes abolished  but we didnt shout said walter fürst  i really cannot speak if i am to be constantly interrupted said arnold of sewa severely what i say is that you ought to employ tact tact thats what you want if i had been chosen to represent the swiss people in this affairi am not saying i ought to have been mind you i merely say if i had beeni should have acted rather after the following fashion walking firmly but not defiantly into the tyrants presence i should have broken the ice with some pleasant remark about the weather the conversation once started the rest would have been easy i should have said that i hoped his excellency had enjoyed a good dinner once on the subject of food and it would have been the simplest of tasks to show him how unnecessary taxes on food were and the whole affair would have been pleasantly settled while you waited i do not imply that the swiss people would have done better to have chosen me as their representative i merely say that that is how i should have acted had they done so  and arnold of sewa twirled his moustache and looked offended his friends instantly suggested that he should be allowed to try where the other three had failed and the rest of the crowd beginning to hope once more took up the cry the result was that the visitors bell of the palace was rung for the second time arnold of sewa went in and the door was banged behind him  five minutes later he came out sucking the first finger of his left hand  no he said it cant be done the tyrant has convinced me  i knew he would said arnold of melchthal  then i think you might have warned me snapped arnold of sewa dancing with the pain of his burnt finger  was it hot  boiling  ah  then he really wont let us off the taxes asked the crowd in disappointed voices  no  then the long and short of it is said walter fürst drawing a deep breath that we must rebel  rebel cried everybody  rebel repeated walter firmly  we will cried everybody  down with the tyrant shouted walter fürst  down with the taxes shrieked the crowd  a scene of great enthusiasm followed the last words were spoken by werner stauffacher  we want a leader he said  i dont wish to thrust myself forward began arnold of sewa but i must say if it comes to leading  and i know the very man for the job said werner stauffacher william tell  hurrah for william tell roared the crowd and taking the time from werner stauffacher they burst into the grand old swiss chant which runs as follows       for hes a jolly good fellow       for hes a jolly good fellow       for hes a jolly good feellow       and so say all of us  and having sung this till they were all quite hoarse they went off to their beds to get a few hours sleep before beginning the labours of the day     chapter iii   in a picturesque little châlet high up in the mountains covered with snow and edelweiss which is a flower that grows in the alps and you are not allowed to pick it dwelt william tell his wife hedwig and his two sons walter and william such a remarkable man was tell that i think i must devote a whole chapter to him and his exploits there was really nothing he could not do he was the best shot with the crossbow in the whole of switzerland he had the courage of a lion the surefootedness of a wild goat the agility of a squirrel and a beautiful beard if you wanted someone to hurry across desolate icefields and leap from crag to crag after a chamois tell was the man for your money if you wanted a man to say rude things to the governor it was to tell that you applied first once when he was hunting in the wild ravine of schächenthal where men were hardly ever to be seen he met the governor face to face there was no way of getting past on one side the rocky wall rose sheer up while below the river roared directly gessler caught sight of tell striding along with his crossbow his cheeks grew pale and his knees tottered and he sat down on a rock feeling very unwell indeed  aha said tell oho so its you is it i know you and a nice sort of person you are with your taxes on bread and sheep arent you youll come to a bad end one of these days thats what will happen to you oh you old reprobate pooh and he had passed on with a look of scorn leaving gessler to think over what he had said and gessler ever since had had a grudge against him and was only waiting for a chance of paying him out  mark my words said tells wife hedwig when her husband told her about it after supper that nightmark my words he will never forgive you  i will avoid him said tell he will not seek me  well mind you do was hedwigs reply  on another occasion when the governors soldiers were chasing a friend of his called baumgarten and when baumgartens only chance of escape was to cross the lake during a fierce storm and when the ferryman sensibly remarking what must i rush into the jaws of death no man that hath his senses would do that refused to take out his boat even for twice his proper fare and when the soldiers rode down to seize their prey with dreadful shouts tell jumped into the boat and rowing with all his might brought his friend safe across after a choppy passage which made gessler the governor still more angry with him  but it was as a marksman that tell was so extraordinary there was nobody in the whole of the land who was half so skilful he attended every meeting for miles around where there was a shooting competition and every time he won first prize even his rivals could not help praising his skill behold they would say tell is quite the pothunter meaning by the last word a man who always went in for every prize and always won it and tell would say yes truly am i a pothunter for i hunt to fill the family pot and so he did he never came home emptyhanded from the chase sometimes it was a chamois that he brought back and then the family had it roasted on the first day cold on the next four and minced on the sixth with sippets of toast round the edge of the dish sometimes it was only a bird as on the cover of this book and then hedwig would say mark my words this fowl will not go round but it always did and it never happened that there was not even a fowl to eat  illustration frontispiece  in fact tell and his family lived a very happy contented life in spite of the governor gessler and his taxes  tell was very patriotic he always believed that some day the swiss would rise and rebel against the tyranny of the governor and he used to drill his two children so as to keep them always in a state of preparation they would march about beating tin cans and shouting and altogether enjoying themselves immensely though hedwig who did not like noise and wanted walter and william to help her with the housework made frequent complaints mark my words she would say this growing spirit of militarism in the young and foolish will lead to no good meaning that boys who played at soldiers instead of helping their mother to dust the chairs and scrub the kitchen floor would in all probability come to a bad end but tell would say who hopes to fight his way through life must be prepared to wield arms carry on my boys and they carried on it was to this man that the swiss people had determined to come for help  illustration plate ii     chapter iv   talking matters over in the inn of the town the glass and glacier the citizens came to the conclusion that they ought to appoint three spokesmen to go and explain to tell just what they wanted him to do  i dont wish to seem to boast at all said arnold of sewa but i think i had better be one of the three  i was thinking said werner stauffacher that it would be a pity always to be chopping and changing why not choose the same three as were sent to gessler  i dont desire to be unpleasant at all replied arnold of sewa but i must be forgiven for reminding the honourable gentleman who has just spoken that he and his equally honourable friends did not meet with the best of success when they called upon the governor  well and you didnt either snapped arnold of melchthal whose finger still hurt him and made him a little badtempered  that said arnold of sewa i put down entirely to the fact that you and your friends by not exercising tact irritated the governor and made him unwilling to listen to anybody else nothing is more important in these affairs than tact thats what you wanttact but have it your own way dont mind me  and the citizens did not they chose werner stauffacher arnold of melchthal and walter fürst and having drained their glasses the three trudged up the steep hill which led to tells house  it had been agreed that everyone should wait at the glass and glacier until the three spokesmen returned in order that they might hear the result of their mission everybody was very anxious a revolution without tell would be quite impossible and it was not unlikely that tell might refuse to be their leader the worst of a revolution is that if it fails the leader is always executed as an example to the rest and many people object to being executed however much it may set a good example to their friends on the other hand tell was a brave man and a patriot and might be only too eager to try to throw off the tyrants yoke whatever the risk they had waited about an hour when they saw the three spokesmen coming down the hill tell was not with them a fact which made the citizens suspect that he had refused their offer the first thing a man does when he has accepted the leadership of a revolution is to come and plot with his companions  well said everybody eagerly as the three arrived  werner stauffacher shook his head  ah said arnold of sewa i see what it is he has refused you didnt exercise tact and he refused  we did exercise tact said stauffacher indignantly but he would not be persuaded it was like this we went to the house and knocked at the door tell opened it goodmorning i said  goodmorning said he take a seat  i took a seat  my heart is full i said and longs to speak with you i thought that a neat way of putting it  the company murmured approval  a heavy heart said tell will not grow light with words  not bad that murmured jost weiler clever way of putting things tell has got  yet words i said might lead us on to deeds  neat said jost weilervery neat yes  to which tells extraordinary reply was the only thing to do is to sit still  what i said bear in silence things unbearable  yes said tell to peaceable men peace is gladly granted when the governor finds that his oppression does not make us revolt he will grow tired of oppressing  and what did you say to that asked ulric the smith  i said he did not know the governor if he thought he could ever grow tired of oppressing we might do much i said if we held fast together union is strength i said  the strong said tell is strongest when he stands alone  then our country must not count on thee i said when in despair she stands on selfdefence  oh well he said hardly that perhaps i dont want to desert you what i mean to say is im no use as a plotter or a counsellor and that sort of thing where i come out strong is in deeds so dont invite me to your meetings and make me speak and that sort of thing but if you want a man to do anythingwhy thats where i shall come in you see just write if you want mea postcard will doand you will not find william tell hanging back no sir and with those words he showed us out  well said jost weiler i call that encouraging all we have to do now is to plot let us plot  yes lets shouted everybody  ulric the smith rapped for silence on the table  gentlemen he said our friend mr klaus von der flue will now read a paper on governorstheir drawbacks and how to get rid of them silence gentlemen please now then klaus old fellow speak up and get it over  and the citizens settled down without further delay to a little serious plotting     chapter v   a few days after this hedwig gave tell a good talking to on the subject of his love for adventure he was sitting at the door of his house mending an axe hedwig as usual was washing up walter and william were playing with a little crossbow not far off  father said walter  yes my boy  my bowstring has bust bust was what all swiss boys said when they meant broken  you must mend it yourself my boy said tell a sportsman always helps himself  what i say said hedwig bustling out of the house is that a boy of his age has no business to be shooting i dont like it  nobody can shoot well if he does not begin to practise early why when i was a boyi remember on one occasion when  what i say interrupted hedwig is that a boy ought not to want always to be shooting and what not he ought to stay at home and help his mother and i wish you would set them a better example  well the fact is you know said tell i dont think nature meant me to be a stayathome and that sort of thing i couldnt be a herdsman if you paid me i shouldnt know what to do no everyone has his special line and mine is hunting now i can hunt  a nasty dangerous occupation said hedwig i dont like to hear of your being lost on desolate icefields and leaping from crag to crag and what not some day mark my words if you are not careful you will fall down a precipice or be overtaken by an avalanche or the ice will break while you are crossing it there are a thousand ways in which you might get hurt  a man of ready wit with a quick eye replied tell complacently never gets hurt the mountain has no terror for her children i am a child of the mountain  you are certainly a child snapped hedwig it is no use my arguing with you  not very much agreed tell for i am just off to the town i have an appointment with your papa and some other gentlemen  i forgot to say so before but hedwig was the daughter of walter fürst  now what are you and papa plotting asked hedwig i know there is something going on i suspected it when papa brought werner stauffacher and the other man here and you wouldnt let me listen what is it some dangerous scheme i suppose  now how in the world do you get those sort of ideas into your head tell laughed dangerous scheme as if i should plot dangerous schemes with your papa  i know said hedwig you cant deceive me there is a plot afoot against the governor and you are in it  a man must help his country  theyre sure to place you where there is most danger i know them dont go send walter down with a note to say that you regret that an unfortunate previous engagement which you have just recollected will make it impossible for you to accept their kind invitation to plot  no i must go  and there is another thing continued hedwig gessler the governor is in the town now  he goes away today  well wait till he has gone you must not meet him he bears you malice  to me his malice cannot do much harm i do whats right and fear no enemy  those who do right said hedwig are those he hates the most and you know he has never forgiven you for speaking like that when you met him in the ravine keep away from the town for today do anything else go hunting if you will  no said tell i promised i must go come along walter  you arent going to take that poor dear child come here walter directly minute  want to go with father said walter beginning to cry for his father had promised to take him with him the next time he went to the town and he had saved his pocketmoney for the occasion  oh let the boy come said tell william will stay with you wont you william  all right father said william  well mark my words said hedwig if something bad does not happen i shall be surprised  oh no said tell what can happen  and without further delay he set off with walter for the town     chapter vi   in the meantime all kinds of things of which tell had no suspicion had been happening in the town the fact that there were no newspapers in switzerland at that time often made him a little behindhand as regarded the latest events he had to depend as a rule on visits from his friends who would sit in his kitchen and tell him all about everything that had been going on for the last few days and of course when there was anything very exciting happening in the town nobody had time to trudge up the hill to tells châlet they all wanted to be in the town enjoying the fun  what had happened now was this it was the chief amusement of the governor gessler who you will remember was not a nice man when he had a few moments to spare from the cares of governing to sit down and think out some new way of annoying the swiss people he was one of those persons who              only do it to annoy      because they know it teases  what he liked chiefly was to forbid something he would find out what the people most enjoyed doing and then he would send a herald to say that he was very sorry but it must stop he found that this annoyed the swiss more than anything but now he was rather puzzled what to do for he had forbidden everything he could think of he had forbidden dancing and singing and playing on any sort of musical instrument on the ground that these things made such a noise and disturbed people who wanted to work he had forbidden the eating of everything except bread and the simplest sorts of meat because he said that anything else upset people and made them unfit to do anything except sit still and say how ill they were and he had forbidden all sorts of games because he said they were a waste of time  so that now though he wanted dreadfully to forbid something else he could not think of anything  then he had an idea and this was it  he told his servants to cut a long pole and they cut a very long pole then he said to them go into the hall and bring me one of my hats not my best hat which i wear on sundays and on state occasions nor yet my secondbest which i wear every day nor yet again the one i wear when i am out hunting for all these i need fetch me rather the oldest of my hats and they fetched him the very oldest of his hats then he said put it on top of the pole and they put it right on top of the pole and last of all he said go and set up the pole in the middle of the meadow just outside the gates of the town and they went and set up the pole in the very middle of the meadow just outside the gates of the town  then he sent his heralds out to north and south and east and west to summon the people together because he said he had something very important and special to say to them and the people came in tens and fifties and hundreds men women and children and they stood waiting in front of the palace steps till gessler the governor should come out and say something very important and special to them  and punctually at eleven oclock gessler having finished a capital breakfast came out on to the top step and spoke to them  ladies and gentlemenhe began a voice from the crowd speak up  ladies and gentlemen he began again in a louder voice if i could catch the man who said speak up i would have him bitten in the neck by wild elephants applause i have called you to this place today to explain to you my reason for putting up a pole on the top of which is one of my caps in the meadow just outside the city gates it is this you all i know respect and love me here he paused for the audience to cheer but as they remained quite silent he went on you would all i know like to come to my palace every day and do reverence to me a voice no no if i could catch the man who said no no i would have him stung on the soles of the feet by pink scorpions and if he was the same man who said speak up a little while ago the number of scorpions should be doubled loud applause as i was saying before i was interrupted i know you would like to come to my palace and do reverence to me there but as you are many and space is limited i am obliged to refuse you that pleasure however being anxious not to disappoint you i have set up my cap in the meadow and you may do reverence to that in fact you must everybody is to look on that cap as if it were me a voice it aint so ugly as you if i could catch the man who made that remark i would have him tied up and teased by trained bluebottles deafening applause in fact to put the matter briefly if anybody crosses that meadow without bowing down before that cap my soldiers will arrest him and i will have him pecked on the nose by infuriated blackbirds so there soldiers move that crowd on  and gessler disappeared indoors again just as a volley of eggs and cabbages whistled through the air and the soldiers began to hustle the crowd down the various streets till the open space in front of the palace gates was quite cleared of them all this happened the day before tell and walter set out for the town     chapter vii   having set up the pole and cap in the meadow gessler sent two of his bodyguard friesshardt i should think you would be safe in pronouncing this freezehard but you had better ask somebody who knows and leuthold to keep watch there all day and see that nobody passed by without kneeling down before the pole and taking off his hat to it  but the people who prided themselves on being what they called üppen zie schnuffen or as we should say up to snuff and equal to every occasion had already seen a way out of the difficulty they knew that if they crossed the meadow they must bow down before the pole which they did not want to do so it occurred to them that an ingenious way of preventing this would be not to cross the meadow so they went the long way round and the two soldiers spent a lonely day  what i sez said friesshardt is wots the use of us wasting our time here friesshardt was not a very welleducated man and he did not speak good grammar none of these here people aint agoing to bow down to that there hat of course they aint why i can remember the time when this meadow was like a faireverybody ashoving and ajostling one another for elbowroom and look at it now its a desert thats what it is a desert whats the good of us wasting of our time here i sez thats what i sez  and theyre artful too mind yer he continued why only this morning i sez to myself friesshardt i sez you just wait till twelve oclock i sez cos thats when they leave the councilhouse and then theyll have to cross the meadow and then well see what we shall see i sez like that i sez bitterlike yer know well see i sez what we shall see so i waited and at twelve oclock out they came dozens of them and began to cross the meadow and now sez i to myself look out for larks but what happened why when they came to the pole the priest stood in front of it and the sacristan rang the bell and they all fell down on their knees but they were saying their prayers not doing obeisance to the hat thats what they were doing artfulthats what they are  and friesshardt kicked the foot of the pole viciously with his iron boot  its my belief said leuthold leuthold is the thin soldier you see in the pictureits my firm belief that they are laughing at us there listen to that  a voice made itself heard from behind a rock not far off  where did you get that hat said the voice  there grumbled leuthold theyre always at it last time it was whos your hatter why were the laughingstock of the place were like two rogues in a pillory tis rank disgrace for one who wears a sword to stand as sentry oer an empty hat to make obeisance to a hat i faith such a command is downright foolery  well said friesshardt and why not bow before an empty hat thou hast oft bowd before an empty skull ha ha i was always one for a joke yer know  here come some people said leuthold at last and theyre only the rabble after all you dont catch any of the better sort of people coming here  a crowd was beginning to collect on the edge of the meadow its numbers swelled every minute until quite a hundred of the commoner sort must have been gathered together they stood pointing at the pole and talking among themselves but nobody made any movement to cross the meadow  at last somebody shouted yah  the soldiers took no notice  somebody else cried booh  pass along there pass along said the soldiers  cries of where did you get that hat began to come from the body of the crowd when the swiss invented a catchphrase they did not drop it in a hurry  wheredidyougetthathat they shouted  friesshardt and leuthold stood like two statues in armour paying no attention to the remarks of the rabble this annoyed the rabble they began to be more personal  you in the secondhand lobstertin shouted onehe meant friesshardt whose suit of armour though no longer new hardly deserved this descriptionwhos your hatter  cant yer see shouted a friend when friesshardt made no reply the pore thing aint alive es stuffed  roars of laughter greeted this sally friesshardt in spite of the fact that he enjoyed a joke turned pink  es blushing shrieked a voice  friesshardt turned purple  then things got still more exciting  ere said a rough voice in the crowd impatiently wots the good of torkin to em gimme that ere egg missus  and in another instant an egg flew across the meadow and burst over leutholds shoulder the crowd howled with delight this was something like fun thought they and the next moment eggs cabbages cats and missiles of every sort darkened the air the two soldiers raved and shouted but did not dare to leave their post at last just as the storm was at its height it ceased as if by magic everyone in the crowd turned round and as he turned jumped into the air and waved his hat  illustration plate iii  a deafening cheer went up  hurrah cried the mob here comes good old tell now theres going to be a jolly row     chapter viii   tell came striding along walter by his side and his crossbow over his shoulder he knew nothing about the hat having been placed on the pole and he was surprised to see such a large crowd gathered in the meadow he bowed to the crowd in his polite way and the crowd gave three cheers and one more and he bowed again  hullo said walter suddenly look at that hat up there father on the pole  what is the hat to us said tell and he began to walk across the meadow with an air of great dignity and walter walked by his side trying to look just like him  here hi shouted the soldiers stop you havent bowed down to the cap  illustration plate iv  tell looked scornful but said nothing walter looked still more scornful  ho there shouted friesshardt standing in front of him i bid you stand in the emperors name  my good fellow said tell please do not bother me i am in a hurry i really have nothing for you  my orders is said friesshardt to stand in this ere meadow and to see as how all them what passes through it does obeisance to that there hat thems governors orders them is so now  my good fellow said tell let me pass i shall get cross i know i shall  shouts of encouragement from the crowd who were waiting patiently for the trouble to begin  go it tell they cried dont stand talking to him hit him a kick  friesshardt became angrier every minute  my orders is he said again to arrest them as dont bow down to the hat and for two pins young feller ill arrest you so which is it to be either you bow down to that there hat or you come along of me  tell pushed him aside and walked on with his chin in the air walter went with him with his chin in the air  whack  a howl of dismay went up from the crowd as they saw friesshardt raise his pike and bring it down with all his force on tells head the sound of the blow went echoing through the meadow and up the hills and down the valleys  illustration plate v  ow cried tell  now thought the crowd things must begin to get exciting  tells first idea was that one of the larger mountains in the neighbourhood had fallen on top of him then he thought that there must have been an earthquake then it gradually dawned upon him that he had been hit by a mere common soldier with a pike then he was angry  look here he began  look there said friesshardt pointing to the cap  illustration plate vi  youve hurt my head very much said tell feel the bump if i hadnt happened to have a particularly hard head i dont know what might not have happened and he raised his fist and hit friesshardt but as friesshardt was wearing a thick iron helmet the blow did not hurt him very much  but it had the effect of bringing the crowd to tells assistance they had been waiting all this time for him to begin the fighting for though they were very anxious to attack the soldiers they did not like to do so by themselves they wanted a leader  so when they saw tell hit friesshardt they tucked up their sleeves grasped their sticks and cudgels more tightly and began to run across the meadow towards him  neither of the soldiers noticed this friesshardt was busy arguing with tell and leuthold was laughing at friesshardt so when the people came swarming up with their sticks and cudgels they were taken by surprise but every soldier in the service of gessler was as brave as a lion and friesshardt and leuthold were soon hitting back merrily and making a good many of the crowd wish that they had stayed at home the two soldiers were wearing armour of course so that it was difficult to hurt them but the crowd who wore no armour found that they could get hurt very easily conrad hunn for instance was attacking friesshardt when the soldier happened to drop his pike it fell on conrads toe and conrad limped away feeling that fighting was no fun unless you had thick boots on  and so for a time the soldiers had the best of the fight     chapter ix   for many minutes the fight raged furiously round the pole and the earth shook beneath the iron boots of friesshardt and leuthold as they rushed about striking out right and left with their fists and the flats of their pikes seppi the cowboy an ancestor by the way of buffalo bill went down before a tremendous blow by friesshardt and leuthold knocked klaus von der flue head over heels  what you want said arnold of sewa who had seen the beginning of the fight from the window of his cottage and had hurried to join it and as usual to give advice to everybodywhat you want here is guile thats what you wantguile cunning not brute force mind you its no good rushing at a man in armour and hitting him he only hits you back you should employ guile thus observe  he had said these words standing on the outskirts of the crowd he now grasped his cudgel and began to steal slowly towards friesshardt who had just given werni the huntsman such a hit with his pike that the sound of it was still echoing in the mountains and was now busily engaged in disposing of jost weiler arnold of sewa crept stealthily behind him and was just about to bring his cudgel down on his head when leuthold catching sight of him saved his comrade by driving his pike with all his force into arnolds side arnold said afterwards that it completely took his breath away he rolled over and after being trodden on by everybody for some minutes got up and limped back to his cottage where he went straight to bed and did not get up for two days  all this time tell had been standing a little way off with his arms folded looking on while it was a quarrel simply between himself and friesshardt he did not mind fighting but when the crowd joined in he felt that it was not fair to help so many men attack one however badly that one might have behaved  he now saw that the time had come to put an end to the disturbance he drew an arrow from his quiver placed it in his crossbow and pointed it at the hat friesshardt seeing what he intended to do uttered a shout of horror and rushed to stop him but at that moment somebody in the crowd hit him so hard with a spade that his helmet was knocked over his eyes and before he could raise it again the deed was done through the cap and through the pole and out at the other side sped the arrow and the first thing he saw when he opened his eyes was tell standing beside him twirling his moustache while all around the crowd danced and shouted and threw their caps into the air with joy  illustration plate vii  illustration plate viii  a mere trifle said tell modestly  the crowd cheered again and again  friesshardt and leuthold lay on the ground beside the pole feeling very sore and bruised and thought that perhaps on the whole they had better stay there there was no knowing what the crowd might do after this if they began to fight again so they lay on the ground and made no attempt to interfere with the popular rejoicings what they wanted as arnold of sewa might have said if he had been there was a few moments complete rest leutholds helmet had been hammered with sticks until it was over his eyes and all out of shape and friesshardts was very little better and they both felt just as if they had been run over in the street by a horse and cart  tell shouted the crowd hurrah for tell good old tell  tells the boy roared ulric the smith not another man in switzerland could have made that shot  no shrieked everybody not another  speech cried someone from the edge of the crowd  speech speech tell speech everybody took up the cry  no no said tell blushing  go on go on shouted the crowd  oh i couldnt said tell i dont know what to say  anything will do speech speech  ulric the smith and ruodi the fisherman hoisted tell on to their shoulders and having coughed once or twice he said  gentlemen  cheers from the crowd  gentlemen said tell again this is the proudest moment of my life  more cheers  i dont know what you want me to talk about i have never made a speech before excuse my emotion this is the proudest moment of my life today is a great day for switzerland we have struck the first blow of the revolution let us strike some more  shouts of hear hear from the crowd many of whom misunderstanding tells last remark proceeded to hit leuthold and friesshardt until stopped by cries of order from ulric the smith  gentlemen continued tell the floodgates of revolution have been opened from this day they will stalk through the land burning to ashes the slough of oppression which our tyrant governor has erected in our midst i have only to add that this is the proudest moment of my life and  he was interrupted by a frightened voice  look out you chaps said the voice here comes the governor  gessler with a bodyguard of armed men had entered the meadow and was galloping towards them     chapter x   gessler came riding up on his brown horse and the crowd melted away in all directions for there was no knowing what the governor might not do if he found them plotting they were determined to rebel and to throw off his tyrannous yoke but they preferred to do it quietly and comfortably when he was nowhere near  so they ran away to the edge of the meadow and stood there in groups waiting to see what was going to happen not even ulric the smith and ruodi the fisherman waited though they knew quite well that tell had not nearly finished his speech they set the orator down and began to walk away trying to look as if they had been doing nothing in particular and were going to go on doing itonly somewhere else  tell was left standing alone in the middle of the meadow by the pole he scorned to run away like the others but he did not at all like the look of things gessler was a stern man quick to punish any insult and there were two of his soldiers lying on the ground with their nice armour all spoiled and dented and his own cap on top of the pole had an arrow right through the middle of it and would never look the same again however much it might be patched it seemed to tell that there was a bad time coming  gessler rode up and reined in his horse  now then now then now then he said in his quick abrupt way whats this whats this whats this  when a man repeats what he says three times you can see that he is not in a good temper  friesshardt and leuthold got up saluted and limped slowly towards him they halted beside his horse and stood to attention the tears trickled down their cheeks  come come come said gessler tell me all about it  illustration plate ix  and he patted friesshardt on the head friesshardt bellowed  gessler beckoned to one of his courtiers  have you a handkerchief he said  i have a handkerchief your excellency  then dry this mans eyes  the courtier did as he was bidden  now said gessler when the drying was done and friesshardts tears had ceased what has been happening here i heard a cry of help as i came up who cried help  please your lordships noble excellencyship said friesshardt it was me friesshardt  you should say it was i said gessler proceed  which i am a loyal servant of your excellencys and in your excellencys army and seeing as how i was told to stand by this ere pole and guard that there hat i stood by this ere pole and guarded that there hatall day i did your excellency and then up comes this man here and i says to himbow down to the hat i says ho he says to meho indeed and he passed on without so much as nodding so i takes my pike and i taps him on the head to remind him as you may say that there was something he was forgetting and he ups and hits me he does and then the crowd runs up with their sticks and hits me and leuthold cruel your excellency and while we was afighting with them this here man im atelling you about your excellency he outs with an arrow puts it into his bow and sends it through the hat and i dont see how youll ever be able to wear it again its a waste of a good hat your excellencythats what it is and then the people they puts me and leuthold on the ground and hoists this here mantell they call himup on their shoulders and he starts making a speech when up you comes your excellency thats how it all was  gessler turned pale with rage and glared fiercely at tell who stood before him in the grasp of two of the bodyguard  ah he said tell is it goodday to you tell i think weve met before tell eh tell  we have your excellency it was in the ravine of schächenthal said tell firmly  your memory is good tell so is mine i think you made a few remarks to me on that occasion tella few chatty remarks eh tell  very possibly your excellency  you were hardly polite tell  if i offended you i am sorry  i am glad to hear it tell i think you will be even sorrier before long so youve been illtreating my soldiers eh  it was not i who touched them  oh so you didnt touch them ah but you defied my power by refusing to bow down to the hat i set up that hat to prove the peoples loyalty i am afraid you are not loyal tell  i was a little thoughtless not disloyal i passed the hat without thinking  you should always think tell it is very dangerous not to do so and i suppose that you shot your arrow through the hat without thinking  i was a little carried away by excitement your excellency  dear dear carried away by excitement were you you must really be more careful tell one of these days you will be getting yourself into trouble but it seems to have been a very fine shot you are a capital marksman i believe  fathers the best shot in all switzerland piped a youthful voice he can hit an apple on a tree a hundred yards away ive seen him cant you father  walter who had run away when the fighting began had returned on seeing his father in the hands of the soldiers  gessler turned a cold eye upon him  who is this he asked     chapter xi   it is my son walter your excellency said tell  your son indeed this is very interesting have you any more children  i have one other boy  and which of them do you love the most eh  i love them both alike your excellency  dear me quite a happy family now listen to me tell i know you are fond of excitement so i am going to try to give you a little your son says that you can hit an apple on a tree a hundred yards away and i am sure you have every right to be very proud of such a feat friesshardt  your excellency  bring me an apple  friesshardt picked one up some apples had been thrown at him and leuthold earlier in the day and there were several lying about  which im afraid as how its a little bruised your excellency he said having hit me on the helmet  thank you i do not require it for eating purposes said gessler now tell i have here an applea simple apple not overripe i should like to test that feat of yours so take your bowi see you have it in your handand get ready to shoot i am going to put this apple on your sons head he will be placed a hundred yards away from you and if you do not hit the apple with your first shot your life shall pay forfeit  illustration plate x  and he regarded tell with a look of malicious triumph  your excellency it cannot be cried tell the thing is too monstrous perhaps your excellency is pleased to jest you cannot bid a father shoot an apple from off his sons head consider your excellency  you shall shoot the apple from off the head of this boy said gessler sternly i do not jest that is my will  sooner would i die said tell  if you do not shoot you die with the boy come come tell why so cautious they always told me that you loved perilous enterprises and yet when i give you one you complain i could understand anybody else shrinking from the feat but you hitting apples at a hundred yards is childs play to you and what does it matter where the apple iswhether it is on a tree or on a boys head it is an apple just the same proceed tell  the crowd seeing a discussion going on had left the edge of the meadow and clustered round to listen a groan of dismay went up at the governors words  down on your knees boy whispered rudolph der harras to walterdown on your knees and beg his excellency for your life  i wont said walter stoutly  come said gessler clear a path thereclear a path hurry yourselves i wont have this loitering look you tell attend to me for a moment i find you in the middle of this meadow deliberately defying my authority and making sport of my orders i find you in the act of stirring up discontent among my people with speeches i might have you executed without ceremony but do i no nobody shall say that hermann gessler the governor is not kindhearted i say to myself i will give this man one chance i place your fate in your own skilful hands how can a man complain of harsh treatment when he is made master of his own fate besides i dont ask you to do anything difficult i merely hid you perform what must be to you a simple shot you boast of your unerring aim now is the time to prove it clear the way there  walter fürst flung himself on his knees before the governor  your highness he cried none deny your power let it be mingled with mercy it is excellent as an english poet will say in a few hundred years to have a giants strength but it is tyrannous to use it like a giant take the half of my possessions but spare my soninlaw  but walter tell broke in impatiently and bade his grandfather rise and not kneel to the tyrant  where must i stand asked he im not afraid father can hit a bird upon the wing  you see that limetree yonder said gessler to his soldiers take the boy and bind him to it  i will not be bound cried walter i am not afraid ill stand still i wont breathe if you bind me ill kick  let us bind your eyes at least said rudolph der harras  do you think i fear to see father shoot said walter i wont stir an eyelash father show the tyrant how you can shoot he thinks youre going to miss isnt he an old donkey  very well young man muttered gessler well see who is laughing five minutes from now and once more he bade the crowd stand back and leave a way clear for tell to shoot     chapter xii   the crowd fell back leaving a lane down which walter walked carrying the apple there was dead silence as he passed then the people began to whisper excitedly to one another  shall this be done before our eyes said arnold of melchthal to werner stauffacher of what use was it that we swore an oath to rebel if we permit this let us rise and slay the tyrant  werner stauffacher prudent man scratched his chin thoughtfully  weell he said you see the difficulty is that we are not armed and the soldiers are there is nothing i should enjoy more than slaying the tyrant only i have an idea that the tyrant would slay us you see my point  why were we so slow groaned arnold we should have risen before and then this would never have happened who was it that advised us to delay  weell said stauffacher who had himself advised delay i cant quite remember at the moment but i dare say you could find out by looking up the minutes of our last meeting i know the motion was carried by a majority of two votes see gessler grows impatient  gessler who had been fidgeting on his horse for some time now spoke again urging tell to hurry  begin he criedbegin  immediately replied tell fitting the arrow to the string  gessler began to mock him once more  you see now he said the danger of carrying arms i dont know if you have ever noticed it but arrows very often recoil on the man who carries them the only man who has any business to possess a weapon is the ruler of a countrymyself for instance a low common fellowif you will excuse the descriptionlike yourself only grows proud through being armed and so offends those above him but of course its no business of mine i am only telling you what i think about it personally i like to encourage my subjects to shoot that is why i am giving you such a splendid mark to shoot at you see tell  tell did not reply he raised his bow and pointed it there was a stir of excitement in the crowd more particularly in that part of the crowd which stood on his right for his hand trembling for the first time in his life tell had pointed his arrow not at his son but straight into the heart of the crowd  illustration plate xi  here hi thats the wrong way more to the left shouted the people in a panic while gessler roared with laughter and bade tell shoot and chance it  if you cant hit the apple or your son he chuckled you can bring down one of your dear fellowcountrymen  tell lowered his bow and a sigh of relief went through the crowd  my eyes are swimming he said i cannot see  then he turned to the governor  i cannot shoot he said bid your soldiers kill me  no said gesslerno tell that is not at all what i want if i had wished my soldiers to kill you i should not have waited for a formal invitation from you i have no desire to see you slain not at present i wish to see you shoot come tell they say you can do everything and are afraid of nothing only the other day i hear you carried a man one baumgartnerthat was his name i thinkacross a rough sea in an open boat you may remember it i particularly wished to catch baumgartner tell now this is a feat which calls for much less courage simply to shoot an apple off a boys head a child could do it  while he was speaking tell had been standing in silence his hands trembling and his eyes fixed sometimes on the governor sometimes on the sky he now seized his quiver and taking from it a second arrow placed it in his belt gessler watched him but said nothing  shoot father cried walter from the other end of the lane im not afraid  tell calm again now raised his bow and took a steady aim everybody craned forward the front ranks in vain telling those behind that there was nothing to be gained by pushing gessler bent over his horses neck and peered eagerly towards walter a great hush fell on all as tell released the string  phut went the string and the arrow rushed through the air  a moments suspense and then a terrific cheer rose from the spectators  illustration plate xii  the apple had leaped from walters head pierced through the centre     chapter xiii   intense excitement instantly reigned their suspense over the crowd cheered again and again shook hands with one another and flung their caps into the air everyone was delighted for everyone was fond of tell and walter it also pleased them to see the governor disappointed he had had things his own way for so long that it was a pleasant change to see him baffled in this manner not since switzerland became a nation had the meadow outside the city gates been the scene of such rejoicings  walter had picked up the apple with the arrow piercing it and was showing it proudly to all his friends  i told you so he kept saying i knew father wouldnt hurt me fathers the best shot in all switzerland  that was indeed a shot exclaimed ulric the smith it will ring through the ages while the mountains stand will the tale of tell the bowman be told  rudolph der harras took the apple from walter and showed it to gessler who had been sitting transfixed on his horse  see he said the arrow has passed through the very centre it was a master shot  it was very nearly a master walter shot said rösselmann the priest severely fixing the governor with a stern eye  gessler made no answer he sat looking moodily at tell who had dropped his crossbow and was standing motionless still gazing in the direction in which the arrow had sped nobody liked to be the first to speak to him  well said rudolph der harras breaking an awkward silence i suppose its all over now may as well be moving eh  he bit a large piece out of the apple which he still held walter uttered a piercing scream as he saw the mouthful disappear up till now he had shown no signs of dismay in spite of the peril which he had had to face but when he watched rudolph eating the apple which he naturally looked upon as his own property he could not keep quiet any longer rudolph handed him the apple with an apology and he began to munch it contentedly  come with me to your mother my boy said rösselmann  walter took no notice but went on eating the apple  tell came to himself with a start looked round for walter and began to lead him away in the direction of his home deaf to all the cheering that was going on around him  gessler leaned forward in his saddle  tell he said a word with you  tell came back  your excellency  before you go i wish you to explain one thing  a thousand your excellency  no only one when you were getting ready to shoot at the apple you placed an arrow in the string and a second arrow in your belt  a second arrow tell pretended to be very much astonished but the pretence did not deceive the governor  yes a second arrow why was that what did you intend to do with that arrow tell  tell looked down uneasily and twisted his bow about in his hands  my lord he said at last it is a bowmans custom all archers place a second arrow in their belt  no tell said gessler i cannot take that answer as the truth i know there was some other meaning in what you did tell me the reason without concealment why was it your life is safe whatever it was so speak out why did you take out that second arrow  tell stopped fidgeting with his bow and met the governors eye with a steady gaze  since you promise me my life your excellency he replied drawing himself up i will tell you  he drew the arrow from his belt and held it up  the crowd pressed forward hanging on his words  had my first arrow said tell slowly pierced my child and not the apple this would have pierced you my lord had i missed with my first shot be sure my lord that my second would have found its mark  a murmur of approval broke from the crowd as tell thrust the arrow back into the quiver and faced the governor with folded arms and burning eyes gessler turned white with fury  seize that man he shouted  illustration plate xiii  my lord bethink you whispered rudolph der harras you promised him his life tell fly he cried  tell did not move  seize that man and bind him roared gessler once more if he resists cut him down  i shall not resist said tell scornfully i should have known the folly of trusting to a tyrant to keep his word my death will at least show my countrymen the worth of their governors promises  not so replied gessler no man shall say i ever broke my knightly word i promised you your life and i will give you your life but you are a dangerous man tell and against such must i guard myself you have told me your murderous purpose i must look to it that that purpose is not fulfilled life i promised you and life i will give you but of freedom i said nothing in my castle at küssnacht there are dungeons where no ray of sun or moon ever falls chained hand and foot in one of these you will hardly aim your arrows at me it is rash tell to threaten those who have power over you soldiers bind him and lead him to my ship i will follow and will myself conduct him to küssnacht  the soldiers tied tells hands he offered no resistance and amidst the groans of the people he was led away to the shore of the lake where gesslers ship lay at anchor  illustration plate xiv  our last chance is gone said the people to one another where shall we look now for a leader     chapter xiv   the castle of küssnacht lay on the opposite side of the lake a mighty mass of stone reared on a mightier crag rising sheer out of the waves which boiled and foamed about its foot steep rocks of fantastic shape hemmed it in and many were the vessels which perished on these driven thither by the frequent storms that swept over the lake  gessler and his men tell in their midst bound and unarmed embarked early in the afternoon at flüelen which was the name of the harbour where the governors ship had been moored flüelen was about two miles from küssnacht  when they had arrived at the vessel they went on board and tell was placed at the bottom of the hold it was pitch dark and rats scampered over his body as he lay the ropes were cast off the sails filled and the ship made her way across the lake aided by a favouring breeze  a large number of the swiss people had followed tell and his captors to the harbour and stood gazing sorrowfully after the ship as it diminished in the distance there had been whispers of an attempted rescue but nobody had dared to begin it and the whispers had led to nothing few of the people carried weapons and the soldiers were clad in armour and each bore a long pike or a sharp sword as arnold of sewa would have said if he had been present what the people wanted was prudence it was useless to attack men so thoroughly able to defend themselves  therefore the people looked on and groaned but did nothing  for some time the ship sped easily on her way and through a calm sea tell lay below listening to the trampling of the sailors overhead as they ran about the deck and gave up all hope of ever seeing his home and his friends again  but soon he began to notice that the ship was rolling and pitching more than it had been doing at first and it was not long before he realized that a very violent storm had begun storms sprung up very suddenly on the lake and made it unsafe for boats that attempted to cross it often the sea was quite unruffled at the beginning of the crossing and was rough enough at the end to wreck the largest ship  tell welcomed the storm he had no wish to live if life meant years of imprisonment in a dark dungeon of castle küssnacht drowning would be a pleasant fate compared with that he lay at the bottom of the ship hoping that the next wave would dash them on to a rock and send them to the bottom of the lake the tossing became worse and worse  upon the deck gessler was standing beside the helmsman and gazing anxiously across the waters at the rocks that fringed the narrow entrance to the bay a few hundred yards to the east of castle küssnacht this bay was the only spot for miles along the shore at which it was possible to land safely for miles on either side the coast was studded with great rocks which would have dashed a ship to pieces in a moment it was to this bay that gessler wished to direct the ship but the helmsman told him that he could not make sure of finding the entrance so great was the cloud of spray which covered it a mistake would mean shipwreck  my lord said the helmsman i have neither strength nor skill to guide the helm i do not know which way to turn  what are we to do asked rudolph der harras who was standing near  the helmsman hesitated then he spoke eyeing the governor uneasily  tell could steer us through he said if your lordship would but give him the helm  gessler started  tell he muttered tell  the ship drew nearer to the rocks  bring him here said gessler  two soldiers went down to the hold and released tell they bade him get up and come with them tell followed them on deck and stood before the governor  tell said gessler  tell looked at him without speaking  take the helm tell said gessler and steer the ship through those rocks into the bay beyond or instant death shall be your lot  without a word tell took the helmsmans place peering keenly into the cloud of foam before him to right and to left he turned the vessels head and to right again into the very heart of the spray they were right among the rocks now but the ship did not strike on them quivering and pitching she was hurried along until of a sudden the spraycloud was behind her and in front the calm waters of the bay  gessler beckoned to the helmsman  take the helm again he said  he pointed to tell  bind him he said to the soldiers  the soldiers advanced slowly for they were loath to bind the man who had just saved them from destruction but the governors orders must he obeyed so they came towards tell carrying ropes with which to bind him  tell moved a step back the ship was gliding past a lofty rock it was such a rock as tell had often climbed when hunting the chamois he acted with the quickness of the hunter snatching up the bow and quiver which lay on the deck he sprang on to the bulwark of the vessel and with a mighty leap gained the rock another instant and he was out of reach  gessler roared to his bowmen  shoot shoot he cried  the bowmen hastily fitted arrow to string they were too late tell was ready before them there was a hiss as the shaft rushed through the air and the next moment gessler the governor fell dead on the deck pierced through the heart  tells second arrow had found its mark as his first had done  illustration plate xv     chapter xv   there is not much more of the story of william tell the death of gessler was a signal to the swiss to rise in revolt and soon the whole country was up in arms against the austrians it had been chiefly the fear of the governor that had prevented a rising before it had been brewing for a long time the people had been bound by a solemn oath to drive the enemy out of the country all through switzerland preparations for a revolution were going on and nobles and peasants had united  directly the news arrived that the governor was slain meetings of the people were held in every town in switzerland and it was resolved to begin the revolution without delay all the fortresses that gessler had built during his years of rule were carried by assault on the same night the last to fall was one which had only been begun a short time back and the people who had been forced to help to build it spent a very pleasant hour pulling down the stones which had cost them such labour to put in their place even the children helped it was a great treat to them to break what they pleased without being told not to  see said tell as he watched them in years to come when these same children are grayhaired they will remember this night as freshly as they will remember it tomorrow  a number of people rushed up bearing the pole which gesslers soldiers had set up in the meadow the hat was still on top of it nailed to the wood by tells arrow  heres the hat shouted ruodithe hat to which we were to bow  what shall we do with it cried several voices  destroy it burn it said others to the flames with this emblem of tyranny  but tell stopped them  let us preserve it he said gessler set it up to be a means of enslaving the country we will set it up as a memorial of our newlygained liberty nobly is fulfilled the oath we swore to drive the tyrants from our land let the pole mark the spot where the revolution finished  but is it finished said arnold of melchthal it is a nice point when the emperor of austria hears that we have killed his friend gessler and burnt down all his fine new fortresses will he not come here to seek revenge  he will said tell and let him come and let him bring all his mighty armies we have driven out the enemy that was in our land we will meet and drive away the enemy that comes from another country switzerland is not easy to attack there are but a few mountain passes by which the foe can approach we will stop these with our bodies and one great strength we have we are united and united we need fear no foe  hurrah shouted everybody  but who is this that approaches said tell he seems excited perhaps he brings news  it was rösselmann the pastor and he brought stirring news  these are strange times in which we live said rösselmann coming up  why what has happened cried everybody  listen and be amazed  why whats the matter  the emperor  yes  the emperor is dead  what dead  dead  impossible how came you by the news  john müller of schaffhausen brought it and he is a truthful man  but how did it happen  as the emperor rode from stein to baden the lords of eschenbach and tegerfelden jealous it is said of his power fell upon him with their spears his bodyguard were on the other side of a streamthe emperor had just crossed itand could not come to his assistance he died instantly  by the death of the emperor the revolution in switzerland was enabled to proceed without check the successor of the emperor had too much to do in defending himself against the slayers of his father to think of attacking the swiss and by the time he was at leisure they were too strong to be attacked so the swiss became free  as for william tell he retired to his home and lived there very happily ever afterwards with his wife and his two sons who in a few years became very nearly as skilful in the use of the crossbow as their father     epilogue        some say the tale related here        is amplified and twisted      some say it isnt very clear        that william tell existed      some say he freed his country so        the governor demolished      perhaps he did i only know        that taxes arent abolished
