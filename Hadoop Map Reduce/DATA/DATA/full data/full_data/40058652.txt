40058652	i and my chimney  by herman melville    i and my chimney two greyheaded old smokers reside in the country we are i may say old settlers here particularly my old chimney which settles more and more every day  though i always say i and my chimney as cardinal wolsey used to say i and my king yet this egotistic way of speaking wherein i take precedence of my chimney is hereby borne out by the facts in everything except the above phrase my chimney taking precedence of me  within thirty feet of the turfsided road my chimneya huge corpulent old harry viii of a chimneyrises full in front of me and all my possessions standing well up a hillside my chimney like lord rosses monster telescope swung vertical to hit the meridian moon is the first object to greet the approaching travelers eye nor is it the last which the sun salutes my chimney too is before me in receiving the firstfruits of the seasons the snow is on its head ere on my hat and every spring as in a hollow beech tree the first swallows build their nests in it  but it is within doors that the preeminence of my chimney is most manifest when in the rear room set apart for that object i stand to receive my guests who by the way call more i suspect to see my chimney than me i then stand not so much before as strictly speaking behind my chimney which is indeed the true host not that i demur in the presence of my betters i hope i know my place  from this habitual precedence of my chimney over me some even think that i have got into a sad rearward way altogether in short from standing behind my oldfashioned chimney so much i have got to be quite behind the age too as well as running behindhand in everything else but to tell the truth i never was a very forward old fellow nor what my farming neighbors call a forehanded one indeed those rumors about my behindhandedness are so far correct that i have an odd sauntering way with me sometimes of going about with my hands behind my back as for my belonging to the rearguard in general certain it is i bring up the rear of my chimneywhich by the way is this moment before meand that too both in fancy and fact in brief my chimney is my superior my superior too in that humbly bowing over with shovel and tongs i much minister to it yet never does it minister or incline over to me but if anything in its settlings rather leans the other way  my chimney is grand seignior herethe one great domineering object not more of the landscape than of the house all the rest of which house in each architectural arrangement as may shortly appear is in the most marked manner accommodated not to my wants but to my chimneys which among other things has the centre of the house to himself leaving but the odd holes and corners to me  but i and my chimney must explain and as we are both rather obese we may have to expatiate  in those houses which are strictly double housesthat is where the hall is in the middlethe fireplaces usually are on opposite sides so that while one member of the household is warming himself at a fire built into a recess of the north wall say another member the formers own brother perhaps may be holding his feet to the blaze before a hearth in the south wallthe two thus fairly sitting back to back is this well be it put to any man who has a proper fraternal feeling has it not a sort of sulky appearance but very probably this style of chimney building originated with some architect afflicted with a quarrelsome family  then again almost every modern fireplace has its separate flueseparate throughout from hearth to chimneytop at least such an arrangement is deemed desirable does not this look egotistical selfish but still more all these separate flues instead of having independent masonry establishments of their own or instead of being grouped together in one federal stock in the middle of the houseinstead of this i say each flue is surreptitiously honeycombed into the walls so that these last are here and there or indeed almost anywhere treacherously hollow and in consequence more or less weak of course the main reason of this style of chimney building is to economize room in cities where lots are sold by the inch small space is to spare for a chimney constructed on magnanimous principles and as with most thin men who are generally tall so with such houses what is lacking in breadth must be made up in height this remark holds true even with regard to many very stylish abodes built by the most stylish of gentlemen and yet when that stylish gentleman louis le grand of france would build a palace for his lady friend madame de maintenon he built it but one story highin fact in the cottage style but then how uncommonly quadrangular spacious and broadhorizontal acres not vertical ones such is the palace which in all its onestoried magnificence of languedoc marble in the garden of versailles still remains to this day any man can buy a square foot of land and plant a libertypole on it but it takes a king to set apart whole acres for a grand triannon  but nowadays it is different and furthermore what originated in a necessity has been mounted into a vaunt in towns there is large rivalry in building tall houses if one gentleman builds his house four stories high and another gentleman comes next door and builds five stories high then the former not to be looked down upon that way immediately sends for his architect and claps a fifth and a sixth story on top of his previous four and not till the gentleman has achieved his aspiration not till he has stolen over the way by twilight and observed how his sixth story soars beyond his neighbors fifthnot till then does he retire to his rest with satisfaction  such folks it seems to me need mountains for neighbors to take this emulous conceit of soaring out of them  if considering that mine is a very wide house and by no means lofty aught in the above may appear like interested pleading as if i did but fold myself about in the cloak of a general proposition cunningly to tickle my individual vanity beneath it such misconception must vanish upon my frankly conceding that land adjoining my alder swamp was sold last month for ten dollars an acre and thought a rash purchase at that so that for wide houses hereabouts there is plenty of room and cheap indeed so cheapdirt cheapis the soil that our elms thrust out their roots in it and hang their great boughs over it in the most lavish and reckless way almost all our crops too are sown broadcast even peas and turnips a farmer among us who should go about his twentyacre field poking his finger into it here and there and dropping down a mustard seed would be thought a penurious narrowminded husbandman the dandelions in the rivermeadows and the forgetmenots along the mountain roads you see at once they are put to no economy in space some seasons too our rye comes up here and there a spear sole and single like a churchspire it doesnt care to crowd itself where it knows there is such a deal of room the world is wide the world is all before us says the rye weeds too it is amazing how they spread no such thing as arresting themsome of our pastures being a sort of alsatia for the weeds as for the grass every spring it is like kossuths rising of what he calls the peoples mountains too a regular campmeeting of them for the same reason the same allsufficiency of room our shadows march and countermarch going through their various drills and masterly evolutions like the old imperial guard on the champs de mars as for the hills especially where the roads cross them the supervisors of our various towns have given notice to all concerned that they can come and dig them down and cart them off and never a cent to pay no more than for the privilege of picking blackberries the stranger who is buried here what liberalhearted landed proprietor among us grudges him six feet of rocky pasture  nevertheless cheap after all as our land is and much as it is trodden under foot i for one am proud of it for what it bears and chiefly for its three great lionsthe great oak ogg mountain and my chimney  most houses here are but one and a half stories high few exceed two that in which i and my chimney dwell is in width nearly twice its height from sill to eaveswhich accounts for the magnitude of its main contentbesides showing that in this house as in this country at large there is abundance of space and to spare for both of us  the frame of the old house is of woodwhich but the more sets forth the solidity of the chimney which is of brick and as the great wrought nails binding the clapboards are unknown in these degenerate days so are the huge bricks in the chimney walls the architect of the chimney must have had the pyramid of cheops before him for after that famous structure it seems modeled only its rate of decrease towards the summit is considerably less and it is truncated from the exact middle of the mansion it soars from the cellar right up through each successive floor till four feet square it breaks water from the ridgepole of the roof like an anvilheaded whale through the crest of a billow most people though liken it in that part to a razed observatory masoned up  the reason for its peculiar appearance above the roof touches upon rather delicate ground how shall i reveal that forasmuch as many years ago the original gable roof of the old house had become very leaky a temporary proprietor hired a band of woodmen with their huge crosscut saws and went to sawing the old gable roof clean off off it went with all its birds nests and dormer windows it was replaced with a modern roof more fit for a railway woodhouse than an old country gentlemans abode this operationrazeeing the structure some fifteen feetwas in effect upon the chimney something like the falling of the great spring tides it left uncommon low water all about the chimneyto abate which appearance the same person now proceeds to slice fifteen feet off the chimney itself actually beheading my royal old chimneya regicidal act which were it not for the palliating fact that he was a poulterer by trade and therefore hardened to such neckwringings should send that former proprietor down to posterity in the same cart with cromwell  owing to its pyramidal shape the reduction of the chimney inordinately widened its razeed summit inordinately i say but only in the estimation of such as have no eye to the picturesque what care i if unaware that my chimney as a free citizen of this free land stands upon an independent basis of its own people passing it wonder how such a brickkiln as they call it is supported upon mere joists and rafters what care i i will give a traveler a cup of switchel if he want it but am i bound to supply him with a sweet taste men of cultivated minds see in my old house and chimney a goodly old elephantandcastle  all feeling hearts will sympathize with me in what i am now about to add the surgical operation above referred to necessarily brought into the open air a part of the chimney previously under cover and intended to remain so and therefore not built of what are called weatherbricks in consequence the chimney though of a vigorous constitution suffered not a little from so naked an exposure and unable to acclimate itself ere long began to failshowing blotchy symptoms akin to those in measles whereupon travelers passing my way would wag their heads laughing see that wax nosehow it melts off but what cared i the same travelers would travel across the sea to view kenilworth peeling away and for a very good reason that of all artists of the picturesque decay wears the palmi would say the ivy in fact ive often thought that the proper place for my old chimney is ivied old england  in vain my wifewith what probable ulterior intent will ere long appearsolemnly warned me that unless something were done and speedily we should be burnt to the ground owing to the holes crumbling through the aforesaid blotchy parts where the chimney joined the roof wife said i far better that my house should burn down than that my chimney should be pulled down though but a few feet they call it a wax nose very good not for me to tweak the nose of my superior but at last the man who has a mortgage on the house dropped me a note reminding me that if my chimney was allowed to stand in that invalid condition my policy of insurance would be void this was a sort of hint not to be neglected all the world over the picturesque yields to the pocketesque the mortgagor cared not but the mortgagee did  so another operation was performed the wax nose was taken off and a new one fitted on unfortunately for the expressionbeing put up by a squinteyed mason who at the time had a bad stitch in the same sidethe new nose stands a little awry in the same direction  of one thing however i am proud the horizontal dimensions of the new part are unreduced  large as the chimney appears upon the roof that is nothing to its spaciousness below at its base in the cellar it is precisely twelve feet square and hence covers precisely one hundred and fortyfour superficial feet what an appropriation of terra firma for a chimney and what a huge load for this earth in fact it was only because i and my chimney formed no part of his ancient burden that that stout peddler atlas of old was enabled to stand up so bravely under his pack the dimensions given may perhaps seem fabulous but like those stones at gilgal which joshua set up for a memorial of having passed over jordan does not my chimney remain even unto this day  very often i go down into my cellar and attentively survey that vast square of masonry i stand long and ponder over and wonder at it it has a druidical look away down in the umbrageous cellar there whose numerous vaulted passages and far glens of gloom resemble the dark damp depths of primeval woods so strongly did this conceit steal over me so deeply was i penetrated with wonder at the chimney that one daywhen i was a little out of my mind i now thinkgetting a spade from the garden i set to work digging round the foundation especially at the corners thereof obscurely prompted by dreams of striking upon some old earthenworn memorial of that bygone day when into all this gloom the light of heaven entered as the masons laid the foundationstones peradventure sweltering under an august sun or pelted by a march storm plying my blunted spade how vexed was i by that ungracious interruption of a neighbor who calling to see me upon some business and being informed that i was below said i need not be troubled to come up but he would go down to me and so without ceremony and without my having been forewarned suddenly discovered me digging in my cellar  gold digging sir  nay sir answered i starting i was merelyahemmerelyi say i was merely digginground my chimney  ah loosening the soil to make it grow your chimney sir you regard as too small i suppose needing further development especially at the top  sir said i throwing down the spade do not be personal i and my chimney  personal  sir i look upon this chimney less as a pile of masonry than as a personage it is the king of the house i am but a suffered and inferior subject  in fact i would permit no gibes to be cast at either myself or my chimney and never again did my visitor refer to it in my hearing without coupling some compliment with the mention it well deserves a respectful consideration there it stands solitary and alonenot a councilof ten flues but like his sacred majesty of russia a unit of an autocrat  even to me its dimensions at times seem incredible it does not look so bigno not even in the cellar by the mere eye its magnitude can be but imperfectly comprehended because only one side can be received at one time and said side can only present twelve feet linear measure but then each other side also is twelve feet long and the whole obviously forms a square and twelve times twelve is one hundred and fortyfour and so an adequate conception of the magnitude of this chimney is only to be got at by a sort of process in the higher mathematics by a method somewhat akin to those whereby the surprising distances of fixed stars are computed  it need hardly be said that the walls of my house are entirely free from fireplaces these all congregate in the middlein the one grand central chimney upon all four sides of which are hearthstwo tiers of hearthsso that when in the various chambers my family and guests are warming themselves of a cold winters night just before retiring then though at the time they may not be thinking so all their faces mutually look towards each other yea all their feet point to one centre and when they go to sleep in their beds they all sleep round one warm chimney like so many iroquois indians in the woods round their one heap of embers and just as the indians fire serves not only to keep them comfortable but also to keep off wolves and other savage monsters so my chimney by its obvious smoke at top keeps off prowling burglars from the townsfor what burglar or murderer would dare break into an abode from whose chimney issues such a continual smokebetokening that if the inmates are not stirring at least fires are and in case of an alarm candles may readily be lighted to say nothing of muskets  but stately as is the chimneyyea grand high altar as it is right worthy for the celebration of high mass before the pope of rome and all his cardinalsyet what is there perfect in this world caius julius caesar had he not been so inordinately great they say that brutus cassius antony and the rest had been greater my chimney were it not so mighty in its magnitude my chambers had been larger how often has my wife ruefully told me that my chimney like the english aristocracy casts a contracting shade all round it she avers that endless domestic inconveniences arisemore particularly from the chimneys stubborn central locality the grand objection with her is that it stands midway in the place where a fine entrancehall ought to be in truth there is no hall whatever to the housenothing but a sort of square landingplace as you enter from the wide front door a roomy enough landingplace i admit but not attaining to the dignity of a hall now as the front door is precisely in the middle of the front of the house inwards it faces the chimney in fact the opposite wall of the landingplace is formed solely by the chimney and henceowing to the gradual tapering of the chimneyis a little less than twelve feet in width climbing the chimney in this part is the principal staircasewhich by three abrupt turns and three minor landingplaces mounts to the second floor where over the front door runs a sort of narrow gallery something less than twelve feet long leading to chambers on either hand this gallery of course is railed and so looking down upon the stairs and all those landingplaces together with the main one at bottom resembles not a little a balcony for musicians in some jolly old abode in times elizabethan shall i tell a weakness i cherish the cobwebs there and many a time arrest biddy in the act of brushing them with her broom and have many a quarrel with my wife and daughters about it  now the ceiling so to speak of the place where you enter the house that ceiling is in fact the ceiling of the second floor not the first the two floors are made one here so that ascending this turning stairs you seem going up into a kind of soaring tower or lighthouse at the second landing midway up the chimney is a mysterious door entering to a mysterious closet and here i keep mysterious cordials of a choice mysterious flavor made so by the constant nurturing and subtle ripening of the chimneys gentle heat distilled through that warm mass of masonry better for wines is it than voyages to the indias my chimney itself a tropic a chair by my chimney in a november day is as good for an invalid as a long season spent in cuba often i think how grapes might ripen against my chimney how my wifes geraniums bud there bud in december her eggs toocant keep them near the chimney an account of the hatching ah a warm heart has my chimney  how often my wife was at me about that projected grand entrancehall of hers which was to be knocked clean through the chimney from one end of the house to the other and astonish all guests by its generous amplitude but wife said i the chimneyconsider the chimney if you demolish the foundation what is to support the superstructure oh that will rest on the second floor the truth is women know next to nothing about the realities of architecture however my wife still talked of running her entries and partitions she spent many long nights elaborating her plans in imagination building her boasted hall through the chimney as though its high mightiness were a mere spear of sorreltop at last i gently reminded her that little as she might fancy it the chimney was a facta sober substantial fact which in all her plannings it would be well to take into full consideration but this was not of much avail  and here respectfully craving her permission i must say a few words about this enterprising wife of mine though in years nearly old as myself in spirit she is young as my little sorrel mare trigger that threw me last fall what is extraordinary though she comes of a rheumatic family she is straight as a pine never has any aches while for me with the sciatica i am sometimes as crippled up as any old appletree but she has not so much as a toothache as for her hearinglet me enter the house in my dusty boots and she away up in the attic and for her sightbiddy the housemaid tells other peoples housemaids that her mistress will spy a spot on the dresser straight through the pewter platter put up on purpose to hide it her faculties are alert as her limbs and her senses no danger of my spouse dying of torpor the longest night in the year ive known her lie awake planning her campaign for the morrow she is a natural projector the maxim whatever is is right is not hers her maxim is whatever is is wrong and what is more must be altered and what is still more must be altered right away dreadful maxim for the wife of a dozy old dreamer like me who dote on seventh days as days of rest and out of a sabbatical horror of industry will on a week day go out of my road a quarter of a mile to avoid the sight of a man at work  that matches are made in heaven may be but my wife would have been just the wife for peter the great or peter the piper how she would have set in order that huge littered empire of the one and with indefatigable painstaking picked the peck of pickled peppers for the other  but the most wonderful thing is my wife never thinks of her end her youthful incredulity as to the plain theory and still plainer fact of death hardly seems christian advanced in years as she knows she must be my wife seems to think that she is to teem on and be inexhaustible forever she doesnt believe in old age at that strange promise in the plain of mamre my old wife unlike old abrahams would not have jeeringly laughed within herself  judge how to me who sitting in the comfortable shadow of my chimney smoking my comfortable pipe with ashes not unwelcome at my feet and ashes not unwelcome all but in my mouth and who am thus in a comfortable sort of not unwelcome though indeed ashy enough way reminded of the ultimate exhaustion even of the most fiery life judge how to me this unwarrantable vitality in my wife must come sometimes it is true with a moral and a calm but oftener with a breeze and a ruffle  if the doctrine be true that in wedlock contraries attract by how cogent a fatality must i have been drawn to my wife while spicily impatient of present and past like a glass of gingerbeer she overflows with her schemes and with like energy as she puts down her foot puts down her preserves and her pickles and lives with them in a continual future or ever full of expectations both from time and space is ever restless for newspapers and ravenous for letters content with the years that are gone taking no thought for the morrow and looking for no new thing from any person or quarter whatever i have not a single scheme or expectation on earth save in unequal resistance of the undue encroachment of hers  old myself i take to oldness in things for that cause mainly loving old montague and old cheese and old wine and eschewing young people hot rolls new books and early potatoes and very fond of my old clawfooted chair and old clubfooted deacon white my neighbor and that still nigher old neighbor my betwisted old grapevine that of a summer evening leans in his elbow for cosy company at my windowsill while i within doors lean over mine to meet his and above all high above all am fond of my highmantled old chimney but she out of the infatuate juvenility of hers takes to nothing but newness for that cause mainly loving new cider in autumn and in spring as if she were own daughter of nebuchadnezzar fairly raving after all sorts of salads and spinages and more particularly green cucumbers though all the time nature rebukes such unsuitable young hankerings in so elderly a person by never permitting such things to agree with her and has an itch after recentlydiscovered fine prospects so no graveyard be in the background and also after swedenborganism and the spirit rapping philosophy with other new views alike in things natural and unnatural and immortally hopeful is forever making new flowerbeds even on the north side of the house where the bleak mountain wind would scarce allow the wiry weed called hardhack to gain a thorough footing and on the roadside sets out mere pipestems of young elms though there is no hope of any shade from them except over the ruins of her great granddaughters gravestones and wont wear caps but plaits her gray hair and takes the ladies magazine for the fashions and always buys her new almanac a month before the new year and rises at dawn and to the warmest sunset turns a cold shoulder and still goes on at odd hours with her new course of history and her french and her music and likes a young company and offers to ride young colts and sets out young suckers in the orchard and has a spite against my elbowed old grapevine and my clubfooted old neighbor and my clawfooted old chair and above all high above all would fain persecute until death my highmantled old chimney by what perverse magic i a thousand times think does such a very autumnal old lady have such a very vernal young soul when i would remonstrate at times she spins round on me with oh dont you grumble old man she always calls me old man its i young i that keep you from stagnating well i suppose it is so yea after all these things are well ordered my wife as one of her poor relations good soul intimates is the salt of the earth and none the less the salt of my sea which otherwise were unwholesome she is its monsoon too blowing a brisk gale over it in the one steady direction of my chimney  not insensible of her superior energies my wife has frequently made me propositions to take upon herself all the responsibilities of my affairs she is desirous that domestically i should abdicate that renouncing further rule like the venerable charles v i should retire into some sort of monastery but indeed the chimney excepted i have little authority to lay down by my wifes ingenious application of the principle that certain things belong of right to female jurisdiction i find myself through my easy compliances insensibly stripped by degrees of one masculine prerogative after another in a dream i go about my fields a sort of lazy happygolucky goodfornothing loafing old lear only by some sudden revelation am i reminded who is over me as year before last one day seeing in one corner of the premises fresh deposits of mysterious boards and timbers the oddity of the incident at length begat serious meditation wife said i whose boards and timbers are those i see near the orchard there do you know anything about them wife who put them there you know i do not like the neighbors to use my land that way they should ask permission first  she regarded me with a pitying smile  why old man dont you know i am building a new barn didnt you know that old man  this is the poor old lady who was accusing me of tyrannizing over her  to return now to the chimney upon being assured of the futility of her proposed hall so long as the obstacle remained for a time my wife was for a modified project but i could never exactly comprehend it as far as i could see through it it seemed to involve the general idea of a sort of irregular archway or elbowed tunnel which was to penetrate the chimney at some convenient point under the staircase and carefully avoiding dangerous contact with the fireplaces and particularly steering clear of the great interior flue was to conduct the enterprising traveler from the front door all the way into the diningroom in the remote rear of the mansion doubtless it was a bold stroke of genius that plan of hers and so was neros when he schemed his grand canal through the isthmus of corinth nor will i take oath that had her project been accomplished then by help of lights hung at judicious intervals through the tunnel some belzoni or other might have succeeded in future ages in penetrating through the masonry and actually emerging into the diningroom and once there it would have been inhospitable treatment of such a traveler to have denied him a recruiting meal  but my bustling wife did not restrict her objections nor in the end confine her proposed alterations to the first floor her ambition was of the mounting order she ascended with her schemes to the second floor and so to the attic perhaps there was some small ground for her discontent with things as they were the truth is there was no regular passageway upstairs or down unless we again except that little orchestragallery before mentioned and all this was owing to the chimney which my gamesome spouse seemed despitefully to regard as the bully of the house on all its four sides nearly all the chambers sidled up to the chimney for the benefit of a fireplace the chimney would not go to them they must needs go to it the consequence was almost every room like a philosophical system was in itself an entry or passageway to other rooms and systems of roomsa whole suite of entries in fact going through the house you seem to be forever going somewhere and getting nowhere it is like losing ones self in the woods round and round the chimney you go and if you arrive at all it is just where you started and so you begin again and again get nowhere indeedthough i say it not in the way of faultfinding at allnever was there so labyrinthine an abode guests will tarry with me several weeks and every now and then be anew astonished at some unforseen apartment  the puzzling nature of the mansion resulting from the chimney is peculiarly noticeable in the diningroom which has no less than nine doors opening in all directions and into all sorts of places a stranger for the first time entering this diningroom and naturally taking no special heed at which door he entered will upon rising to depart commit the strangest blunders such for instance as opening the first door that comes handy and finding himself stealing upstairs by the back passage shutting that he will proceed to another and be aghast at the cellar yawning at his feet trying a third he surprises the housemaid at her work in the end no more relying on his own unaided efforts he procures a trusty guide in some passing person and in good time successfully emerges perhaps as curious a blunder as any was that of a certain stylish young gentleman a great exquisite in whose judicious eyes my daughter anna had found especial favor he called upon the young lady one evening and found her alone in the diningroom at her needlework he stayed rather late and after abundance of superfine discourse all the while retaining his hat and cane made his profuse adieus and with repeated graceful bows proceeded to depart after fashion of courtiers from the queen and by so doing opening a door at random with one hand placed behind very effectually succeeded in backing himself into a dark pantry where he carefully shut himself up wondering there was no light in the entry after several strange noises as of a cat among the crockery he reappeared through the same door looking uncommonly crestfallen and with a deeply embarrassed air requested my daughter to designate at which of the nine he should find exit when the mischievous anna told me the story she said it was surprising how unaffected and matteroffact the young gentlemans manner was after his reappearance he was more candid than ever to be sure having inadvertently thrust his white kids into an open drawer of havana sugar under the impression probably that being what they call a sweet fellow his route might possibly lie in that direction  another inconvenience resulting from the chimney is the bewilderment of a guest in gaining his chamber many strange doors lying between him and it to direct him by fingerposts would look rather queer and just as queer in him to be knocking at every door on his route like londons city guest the king at templebar  now of all these things and many many more my family continually complained at last my wife came out with her sweeping propositionin toto to abolish the chimney  what said i abolish the chimney to take out the backbone of anything wife is a hazardous affair spines out of backs and chimneys out of houses are not to be taken like frosted lead pipes from the ground besides added i the chimney is the one grand permanence of this abode if undisturbed by innovators then in future ages when all the house shall have crumbled from it this chimney will still survivea bunker hill monument no no wife i cant abolish my backbone  so said i then but who is sure of himself especially an old man with both wife and daughters ever at his elbow and ear in time i was persuaded to think a little better of it in short to take the matter into preliminary consideration at length it came to pass that a mastermasona rough sort of architectone mr scribe was summoned to a conference i formally introduced him to my chimney a previous introduction from my wife had introduced him to myself he had been not a little employed by that lady in preparing plans and estimates for some of her extensive operations in drainage having with much ado exhorted from my spouse the promise that she would leave us to an unmolested survey i began by leading mr scribe down to the root of the matter in the cellar lamp in hand i descended for though upstairs it was noon below it was night  we seemed in the pyramids and i with one hand holding my lamp over head and with the other pointing out in the obscurity the hoar mass of the chimney seemed some arab guide showing the cobwebbed mausoleum of the great god apis  this is a most remarkable structure sir said the mastermason after long contemplating it in silence a most remarkable structure sir  yes said i complacently every one says so  but large as it appears above the roof i would not have inferred the magnitude of this foundation sir eyeing it critically  then taking out his rule he measured it  twelve feet square one hundred and fortyfour square feet sir this house would appear to have been built simply for the accommodation of your chimney  yes my chimney and me tell me candidly now i added would you have such a famous chimney abolished  i wouldnt have it in a house of mine sir for a gift was the reply its a losing affair altogether sir do you know sir that in retaining this chimney you are losing not only one hundred and fortyfour square feet of good ground but likewise a considerable interest upon a considerable principal  how  look sir said he taking a bit of red chalk from his pocket and figuring against a whitewashed wall twenty times eight is so and so then fortytwo times thirtynine is so and soaint it sir well add those together and subtract this here then that makes so and so still chalking away  to be brief after no small ciphering mr scribe informed me that my chimney contained i am ashamed to say how many thousand and odd valuable bricks  no more said i fidgeting pray now let us have a look above  in that upper zone we made two more circumnavigations for the first and second floors that done we stood together at the foot of the stairway by the front door my hand upon the knob and mr scribe hat in hand  well sir said he a sort of feeling his way and to help himself fumbling with his hat well sir i think it can be done  what pray mr scribe what can be done  your chimney sir it can without rashness be removed i think  i will think of it too mr scribe said i turning the knob and bowing him towards the open space without i will think of it sir it demands consideration much obliged to ye good morning mr scribe  it is all arranged then cried my wife with great glee bursting from the nighest room  when will they begin demanded my daughter julia  tomorrow asked anna  patience patience my dears said i such a big chimney is not to be abolished in a minute  next morning it began again  you remember the chimney said my wife wife said i it is never out of my house and never out of my mind  but when is mr scribe to begin to pull it down asked anna  not today anna said i  when then demanded julia in alarm  now if this chimney of mine was for size a sort of belfry for dingdonging at me about it my wife and daughters were a sort of bells always chiming together or taking up each others melodies at every pause my wife the keyclapper of all a very sweet ringing and pealing and chiming i confess but then the most silvery of bells may sometimes dismally toll as well as merrily play and as touching the subject in question it became so now perceiving a strange relapse of opposition in me wife and daughters began a soft and dirgelike melancholy tolling over it  at length my wife getting much excited declared to me with pointed finger that so long as that chimney stood she should regard it as the monument of what she called my broken pledge but finding this did not answer the next day she gave me to understand that either she or the chimney must quit the house  finding matters coming to such a pass i and my pipe philosophized over them awhile and finally concluded between us that little as our hearts went with the plan yet for peace sake i might write out the chimneys deathwarrant and while my hand was in scratch a note to mr scribe  considering that i and my chimney and my pipe from having been so much together were three great cronies the facility with which my pipe consented to a project so fatal to the goodliest of our trio or rather the way in which i and my pipe in secret conspired together as it were against our unsuspicious old comradethis may seem rather strange if not suggestive of sad reflections upon us two but indeed we sons of clay that is my pipe and i are no whit better than the rest far from us indeed to have volunteered the betrayal of our crony we are of a peaceable nature too but that love of peace it was which made us false to a mutual friend as soon as his cause demanded a vigorous vindication but i rejoice to add that better and braver thoughts soon returned as will now briefly be set forth  to my note mr scribe replied in person  once more we made a survey mainly now with a view to a pecuniary estimate  i will do it for five hundred dollars said mr scribe at last again hat in hand  very well mr scribe i will think of it replied i again bowing him to the door  not unvexed by this for the second time unexpected response again he withdrew and from my wife and daughters again burst the old exclamations  the truth is resolved how i would at the last pinch i and my chimney could not be parted  so holofernes will have his way never mind whose heart breaks for it said my wife next morning at breakfast in that halfdidactic halfreproachful way of hers which is harder to bear than her most energetic assault holofernes too is with her a pet name for any fell domestic despot so whenever against her most ambitious innovations those which saw me quite across the grain i as in the present instance stand with however little steadfastness on the defence she is sure to call me holofernes and ten to one takes the first opportunity to read aloud with a suppressed emphasis of an evening the first newspaper paragraph about some tyrannic daylaborer who after being for many years the caligula of his family ends by beating his longsuffering spouse to death with a garret door wrenched off its hinges and then pitching his little innocents out of the window suicidally turns inward towards the broken wall scored with the butchers and bakers bills and so rushes headlong to his dreadful account  nevertheless for a few days not a little to my surprise i heard no further reproaches an intense calm pervaded my wife but beneath which as in the sea there was no knowing what portentous movements might be going on she frequently went abroad and in a direction which i thought not unsuspicious namely in the direction of new petra a griffinlike house of wood and stucco in the highest style of ornamental art graced with four chimneys in the form of erect dragons spouting smoke from their nostrils the elegant modern residence of mr scribe which he had built for the purpose of a standing advertisement not more of his taste as an architect than his solidity as a mastermason  at last smoking my pipe one morning i heard a rap at the door and my wife with an air unusually quiet for her brought me a note as i have no correspondents except solomon with whom in his sentiments at least i entirely correspond the note occasioned me some little surprise which was not dismissed upon reading the following  new petra april 1st  sirduring my last examination of your chimney possibly you may have noted that i frequently applied my rule to it in a manner apparently unnecessary possibly also at the same time you might have observed in me more or less of perplexity to which however i refrained from giving any verbal expression  i now feel it obligatory upon me to inform you of what was then but a dim suspicion and as such would have been unwise to give utterance to but which now from various subsequent calculations assuming no little probability it may be important that you should not remain in further ignorance of  it is my solemn duty to warn you sir that there is architectural cause to conjecture that somewhere concealed in your chimney is a reserved space hermetically closed in short a secret chamber or rather closet how long it has been there it is for me impossible to say what it contains is hid with itself in darkness but probably a secret closet would not have been contrived except for some extraordinary object whether for the concealment of treasure or for what other purpose may be left to those better acquainted with the history of the house to guess  but enough in making this disclosure sir my conscience is eased whatever step you choose to take upon it is of course a matter of indifference to me though i confess as respects the character of the closet i cannot but share in a natural curiosity trusting that you may be guided aright in determining whether it is christianlike knowingly to reside in a house hidden in which is a secret closet i remain with much respect  yours very humbly  hiram scribe   my first thought upon reading this note was not of the alleged mystery of manner to which at the outset it alludedfor none such had i at all observed in the mastermason during his surveysbut of my late kinsman captain julian dacres long a shipmaster and merchant in the indian trade who about thirty years ago and at the ripe age of ninety died a bachelor and in this very house which he had built he was supposed to have retired into this country with a large fortune but to the general surprise after being at great cost in building himself this mansion he settled down into a sedate reserved and inexpensive old age which by the neighbors was thought all the better for his heirs but lo upon opening the will his property was found to consist but of the house and grounds and some ten thousand dollars in stocks but the place being found heavily mortgaged was in consequence sold gossip had its day and left the grass quietly to creep over the captains grave where he still slumbers in a privacy as unmolested as if the billows of the indian ocean instead of the billows of inland verdure rolled over him still i remembered long ago hearing strange solutions whispered by the country people for the mystery involving his will and by reflex himself and that too as well in conscience as purse but people who could circulate the report which they did that captain julian dacres had in his day been a borneo pirate surely were not worthy of credence in their collateral notions it is queer what wild whimsies of rumors will like toadstools spring up about any eccentric stranger who settling down among a rustic population keeps quietly to himself with some inoffensiveness would seem a prime cause of offense but what chiefly had led me to scout at these rumors particularly as referring to concealed treasure was the circumstance that the stranger the same who razeed the roof and the chimney into whose hands the estate had passed on my kinsmans death was of that sort of character that had there been the least ground for those reports he would speedily have tested them by tearing down and rummaging the walls  nevertheless the note of mr scribe so strangely recalling the memory of my kinsman very naturally chimed in with what had been mysterious or at least unexplained about him vague flashings of ingots united in my mind with vague gleamings of skulls but the first cool thought soon dismissed such chimeras and with a calm smile i turned towards my wife who meantime had been sitting nearby impatient enough i dare say to know who could have taken it into his head to write me a letter  well old man said she who is it from and what is it about  read it wife said i handing it  read it she did and thensuch an explosion i will not pretend to describe her emotions or repeat her expressions enough that my daughters were quickly called in to share the excitement although they had never dreamed of such a revelation as mr scribes yet upon the first suggestion they instinctively saw the extreme likelihood of it in corroboration they cited first my kinsman and second my chimney alleging that the profound mystery involving the former and the equally profound masonry involving the latter though both acknowledged facts were alike preposterous on any other supposition than the secret closet  but all this time i was quietly thinking to myself could it be hidden from me that my credulity in this instance would operate very favorably to a certain plan of theirs how to get to the secret closet or how to have any certainty about it at all without making such fell work with my chimney as to render its set destruction superfluous that my wife wished to get rid of the chimney it needed no reflection to show and that mr scribe for all his pretended disinterestedness was not opposed to pocketing five hundred dollars by the operation seemed equally evident that my wife had in secret laid heads together with mr scribe i at present refrain from affirming but when i consider her enmity against my chimney and the steadiness with which at the last she is wont to carry out her schemes if by hook or crook she can especially after having been once baffled why i scarcely knew at what step of hers to be surprised  of one thing only was i resolved that i and my chimney should not budge  in vain all protests next morning i went out into the road where i had noticed a diabolicallooking old gander that for its doughty exploits in the way of scratching into forbidden enclosures had been rewarded by its master with a portentous fourpronged wooden decoration in the shape of a collar of the order of the garotte this gander i cornered and rummaging out its stiffest quill plucked it took it home and making a stiff pen inscribed the following stiff note     chimney side april 2    mr scribe    sirfor your conjecture we return you our joint thanks and    compliments and beg leave to assure you that we shall remain    very faithfully    the same    i and my chimney  of course for this epistle we had to endure some pretty sharp raps but having at last explicitly understood from me that mr scribes note had not altered my mind one jot my wife to move me among other things said that if she remembered aright there was a statute placing the keeping in private of secret closets on the same unlawful footing with the keeping of gunpowder but it had no effect  a few days after my spouse changed her key  it was nearly midnight and all were in bed but ourselves who sat up one in each chimneycorner she needles in hand indefatigably knitting a sock i pipe in mouth indolently weaving my vapors  it was one of the first of the chill nights in autumn there was a fire on the hearth burning low the air without was torpid and heavy the wood by an oversight of the sort called soggy  do look at the chimney she began cant you see that something must be in it  yes wife truly there is smoke in the chimney as in mr scribes note  smoke yes indeed and in my eyes too how you two wicked old sinners do smokethis wicked old chimney and you  wife said i i and my chimney like to have a quiet smoke together it is true but we dont like to be called names  now dear old man said she softening down and a little shifting the subject when you think of that old kinsman of yours you know there must be a secret closet in this chimney  secret ashhole wife why dont you have it yes i dare say there is a secret ashhole in the chimney for where do all the ashes go to that drop down the queer hole yonder  i know where they go to ive been there almost as many times as the cat  what devil wife prompted you to crawl into the ashhole dont you know that st dunstans devil emerged from the ashhole you will get your death one of these days exploring all about as you do but supposing there be a secret closet what then  what then why what should be in a secret closet but  dry bones wife broke in i with a puff while the sociable old chimney broke in with another  there again oh how this wretched old chimney smokes wiping her eyes with her handkerchief ive no doubt the reason it smokes so is because that secret closet interferes with the flue do see too how the jambs here keep settling and its down hill all the way from the door to this hearth this horrid old chimney will fall on our heads yet depend upon it old man  yes wife i do depend on it yes indeed i place every dependence on my chimney as for its settling i like it i too am settling you know in my gait i and my chimney are settling together and shall keep settling too till as in a great featherbed we shall both have settled away clean out of sight but this secret oven i mean secret closet of yours wife where exactly do you suppose that secret closet is  that is for mr scribe to say  but suppose he cannot say exactly what then  why then he can prove i am sure that it must be somewhere or other in this horrid old chimney  and if he cant prove that what then  why then old man with a stately air i shall say little more about it  agreed wife returned i knocking my pipebowl against the jamb and now tomorrow i will for a third time send for mr scribe wife the sciatica takes me be so good as to put this pipe on the mantel  if you get the stepladder for me i will this shocking old chimney this abominable oldfashioned old chimneys mantels are so high i cant reach them  no opportunity however trivial was overlooked for a subordinate fling at the pile  here by way of introduction it should be mentioned that besides the fireplaces all round it the chimney was in the most haphazard way excavated on each floor for certain curious outoftheway cupboards and closets of all sorts and sizes clinging here and there like nests in the crotches of some old oak on the second floor these closets were by far the most irregular and numerous and yet this should hardly have been so since the theory of the chimney was that it pyramidically diminished as it ascended the abridgment of its square on the roof was obvious enough and it was supposed that the reduction must be methodically graduated from bottom to top  mr scribe said i when the next day with an eager aspect that individual again came my object in sending for you this morning is not to arrange for the demolition of my chimney nor to have any particular conversation about it but simply to allow you every reasonable facility for verifying if you can the conjecture communicated in your note  though in secret not a little crestfallen it may be by my phlegmatic reception so different from what he had looked for with much apparent alacrity he commenced the survey throwing open the cupboards on the first floor and peering into the closets on the second measuring one within and then comparing that measurement with the measurement without removing the fireboards he would gaze up the flues but no sign of the hidden work yet  now on the second floor the rooms were the most rambling conceivable they as it were dovetailed into each other they were of all shapes not one mathematically square room among them alla peculiarity which by the mastermason had not been unobserved with a significant not to say portentous expression he took a circuit of the chimney measuring the area of each room around it then going down stairs and out of doors he measured the entire ground area then compared the sum total of the areas of all the rooms on the second floor with the ground area then returning to me in no small excitement announced that there was a difference of no less than two hundred and odd square feetroom enough in all conscience for a secret closet  but mr scribe said i stroking my chin have you allowed for the walls both main and sectional they take up some space you know  ah i had forgotten that tapping his forehead but still ciphering on his paper that will not make up the deficiency  but mr scribe have you allowed for the recesses of so many fireplaces on a floor and for the firewalls and the flues in short mr scribe have you allowed for the legitimate chimney itselfsome one hundred and fortyfour square feet or thereabouts mr scribe  how unaccountable that slipped my mind too  did it indeed mr scribe  he faltered a little and burst forth with but we must now allow one hundred and fortyfour square feet for the legitimate chimney my position is that within those undue limits the secret closet is contained  i eyed him in silence a moment then spoke  your survey is concluded mr scribe be so good now as to lay your finger upon the exact part of the chimney wall where you believe this secret closet to be or would a witchhazel wand assist you mr scribe  no sir but a crowbar would he with temper rejoined  here now thought i to myself the cat leaps out of the bag i looked at him with a calm glance under which he seemed somewhat uneasy more than ever now i suspected a plot i remembered what my wife had said about abiding by the decision of mr scribe in a bland way i resolved to buy up the decision of mr scribe  sir said i really i am much obliged to you for this survey it has quite set my mind at rest and no doubt you too mr scribe must feel much relieved sir i added you have made three visits to the chimney with a business man time is money here are fifty dollars mr scribe nay take it you have earned it your opinion is worth it and by the wayas he modestly received the moneyhave you any objections to give me aalittle certificatesomething say like a steamboat certificate certifying that you a competent surveyor have surveyed my chimney and found no reason to believe any unsoundness in short anyany secret closet in it would you be so kind mr scribe  but but sir stammered he with honest hesitation  here here are pen and paper said i with entire assurance  enough  that evening i had the certificate framed and hung over the diningroom fireplace trusting that the continual sight of it would forever put at rest at once the dreams and stratagems of my household  but no inveterately bent upon the extirpation of that noble old chimney still to this day my wife goes about it with my daughter annas geological hammer tapping the wall all over and then holding her ear against it as i have seen the physicians of life insurance companies tap a mans chest and then incline over for the echo sometimes of nights she almost frightens one going about on this phantom errand and still following the sepulchral response of the chimney round and round as if it were leading her to the threshold of the secret closet  how hollow it sounds she will hollowly cry yes i declare with an emphatic tap there is a secret closet here here in this very spot hark how hollow  psha wife of course it is hollow who ever heard of a solid chimney but nothing avails and my daughters take after not me but their mother  sometimes all three abandon the theory of the secret closet and return to the genuine ground of attackthe unsightliness of so cumbrous a pile with comments upon the great addition of room to be gained by its demolition and the fine effect of the projected grand hall and the convenience resulting from the collateral running in one direction and another of their various partitions not more ruthlessly did the three powers partition away poor poland than my wife and daughters would fain partition away my chimney  but seeing that despite all i and my chimney still smoke our pipes my wife reoccupies the ground of the secret closet enlarging upon what wonders are there and what a shame it is not to seek it out and explore it  wife said i upon one of these occasions why speak more of that secret closet when there before you hangs contrary testimony of a master mason elected by yourself to decide besides even if there were a secret closet secret it should remain and secret it shall yes wife here for once i must say my say infinite sad mischief has resulted from the profane bursting open of secret recesses though standing in the heart of this house though hitherto we have all nestled about it unsuspicious of aught hidden within this chimney may or may not have a secret closet but if it have it is my kinsmans to break into that wall would be to break into his breast and that wallbreaking wish of momus i account the wish of a churchrobbing gossip and knave yes wife a vile eavesdropping varlet was momus  moses mumps stuff with your mumps and moses  the truth is my wife like all the rest of the world cares not a fig for philosophical jabber in dearth of other philosophical companionship i and my chimney have to smoke and philosophize together and sitting up so late as we do at it a mighty smoke it is that we two smoky old philosophers make  but my spouse who likes the smoke of my tobacco as little as she does that of the soot carries on her war against both i live in continual dread lest like the golden bowl the pipes of me and my chimney shall yet be broken to stay that mad project of my wifes naught answers or rather she herself is incessantly answering incessantly besetting me with her terrible alacrity for improvement which is a softer name for destruction scarce a day i do not find her with her tapemeasure measuring for her grand hall while anna holds a yardstick on one side and julia looks approvingly on from the other mysterious intimations appear in the nearest village paper signed claude to the effect that a certain structure standing on a certain hill is a sad blemish to an otherwise lovely landscape anonymous letters arrive threatening me with i know not what unless i remove my chimney is it my wife too or who that sets up the neighbors to badgering me on the same subject and hinting to me that my chimney like a huge elm absorbs all moisture from my garden at night also my wife will start as from sleep professing to hear ghostly noises from the secret closet assailed on all sides and in all ways small peace have i and my chimney  were it not for the baggage we would together pack up and remove from the country  what narrow escapes have been ours once i found in a drawer a whole portfolio of plans and estimates another time upon returning after a days absence i discovered my wife standing before the chimney in earnest conversation with a person whom i at once recognized as a meddlesome architectural reformer who because he had no gift for putting up anything was ever intent upon pulling them down in various parts of the country having prevailed upon halfwitted old folks to destroy their oldfashioned houses particularly the chimneys  but worst of all was that time i unexpectedly returned at early morning from a visit to the city and upon approaching the house narrowly escaped three brickbats which fell from high aloft at my feet glancing up what was my horror to see three savages in blue jean overalls in the very act of commencing the longthreatened attack aye indeed thinking of those three brickbats i and my chimney have had narrow escapes  it is now some seven years since i have stirred from my home my city friends all wonder why i dont come to see them as in former times they think i am getting sour and unsocial some say that i have become a sort of mossy old misanthrope while all the time the fact is i am simply standing guard over my mossy old chimney for it is resolved between me and my chimney that i and my chimney will never surrender
