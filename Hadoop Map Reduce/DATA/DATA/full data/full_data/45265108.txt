45265108	the lesson of the master by henry james   chapter i   he had been told the ladies were at church but this was corrected by what he saw from the top of the stepsthey descended from a great height in two arms with a circular sweep of the most charming effectat the threshold of the door which from the long bright gallery overlooked the immense lawn  three gentlemen on the grass at a distance sat under the great trees while the fourth figure showed a crimson dress that told as a bit of colour amid the fresh rich green  the servant had so far accompanied paul overt as to introduce him to this view after asking him if he wished first to go to his room  the young man declined that privilege conscious of no disrepair from so short and easy a journey and always liking to take at once a general perceptive possession of a new scene  he stood there a little with his eyes on the group and on the admirable picture the wide grounds of an old countryhouse near londonthat only made it betteron a splendid sunday in june  but that lady whos she he said to the servant before the man left him  i think shes mrs st george sir  mrs st george the wife of the distinguished  then paul overt checked himself doubting if a footman would know  yes sirprobably sir said his guide who appeared to wish to intimate that a person staying at summersoft would naturally be if only by alliance distinguished  his tone however made poor overt himself feel for the moment scantly so  and the gentlemen overt went on  well sir one of thems general fancourt  ah yes i know thank you  general fancourt was distinguished there was no doubt of that for something he had done or perhaps even hadnt donethe young man couldnt remember whichsome years before in india the servant went away leaving the glass doors open into the gallery and paul overt remained at the head of the wide double staircase saying to himself that the place was sweet and promised a pleasant visit while he leaned on the balustrade of fine old ironwork which like all the other details was of the same period as the house  it all went together and spoke in one voicea rich english voice of the early part of the eighteenth century  it might have been churchtime on a summers day in the reign of queen anne the stillness was too perfect to be modern the nearness counted so as distance and there was something so fresh and sound in the originality of the large smooth house the expanse of beautiful brickwork that showed for pink rather than red and that had been kept clear of messy creepers by the law under which a woman with a rare complexion disdains a veil  when paul overt became aware that the people under the trees had noticed him he turned back through the open doors into the great gallery which was the pride of the place  it marched across from end to end and seemedwith its bright colours its high panelled windows its faded flowered chintzes its quicklyrecognised portraits and pictures the blueandwhite china of its cabinets and the attenuated festoons and rosettes of its ceilinga cheerful upholstered avenue into the other century  our friend was slightly nervous that went with his character as a student of fine prose went with the artists general disposition to vibrate and there was a particular thrill in the idea that henry st george might be a member of the party  for the young aspirant he had remained a high literary figure in spite of the lower range of production to which he had fallen after his first three great successes the comparative absence of quality in his later work  there had been moments when paul overt almost shed tears for this but now that he was near himhe had never met himhe was conscious only of the fine original source and of his own immense debt  after he had taken a turn or two up and down the gallery he came out again and descended the steps he was but slenderly supplied with a certain social boldnessit was really a weakness in himso that conscious of a want of acquaintance with the four persons in the distance he gave way to motions recommended by their not committing him to a positive approach  there was a fine english awkwardness in thishe felt that too as he sauntered vaguely and obliquely across the lawn taking an independent line  fortunately there was an equally fine english directness in the way one of the gentlemen presently rose and made as if to stalk him though with an air of conciliation and reassurance  to this demonstration paul overt instantly responded even if the gentleman were not his host  he was tall straight and elderly and had like the great house itself a pink smiling face and into the bargain a white moustache  our young man met him halfway while he laughed and said erlady watermouth told us you were coming she asked me just to look after you  paul overt thanked him liking him on the spot and turned round with him to walk toward the others  theyve all gone to churchall except us the stranger continued as they went were just sitting hereits so jolly  overt pronounced it jolly indeed it was such a lovely place  he mentioned that he was having the charming impression for the first time  ah youve not been here before said his companion  its a nice little placenot much to do you know  overt wondered what he wanted to dohe felt that he himself was doing so much  by the time they came to where the others sat he had recognised his initiator for a military man andsuch was the turn of overts imaginationhad found him thus still more sympathetic  he would naturally have a need for action for deeds at variance with the pacific pastoral scene  he was evidently so goodnatured however that he accepted the inglorious hour for what it was worth  paul overt shared it with him and with his companions for the next twenty minutes the latter looked at him and he looked at them without knowing much who they were while the talk went on without much telling him even what it meant  it seemed indeed to mean nothing in particular it wandered with casual pointless pauses and short terrestrial flights amid names of persons and placesnames which for our friend had no great power of evocation  it was all sociable and slow as was right and natural of a warm sunday morning  his first attention was given to the question privately considered of whether one of the two younger men would be henry st george  he knew many of his distinguished contemporaries by their photographs but had never as happened seen a portrait of the great misguided novelist  one of the gentlemen was unimaginablehe was too young and the other scarcely looked clever enough with such mild undiscriminating eyes  if those eyes were st georges the problem presented by the illmatched parts of his genius would be still more difficult of solution  besides the deportment of their proprietor was not as regards the lady in the red dress such as could be natural toward the wife of his bosom even to a writer accused by several critics of sacrificing too much to manner lastly paul overt had a vague sense that if the gentleman with the expressionless eyes bore the name that had set his heart beating faster he also had contradictory conventional whiskersthe young admirer of the celebrity had never in a mental vision seen his face in so vulgar a frame he would have given him a sign of recognition or of friendliness would have heard of him a little would know something about ginistrella would have an impression of how that fresh fiction had caught the eye of real criticism  paul overt had a dread of being grossly proud but even morbid modesty might view the authorship of ginistrella as constituting a degree of identity  his soldierly friend became clear enough he was fancourt but was also the general and he mentioned to the new visitor in the course of a few moments that he had but lately returned from twenty years service abroad  and now you remain in england the young man asked  oh yes ive bought a small house in london  and i hope you like it said overt looking at mrs st george  well a little house in manchester squaretheres a limit to the enthusiasm that inspires  oh i meant being at home againbeing back in piccadilly  my daughter likes piccadillythats the main thing  shes very fond of art and music and literature and all that kind of thing  she missed it in india and she finds it in london or she hopes shell find it  mr st george has promised to help herhe has been awfully kind to her  she has gone to churchshes fond of that toobut theyll all be back in a quarter of an hour  you must let me introduce you to hershell be so glad to know you  i dare say she has read every blest word youve written  i shall be delightedi havent written so very many overt pleaded feeling and without resentment that the general at least was vagueness itself about that  but he wondered a little why expressing this friendly disposition it didnt occur to the doubtless eminent soldier to pronounce the word that would put him in relation with mrs st george if it was a question of introductions miss fancourtapparently as yet unmarriedwas far away while the wife of his illustrious confrere was almost between them  this lady struck paul overt as altogether pretty with a surprising juvenility and a high smartness of aspect something thathe could scarcely have said whyserved for mystification  st george certainly had every right to a charming wife but he himself would never have imagined the important little woman in the aggressively parisian dress the partner for life the alter ego of a man of letters that partner in general he knew that second self was far from presenting herself in a single type observation had taught him that she was not inveterately not necessarily plain  but he had never before seen her look so much as if her prosperity had deeper foundations than an inkspotted studytable littered with proofsheets  mrs st george might have been the wife of a gentleman who kept books rather than wrote them who carried on great affairs in the city and made better bargains than those that poets mostly make with publishers  with this she hinted at a success more personala success peculiarly stamping the age in which society the world of conversation is a great drawingroom with the city for its antechamber  overt numbered her years at first as some thirty and then ended by believing that she might approach her fiftieth  but she somehow in this case juggled away the excess and the differenceyou only saw them in a rare glimpse like the rabbit in the conjurers sleeve  she was extraordinarily white and her every element and item was pretty her eyes her ears her hair her voice her hands her feetto which her relaxed attitude in her wicker chair gave a great publicityand the numerous ribbons and trinkets with which she was bedecked  she looked as if she had put on her best clothes to go to church and then had decided they were too good for that and had stayed at home  she told a story of some length about the shabby way lady jane had treated the duchess as well as an anecdote in relation to a purchase she had made in parison her way back from cannes made for lady egbert who had never refunded the money  paul overt suspected her of a tendency to figure great people as larger than life until he noticed the manner in which she handled lady egbert which was so sharply mutinous that it reassured him  he felt he should have understood her better if he might have met her eye but she scarcely so much as glanced at him  ah here they comeall the good ones she said at last and paul overt admired at his distance the return of the churchgoersseveral persons in couples and threes advancing in a flicker of sun and shade at the end of a large green vista formed by the level grass and the overarching boughs  if you mean to imply that were bad i protest said one of the gentlemenafter making ones self agreeable all the morning  ah if theyve found you agreeable mrs st george gaily cried  but if were good the others are better  they must be angels then said the amused general  your husband was an angel the way he went off at your bidding the gentleman who had first spoken declared to mrs st george  at my bidding  didnt you make him go to church  i never made him do anything in my life but oncewhen i made him burn up a bad book  thats all  at her thats all our young friend broke into an irrepressible laugh it lasted only a second but it drew her eyes to him  his own met them though not long enough to help him to understand her unless it were a step towards this that he saw on the instant how the burnt bookthe way she alluded to itwould have been one of her husbands finest things  a bad book her interlocutor repeated  i didnt like it  he went to church because your daughter went she continued to general fancourt  i think it my duty to call your attention to his extraordinary demonstrations to your daughter  well if you dont mind them i dont the general laughed  il sattache a ses pas  but i dont wondershes so charming  i hope she wont make him burn any books paul overt ventured to exclaim  if shed make him write a few it would be more to the purpose said mrs st george  he has been of a laziness of late  our young man staredhe was so struck with the ladys phraseology  her write a few seemed to him almost as good as her thats all  didnt she as the wife of a rare artist know what it was to produce one perfect work of art  how in the world did she think they were turned off his private conviction was that admirably as henry st george wrote he had written for the last ten years and especially for the last five only too much and there was an instant during which he felt inwardly solicited to make this public  but before he had spoken a diversion was effected by the return of the absentees  they strolled up dispersedlythere were eight or ten of themand the circle under the trees rearranged itself as they took their place in it  they made it much larger so that paul overt could feelhe was always feeling that sort of thing as he said to himselfthat if the company had already been interesting to watch the interest would now become intense  he shook hands with his hostess who welcomed him without many words in the manner of a woman able to trust him to understand and conscious that so pleasant an occasion would in every way speak for itself  she offered him no particular facility for sitting by her and when they had all subsided again he found himself still next general fancourt with an unknown lady on his other flank  thats my daughterthat one opposite the general said to him without lose of time  overt saw a tall girl with magnificent red hair in a dress of a pretty greygreen tint and of a limp silken texture a garment that clearly shirked every modern effect  it had therefore somehow the stamp of the latest thing so that our beholder quickly took her for nothing if not contemporaneous  shes very handsomevery handsome he repeated while he considered her  there was something noble in her head and she appeared fresh and strong  her good father surveyed her with complacency remarking soon she looks too hotthats her walk  but shell be all right presently  then ill make her come over and speak to you  i should be sorry to give you that trouble  if you were to take me over there the young man murmured  my dear sir do you suppose i put myself out that way  i dont mean for you but for marian the general added  i would put myself out for her soon enough overt replied after which he went on will you be so good as to tell me which of those gentlemen is henry st george  the fellow talking to my girl  by jove he is making up to hertheyre going off for another walk  ah is that hereally  our friend felt a certain surprise for the personage before him seemed to trouble a vision which had been vague only while not confronted with the reality  as soon as the reality dawned the mental image retiring with a sigh became substantial enough to suffer a slight wrong  overt who had spent a considerable part of his short life in foreign lands made now but not for the first time the reflexion that whereas in those countries he had almost always recognised the artist and the man of letters by his personal type the mould of his face the character of his head the expression of his figure and even the indications of his dress so in england this identification was as little as possible a matter of course thanks to the greater conformity the habit of sinking the profession instead of advertising it the general diffusion of the air of the gentlemanthe gentleman committed to no particular set of ideas  more than once on returning to his own country he had said to himself about people met in society one sees them in this place and that and one even talks with them but to find out what they do one would really have to be a detective  in respect to several individuals whose work he was the opposite of drawn toperhaps he was wronghe found himself adding no wonder they conceal itwhen its so bad  he noted that oftener than in france and in germany his artist looked like a gentlemanthat is like an english onewhile certainly outside a few exceptions his gentlemen didnt look like an artist  st george was not one of the exceptions that circumstance he definitely apprehended before the great man had turned his back to walk off with miss fancourt  he certainly looked better behind than any foreign man of lettersshowed for beautifully correct in his tall black hat and his superior frock coat  somehow all the same these very garmentshe wouldnt have minded them so much on a weekdaywere disconcerting to paul overt who forgot for the moment that the head of the profession was not a bit better dressed than himself  he had caught a glimpse of a regular face a fresh colour a brown moustache and a pair of eyes surely never visited by a fine frenzy and he promised himself to study these denotements on the first occasion  his superficial sense was that their owner might have passed for a lucky stockbrokera gentleman driving eastward every morning from a sanitary suburb in a smart dogcart  that carried out the impression already derived from his wife  pauls glance after a moment travelled back to this lady and he saw how her own had followed her husband as he moved off with miss fancourt  overt permitted himself to wonder a little if she were jealous when another woman took him away  then he made out that mrs st george wasnt glaring at the indifferent maiden  her eyes rested but on her husband and with unmistakeable serenity  that was the way she wanted him to beshe liked his conventional uniform  overt longed to hear more about the book she had induced him to destroy     chapter ii   as they all came out from luncheon general fancourt took hold of him with an i say i want you to know my girl as if the idea had just occurred to him and he hadnt spoken of it before  with the other hand he possessed himself all paternally of the young lady  you know all about him  ive seen you with his books  she reads everythingeverything he went on to paul  the girl smiled at him and then laughed at her father  the general turned away and his daughter spokeisnt papa delightful  he is indeed miss fancourt  as if i read you because i read everything  oh i dont mean for saying that said paul overt  i liked him from the moment he began to be kind to me  then he promised me this privilege  it isnt for you he means itits for me  if you flatter yourself that he thinks of anything in life but me youll find youre mistaken  he introduces every one  he thinks me insatiable  you speak just like him laughed our youth  ah but sometimes i want toand the girl coloured  i dont read everythingi read very little  but i have read you  suppose we go into the gallery said paul overt  she pleased him greatly not so much because of this last remarkthough that of course was not too disconcertingas because seated opposite to him at luncheon she had given him for half an hour the impression of her beautiful face  something else had come with ita sense of generosity of an enthusiasm which unlike many enthusiasms was not all manner  that was not spoiled for him by his seeing that the repast had placed her again in familiar contact with henry st george  sitting next her this celebrity was also opposite our young man who had been able to note that he multiplied the attentions lately brought by his wife to the generals notice  paul overt had gathered as well that this lady was not in the least discomposed by these fond excesses and that she gave every sign of an unclouded spirit  she had lord masham on one side of her and on the other the accomplished mr mulliner editor of the new highclass lively evening paper which was expected to meet a want felt in circles increasingly conscious that conservatism must be made amusing and unconvinced when assured by those of another political colour that it was already amusing enough  at the end of an hour spent in her company paul overt thought her still prettier than at the first radiation and if her profane allusions to her husbands work had not still rung in his ears he should have liked herso far as it could be a question of that in connexion with a woman to whom he had not yet spoken and to whom probably he should never speak if it were left to her  pretty women were a clear need to this genius and for the hour it was miss fancourt who supplied the want  if overt had promised himself a closer view the occasion was now of the best and it brought consequences felt by the young man as important  he saw more in st georges face which he liked the better for its not having told its whole story in the first three minutes  that story came out as one read in short instalmentsit was excusable that ones analogies should be somewhat professionaland the text was a style considerably involved a language not easy to translate at sight  there were shades of meaning in it and a vague perspective of history which receded as you advanced  two facts paul had particularly heeded  the first of these was that he liked the measured mask much better at inscrutable rest than in social agitation its almost convulsive smile above all displeased him as much as any impression from that source could whereas the quiet face had a charm that grew in proportion as stillness settled again  the change to the expression of gaiety excited he made out very much the private protest of a person sitting gratefully in the twilight when the lamp is brought in too soon  his second reflexion was that though generally averse to the flagrant use of ingratiating arts by a man of age making up to a pretty girl he was not in this case too painfully affected which seemed to prove either that st george had a light hand or the air of being younger than he was or else that miss fancourts own manner somehow made everything right  overt walked with her into the gallery and they strolled to the end of it looking at the pictures the cabinets the charming vista which harmonised with the prospect of the summer afternoon resembling it by a long brightness with great divans and old chairs that figured hours of rest  such a place as that had the added merit of giving those who came into it plenty to talk about  miss fancourt sat down with her new acquaintance on a flowered sofa the cushions of which very numerous were tight ancient cubes of many sizes and presently said im so glad to have a chance to thank you  to thank me  he had to wonder  i liked your book so much  i think it splendid  she sat there smiling at him and he never asked himself which book she meant for after all he had written three or four  that seemed a vulgar detail and he wasnt even gratified by the idea of the pleasure she told himher handsome bright face told himhe had given her  the feeling she appealed to or at any rate the feeling she excited was something larger something that had little to do with any quickened pulsation of his own vanity  it was responsive admiration of the life she embodied the young purity and richness of which appeared to imply that real success was to resemble that to live to bloom to present the perfection of a fine type not to have hammered out headachy fancies with a bent back at an inkstained table  while her grey eyes rested on himthere was a wideish space between these and the division of her richcoloured hair so thick that it ventured to be smooth made a free arch above themhe was almost ashamed of that exercise of the pen which it was her present inclination to commend  he was conscious he should have liked better to please her in some other way  the lines of her face were those of a woman grown but the child lingered on in her complexion and in the sweetness of her mouth  above all she was naturalthat was indubitable now more natural than he had supposed at first perhaps on account of her aesthetic toggery which was conventionally unconventional suggesting what he might have called a tortuous spontaneity  he had feared that sort of thing in other cases and his fears had been justified for though he was an artist to the essence the modern reactionary nymph with the brambles of the woodland caught in her folds and a look as if the satyrs had toyed with her hair made him shrink not as a man of starch and patent leather but as a man potentially himself a poet or even a faun  the girl was really more candid than her costume and the best proof of it was her supposing her liberal character suited by any uniform  this was a fallacy since if she was draped as a pessimist he was sure she liked the taste of life  he thanked her for her appreciationaware at the same time that he didnt appear to thank her enough and that she might think him ungracious  he was afraid she would ask him to explain something he had written and he always winced at thatperhaps too timidlyfor to his own ear the explanation of a work of art sounded fatuous  but he liked her so much as to feel a confidence that in the long run he should be able to show her he wasnt rudely evasive  moreover she surely wasnt quick to take offence wasnt irritable she could be trusted to wait  so when he said to her ah dont talk of anything ive done dont talk of it here theres another man in the house whos the actualitywhen he uttered this short sincere protest it was with the sense that she would see in the words neither mock humility nor the impatience of a successful man bored with praise  you mean mr st georgeisnt he delightful  paul overt met her eyes which had a cool morninglight that would have halfbroken his heart if he hadnt been so young  alas i dont know him  i only admire him at a distance  oh you must know himhe wants so to talk to you returned miss fancourt who evidently had the habit of saying the things that by her quick calculation would give people pleasure  paul saw how she would always calculate on everythings being simple between others  i shouldnt have supposed he knew anything about me he professed  he does theneverything  and if he didnt i should be able to tell him  to tell him everything our friend smiled  you talk just like the people in your book she answered  then they must all talk alike  she thought a moment not a bit disconcerted  well it must be so difficult  mr st george tells me it isterribly  ive tried tooand i find it so  ive tried to write a novel  mr st george oughtnt to discourage you paul went so far as to say  you do much morewhen you wear that expression  well after all why try to be an artist the young man pursued  its so poorso poor  i dont know what you mean said miss fancourt who looked grave  i mean as compared with being a person of actionas living your works  but whats art but an intense lifeif it be real she asked  i think its the only oneeverything else is so clumsy  her companion laughed and she brought out with her charming serenity what next struck her its so interesting to meet so many celebrated people  so i should thinkbut surely it isnt new to you  why ive never seen any oneany one living always in asia  the way she talked of asia somehow enchanted him  but doesnt that continent swarm with great figures  havent you administered provinces in india and had captive rajahs and tributary princes chained to your car  it was as if she didnt care even should he amuse himself at her cost i was with my father after i left school to go out there  it was delightful being with himwere alone together in the world he and ibut there was none of the society i like best  one never heard of a picturenever of a book except bad ones  never of a picture  why wasnt all life a picture  she looked over the delightful place where they sat  nothing to compare to this  i adore england she cried  it fairly stirred in him the sacred chord  ah of course i dont deny that we must do something with her poor old dear yet  she hasnt been touched really said the girl  did mr st george say that  there was a small and as he felt harmless spark of irony in his question which however she answered very simply not noticing the insinuation  yes he says england hasnt been touchednot considering all there is she went on eagerly  hes so interesting about our country  to listen to him makes one want so to do something  it would make me want to said paul overt feeling strongly on the instant the suggestion of what she said and that of the emotion with which she said it and well aware of what an incentive on st georges lips such a speech might be  oh youas if you hadnt  i should like so to hear you talk together she added ardently  thats very genial of you but hed have it all his own way  im prostrate before him  she had an air of earnestness  do you think then hes so perfect  far from it  some of his later books seem to me of a queerness  yes yeshe knows that  paul overt stared  that they seem to me of a queerness  well yes or at any rate that theyre not what they should be  he told me he didnt esteem them  he has told me such wonderful thingshes so interesting  there was a certain shock for paul overt in the knowledge that the fine genius they were talking of had been reduced to so explicit a confession and had made it in his misery to the first comer for though miss fancourt was charming what was she after all but an immature girl encountered at a countryhouse  yet precisely this was part of the sentiment he himself had just expressed he would make way completely for the poor peccable great man not because he didnt read him clear but altogether because he did  his consideration was half composed of tenderness for superficialities which he was sure their perpetrator judged privately judged more ferociously than any one and which represented some tragic intellectual secret  he would have his reasons for his psychology a fleur de peau and these reasons could only be cruel ones such as would make him dearer to those who already were fond of him  you excite my envy  i have my reserves i discriminatebut i love him paul said in a moment  and seeing him for the first time this way is a great event for me  how momentoushow magnificent cried the girl  how delicious to bring you together  your doing itthat makes it perfect our friend returned  hes as eager as you she went on  but its so odd you shouldnt have met  its not really so odd as it strikes you  ive been out of england so muchmade repeated absences all these last years  she took this in with interest  and yet you write of it as well as if you were always here  its just the being away perhaps  at any rate the best bits i suspect are those that were done in dreary places abroad  and why were they dreary  because they were healthresortswhere my poor mother was dying  your poor mothershe was all sweet wonder  we went from place to place to help her to get better  but she never did  to the deadly riviera i hate it to the high alps to algiers and far awaya hideous journeyto colorado  and she isnt better miss fancourt went on  she died a year ago  reallylike mine  only thats years since  some day you must tell me about your mother she added  he could at first on this only gaze at her  what right things you say  if you say them to st george i dont wonder hes in bondage  it pulled her up for a moment  i dont know what you mean  he doesnt make speeches and professions at allhe isnt ridiculous  im afraid you consider then that i am  no i dontshe spoke it rather shortly  and then she added he understandsunderstands everything  the young man was on the point of saying jocosely and i dontis that it  but these words in time changed themselves to others slightly less trivial do you suppose he understands his wife  miss fancourt made no direct answer but after a moments hesitation put it isnt she charming  not in the least  here he comes  now you must know him she went on  a small group of visitors had gathered at the other end of the gallery and had been there overtaken by henry st george who strolled in from a neighbouring room he stood near them a moment not falling into the talk but taking up an old miniature from a table and vaguely regarding it  at the end of a minute he became aware of miss fancourt and her companion in the distance whereupon laying down his miniature he approached them with the same procrastinating air his hands in his pockets and his eyes turned right and left to the pictures  the gallery was so long that this transit took some little time especially as there was a moment when he stopped to admire the fine gainsborough  he says mrs st george has been the making of him the girl continued in a voice slightly lowered  ah hes often obscure paul laughed  obscure she repeated as if she heard it for the first time  her eyes rested on her other friend and it wasnt lost upon paul that they appeared to send out great shafts of softness  hes going to speak to us she fondly breathed  there was a sort of rapture in her voice and our friend was startled  bless my soul does she care for him like thatis she in love with him he mentally enquired  didnt i tell you he was eager she had meanwhile asked of him  its eagerness dissimulated the young man returned as the subject of their observation lingered before his gainsborough  he edges toward us shyly  does he mean that she saved him by burning that book  that book what book did she burn  the girl quickly turned her face to him  hasnt he told you then  not a word  then he doesnt tell you everything  paul had guessed that she pretty much supposed he did  the great man had now resumed his course and come nearer in spite of which his more qualified admirer risked a profane observation st george and the dragon is what the anecdote suggests  his companion however didnt hear it she smiled at the dragons adversary  he is eagerhe is she insisted  eager for youyes  but meanwhile she had called out im sure you want to know mr overt youll be great friends and it will always be delightful to me to remember i was here when you first met and that i had something to do with it  there was a freshness of intention in the words that carried them off nevertheless our young man was sorry for henry st george as he was sorry at any time for any person publicly invited to be responsive and delightful  he would have been so touched to believe that a man he deeply admired should care a straw for him that he wouldnt play with such a presumption if it were possibly vain  in a single glance of the eye of the pardonable master he readhaving the sort of divination that belonged to his talentthat this personage had ever a store of friendly patience which was part of his rich outfit but was versed in no printed page of a rising scribbler  there was even a relief a simplification in that liking him so much already for what he had done how could one have liked him any more for a perception which must at the best have been vague  paul overt got up trying to show his compassion but at the same instant he found himself encompassed by st georges happy personal arta manner of which it was the essence to conjure away false positions  it all took place in a moment  paul was conscious that he knew him now conscious of his handshake and of the very quality of his hand of his face seen nearer and consequently seen better of a general fraternising assurance and in particular of the circumstance that st george didnt dislike him as yet at least for being imposed by a charming but too gushing girl attractive enough without such danglers  no irritation at any rate was reflected in the voice with which he questioned miss fancourt as to some project of a walka general walk of the company round the park  he had soon said something to paul about a talkwe must have a tremendous lot of talk there are so many things arent therebut our friend could see this idea wouldnt in the present case take very immediate effect  all the same he was extremely happy even after the matter of the walk had been settledthe three presently passed back to the other part of the gallery where it was discussed with several members of the party even when after they had all gone out together he found himself for half an hour conjoined with mrs st george  her husband had taken the advance with miss fancourt and this pair were quite out of sight  it was the prettiest of rambles for a summer afternoona grassy circuit of immense extent skirting the limit of the park within  the park was completely surrounded by its old mottled but perfect red wall which all the way on their left constituted in itself an object of interest  mrs st george mentioned to him the surprising number of acres thus enclosed together with numerous other facts relating to the property and the family and the familys other properties she couldnt too strongly urge on him the importance of seeing their other houses  she ran over the names of these and rang the changes on them with the facility of practice making them appear an almost endless list  she had received paul overt very amiably on his breaking ground with her by the mention of his joy in having just made her husbands acquaintance and struck him as so alert and so accommodating a little woman that he was rather ashamed of his mot about her to miss fancourt though he reflected that a hundred other people on a hundred occasions would have been sure to make it  he got on with ms st george in short better than he expected but this didnt prevent her suddenly becoming aware that she was faint with fatigue and must take her way back to the house by the shortest cut  she professed that she hadnt the strength of a kitten and was a miserable wreck a character he had been too preoccupied to discern in her while he wondered in what sense she could be held to have been the making of her husband  he had arrived at a glimmering of the answer when she announced that she must leave him though this perception was of course provisional  while he was in the very act of placing himself at her disposal for the return the situation underwent a change lord masham had suddenly turned up coming back to them overtaking them emerging from the shrubberyovert could scarcely have said how he appearedand mrs st george had protested that she wanted to be left alone and not to break up the party  a moment later she was walking off with lord masham our friend fell back and joined lady watermouth to whom he presently mentioned that mrs st george had been obliged to renounce the attempt to go further  she oughtnt to have come out at all her ladyship rather grumpily remarked  is she so very much of an invalid  very bad indeed  and his hostess added with still greater austerity she oughtnt really to come to one  he wondered what was implied by this and presently gathered that it was not a reflexion on the ladys conduct or her moral nature it only represented that her strength was not equal to her aspirations     chapter iii   the smokingroom at summersoft was on the scale of the rest of the place high light commodious and decorated with such refined old carvings and mouldings that it seemed rather a bower for ladies who should sit at work at fading crewels than a parliament of gentlemen smoking strong cigars the gentlemen mustered there in considerable force on the sunday evening collecting mainly at one end in front of one of the cool fair fireplaces of white marble the entablature of which was adorned with a delicate little italian subject  there was another in the wall that faced it and thanks to the mild summer night a fire in neither but a nucleus for aggregation was furnished on one side by a table in the chimneycorner laden with bottles decanters and tall tumblers  paul overt was a faithless smoker he would puff a cigarette for reasons with which tobacco had nothing to do  this was particularly the case on the occasion of which i speak his motive was the vision of a little direct talk with henry st george  the tremendous communion of which the great man had held out hopes to him earlier in the day had not yet come off and this saddened him considerably for the party was to go its several ways immediately after breakfast on the morrow  he had however the disappointment of finding that apparently the author of shadowmere was not disposed to prolong his vigil  he wasnt among the gentlemen assembled when paul entered nor was he one of those who turned up in bright habiliments during the next ten minutes  the young man waited a little wondering if he had only gone to put on something extraordinary this would account for his delay as well as contribute further to overts impression of his tendency to do the approved superficial thing  but he didnt arrivehe must have been putting on something more extraordinary than was probable  our hero gave him up feeling a little injured a little wounded at this loss of twenty coveted words  he wasnt angry but he puffed his cigarette sighingly with the sense of something rare possibly missed  he wandered away with his regret and moved slowly round the room looking at the old prints on the walls  in this attitude he presently felt a hand on his shoulder and a friendly voice in his ear this is good  i hoped i should find you  i came down on purpose  st george was there without a change of dress and with a fine facehis graver oneto which our young man all in a flutter responded  he explained that it was only for the masterthe idea of a little talkthat he had sat up and that not finding him he had been on the point of going to bed  well you know i dont smokemy wife doesnt let me said st george looking for a place to sit down  its very good for mevery good for me  let us take that sofa  do you mean smokings good for you  no noher not letting me  its a great thing to have a wife whos so sure of all the things one can do without  one might never find them out ones self  she doesnt allow me to touch a cigarette  they took possession of a sofa at a distance from the group of smokers and st george went on have you got one yourself  do you mean a cigarette  dear noa wife  no and yet id give up my cigarette for one  youd give up a good deal more than that st george returned however youd get a great deal in return  theres a something to be said for wives he added folding his arms and crossing his outstretched legs  he declined tobacco altogether and sat there without returning fire  his companion stopped smoking touched by his courtesy and after all they were out of the fumes their sofa was in a faraway corner  it would have been a mistake st george went on a great mistake for them to have separated without a little chat for i know all about you he said i know youre very remarkable  youve written a very distinguished book  and how do you know it paul asked  why my dear fellow its in the air its in the papers its everywhere  st george spoke with the immediate familiarity of a confrerea tone that seemed to his neighbour the very rustle of the laurel  youre on all mens lips and whats better on all womens and ive just been reading your book  just  you hadnt read it this afternoon said overt  how do you know that  i think you should know how i know it the young man laughed  i suppose miss fancourt told you  no indeedshe led me rather to suppose you had  yesthats much more what shed do  doesnt she shed a rosy glow over life  but you didnt believe her asked st george  no not when you came to us there  did i pretend did i pretend badly  but without waiting for an answer to this st george went on you ought always to believe such a girl as thatalways always  some women are meant to be taken with allowances and reserves but you must take her just as she is  i like her very much said paul overt  something in his tone appeared to excite on his companions part a momentary sense of the absurd perhaps it was the air of deliberation attending this judgement  st george broke into a laugh to reply  its the best thing you can do with her  shes a rare young lady  in point of fact however i confess i hadnt read you this afternoon  then you see how right i was in this particular case not to believe miss fancourt  how right how can i agree to that when i lost credit by it  do you wish to pass exactly for what she represents you  certainly you neednt be afraid paul said  ah my dear young man dont talk about passingfor the likes of me im passing awaynothing else than that  she has a better use for her young imagination isnt it fine than in representing in any way such a weary wasted usedup animal  the master spoke with a sudden sadness that produced a protest on pauls part but before the protest could be uttered he went on reverting to the latters striking novel i had no idea you were so goodone hears of so many things  but youre surprisingly good  im going to be surprisingly better overt made bold to reply  i see that and its what fetches me  i dont see so much elseas one looks aboutthats going to be surprisingly better  theyre going to be consistently worsemost of the things  its so much easier to be worseheaven knows ive found it so  im not in a great glow you know about whats breaking out all over the place  but you must be betteryou really must keep it up  i havent of course  its very difficultthats the devil of the whole thing keeping it up  but i see youll be able to  it will be a great disgrace if you dont  its very interesting to hear you speak of yourself but i dont know what you mean by your allusions to your having fallen off paul overt observed with pardonable hypocrisy  he liked his companion so much now that the fact of any decline of talent or of care had ceased for the moment to be vivid to him  dont say thatdont say that st george returned gravely his head resting on the top of the sofaback and his eyes on the ceiling  you know perfectly what i mean  i havent read twenty pages of your book without seeing that you cant help it  you make me very miserable paul ecstatically breathed  im glad of that for it may serve as a kind of warning  shocking enough it must be especially to a young fresh mind full of faiththe spectacle of a man meant for better things sunk at my age in such dishonour  st george in the same contemplative attitude spoke softly but deliberately and without perceptible emotion  his tone indeed suggested an impersonal lucidity that was practically cruelcruel to himselfand made his young friend lay an argumentative hand on his arm but he went on while his eyes seemed to follow the graces of the eighteenthcentury ceiling look at me well take my lesson to heartfor it is a lesson  let that good come of it at least that you shudder with your pitiful impression and that this may help to keep you straight in the future  dont become in your old age what i have in minethe depressing the deplorable illustration of the worship of false gods  what do you mean by your old age the young man asked  it has made me old  but i like your youth  paul answered nothingthey sat for a minute in silence  they heard the others going on about the governmental majority  then what do you mean by false gods he enquired  his companion had no difficulty whatever in saying the idols of the market money and luxury and the world placing ones children and dressing ones wife everything that drives one to the short and easy way  ah the vile things they make one do  but surely ones right to want to place ones children  one has no business to have any children st george placidly declared i mean of course if one wants to do anything good  but arent they an inspirationan incentive  an incentive to damnation artistically speaking  you touch on very deep thingsthings i should like to discuss with you paul said  i should like you to tell me volumes about yourself this is a great feast for me  of course it is cruel youth  but to show you im still not incapable degraded as i am of an act of faith ill tie my vanity to the stake for you and burn it to ashes  you must come and see meyou must come and see us the master quickly substituted  mrs st george is charming i dont know whether youve had any opportunity to talk with her  shell be delighted to see you she likes great celebrities whether incipient or predominant  you must come and dinemy wife will write to you  where are you to be found  this is my little addressand overt drew out his pocketbook and extracted a visitingcard  on second thoughts however he kept it back remarking that he wouldnt trouble his friend to take charge of it but would come and see him straightway in london and leave it at his door if he should fail to obtain entrance  ah youll probably fail my wifes always outor when she isnt out is knocked up from having been out  you must come and dinethough that wont do much good either for my wife insists on big dinners  st george turned it over further but then went on you must come down and see us in the country thats the best way weve plenty of room and it isnt bad  youve a house in the country paul asked enviously  ah not like this  but we have a sort of place we go toan hour from euston  thats one of the reasons  one of the reasons  why my books are so bad  you must tell me all the others paul longingly laughed  his friend made no direct rejoinder to this but spoke again abruptly why have i never seen you before  the tone of the question was singularly flattering to our hero who felt it to imply the great mans now perceiving he had for years missed something  partly i suppose because there has been no particular reason why you should see me  i havent lived in the worldin your world  ive spent many years out of england in different places abroad  well please dont do it any more  you must do englandtheres such a lot of it  do you mean i must write about it and paul struck the note of the listening candour of a child  of course you must  and tremendously well do you mind  that takes off a little of my esteem for this thing of yoursthat it goes on abroad hang abroad  stay at home and do things heredo subjects we can measure  ill do whatever you tell me overt said deeply attentive  but pardon me if i say i dont understand how youve been reading my book he added  ive had you before me all the afternoon first in that long walk then at tea on the lawn till we went to dress for dinner and all the evening at dinner and in this place  st george turned his face about with a smile  i gave it but a quarter of an hour  a quarter of an hours immense but i dont understand where you put it in  in the drawingroom after dinner you werent readingyou were talking to miss fancourt  it comes to the same thing because we talked about ginistrella  she described it to meshe lent me her copy  lent it to you  she travels with it  its incredible paul blushed  its glorious for you but it also turned out very well for me  when the ladies went off to bed she kindly offered to send the book down to me  her maid brought it to me in the hall and i went to my room with it i hadnt thought of coming here i do that so little  but i dont sleep early i always have to read an hour or two  i sat down to your novel on the spot without undressing without taking off anything but my coat  i think thats a sign my curiosity had been strongly roused about it  i read a quarter of an hour as i tell you and even in a quarter of an hour i was greatly struck  ah the beginning isnt very goodits the whole thing said overt who had listened to this recital with extreme interest  and you laid down the book and came after me he asked  thats the way it moved me  i said to myself i see its off his own bat and hes there by the way and the days over and i havent said twenty words to him  it occurred to me that youd probably be in the smokingroom and that it wouldnt be too late to repair my omission  i wanted to do something civil to you so i put on my coat and came down  i shall read your book again when i go up  our friend faced round in his placehe was touched as he had scarce ever been by the picture of such a demonstration in his favour  youre really the kindest of men  cela sest passe comme caand ive been sitting here with you all this time and never apprehended it and never thanked you  thank miss fancourtit was she who wound me up  she has made me feel as if i had read your novel  shes an angel from heaven paul declared  she is indeed  ive never seen any one like her  her interest in literatures touchingsomething quite peculiar to herself she takes it all so seriously  she feels the arts and she wants to feel them more  to those who practise them its almost humiliatingher curiosity her sympathy her good faith  how can anything be as fine as she supposes it  shes a rare organisation the younger man sighed  the richest ive ever seenan artistic intelligence really of the first order  and lodged in such a form st george exclaimed  one would like to represent such a girl as that paul continued  ah there it istheres nothing like life said his companion  when youre finished squeezed dry and used up and you think the sacks empty youre still appealed to you still get touches and thrills the idea springs upout of the lap of the actualand shows you theres always something to be done  but i shant do itshes not for me  how do you mean not for you  oh its all overshes for you if you like  ah much less said paul  shes not for a dingy little man of letters shes for the world the bright rich world of bribes and rewards  and the world will take hold of herit will carry her away  it will trybut its just a case in which there may be a fight  it would be worth fighting for a man who had it in him with youth and talent on his side  these words rang not a little in paul overts consciousnessthey held him briefly silent  its a wonder she has remained as she is giving herself away sowith so much to give away  remaining you mean so ingenuousso natural  oh she doesnt care a strawshe gives away because she overflows  she has her own feelings her own standards she doesnt keep remembering that she must be proud and then she hasnt been here long enough to be spoiled she has picked up a fashion or two but only the amusing ones  shes a provinciala provincial of genius st george went on her very blunders are charming her mistakes are interesting  she has come back from asia with all sorts of excited curiosities and unappeased appetities  shes first rate herself and she expends herself on the secondrate  shes life herself and she takes a rare interest in imitations  she mixes all things up but there are none in regard to which she hasnt perceptions she sees things in a perspectiveas if from the top of the himalayasand she enlarges everything she touches  above all she exaggeratesto herself i mean  she exaggerates you and me  there was nothing in that description to allay the agitation caused in our younger friend by such a sketch of a fine subject  it seemed to him to show the art of st georges admired hand and he lost himself in gazing at the visionthis hovered there before himof a womans figure which should be part of the glory of a novel  but at the end of a moment the thing had turned into smoke and out of the smokethe last puff of a big cigarproceeded the voice of general fancourt who had left the others and come and planted himself before the gentlemen on the sofa  i suppose that when you fellows get talking you sit up half the night  half the nightjamais de la vie  i follow a hygieneand st george rose to his feet  i seeyoure hothouse plants laughed the general  thats the way you produce your flowers  i produce mine between ten and one every morningi bloom with a regularity st george went on  and with a splendour added the polite general while paul noted how little the author of shadowmere minded as he phrased it to himself when addressed as a celebrated storyteller  the young man had an idea he should never get used to that it would always make him uncomfortablefrom the suspicion that people would think they had toand he would want to prevent it  evidently his great colleague had toughened and hardenedhad made himself a surface  the group of men had finished their cigars and taken up their bedroom candlesticks but before they all passed out lord watermouth invited the pair of guests who had been so absorbed together to have something  it happened that they both declined upon which general fancourt said is that the hygiene  you dont water the flowers  oh i should drown them st george replied but leaving the room still at his young friends side he added whimsically for the latters benefit in a lower tone my wife doesnt let me  well im glad im not one of you fellows the general richly concluded  the nearness of summersoft to london had this consequence chilling to a person who had had a vision of sociability in a railwaycarriage that most of the company after breakfast drove back to town entering their own vehicles which had come out to fetch them while their servants returned by train with their luggage  three or four young men among whom was paul overt also availed themselves of the common convenience but they stood in the portico of the house and saw the others roll away miss fancourt got into a victoria with her father after she had shaken hands with our hero and said smiling in the frankest way in the world i must see you more  mrs st george is so nice she has promised to ask us both to dinner together  this lady and her husband took their places in a perfectlyappointed broughamshe required a closed carriageand as our young man waved his hat to them in response to their nods and flourishes he reflected that taken together they were an honourable image of success of the material rewards and the social credit of literature  such things were not the full measure but he nevertheless felt a little proud for literature     chapter iv   before a week had elapsed he met miss fancourt in bond street at a private view of the works of a young artist in blackandwhite who had been so good as to invite him to the stuffy scene  the drawings were admirable but the crowd in the one little room was so dense that he felt himself up to his neck in a sack of wool  a fringe of people at the outer edge endeavoured by curving forward their backs and presenting below them a still more convex surface of resistance to the pressure of the mass to preserve an interval between their noses and the glazed mounts of the pictures while the central body in the comparative gloom projected by a wide horizontal screen hung under the skylight and allowing only a margin for the day remained upright dense and vague lost in the contemplation of its own ingredients  this contemplation sat especially in the sad eyes of certain female heads surmounted with hats of strange convolution and plumage which rose on long necks above the others  one of the heads paul perceived was much the so most beautiful of the collection and his next discovery was that it belonged to miss fancourt  its beauty was enhanced by the glad smile she sent him across surrounding obstructions a smile that drew him to her as fast as he could make his way  he had seen for himself at summersoft that the last thing her nature contained was an affectation of indifference yet even with this circumspection he took a fresh satisfaction in her not having pretended to await his arrival with composure  she smiled as radiantly as if she wished to make him hurry and as soon as he came within earshot she broke out in her voice of joy hes herehes herehes coming back in a moment  ah your father paul returned as she offered him her hand  oh dear no this isnt in my poor fathers line  i mean mr st george he has just left me to speak to some onehes coming back  its he who brought mewasnt it charming  ah that gives him a pull over mei couldnt have brought you could i  if you had been so kind as to propose itwhy not you as well as he the girl returned with a face that expressing no cheap coquetry simply affirmed a happy fact  why hes a pere de famille  theyve privileges paul explained  and then quickly will you go to see places with me he asked  anything you like she smiled  i know what you mean that girls have to have a lot of people  then she broke off i dont know im free ive always been like thati can go about with any one  im so glad to meet you she added with a sweet distinctness that made those near her turn round  let me at least repay that speech by taking you out of this squash her friend said  surely people arent happy here  no theyre awfully mornes arent they  but im very happy indeed and i promised mr st george to remain in this spot till he comes back  hes going to take me away  they send him invitations for things of this sortmore than he wants  it was so kind of him to think of me  they also send me invitations of this kindmore than i want  and if thinking of you will do it paul went on  oh i delight in themeverything thats lifeeverything thats london  they dont have private views in asia i suppose he laughed  but what a pity that for this year even in this gorged city theyre pretty well over  well next year will do for i hope you believe were going to be friends always  here he comes miss fancourt continued before paul had time to respond  he made out st george in the gaps of the crowd and this perhaps led to his hurrying a little to say i hope that doesnt mean im to wait till next year to see you  no noarent we to meet at dinner on the twentyfifth she panted with an eagerness as happy as his own  thats almost next year  is there no means of seeing you before  she stared with all her brightness  do you mean youd come  like a shot if youll be so good as to ask me  on sunday thenthis next sunday  what have i done that you should doubt it the young man asked with delight  miss fancourt turned instantly to st george who had now joined them and announced triumphantly hes coming on sundaythis next sunday  ah my daymy day too said the famous novelist laughing to their companion  yes but not yours only  you shall meet in manchester square you shall talkyou shall be wonderful  we dont meet often enough st george allowed shaking hands with his disciple  too many thingsah too many things  but we must make it up in the country in september  you wont forget youve promised me that  why hes coming on the twentyfifthyoull see him then said the girl  on the twentyfifth st george asked vaguely  we dine with you i hope you havent forgotten  hes dining out that day she added gaily to paul  oh bless me yesthats charming  and youre coming  my wife didnt tell me st george said to him  too many thingstoo many things he repeated  too many peopletoo many people paul exclaimed giving ground before the penetration of an elbow  you oughtnt to say that  they all read you  me  i should like to see them  only two or three at most the young man returned  did you ever hear anything like that  he knows haughtily how good he is st george declared laughing to miss fancourt  they read me but that doesnt make me like them any better  come away from them come away  and he led the way out of the exhibition  hes going to take me to the park miss fancourt observed to overt with elation as they passed along the corridor that led to the street  ah does he go there paul asked taking the fact for a somewhat unexpected illustration of st georges moeurs  its a beautiful daytherell be a great crowd  were going to look at the people to look at types the girl went on  we shall sit under the trees we shall walk by the row  i go once a yearon business said st george who had overheard pauls question  or with a country cousin didnt you tell me  im the country cousin she continued over her shoulder to paul as their friend drew her toward a hansom to which he had signalled  the young man watched them get in he returned as he stood there the friendly wave of the hand with which ensconced in the vehicle beside her st george took leave of him  he even lingered to see the vehicle start away and lose itself in the confusion of bond street  he followed it with his eyes it put to him embarrassing things  shes not for me the great novelist had said emphatically at summersoft but his manner of conducting himself toward her appeared not quite in harmony with such a conviction  how could he have behaved differently if she had been for him  an indefinite envy rose in paul overts heart as he took his way on foot alone a feeling addressed alike strangely enough to each of the occupants of the hansom how much he should like to rattle about london with such a girl  how much he should like to go and look at types with st george  the next sunday at four oclock he called in manchester square where his secret wish was gratified by his finding miss fancourt alone  she was in a large bright friendly occupied room which was painted red all over draped with the quaint cheap florid stuffs that are represented as coming from southern and eastern countries where they are fabled to serve as the counterpanes of the peasantry and bedecked with pottery of vivid hues ranged on casual shelves and with many watercolour drawings from the hand as the visitor learned of the young lady herself commemorating with a brave breadth the sunsets the mountains the temples and palaces of india  he sat an hourmore than an hour two hoursand all the while no one came in  his hostess was so good as to remark with her liberal humanity that it was delightful they werent interrupted it was so rare in london especially at that season that people got a good talk  but luckily now of a fine sunday half the world went out of town and that made it better for those who didnt go when these others were in sympathy  it was the defect of londonone of two or three the very short list of those she recognised in the teeming worldcity she adoredthat there were too few good chances for talk you never had time to carry anything far  too many thingstoo many things paul said quoting st georges exclamation of a few days before  ah yes for him there are too manyhis lifes too complicated  have you seen it near  thats what i should like to do it might explain some mysteries her visitor went on  she asked him what mysteries he meant and he said oh peculiarities of his work inequalities superficialities  for one who looks at it from the artistic point of view it contains a bottomless ambiguity  she became at this on the spot all intensity  ah do describe that moreits so interesting  there are no such suggestive questions  im so fond of them  he thinks hes a failurefancy she beautifully wailed  that depends on what his ideal may have been  with his gifts it ought to have been high  but till one knows what he really proposed to himself  do you know by chance the young man broke off  oh he doesnt talk to me about himself  i cant make him  its too provoking  paul was on the point of asking what then he did talk about but discretion checked it and he said instead do you think hes unhappy at home  she seemed to wonder  at home  i mean in his relations with his wife  he has a mystifying little way of alluding to her  not to me said marian fancourt with her clear eyes  that wouldnt be right would it she asked gravely  not particularly so im glad he doesnt mention her to you  to praise her might bore you and he has no business to do anything else  yet he knows you better than me  ah but he respects you the girl cried as with envy  her visitor stared a moment then broke into a laugh  doesnt he respect you  of course but not in the same way  he respects what youve donehe told me so the other day  paul drank it in but retained his faculties  when you went to look at types  yeswe found so many he has such an observation of them  he talked a great deal about your book  he says its really important  important  ah the grand creatureand the author of the work in question groaned for joy  he was wonderfully amusing he was inexpressibly droll while we walked about  he sees everything he has so many comparisons and images and theyre always exactly right  cest dun trouve as they say  yes with his gifts such things as he ought to have done paul sighed  and dont you think he has done them  ah it was just the point  a part of them and of course even that parts immense  but he might have been one of the greatest  however let us not make this an hour of qualifications  even as they stand our friend earnestly concluded his writings are a mine of gold  to this proposition she ardently responded and for half an hour the pair talked over the masters principal productions  she knew them wellshe knew them even better than her visitor who was struck with her critical intelligence and with something large and bold in the movement in her mind  she said things that startled him and that evidently had come to her directly they werent pickedup phrasesshe placed them too well st george had been right about her being firstrate about her not being afraid to gush not remembering that she must be proud  suddenly something came back to her and she said i recollect that he did speak of mrs st george to me once  he said apropos of something or other that she didnt care for perfection  thats a great crime in an artists wife paul returned  yes poor thing and the girl sighed with a suggestion of many reflexions some of them mitigating  but she presently added ah perfection perfectionhow one ought to go in for it  i wish i could  every one can in his way her companion opined  in his way yesbut not in hers  women are so hamperedso condemned  yet its a kind of dishonour if you dont when you want to do something isnt it  miss fancourt pursued dropping one train in her quickness to take up another an accident that was common with her so these two young persons sat discussing high themes in their eclectic drawingroom in their london seasondiscussing with extreme seriousness the high theme of perfection  it must be said in extenuation of this eccentricity that they were interested in the business  their tone had truth and their emotion beauty they werent posturing for each other or for some one else  the subject was so wide that they found themselves reducing it the perfection to which for the moment they agreed to confine their speculations was that of the valid the exemplary work of art  our young womans imagination it appeared had wandered far in that direction and her guest had the rare delight of feeling in their conversation a full interchange  this episode will have lived for years in his memory and even in his wonder it had the quality that fortune distils in a single drop at a timethe quality that lubricates many ensuing frictions  he still whenever he likes has a vision of the room the bright red sociable talkative room with the curtains that by a stroke of successful audacity had the note of vivid blue  he remembers where certain things stood the particular book open on the table and the almost intense odour of the flowers placed at the left somewhere behind him  these facts were the fringe as it were of a fine special agitation which had its birth in those two hours and of which perhaps the main sign was in its leading him inwardly and repeatedly to breathe i had no idea there was any one like thisi had no idea there was any one like this  her freedom amazed him and charmed himit seemed so to simplify the practical question  she was on the footing of an independent personagea motherless girl who had passed out of her teens and had a position and responsibilities who wasnt held down to the limitations of a little miss  she came and went with no dragged duenna she received people alone and though she was totally without hardness the question of protection or patronage had no relevancy in regard to her  she gave such an impression of the clear and the noble combined with the easy and the natural that in spite of her eminent modern situation she suggested no sort of sisterhood with the fast girl  modern she was indeed and made paul overt who loved old colour the golden glaze of time think with some alarm of the muddled palette of the future  he couldnt get used to her interest in the arts he cared for it seemed too good to be realit was so unlikely an adventure to tumble into such a well of sympathy  one might stray into the desert easilythat was on the cards and that was the law of life but it was too rare an accident to stumble on a crystal well  yet if her aspirations seemed at one moment too extravagant to be real they struck him at the next as too intelligent to be false  they were both high and lame and whims for whims he preferred them to any he had met in a like relation  it was probable enough she would leave them behindexchange them for politics or smartness or mere prolific maternity as was the custom of scribbling daubing educated flattered girls in an age of luxury and a society of leisure  he noted that the watercolours on the walls of the room she sat in had mainly the quality of being naives and reflected that naivete in art is like a zero in a number its importance depends on the figure it is united with  meanwhile however he had fallen in love with her before he went away at any rate he said to her i thought st george was coming to see you today but he doesnt turn up  for a moment he supposed she was going to cry comment donc  did you come here only to meet him  but the next he became aware of how little such a speech would have fallen in with any note of flirtation he had as yet perceived in her  she only replied ah yes but i dont think hell come  he recommended me not to expect him  then she gaily but all gently added he said it wasnt fair to you  but i think i could manage two  so could i paul overt returned stretching the point a little to meet her  in reality his appreciation of the occasion was so completely an appreciation of the woman before him that another figure in the scene even so esteemed a one as st george might for the hour have appealed to him vainly  he left the house wondering what the great man had meant by its not being fair to him and still more than that whether he had actually stayed away from the force of that idea  as he took his course through the sunday solitude of manchester square swinging his stick and with a good deal of emotion fermenting in his soul it appeared to him he was living in a world strangely magnanimous  miss fancourt had told him it was possible she should be away and that her father should be on the following sunday but that she had the hope of a visit from him in the other event  she promised to let him know should their absence fail and then he might act accordingly  after he had passed into one of the streets that open from the square he stopped without definite intentions looking sceptically for a cab  in a moment he saw a hansom roll through the place from the other side and come a part of the way toward him  he was on the point of hailing the driver when he noticed a fare within then he waited seeing the man prepare to deposit his passenger by pulling up at one of the houses  the house was apparently the one he himself had just quitted at least he drew that inference as he recognised henry st george in the person who stepped out of the hansom  paul turned off as quickly as if he had been caught in the act of spying  he gave up his cabhe preferred to walk he would go nowhere else  he was glad st george hadnt renounced his visit altogetherthat would have been too absurd  yes the world was magnanimous and even he himself felt so as on looking at his watch he noted but six oclock so that he could mentally congratulate his successor on having an hour still to sit in miss fancourts drawingroom  he himself might use that hour for another visit but by the time he reached the marble arch the idea of such a course had become incongruous to him  he passed beneath that architectural effort and walked into the park till he got upon the spreading grass  here he continued to walk he took his way across the elastic turf and came out by the serpentine  he watched with a friendly eye the diversions of the london people he bent a glance almost encouraging on the young ladies paddling their sweethearts about the lake and the guardsmen tickling tenderly with their bearskins the artificial flowers in the sunday hats of their partners  he prolonged his meditative walk he went into kensington gardens he sat upon the penny chairs he looked at the little sailboats launched upon the round pond and was glad he had no engagement to dine  he repaired for this purpose very late to his club where he found himself unable to order a repast and told the waiter to bring whatever there was  he didnt even observe what he was served with and he spent the evening in the library of the establishment pretending to read an article in an american magazine  he failed to discover what it was about it appeared in a dim way to be about marian fancourt  quite late in the week she wrote to him that she was not to go into the countryit had only just been settled  her father she added would never settle anything but put it all on her  she felt her responsibilityshe had toand since she was forced this was the way she had decided  she mentioned no reasons which gave our friend all the clearer field for bold conjecture about them  in manchester square on this second sunday he esteemed his fortune less good for she had three or four other visitors  but there were three or four compensations perhaps the greatest of which was that learning how her father had after all at the last hour gone out of town alone the bold conjecture i just now spoke of found itself becoming a shade more bold  and then her presence was her presence and the personal red room was there and was full of it whatever phantoms passed and vanished emitting incomprehensible sounds  lastly he had the resource of staying till every one had come and gone and of believing this grateful to her though she gave no particular sign  when they were alone together he came to his point  but st george did comelast sunday  i saw him as i looked back  yes but it was the last time  the last time  he said he would never come again  paul overt stared  does he mean he wishes to cease to see you  i dont know what he means the girl bravely smiled  he wont at any rate see me here  and pray why not  i havent the least idea said marian fancourt whose visitor found her more perversely sublime than ever yet as she professed this clear helplessness     chapter v   oh i say i want you to stop a little henry st george said to him at eleven oclock the night he dined with the head of the profession  the companynone of it indeed of the professionhad been numerous and was taking its leave our young man after bidding goodnight to his hostess had put out his hand in farewell to the master of the house  besides drawing from the latter the protest i have cited this movement provoked a further priceless word about their chance now to have a talk their going into his room his having still everything to say  paul overt was all delight at this kindness nevertheless he mentioned in weak jocose qualification the bare fact that he had promised to go to another place which was at a considerable distance  well then youll break your promise thats all  you quite awful humbug st george added in a tone that confirmed our young mans ease  certainly ill break itbut it was a real promise  do you mean to miss fancourt  youre following her his friend asked  he answered by a question  oh is she going  base impostor his ironic host went on  ive treated you handsomely on the article of that young lady i wont make another concession  wait three minutesill be with you  he gave himself to his departing guests accompanied the longtrained ladies to the door  it was a hot night the windows were open the sound of the quick carriages and of the linkmens call came into the house  the affair had rather glittered a sense of festal things was in the heavy air not only the influence of that particular entertainment but the suggestion of the wide hurry of pleasure which in london on summer nights fills so many of the happier quarters of the complicated town  gradually mrs st georges drawing room emptied itself paul was left alone with his hostess to whom he explained the motive of his waiting  ah yes some intellectual some professional talk she leered at this season doesnt one miss it poor dear henry im so glad  the young man looked out of the window a moment at the called hansoms that lurched up at the smooth broughams that rolled away  when he turned round mrs st george had disappeared her husbands voice rose to him from belowhe was laughing and talking in the portico with some lady who awaited her carriage  paul had solitary possession for some minutes of the warm deserted rooms where the covered tinted lamplight was soft the seats had been pushed about and the odour of flowers lingered  they were large they were pretty they contained objects of value everything in the picture told of a good house  at the end of five minutes a servant came in with a request from the master that he would join him downstairs upon which descending he followed his conductor through a long passage to an apartment thrown out in the rear of the habitation for the special requirements as he guessed of a busy man of letters  st george was in his shirtsleeves in the middle of a large high rooma room without windows but with a wide skylight at the top that of a place of exhibition  it was furnished as a library and the serried bookshelves rose to the ceiling a surface of incomparable tone produced by dimlygilt backs interrupted here and there by the suspension of old prints and drawings  at the end furthest from the door of admission was a tall desk of great extent at which the person using it could write only in the erect posture of a clerk in a countinghouse and stretched from the entrance to this structure was a wide plain band of crimson cloth as straight as a gardenpath and almost as long where in his minds eye paul at once beheld the master pace to and fro during vexed hourshours that is of admirable composition  the servant gave him a coat an old jacket with a hang of experience from a cupboard in the wall retiring afterwards with the garment he had taken off  paul overt welcomed the coat it was a coat for talk it promised confidenceshaving visibly received so manyand had tragic literary elbows  ah were practicalwere practical st george said as he saw his visitor look the place over  isnt it a good big cage for going round and round  my wife invented it and she locks me up here every morning  our young man breathedby way of tributewith a certain oppression you dont miss a windowa place to look out  i did at first awfully but her calculation was just  it saves time it has saved me many months in these ten years  here i stand under the eye of dayin london of course very often its rather a bleared old eyewalled in to my trade  i cant get awayso the rooms a fine lesson in concentration  ive learnt the lesson i think look at that big bundle of proof and acknowledge it  he pointed to a fat roll of papers on one of the tables which had not been undone  are you bringing out another paul asked in a tone the fond deficiencies of which he didnt recognise till his companion burst out laughing and indeed scarce even then  you humbug you humbugst george appeared to enjoy caressing him as it were with that opprobrium  dont i know what you think of them he asked standing there with his hands in his pockets and with a new kind of smile  it was as if he were going to let his young votary see him all now  upon my word in that case you know more than i do the latter ventured to respond revealing a part of the torment of being able neither clearly to esteem nor distinctly to renounce him  my dear fellow said the more and more interesting master dont imagine i talk about my books specifically theyre not a decent subjectil ne manquerait plus que ca  im not so bad as you may apprehend  about myself yes a little if you like though it wasnt for that i brought you down here  i want to ask you somethingvery much indeed i value this chance  therefore sit down  were practical but there is a sofa you seefor she does humour my poor bones so far like all really great administrators and disciplinarians she knows when wisely to relax  paul sank into the corner of a deep leathern couch but his friend remained standing and explanatory  if you dont mind in this room this is my habit  from the door to the desk and from the desk to the door  that shakes up my imagination gently and dont you see what a good thing it is that theres no window for her to fly out of  the eternal standing as i write i stop at that bureau and put it down when anything comes and so we go on was rather wearisome at first but we adopted it with an eye to the long run youre in better orderif your legs dont break downand you can keep it up for more years  oh were practicalwere practical st george repeated going to the table and taking up all mechanically the bundle of proofs  but pulling off the wrapper he had a change of attention that appealed afresh to our hero he lost himself a moment examining the sheets of his new book while the younger mans eyes wandered over the room again  lord what good things i should do if i had such a charming place as this to do them in paul reflected  the outer world the world of accident and ugliness was so successfully excluded and within the rich protecting square beneath the patronising sky the dreamfigures the summoned company could hold their particular revel  it was a fond prevision of overts rather than an observation on actual data for which occasions had been too few that the master thus more closely viewed would have the quality the charming gift of flashing out all surprisingly in personal intercourse and at moments of suspended or perhaps even of diminished expectation  a happy relation with him would be a thing proceeding by jumps not by traceable stages  do you read themreally he asked laying down the proofs on pauls enquiring of him how soon the work would be published  and when the young man answered oh yes always he was moved to mirth again by something he caught in his manner of saying that  you go to see your grandmother on her birthdayand very proper it is especially as she wont last for ever  she has lost every faculty and every sense she neither sees nor hears nor speaks but all customary pieties and kindly habits are respectable  only youre strong if you do read em  i couldnt my dear fellow  you are strong i know and thats just a part of what i wanted to say to you  youre very strong indeed  ive been going into your other thingstheyve interested me immensely  some one ought to have told me about them beforesome one i could believe  but whom can one believe  youre wonderfully on the right roadits awfully decent work  now do you mean to keep it upthats what i want to ask you  do i mean to do others paul asked looking up from his sofa at his erect inquisitor and feeling partly like a happy little boy when the schoolmaster is gay and partly like some pilgrim of old who might have consulted a worldfamous oracle  st georges own performance had been infirm but as an adviser he would be infallible  othersothers  ah the number wont matter one other would do if it were really a further stepa throb of the same effort  what i mean is have you it in your heart to go in for some sort of decent perfection  ah decency ah perfection the young man sincerely sighed  i talked of them the other sunday with miss fancourt  it produced on the masters part a laugh of odd acrimony  yes theyll talk of them as much as you like  but theyll do little to help one to them  theres no obligation of course only you strike me as capable he went on  you must have thought it all over  i cant believe youre without a plan  thats the sensation you give me and its so rare that it really stirs one upit makes you remarkable  if you havent a plan if you dont mean to keep it up surely youre within your rights its nobodys business no one can force you and not more than two or three people will notice you dont go straight  the othersall the rest every blest soul in england will think you dowill think you are keeping it up upon my honour they will  i shall be one of the two or three who know better  now the question is whether you can do it for two or three  is that the stuff youre made of  it locked his guest a minute as in closed throbbing arms  i could do it for one if you were the one  dont say that i dont deserve it it scorches me he protested with eyes suddenly grave and glowing  the one is of course ones self ones conscience ones idea the singleness of ones aim  i think of that pure spirit as a man thinks of a woman he has in some detested hour of his youth loved and forsaken  she haunts him with reproachful eyes she lives for ever before him  as an artist you know ive married for money  paul stared and even blushed a little confounded by this avowal whereupon his host observing the expression of his face dropped a quick laugh and pursued you dont follow my figure  im not speaking of my dear wife who had a small fortunewhich however was not my bribe  i fell in love with her as many other people have done  i refer to the mercenary muse whom i led to the altar of literature  dont my boy put your nose into that yoke  the awful jade will lead you a life  our hero watched him wondering and deeply touched  havent you been happy  happy  its a kind of hell  there are things i should like to ask you paul said after a pause  ask me anything in all the world  id turn myself inside out to save you  to save me he quavered  to make you stick to itto make you see it through  as i said to you the other night at summersoft let my example be vivid to you  why your books are not so bad as that said paul fairly laughing and feeling that if ever a fellow had breathed the air of art  so bad as what  your talents so great that its in everything you do in whats less good as well as in whats best  youve some forty volumes to show for itforty volumes of wonderful life of rare observation of magnificent ability  im very clever of course i know thatbut it was a thing in fine this author made nothing of  lord what rot theyd all be if i hadnt been im a successful charlatan he went onive been able to pass off my system  but do you know what it is  its cartonpierre  cartonpierre paul was struck and gaped  lincrustawalton  ah dont say such thingsyou make me bleed the younger man protested i see you in a beautiful fortunate home living in comfort and honour  do you call it honourhis host took him up with an intonation that often comes back to him  thats what i want you to go in for  i mean the real thing  this is brummagem  brummagem paul ejaculated while his eyes wandered by a movement natural at the moment over the luxurious room  ah they make it so well todayits wonderfully deceptive  our friend thrilled with the interest and perhaps even more with the pity of it  yet he wasnt afraid to seem to patronise when he could still so far envy  is it deceptive that i find you living with every appearance of domestic felicityblest with a devoted accomplished wife with children whose acquaintance i havent yet had the pleasure of making but who must be delightful young people from what i know of their parents  st george smiled as for the candour of his question  its all excellent my dear fellowheaven forbid i should deny it  ive made a great deal of money my wife has known how to take care of it to use it without wasting it to put a good bit of it by to make it fructify  ive got a loaf on the shelf ive got everything in fact but the great thing  the great thing paul kept echoing  the sense of having done the bestthe sense which is the real life of the artist and the absence of which is his death of having drawn from his intellectual instrument the finest music that nature had hidden in it of having played it as it should be played  he either does that or he doesntand if he doesnt he isnt worth speaking of  therefore precisely those who really know dont speak of him  he may still hear a great chatter but what he hears most is the incorruptible silence of fame  ive squared her you may say for my little hourbut whats my little hour  dont imagine for a moment the master pursued that im such a cad as to have brought you down here to abuse or to complain of my wife to you  shes a woman of distinguished qualities to whom my obligations are immense so that if you please well say nothing about her  my boysmy children are all boysare straight and strong thank god and have no poverty of growth about them no penury of needs  i receive periodically the most satisfactory attestation from harrow from oxford from sandhurstoh weve done the best for themof their eminence as living thriving consuming organisms  it must be delightful to feel that the son of ones loins is at sandhurst paul remarked enthusiastically  it isits charming  oh im a patriot  the young man then could but have the greater tribute of questions to pay  then what did you meanthe other night at summersoftby saying that children are a curse  my dear youth on what basis are we talking and st george dropped upon the sofa at a short distance from him  sitting a little sideways he leaned back against the opposite arm with his hands raised and interlocked behind his head  on the supposition that a certain perfections possible and even desirableisnt it so  well all i say is that ones children interfere with perfection  ones wife interferes marriage interferes  you think then the artist shouldnt marry  he does so at his perilhe does so at his cost  not even when his wifes in sympathy with his work  she never isshe cant be  women havent a conception of such things  surely they on occasion work themselves paul objected  yes very badly indeed  oh of course often they think they understand they think they sympathise  then it is theyre most dangerous  their idea is that you shall do a great lot and get a great lot of money  their great nobleness and virtue their exemplary conscientiousness as british females is in keeping you up to that  my wife makes all my bargains with my publishers for me and has done so for twenty years  she does it consummately wellthats why im really pretty well off  arent you the father of their innocent babes and will you withhold from them their natural sustenance  you asked me the other night if theyre not an immense incentive  of course they aretheres no doubt of that  paul turned it over it took from eyes he had never felt open so wide so much looking at  for myself ive an idea i need incentives  ah well then nen parlons plus his companion handsomely smiled  you are an incentive i maintain the young man went on  you dont affect me in the way youd apparently like to  your great success is what i seethe pomp of ennismore gardens  successst georges eyes had a cold fine light  do you call it success to be spoken of as youd speak of me if you were sitting here with another artista young man intelligent and sincere like yourself do you call it success to make you blushas you would blushif some foreign critic some fellow of course i mean who should know what he was talking about and should have shown you he did as foreign critics like to show it were to say to you hes the one in this country whom they consider the most perfect isnt he  is it success to be the occasion of a young englishmans having to stammer as you would have to stammer at such a moment for old england  no no success is to have made people wriggle to another tune  do try it  paul continued all gravely to glow  try what  try to do some really good work  oh i want to heaven knows  well you cant do it without sacrificesdont believe that for a moment the master said  ive made none  ive had everything  in other words ive missed everything  youve had the full rich masculine human general life with all the responsibilities and duties and burdens and sorrows and joysall the domestic and social initiations and complications  they must be immensely suggestive immensely amusing paul anxiously submitted  amusing  for a strong manyes  theyve given me subjects without number if thats what you mean but theyve taken away at the same time the power to use them  ive touched a thousand things but which one of them have i turned into gold  the artist has to do only with thathe knows nothing of any baser metal ive led the life of the world with my wife and my progeny the clumsy conventional expensive materialised vulgarised brutalised life of london weve got everything handsome even a carriagewere perfect philistines and prosperous hospitable eminent people  but my dear fellow dont try to stultify yourself and pretend you dont know what we havent got its bigger than all the rest  between artistscome the master wound up  you know as well as you sit there that youd put a pistolball into your brain if you had written my books  it struck his listener that the tremendous talk promised by him at summersoft had indeed come off and with a promptitude a fulness with which the latters young imagination had scarcely reckoned  his impression fairly shook him and he throbbed with the excitement of such deep soundings and such strange confidences  he throbbed indeed with the conflict of his feelingsbewilderment and recognition and alarm enjoyment and protest and assent all commingled with tenderness and a kind of shame in the participation for the sores and bruises exhibited by so fine a creature and with a sense of the tragic secret nursed under his trappings  the idea of his paul overts becoming the occasion of such an act of humility made him flush and pant at the same time that his consciousness was in certain directions too much alive not to swallowand not intensely to tasteevery offered spoonful of the revelation  it had been his odd fortune to blow upon the deep waters to make them surge and break in waves of strange eloquence  but how couldnt he give out a passionate contradiction of his hosts last extravagance how couldnt he enumerate to him the parts of his work he loved the splendid things he had found in it beyond the compass of any other writer of the day  st george listened a while courteously then he said laying his hand on his visitors thats all very well and if your ideas to do nothing better theres no reason you shouldnt have as many good things as ias many human and material appendages as many sons or daughters a wife with as many gowns a house with as many servants a stable with as many horses a heart with as many aches  the master got up when he had spoken thushe stood a momentnear the sofa looking down on his agitated pupil  are you possessed of any property it occurred to him to ask  none to speak of  oh well then theres no reason why you shouldnt make a goodish incomeif you set about it the right way  study me for thatstudy me well  you may really have horses  paul sat there some minutes without speaking  he looked straight before himhe turned over many things  his friend had wandered away taking up a parcel of letters from the table where the roll of proofs had lain what was the book mrs st george made you burnthe one she didnt like our young man brought out  the book she made me burnhow did you know that  the master looked up from his letters quite without the facial convulsion the pupil had feared  i heard her speak of it at summersoft  ah yesshes proud of it  i dont knowit was rather good  what was it about  let me see  and he seemed to make an effort to remember  oh yesit was about myself  paul gave an irrepressible groan for the disappearance of such a production and the elder man went on oh but you should write ityou should do me  and he pulled upfrom the restless motion that had come upon him his fine smile a generous glare theres a subject my boy no end of stuff in it  again paul was silent but it was all tormenting  are there no women who really understandwho can take part in a sacrifice  how can they take part  they themselves are the sacrifice  theyre the idol and the altar and the flame  isnt there even one who sees further paul continued  for a moment st george made no answer after which having torn up his letters he came back to the point all ironic  of course i know the one you mean  but not even miss fancourt  i thought you admired her so much  its impossible to admire her more  are you in love with her st george asked  yes paul overt presently said  well then give it up  paul stared  give up my love  bless me no  your idea  and then as our hero but still gazed the one you talked with her about  the idea of a decent perfection  shed help itshed help it the young man cried  for about a yearthe first year yes  after that shed be as a millstone round its neck  paul frankly wondered  why she has a passion for the real thing for good workfor everything you and i care for most  you and i is charming my dear fellow his friend laughed  she has it indeed but shed have a still greater passion for her childrenand very proper too  shed insist on everythings being made comfortable advantageous propitious for them  that isnt the artists business  the artistthe artist  isnt he a man all the same  st george had a grand grimace  i mostly think not  you know as well as i what he has to do the concentration the finish the independence he must strive for from the moment he begins to wish his work really decent  ah my young friend his relation to women and especially to the one hes most intimately concerned with is at the mercy of the damning fact that whereas he can in the nature of things have but one standard they have about fifty  thats what makes them so superior st george amusingly added  fancy an artist with a change of standards as youd have a change of shirts or of dinnerplates  to do itto do it and make it divineis the only thing he has to think about  is it done or not is his only question  not is it done as well as a proper solicitude for my dear little family will allow  he has nothing to do with the relativehe has only to do with the absolute and a dear little family may represent a dozen relatives  then you dont allow him the common passions and affections of men paul asked  hasnt he a passion an affection which includes all the rest  besides let him have all the passions he likesif he only keeps his independence  he must be able to be poor  paul slowly got up  why then did you advise me to make up to her  st george laid his hand on his shoulder  because shed make a splendid wife  and i hadnt read you then  the young man had a strained smile  i wish you had left me alone  i didnt know that that wasnt good enough for you his host returned  what a false position what a condemnation of the artist that hes a mere disfranchised monk and can produce his effect only by giving up personal happiness  what an arraignment of art paul went on with a trembling voice  ah you dont imagine by chance that im defending art  arraignmenti should think so  happy the societies in which it hasnt made its appearance for from the moment it comes they have a consuming ache they have an incurable corruption in their breast  most assuredly is the artist in a false position  but i thought we were taking him for granted  pardon me st george continued ginistrella made me  paul stood looking at the floorone oclock struck in the stillness from a neighbouring churchtower  do you think shed ever look at me he put to his friend at last  miss fancourtas a suitor  why shouldnt i think it  thats why ive tried to favour youive had a little chance or two of bettering your opportunity  forgive my asking you but do you mean by keeping away yourself paul said with a blush  im an old idiotmy place isnt there st george stated gravely  im nothing yet ive no fortune and there must be so many others his companion pursued  the master took this considerably in but made little of it  youre a gentleman and a man of genius  i think you might do something  but if i must give that upthe genius  lots of people you know think ive kept mine st george wonderfully grinned  youve a genius for mystification paul declared but grasping his hand gratefully in attenuation of this judgement  poor dear boy i do worry you  but try try all the same  i think your chances are good and youll win a great prize  paul held fast the others hand a minute he looked into the strange deep face  no i am an artisti cant help it  ah show it then st george pleadingly broke out  let me see before i die the thing i most want the thing i yearn for a life in which the passionoursis really intense  if you can be rare dont fail of it think what it ishow it countshow it lives  they had moved to the door and he had closed both his hands over his companions  here they paused again and our hero breathed deep  i want to live  in what sense  in the greatest  well then stick to itsee it through  with your sympathyyour help  count on thatyoull be a great figure to me  count on my highest appreciation my devotion  youll give me satisfactionif that has any weight with you  after which as paul appeared still to waver his host added do you remember what you said to me at summersoft  something infatuated no doubt  ill do anything in the world you tell me  you said that  and you hold me to it  ah what am i the master expressively sighed  lord what things i shall have to do paul almost moaned as be departed     chapter vi   it goes on too much abroadhang abroad  these or something like them had been the masters remarkable words in relation to the action of ginistrella and yet though they had made a sharp impression on the author of that work like almost all spoken words from the same source he a week after the conversation i have noted left england for a long absence and full of brave intentions  it is not a perversion of the truth to pronounce that encounter the direct cause of his departure  if the oral utterance of the eminent writer had the privilege of moving him deeply it was especially on his turning it over at leisure hours and days later that it appeared to yield him its full meaning and exhibit its extreme importance  he spent the summer in switzerland and having in september begun a new task determined not to cross the alps till he should have made a good start  to this end he returned to a quiet corner he knew well on the edge of the lake of geneva and within sight of the towers of chillon a region and a view for which he had an affection that sprang from old associations and was capable of mysterious revivals and refreshments  here he lingered late till the snow was on the nearer hills almost down to the limit to which he could climb when his stint on the shortening afternoons was performed  the autumn was fine the lake was blue and his book took form and direction  these felicities for the time embroidered his life which he suffered to cover him with its mantle  at the end of six weeks he felt he had learnt st georges lesson by heart had tested and proved its doctrine  nevertheless he did a very inconsistent thing before crossing the alps he wrote to marian fancourt  he was aware of the perversity of this act and it was only as a luxury an amusement the reward of a strenuous autumn that he justified it  she had asked of him no such favour when shortly before he left london three days after their dinner in ennismore gardens he went to take leave of her  it was true she had had no groundhe hadnt named his intention of absence  he had kept his counsel for want of due assurance it was that particular visit that was the next thing to settle the matter  he had paid the visit to see how much he really cared for her and quick departure without so much as an explicit farewell was the sequel to this enquiry the answer to which had created within him a deep yearning  when he wrote her from clarens he noted that he owed her an explanation more than three months after for not having told her what he was doing  she replied now briefly but promptly and gave him a striking piece of news that of the death a week before of mrs st george  this exemplary woman had succumbed in the country to a violent attack of inflammation of the lungshe would remember that for a long time she had been delicate  miss fancourt added that she believed her husband overwhelmed by the blow he would miss her too terriblyshe had been everything in life to him  paul overt on this immediately wrote to st george  he would from the day of their parting have been glad to remain in communication with him but had hitherto lacked the right excuse for troubling so busy a man  their long nocturnal talk came back to him in every detail but this was no bar to an expression of proper sympathy with the head of the profession for hadnt that very talk made it clear that the late accomplished lady was the influence that ruled his life what catastrophe could be more cruel than the extinction of such an influence  this was to be exactly the tone taken by st george in answering his young friend upwards of a month later  he made no allusion of course to their important discussion  he spoke of his wife as frankly and generously as if he had quite forgotten that occasion and the feeling of deep bereavement was visible in his words  she took everything off my handsoff my mind  she carried on our life with the greatest art the rarest devotion and i was free as few men can have been to drive my pen to shut myself up with my trade  this was a rare servicethe highest she could have rendered me  would i could have acknowledged it more fitly  a certain bewilderment for our hero disengaged itself from these remarks they struck him as a contradiction a retractation strange on the part of a man who hadnt the excuse of witlessness  he had certainly not expected his correspondent to rejoice in the death of his wife and it was perfectly in order that the rupture of a tie of more than twenty years should have left him sore  but if she had been so clear a blessing what in the name of consistency had the dear man meant by turning him upside down that nightby dosing him to that degree at the most sensitive hour of his life with the doctrine of renunciation  if mrs st george was an irreparable loss then her husbands inspired advice had been a bad joke and renunciation was a mistake  overt was on the point of rushing back to london to show that for his part he was perfectly willing to consider it so and he went so far as to take the manuscript of the first chapters of his new book out of his tabledrawer to insert it into a pocket of his portmanteau  this led to his catching a glimpse of certain pages he hadnt looked at for months and that accident in turn to his being struck with the high promise they revealeda rare result of such retrospections which it was his habit to avoid as much as possible they usually brought home to him that the glow of composition might be a purely subjective and misleading emotion  on this occasion a certain belief in himself disengaged itself whimsically from the serried erasures of his first draft making him think it best after all to pursue his present trial to the end  if he could write as well under the rigour of privation it might be a mistake to change the conditions before that spell had spent itself  he would go back to london of course but he would go back only when he should have finished his book  this was the vow he privately made restoring his manuscript to the tabledrawer  it may be added that it took him a long time to finish his book for the subject was as difficult as it was fine and he was literally embarrassed by the fulness of his notes  something within him warned him that he must make it supremely goodotherwise he should lack as regards his private behaviour a handsome excuse  he had a horror of this deficiency and found himself as firm as need be on the question of the lamp and the file  he crossed the alps at last and spent the winter the spring the ensuing summer in italy where still at the end of a twelvemonth his task was unachieved  stick to itsee it through this general injunction of st georges was good also for the particular case  he applied it to the utmost with the result that when in its slow order the summer had come round again he felt he had given all that was in him  this time he put his papers into his portmanteau with the address of his publisher attached and took his way northward  he had been absent from london for two yearstwo years which seeming to count as more had made such a difference in his own lifethrough the production of a novel far stronger he believed than ginistrellathat he turned out into piccadilly the morning after his arrival with a vague expectation of changes of finding great things had happened  but there were few transformations in piccadillyonly three or four big red houses where there had been low black onesand the brightness of the end of june peeped through the rusty railings of the green park and glittered in the varnish of the rolling carriages as he had seen it in other more cursory junes  it was a greeting he appreciated it seemed friendly and pointed added to the exhilaration of his finished book of his having his own country and the huge oppressive amusing city that suggested everything that contained everything under his hand again  stay at home and do things heredo subjects we can measure st george had said and now it struck him he should ask nothing better than to stay at home for ever  late in the afternoon he took his way to manchester square looking out for a number he hadnt forgotten  miss fancourt however was not at home so that he turned rather dejectedly from the door  his movement brought him face to face with a gentleman just approaching it and recognised on another glance as miss fancourts father  paul saluted this personage and the general returned the greeting with his customary good mannera manner so good however that you could never tell whether it meant he placed you  the disappointed caller felt the impulse to address him then hesitating became both aware of having no particular remark to make and convinced that though the old soldier remembered him he remembered him wrong  he therefore went his way without computing the irresistible effect his own evident recognition would have on the general who never neglected a chance to gossip  our young mans face was expressive and observation seldom let it pass  he hadnt taken ten steps before he heard himself called after with a friendly semiarticulate eri beg your pardon  he turned round and the general smiling at him from the porch said wont you come in i wont leave you the advantage of me  paul declined to come in and then felt regret for miss fancourt so late in the afternoon might return at any moment  but her father gave him no second chance he appeared mainly to wish not to have struck him as ungracious  a further look at the visitor had recalled something enough at least to enable him to say youve come back youve come back  paul was on the point of replying that he had come back the night before but he suppressed the next instant this strong light on the immediacy of his visit and giving merely a general assent alluded to the young lady he deplored not having found  he had come late in the hope she would be in  ill tell herill tell her said the old man and then he added quickly gallantly youll be giving us something new  its a long time isnt it  now he remembered him right  rather long  im very slow paul explained  i met you at summersoft a long time ago  oh yeswith henry st george  i remember very well  before his poor wife general fancourt paused a moment smiling a little less  i dare say you know  about mrs st georges death  certainlyi heard at the time  oh no i meani mean hes to be married  ah ive not heard that  but just as paul was about to add to whom the general crossed his intention  when did you come back  i know youve been awayby my daughter  she was very sorry  you ought to give her something new  i came back last night said our young man to whom something had occurred which made his speech for the moment a little thick  ah most kind of you to come so soon  couldnt you turn up at dinner  at dinner paul just mechanically repeated not liking to ask whom st george was going to marry but thinking only of that  there are several people i believe  certainly st george  or afterwards if you like better  i believe my daughter expects  he appeared to notice something in the visitors raised face on his steps he stood higher which led him to interrupt himself and the interruption gave him a momentary sense of awkwardness from which he sought a quick issue  perhaps then you havent heard shes to be married  paul gaped again  to be married  to mr st georgeit has just been settled  odd marriage isnt it our listener uttered no opinion on this point he only continued to stare  but i dare say it will doshes so awfully literary said the general  paul had turned very red  oh its a surprisevery interesting very charming  im afraid i cant dineso many thanks  well you must come to the wedding cried the general  oh i remember that day at summersoft  hes a great man you know  charmingcharming paul stammered for retreat  he shook hands with the general and got off  his face was red and he had the sense of its growing more and more crimson  all the evening at homehe went straight to his rooms and remained there dinnerlesshis cheek burned at intervals as if it had been smitten  he didnt understand what had happened to him what trick had been played him what treachery practised  none none he said to himself  ive nothing to do with it  im out of itits none of my business  but that bewildered murmur was followed again and again by the incongruous ejaculation was it a planwas it a plan  sometimes he cried to himself breathless have i been duped sold swindled  if at all he was an absurd an abject victim  it was as if he hadnt lost her till now  he had renounced her yes but that was another affairthat was a closed but not a locked door  now he seemed to see the door quite slammed in his face  did he expect her to waitwas she to give him his time like that two years at a stretch  he didnt know what he had expectedhe only knew what he hadnt  it wasnt thisit wasnt this  mystification bitterness and wrath rose and boiled in him when he thought of the deference the devotion the credulity with which he had listened to st george  the evening wore on and the light was long but even when it had darkened he remained without a lamp  he had flung himself on the sofa where he lay through the hours with his eyes either closed or gazing at the gloom in the attitude of a man teaching himself to bear something to bear having been made a fool of he had made it too easythat idea passed over him like a hot wave suddenly as he heard eleven oclock strike he jumped up remembering what general fancourt had said about his coming after dinner  hed gohed see her at least perhaps he should see what it meant  he felt as if some of the elements of a hard sum had been given him and the others were wanting he couldnt do his sum till he had got all his figures  he dressed and drove quickly so that by halfpast eleven he was at manchester square  there were a good many carriages at the doora party was going on a circumstance which at the last gave him a slight relief for now he would rather see her in a crowd  people passed him on the staircase they were going away going on with the hunted herdlike movement of london society at night  but sundry groups remained in the drawingroom and it was some minutes as she didnt hear him announced before he discovered and spoke to her  in this short interval he had seen st george talking to a lady before the fireplace but he at once looked away feeling unready for an encounter and therefore couldnt be sure the author of shadowmere noticed him  at all events he didnt come over though miss fancourt did as soon as she saw himshe almost rushed at him smiling rustling radiant beautiful  he had forgotten what her head what her face offered to the sight she was in white there were gold figures on her dress and her hair was a casque of gold  he saw in a single moment that she was happy happy with an aggressive splendour  but she wouldnt speak to him of that she would speak only of himself  im so delighted my father told me  how kind of you to come  she struck him as so fresh and brave while his eyes moved over her that he said to himself irresistibly why to him why not to youth to strength to ambition to a future  why in her rich young force to failure to abdication to superannuation  in his thought at that sharp moment he blasphemed even against all that had been left of his faith in the peccable master  im so sorry i missed you she went on  my father told me  how charming of you to have come so soon  does that surprise you paul overt asked  the first day  no from younothing thats nice  she was interrupted by a lady who bade her goodnight and he seemed to read that it cost her nothing to speak to him in that tone it was her old liberal lavish way with a certain added amplitude that time had brought and if this manner began to operate on the spot at such a juncture in her history perhaps in the other days too it had meant just as little or as mucha mere mechanical charity with the difference now that she was satisfied ready to give but in want of nothing  oh she was satisfiedand why shouldnt she be  why shouldnt she have been surprised at his coming the first dayfor all the good she had ever got from him  as the lady continued to hold her attention paul turned from her with a strange irritation in his complicated artistic soul and a sort of disinterested disappointment she was so happy that it was almost stupida disproof of the extraordinary intelligence he had formerly found in her  didnt she know how bad st george could be hadnt she recognised the awful thinness if she didnt she was nothing and if she did why such an insolence of serenity  this question expired as our young mans eyes settled at last on the genius who had advised him in a great crisis  st george was still before the chimneypiece but now he was alonefixed waiting as if he meant to stop after every oneand he met the clouded gaze of the young friend so troubled as to the degree of his right the right his resentment would have enjoyed to regard himself as a victim  somehow the ravage of the question was checked by the masters radiance  it was as fine in its way as marian fancourts it denoted the happy human being but also it represented to paul overt that the author of shadowmere had now definitely ceased to countceased to count as a writer  as he smiled a welcome across the place he was almost banal was almost smug  paul fancied that for a moment he hesitated to make a movement as if for all the world he had his bad conscience then they had already met in the middle of the room and had shaken handsexpressively cordially on st georges part  with which they had passed back together to where the elder man had been standing while st george said i hope youre never going away again  ive been dining here the general told me  he was handsome he was young he looked as if he had still a great fund of life  he bent the friendliest most unconfessing eyes on his disciple of a couple of years before asked him about everything his health his plans his late occupations the new book  when will it be outsoon soon i hope  splendid eh  thats right youre a comfort youre a luxury  ive read you all over again these last six months  paul waited to see if he would tell him what the general had told him in the afternoon and what miss fancourt verbally at least of course hadnt  but as it didnt come out he at last put the question  is it true the great news i hearthat youre to be married  ah you have heard it then  didnt the general tell you paul asked  the masters face was wonderful  tell me what  that he mentioned it to me this afternoon  my dear fellow i dont remember  weve been in the midst of people im sorry in that case that i lose the pleasure myself of announcing to you a fact that touches me so nearly  it is a fact strange as it may appear  it has only just become one  isnt it ridiculous  st george made this speech without confusion but on the other hand so far as our friend could judge without latent impudence  it struck his interlocutor that to talk so comfortably and coolly he must simply have forgotten what had passed between them  his next words however showed he hadnt and they produced as an appeal to pauls own memory an effect which would have been ludicrous if it hadnt been cruel  do you recall the talk we had at my house that night into which miss fancourts name entered  ive often thought of it since  yes no wonder you said what you didpaul was careful to meet his eyes  in the light of the present occasion  ah but there was no light then how could i have foreseen this hour  didnt you think it probable  upon my honour no said henry st george  certainly i owe you that assurance  think how my situation has changed  i seei see our young man murmured  his companion went on as if now that the subject had been broached he was as a person of imagination and tact quite ready to give every satisfactionbeing both by his genius and his method so able to enter into everything another might feel  but its not only that for honestly at my age i never dreameda widower with big boys and with so little else  it has turned out differently from anything one could have dreamed and im fortunate beyond all measure  she has been so free and yet she consents  better than any one else perhapsfor i remember how you liked her before you went away and how she liked youyou can intelligently congratulate me  she has been so free  those words made a great impression on paul overt and he almost writhed under that irony in them as to which it so little mattered whether it was designed or casual  of course she had been free and appreciably perhaps by his own act for wasnt the masters allusion to her having liked him a part of the irony too  i thought that by your theory you disapproved of a writers marrying  surelysurely  but you dont call me a writer  you ought to be ashamed said paul  ashamed of marrying again  i wont say thatbut ashamed of your reasons  the elder man beautifully smiled  you must let me judge of them my good friend  yes why not  for you judged wonderfully of mine  the tone of these words appeared suddenly for st george to suggest the unsuspected  he stared as if divining a bitterness  dont you think ive been straight  you might have told me at the time perhaps  my dear fellow when i say i couldnt pierce futurity  i mean afterwards  the master wondered  after my wifes death  when this idea came to you  ah never never  i wanted to save you rare and precious as you are  poor overt looked hard at him  are you marrying miss fancourt to save me  not absolutely but it adds to the pleasure  i shall be the making of you st george smiled  i was greatly struck after our talk with the brave devoted way you quitted the country and still more perhaps with your force of character in remaining abroad  youre very strongyoure wonderfully strong  paul tried to sound his shining eyes the strange thing was that he seemed sincerenot a mocking fiend  he turned away and as he did so heard the master say something about his giving them all the proof being the joy of his old age  he faced him again taking another look  do you mean to say youve stopped writing  my dear fellow of course i have  its too late  didnt i tell you  i cant believe it  of course you cantwith your own talent  no no for the rest of my life i shall only read you  does she know thatmiss fancourt  she willshe will  did he mean this our young man wondered as a covert intimation that the assistance he should derive from that young ladys fortune moderate as it was would make the difference of putting it in his power to cease to work ungratefully an exhausted vein  somehow standing there in the ripeness of his successful manhood he didnt suggest that any of his veins were exhausted  dont you remember the moral i offered myself to you that night as pointing st george continued  consider at any rate the warning i am at present  this was too muchhe was the mocking fiend  paul turned from him with a mere nod for goodnight and the sense in a sore heart that he might come back to him and his easy grace his fine way of arranging things some time in the far future but couldnt fraternise with him now  it was necessary to his soreness to believe for the hour in the intensity of his grievanceall the more cruel for its not being a legal one  it was doubtless in the attitude of hugging this wrong that he descended the stairs without taking leave of miss fancourt who hadnt been in view at the moment he quitted the room  he was glad to get out into the honest dusky unsophisticating night to move fast to take his way home on foot he walked a long time going astray paying no attention  he was thinking of too many other things  his steps recovered their direction however and at the end of an hour he found himself before his door in the small inexpensive empty street  he lingered questioning himself still before going in with nothing around and above him but moonless blackness a bad lamp or two and a few faraway dim stars  to these last faint features he raised his eyes he had been saying to himself that he should have been sold indeed diabolically sold if now on his new foundation at the end of a year st george were to put forth something of his prime qualitysomething of the type of shadowmere and finer than his finest  greatly as he admired his talent paul literally hoped such an incident wouldnt occur it seemed to him just then that he shouldnt be able to bear it  his late advisers words were still in his earsyoure very strong wonderfully strong  was he really  certainly he would have to be and it might a little serve for revenge  is he the reader may ask in turn if his interest has followed the perplexed young man so far  the best answer to that perhaps is that hes doing his best but that its too soon to say  when the new book came out in the autumn mr and mrs st george found it really magnificent  the former still has published nothing but paul doesnt even yet feel safe  i may say for him however that if this event were to occur he would really be the very first to appreciate it which is perhaps a proof that the master was essentially right and that nature had dedicated him to intellectual not to personal passion
