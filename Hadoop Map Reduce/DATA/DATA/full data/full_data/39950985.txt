39950985	note   after lying buried for almost three quarters of a century in the columns of a single newspaper unknown even to lincoln specialists this eulogy on president zachary taylor was discovered by sheer accident it was then brought to the attention of rev william e barton dd of chicago who has long been an ardent student of abraham lincoln and has published several books about him by diligent searching he was able to gather the many details which he has embodied in his introduction to the eulogy and the publishers have gladly co√∂perated with him for the preservation of all the

lincoln   illustration    boston and new york houghton mifflin company the riverside press cambridge 1922     copyright 1922 by william r barton  all rights reserved     introduction   the discovery of an unknown address by abraham lincoln is an event of literary and historical significance various attempts have been made to recover his lost speech delivered in bloomington in 1856 henry c whitney undertook to reconstruct it from notes and memory with a result which has been approved by some who heard it while others including a considerable group who gathered in bloomington to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of its original delivery and of the event which called it forth declared their conviction that abraham lincolns lost speech is still lost so far as i am aware no one now living remembers to have heard lincolns address on the death of president zachary taylor lincolns oration on the death of henry clay is well known and his speech commemorative of his friend benjamin ferguson also is of record his eulogy on president zachary taylor however appears to have been wholly overlooked by lincolns biographers and by the compilers of various editions of his works nicolay and hay make no allusion to it either in their life of lincoln or in their painstaking compilations of his writings and speeches i have found but one reference to it that in whitneys life on the circuit with lincoln  lovers of lincoln are to be congratulated upon this discovery of which some account is to be given in this introduction the address was delivered in the city hall in chicago on thursday afternoon july 25 1850 it was printed in one chicago paper it was set up from lincolns original manuscript furnished for the purpose  president taylor died at washington on july 9 1850 the disease was diagnosed as cholera morbus a number of other distinguished men were sick in washington at the same time and apparently with the same disease the death of taylor was a hard blow to the whig party of its seven candidates for the presidency it succeeded in electing only two william henry harrison and zachary taylor and each of these died not long after his election  lincoln arrived in chicago two days before the presidents death the chicago journal of monday evening july 8 1850 reported       hon a lincoln of springfield arrived in town yesterday to      attend to duties in the united states district court now in      session in this city  a meeting was held in chicago on the night of the presidents death tuesday july 9 1850 and arrangements were made for a memorial service in accordance with the journalistic methods of the times the daily papers reported the proceedings entire  the committee appointed evidently acted promptly for the same issue records that the committee had selected lincoln as the eulogist and that he had accepted the formal acceptance however was not published until two weeks later and just before the address itself was delivered the occasion for the delay would appear to have been that the common council of the city of chicago had started independently a movement for a memorial service and that the two committees after some conference had agreed to combine in one service to be held in the city hall the following correspondence was published on wednesday evening july 24       eulogy upon the late president        the following is a copy of the correspondence between the hon a      lincoln and the committee of arrangements for paying a suitable      tribute of respect to the late president of the united states       a lincoln esq       sirwe

to furnish the address to its readers on saturday july 27 it found itself under the necessity however of printing only part of the address in that issue and apologized with a statement that postponement of the remainder was due to illness among its workmen on monday the address was printed complete the type used in the saturday issue remained standing and the remainder of the eulogy was set up and joined to it  my attention was called to this report by hon edward w baker of barry illinois who having undertaken to discover in the chicago historical society another matter relating to lincoln in which we were both interested found this address and reported it to me with an inquiry whether i had knowledge of it i made search of the daily papers of the period and found not only the address but the correspondence and notable items as here given  lincoln must have been glad of this opportunity to speak out of his heart his words of sincere admiration for a man whom he had helped to elect president of the united states from the outset lincoln had believed in taylor while many other whigs refused to support or supported with languid interest a candidate who was a slaveholder and who had borne a conspicuous part in the mexican war  taylor was nominated by a whig convention which met in philadelphia june 7 1848 the party was so divided that it could not put forth a distinctive platform even an attempt to unite upon an expression concerning the wilmot proviso was regarded as so divisive that it was not permitted to come to a vote the real platform was general taylor and his popular nickname old rough and ready although taylor was no politician and a stranger even to the ballotbox he regarded himself as a whig but he took pains to explain that he was not an ultra whig daniel webster called him an ignorant old frontier colonel but not only webster but clay and seward joined in his support many a whig who voted for taylor accepted him as the choice of two evils lincoln however was enthusiastic in his support of the nominee he went into the campaign as nicolay and hay remind us with exultant alacrity they say       he could not even wait for the adjournment of congress to begin his      stump speaking following the bad example of the rest of his      colleagues he obtained the floor on the 27th of july and made a      long brilliant and humorous speech upon the merits of the two      candidates before the peopleabraham lincoln a history vol      i p 279  this was lincolns noted coattail speech in which he paid his respects to general cass the candidate of the democrats  immediately after the adjournment of congress lincoln went to new england where he delivered speeches in favor of taylor and opposing not so much the democrats as the freesoilers whose hostility was weakening and threatening to defeat the whig party  lincoln fully expected that taylor when elected would remember and reward him for this service what lincoln wanted inasmuch as he was not permitted to return to congress was an appointment as general commissioner of the united states land office in washington to his bitter disappointment taylor did not appoint him but gave the position to justin butterfield of chicago who was said to have been favored by daniel webster  although lincolns chief activity in the taylor campaign was outside the state of illinois it happened that he delivered one notable stump speech for taylor in the city of chicago it was while he was on his way back from the east coming in part by the great lakes and making his visit to niagara that he stopped in chicago friday october 6 1848 the evening journal announced that hon a lincoln mc from this state and family were at the sherman house the same issue called upon the friends of taylor and fillmore to rally that evening at the courthouse and hear mr lincoln on the issues of the campaign the notice is short said the journal but old zacks soldiers are all minute men the papers next day announced that although there was scant notice only six hours the courthouse was overcrowded and adjournment had to be taken to the park where lincoln spoke for two hours in what the editor declared was one of the best political speeches which the editor had ever heard or read  when general taylor died it was eminently fitting that lincoln as the one whig member from illinois of the last congress before the election of taylor should have been invited to deliver the eulogy upon him his arrival in chicago two days before the death of president taylor furnished a convenient opportunity for the people of the city to hear him if lincoln had any feelings as he may well have had that general taylor did not sufficiently recognize lincolns activities in the campaign that led to his election the address portrays nothing of his disappointment though the address was hastily prepared in the midst of duties which kept him more or less busy in court he accepted the invitation gladly and improved the occasion to the satisfaction of his hearers  in a number of respects the address of lincoln presents points of interest first of all it is notable in its biographical character it presents in outline a fairly complete account of the life and service of general taylor lincoln doubtless availed himself of such biographical data as the campaign had recently produced and which lincoln found at hand in chicago after the invitation had been received by him to deliver the address  it is noteworthy that in speaking of taylors invasion of mexican territory lincoln takes pains to state that he did it under orders it was this fact that enabled lincoln and other whigs who were opposed on principle to the mexican war to support taylor for the presidency they were particular to explain that he performed that act as a soldier under orders and that the polk administration was responsible and not their own candidate in this address lincoln did not enlarge upon that fact but he did not fail to state it  his favorable comment upon the fact that taylor had not engaged in dueling is the more notable because lincoln had himself been an unwilling participant in what had threatened to be a duela fact of which he was never very proud  it is notable that he speaks of taylors freedom from ambition to be president until the position came within the range of possibility and then became possessed of a laudable ambition to secure the position lincoln had not as yet precisely an ambition of that character but there always lurked in his mind the possibility that he might rise to that high position even in 1848 when he had not been re√´lected to congress and had been disappointed in his remaining political ambition he still thought the desire to become president a laudable ambition  we note in the oration one or two studied attempts at eloquence such as characterized the earlier oratory of lincoln but which disappeared wholly from his later and more chaste style the description of the mutual solicitude of the garrison of fort brown and the party of soldiers outside the fort and of the relief that was succeeded by a cry of victory must have been dramatic and it shows at its best that earlier vein of abraham lincolns studied attempt at oratorical effect  one of the most interesting because most characteristic qualities of the address is the appreciation of the magnanimity of general taylor as exemplified in his treatment of colonel worth this i regard as one of the best things in the address because it was an example of what was best in that bluff and sensible and generous old soldier zachary taylor and because it was so nobly characteristic also of abraham lincoln lincoln emphasized that quality in taylor because he unconsciously sought out in him what was most truly like to his own noble nature  orations by one president upon another are none too common in american literature and this by lincoln upon taylor is of value in its estimate of the best in taylor as discerned by one in whom the same quality was worthily present lincoln would have done for worth what taylor did he treated in similar fashion the men who opposed him  one feature of the oration has remarkable interest it appears to have been the only address of lincolns in which he made use of his favorite poem       oh why should the spirit of mortal be proud  this poem he quoted so often to his friends that some of them supposed him to have been its author but so far as a search of his published works can show he did not use it in any other formal address  lincoln often inquired of his friends whether any of them knew the author of this poem so far as is known he never learned herndon in his lecture which has served as the basis of all the literature concerning lincoln and ann rutledge informs us that after the death of ann lincoln formed an attachment for this poem it has been affirmed that he learned it from ann i have inquired of mrs sarah rutledge saunders surviving1 sister of ann rutledge whether her mother knew this poem and taught it to her daughters ann included she replied       yes mother knew the poem oh why should the spirit of mortal be      proud but she did not teach it to lincoln the girls and mother      learned it from lincoln they always called it lincolns song  footnote 1 mrs saunders was living when this introduction was written but died may 1 1922  the first allusion made to this poem in any of lincolns letters that i have seen was in april 1846 when he was writing some verses of his own and comparing them with those of another budding poet william johnson johnson had sent to lincoln a poem which he had written a parody upon poes raven lincoln had never read the raven but he sent to johnson some lines of his own composed after his visit to his old home in indiana in the fall of 1844 subsequently in september 1846 lincoln sent him additional lines suggested by the same visit it is in the letter of april 18 1846 that lincoln refers to the poem oh why should the spirit of mortal be proud he says       i have not your letter now before me but from memory i think you      ask me who is the author of the piece i sent you and that you do      so ask as to indicate a slight suspicion that i am the author      beyond all question i am not the author i would give all i am      worth and go in debt to be able to write so fine a piece as i      think that is i met it in a straggling newspaper last summer and      i remember to have seen it once before about fifteen years ago      and this is all i know about it  the statement that he first had seen the poem about fifteen years before 1846that is about 1831carries his acquaintance with it back to the period of his friendship for ann rutledge and it is not at all improbable that she learned it at the same time  after lincoln had become president he is said to have made one or more copies of this poem for personal friends but i have not seen any of these copies it would be interesting to know whether he ever knew the whole poem  literary critics have not shared his high estimate of the composition in general they have esteemed it a rather mediocre piece but its rhythm is accurate and its rhyme is good and its plaintive sentiment accorded with the melancholy of lincoln and of his social environment it is not the only poem of no great literary merit which became popular in that period and it would have been forgotten with the rest but for the association of its lines with the name of abraham lincoln he gave to it and its author their chief claim to immortality  during his presidency lincoln said       there is a poem which has been a great favorite with me for years      which was first shown me when a young man by a friend and which i      afterwards saw and cut from a newspaper and learned by heart i      would give a good deal to know who wrote it but i have never been      able to ascertain  the author of the poem oh why should the spirit of mortal be proud was william knox who was born at firth in the parish of lilliesleaf in the county of roxburghshire in scotland on the 17th of august 1789 and who died at the age of thirtysix from his early childhood he wrote verses and he attained sufficient prominence to win the attention of walter scott who encouraged him and loaned him money what he might have done had he lived we do not know but this is the only poem of his that has any claim to distinction and that not for its own outstanding merit but for its association with abraham lincoln  knoxs earliest volume the harp of zion was published in 1825 and does not contain this poem what appears to have been an inclusive volume of the poems of knox was published in london and edinburgh in 1847 and bore the title the lonely hearth the songs of israel harp of zion and other poems this includes the poem which bears the title mortality it is interesting to recall that it has sometimes been printed with the title immortality to that title however it can bear no claim  it will be of interest to compare the poem in its entirety with the stanzas which lincoln quoted on the occasion of his oration in memory of the deceased president general zachary taylor     mortality  by william knox        oh why should the spirit of mortal be proud      like a swift flying meteor a fast flying cloud      a flash of the lightning a break of the wave      man passeth from life to his rest in the grave       the leaves of the oak and the willow shall fade      be scattered around and together be laid      and the young and the old and the low and the high      shall moulder to dust and together shall lie       the infant a mother attended and loved      the mother that infants affection who proved      the husband that mother and infant who blessed      each all are away to their dwellings of rest       the maid on whose cheek on whose brow in whose eye      shone beauty and pleasureher triumphs are by      and the memory of those who loved her and praised      are alike from the minds of the living erased       the hand of the king that the sceptre hath borne      the brow of the priest that the mitre hath worn      the eye of the sage and the heart of the brave      are hidden and lost in the depth of the grave       the peasant whose lot was to saw and to reap      the herdsman who climbed with his goats up the steep      the beggar who wandered in search of his bread      have faded away like the grass that we tread       the saint who enjoyed the communion of heaven      the sinner who dared to remain unforgiven      the wise and the foolish the guilty and just      have quietly mingled their bones in the dust       so the multitude goes like the flower or the weed      that withers away to let others succeed      so the multitude comes even those we behold      to repeat every tale that has often been told       for we are the same our fathers have been      we see the same sights our fathers have seen      we drink the same stream and view the same sun      and run the same course our fathers have run       the thoughts we are thinking our fathers would think      from the death we are shrinking our fathers would shrink      to the life we are clinging our fathers would cling      but it speeds for us all like a bird on the wing       they loved but the story we cannot unfold      they scorned but the heart of the haughty is cold      they grieved but no wail from their slumbers will come      they joyed but the tongue of their gladness is dumb       they died ay they died and we things that are now      who walk on the turf that lies over their brow      who make in their dwelling a transient abode      meet the things that they met on their pilgrimage road       yea hope and despondency pleasure and pain      we mingle together in sunshine and rain      and the smiles and the tears the song and the dirge      still follow each other like surge upon surge       tis the wink of an eye tis the draught of a breath      from the blossom of health to the paleness of death      from the gilded saloon to the bier and the shroud      oh why should the spirit of mortal be proud     the life and public service of general zachary taylor     eulogy  pronounced by hon abraham lincoln on the life and services of the late president of the united states   general zachary taylor the eleventh elected president of the united states is dead he was born november 2 1784 in orange county virginia and died july 9 1850 in the sixtysixth year of his age at the white house in washington city  he was the second son of richard taylor a colonel in the army of the revolution his youth was passed among the pioneers of kentucky whither his parents emigrated soon after his birth and where his taste for military life probably inherited was greatly stimulated near the commencement of our last war with great britain he was appointed by president jefferson a lieutenant in the seventh regiment of infantry during the war he served under general harrison in his northwestern campaign against the indians and having been promoted to a captaincy was entrusted with the defense of fort harrison with fifty men half of them unfit for duty a strong party of indians under the prophet brother of tecumseh made a midnight attack upon the fort but taylor though weak in his force and without preparation was resolute and on the alert and after a battle which lasted till after daylight completely repulsed them soon after he took a prominent part in the expedition under majorgeneral hopkins against the prophets town and on his return found a letter from president madison who had succeeded mr jefferson conferring on him a majors brevet for his gallant defense of fort harrison  after the close of the british war he remained in the frontier service of the west till 1818 he was then transferred to the southern frontier where he remained most of the time in active service till 1826 in 1819 and during his service in the south he was promoted to the rank of lieutenantcolonel in 1826 he was again sent to the northwest where he continued until 1836 in 1832 he was promoted to the rank of colonel in 1836 he was ordered to the south to engage in what is well known as the florida war in the autumn of 1837 he fought and conquered in the memorable battle of okeechobee one of the most desperate struggles known to the annals of indian warfare for this he was honored with the rank of brigadiergeneral and in 1838 was appointed to succeed general jessup in command of the forces in florida in 1841 he was ordered to fort gibson to take command of the second military department of the united states and in september 1844 was directed to hold the troops between the red river and the sabine in readiness to march as might be indicated by the charge of the united states near texas in 1845 his forces were concentrated at corpus christi  in obedience to orders in march 1846 he planted his troops on the rio grande opposite matamoros soon after this and near this place a small detachment of general taylors forces under captain thornton was cut to pieces by a party of mexicans open hostilities being thus commenced and general taylor being constantly menaced by mexican forces vastly superior to his own in numbers his position became exceedingly critical having erected a fort he might defend himself against great odds while he could remain within it but his provisions had failed and there was no supply nearer than point isabel between which and the new fort the country was open to and full of armed mexicans his resolution was at once taken he garrisoned fort brown the new fort with a force of about four hundred and putting himself at the head of the main body of his troops marched forthwith for point isabel he met no resistance on his march having obtained his supplies he began his return march to the relief of fort brown which he at first knew would be and then knew had been besieged by the enemy immediately upon his leaving it on the first or second day of his return march the mexican general arista met general taylor in front and offered battle the mexicans numbered six or eight thousand opposed to whom were about two thousand americans the moment was a trying one comparatively taylors forces were but a handful and few of either officers or men had ever been under fire a brief council was held and the result was the battle commenced the issue of that contest all rememberremember with mingled sensations of pride and sorrow that then american valor and powers triumphed and then the gallant and accomplished and noble ringgold fell  the americans passed the night on the field the general knew the enemy was still in his front and the question rose upon him whether to advance or retreat a council was again held and it is said the general overruled the majority and resolved to advance accordingly in the morning he moved rapidly forward at about four or five miles from fort brown he again met the enemy in force who had selected his position and made some hasty fortifications again the battle commenced and raged till nightfall when the mexicans were entirely routed and the general with his fatigued and bleeding and reduced battalions marched into fort brown there was a joyous meeting a brief hour before whether all within had perished all without feared but none could tellwhile the incessant roar of artillery wrought those within to the highest pitch of apprehension that their brethren without were being massacred to the last man and now the din of battle nears the fort and sweeps obliquely by a gleam of hope flies through the halfimprisoned few they fly to the wall every eye is strained it isit isthe stars and stripes are still aloft anon the anxious brethren meet and while hand strikes hand the heavens are rent with a loud long glorious gushing cry of victory victory victory  soon after these battles general taylor was brevetted a majorgeneral in the united states army  in the meantime war having been declared to exist between the united states and mexico provision was made to reinforce general taylor and he was ordered to march into the interior of mexico he next marched upon monterey arriving there on the nineteenth of september he commenced an assault upon the city on the twentyfirst and on the twentythird was about carrying it at the point of the bayonet when general ampudia capitulated taylors forces consisted of four hundred and twentyfive officers and nine thousand two hundred and twenty men his artillery consisted of one teninch mortar two twentyfourpound howitzers and eight field batteries of four guns the mortar being the only piece serviceable for the siege the mexican works were armed with fortytwo pieces of cannon and manned with a force of at least seven thousand troops of the line and from two to three thousand irregulars  next we find him advancing farther into the interior of mexico at the head of five thousand four hundred men not more than six hundred being regular troops  at agua nueva he received intelligence that santa anna the greatest military chieftain of mexico was advancing after him and he fell back to buena vista a strong position a few miles in advance of saltillo on the twentysecond of february 1847 the battle now called the battle of buena vista was commenced by santa anna at the head of twenty thousand wellappointed soldiers this was general taylors great battle the particulars of it are familiar to all it continued through the twentythird and although general taylors defeat seemed inevitable yet he succeeded by skill and by the courage and devotion of his officers and men in repulsing the overwhelming forces of the enemy and throwing them back into the desert this was the battle of the chiefest interest fought during the mexican war at the time it was fought and for some weeks after general taylors communication with the united states was cut off and the road was in possession of parties of the enemy for many days after full intelligence of it should have been in all parts of this country nothing certain concerning it was known while vague and painful rumors were afloat that a great battle had been fought and that general taylor and his whole force had been annihilated at length the truth came with its thrilling details of victory and bloodof glory and grief a bright and glowing page was added to our nations history but then too in eternal silence lay clay and mckee and yell and lincoln and our own beloved hardin  this was also general taylors last battle he remained in active service in mexico till the autumn of the same year when he returned to the united states  passing in review general taylors military history some striking peculiarities will appear no one of the six battles which he fought except perhaps that of monterey presented a field which would have been selected by an ambitious captain upon which to gather laurels so far as fame is concerned the prospectthe promise in advancewas you may lose but you cannot win yet taylor in his blunt businesslike view of things seems never to have thought of this  it did not happen to general taylor once in his life to fight a battle on equal terms or on terms advantageous to himselfand yet he was never beaten and he never retreated in all the odds were greatly against him in each defeat seemed inevitable and yet in all he triumphed wherever he has led while the battle still raged the issue was painfully doubtful yet in each and all when the din had ceased and the smoke had blown away our countrys flag was still seen fluttering in the breeze  general taylors battles were not distinguished for brilliant military maneuvers but in all he seems rather to have conquered by the exercise of a sober and steady judgment coupled with a dogged incapacity to understand that defeat was possible his rarest military trait was a combination of negativesabsence of excitement and absence of fear he could not be flurried and he could not be scared  in connection with general taylors military character may be mentioned his relations with his brother officers and his soldiers terrible as he was to his countrys enemies no man was so little disposed to have difficulty with his friends during the period of his life dueling was a practice not quite uncommon among gentlemen in the peaceful avocations of life and still more common among the officers of the army and navy yet so far as i can learn a duel with general taylor has never been talked of  he was alike averse to sudden and to startling quarrels and he pursued no man with revenge a notable and a noble instance of this is found in his conduct to the gallant and now lamented general worth a short while before the battles of the eighth and ninth of may some question of precedence arose between worth then a colonel and some other officer which question it seems it was general taylors duty to decide he decided against worth worth was greatly offended left the army came to the united states and tendered his resignation to the authorities at washington it is said that in his passionate feeling he hesitated not to speak harshly and disparagingly of general taylor he was an officer of the highest character and his word on military subjects and about military men could not with the country pass for nothing in this absence from the army of colonel worth the unexpected turn of things brought in the battles of the eighth and ninth he was deeply mortifiedin almost absolute desperationat having lost the opportunity of being present and taking part in those battles the laurels won by his previous service in his own eyes seemed withering away the government both wisely and generously i think declined accepting his resignation and he returned to general taylor then came general taylors opportunity for revenge the battle of monterey was approaching and even at hand taylor could if he would so place worth in that battle that his name would scarcely be noticed in the report but no he felt it was due to the service to assign the real post of honor to some one of the best officers he knew worth was one of the best and he felt that it was generous to allow him then and there to retrieve his secret loss accordingly he assigned to colonel worth in that assault what was par excellence the post of honor and the duties of which he executed so well and so brilliantly as to eclipse in that battle even general taylor himself  as to general taylors relations with his soldiers details would be endless it is perhaps enough to sayand it is far from the least of his honors that we can truly saythat of the many who served with him through the long course of forty years all testify to the uniform kindness and his constant care for and hearty sympathy with their every want and every suffering while none can be found to declare that he was ever a tyrant anywhere in anything  going back a little in point of time it is proper to say that so soon as the news of the battles of the eighth and ninth of may 1846 had fairly reached the united states general taylor began to be named for the next presidency by letter writers newspapers public meetings and conventions in various parts of the country  these nominations were generally put forth as being of noparty character up to this time i think it highly probablenay almost certainthat general taylor had never thought of the presidency in connection with himself and there is reason for believing that the first intelligence of these nominations rather amused than seriously interested him yet i should be insincere were i not to confess that in my opinion the repeated and steady manifestations in his favor did beget in his mind a laudable ambition to reach the high distinction of the presidential chair  as the time for the presidential canvass approached it was seen that general nominations combining anything near the number of votes necessary to an election could not be made without some pretty strong and decided reference to party politics accordingly in the month of may 1848 the great democratic party nominated as their candidate an able and distinguished member of their own party general cass on strictly party grounds almost immediately following this the whig party in general convention nominated general taylor as their candidate the election came off in the november following and though there was also a third candidate the two former only received any vote in the electoral college general taylor having the majority of them was duly elected and he entered on the duties of that high and responsible office march 5 1849 the incidents of his administration up to the time of his death are too familiar and too fresh to require any direct repetition  the presidency even to the most experienced politicians is no bed of roses and general taylor like others found thorns within it no human being can fill that station and escape censure still i hope and believe when general taylors official conduct shall come to be viewed in the calm light of history he will be found to have deserved as little as any who have succeeded him  upon the death of general taylor as it would be in the case of any president we are naturally led to consider what will be its effect politically upon the country i will not pretend to believe that all the wisdom or all of the patriotism of the country died with general taylor but we know that wisdom and patriotism in a public office under institutions like ours are wholly inefficient and worthless unless they are sustained by the confidence and devotion of the people and i confess my apprehensions that in the death of the late president we have lost a degree of that confidence and devotion which will not soon again pertain to any successor between public measures regarded as antagonistic there is often less real difference in their bearing on the public weal than there is between the dispute being kept up or being settled either way i fear the one great question of the day is not now so likely to be partially acquiesced in by the different sections of the union as it would have been could general taylor have been spared to us yet under all circumstances trusting to our maker and through his wisdom and beneficence to the great body of our people we will not despair nor despond  in general taylors general public relation to his country what will strongly impress a close observer was his unostentatious selfsacrificing longenduring devotion to his duty he indulged in no recreations he visited no public places seeking applause but quietly as the earth in its orbit he was always at his post along our whole indian frontier through summer and winter in sunshine and storm like a sleepless sentinel he has watched while we have slept for forty long years how well might the dying hero say at last i have done my duty i am ready to go  nor can i help thinking that the american people in electing general taylor to the presidency thereby showing their high appreciation of his sterling but inobtrusive qualities did their country a service and themselves an imperishable honor it is much for the young to know that treading the hard path of duty as he trod it will be noticed and will lead to high places  but he is gone the conqueror at last is conquered the fruits of his labor his name his memory and example are all that is left ushis example verifying the great truth that he that humbleth himself shall be exaltedteaching that to serve ones country with a singleness of purpose gives assurances of that countrys gratitude secures its best honors and makes a dying bed soft as downy pillows are  the death of the last president may not be without its use in reminding us that we too must die death abstractly considered is the same with the high as with the low but practically we are not so much aroused by the contemplation of our own mortal natures by the fall of many undistinguished as that of one great and wellknown name by the latter we are forced to muse and ponder sadly       o why should the spirit of mortal be proud       so the multitude goes like the flower or the weed      that withers away to let others succeed      so the multitude comes even those we behold      to repeat every tale that has often been told       for we are same that our fathers have been      we see the same sights our fathers have seen      we drink the same streams and see the same sun      and run the same course our fathers have run       they loved but the story we cannot unfold      they scorned but the heart of the haughty is cold      they grieved but no wail from their slumbers will come      they rejoiced but the tongue of their gladness is dumb       they died aye they died we things that are now      that work on the turf that lies on their brow      and make in their dwellings a transient abode      meet the things that they met on their pilgrimage road       yea hope and despondency pleasure and pain      are mingled together in sunshine and rain      and the smile and the tear and the song and the dirge      still follow each other like surge upon surge       tis the wink of an eye tis the draught of a breath      from the blossom of health to the paleness of death      from the gilded saloon to the bier and the shroud      o why should the spirit of mortal be proud
