67091927	the young trawler by rm ballantyne    chapter one  introduces deepsea fishermen and their families  on a certain breezy morning in octobernot many years agoa wilderness of foam rioted wildly over those dangerous sands which lie off the port of yarmouth where the evening star fishingsmack was getting ready for sea  in one of the narrow lanes or rows peculiar to that town the skipper of the smack stood at his own door grumbling  he was a broad burly man a little past the prime of life but prematurely aged by hard work and hard living  hes always out o the way when hes wanted an always in the way when hes not wanted said the skipper angrily to his wife of whom he was at the moment taking as one of his mates remarked a tender farewell  dont be hard on him david pleaded the wife tearfully as she looked up in her husbands face  hes only a bit thoughtless and i shouldnt wonder if he was already down at the smack  if hes not returned the fisherman with a frown as he clenched his huge right handand a hard and horny hand it was from constant grappling with ropes oars handspikes and the likeif hes not ill  he stopped abruptly as he looked down at his wifes eyes and the frown faded  no wonder for that wifes eyes were soft and gentle and her face was fair and very attractive as well as refined in expression though not particularly pretty  well old girl come i wont be hard on im  now im offgoodday and with that the fisherman stooped to kiss his wife who returned the salute with interest  at the same time she thrust a packet into his hand  whats this nell  a testament davidfrom me  it will do your soul good if you will read it  and the tract wrapped round it is from a lady  the frown returned to the mans face as he growledwhat lady  the lady with the curious name who was down here last summer for seabathing dont you remember miss ruth dotropy  it is a temperance tract  david bright made a motion as though he were about to fling the parcel away but he thought better of it and thrust it into the capacious pocket of his rough coat  the brow cleared again as he left his wife who called after him dont be hard on billy david remember hes our only oneand hes not bad just a little thoughtless  never fear nell ill make a man of him  lighting a large pipe as he spoke the skipper of the evening star nodded farewell and sauntered away  in another of the narrow lanes of yarmouth another fisherman stood at his own door also taking leave of his wife  this man was the mate just engagedof david brights vessel and very different in some respects from the skipper being tall handsome fresh and youngnot more than twentyfouras well as powerful of build  his wife a goodlooking young woman with their firstborn in her arms had bidden him goodbye  we will not trouble the reader with more of their parting conversation than the last few words  now maggie dear whatever you do take care o that blessed babby  trust me for that joe said maggie imprinting a kiss of considerable violence and fervour on the said baby which gazed at its motheras it gazed at everythingin blank amazement  an dont forget to see miss ruth if you can or send a message to her about that matter  ill not forget joe  the mate of the evening star bestowed a parting kiss of extreme gentleness on the wondering infant and hastened away  he had not proceeded far when he encountered a creature which filled his heart with laughter  indeed joe davidsons heart was easily filled with emotions of every kind for he was an unusually sympathetic fellow and rather fond of a joke  the creature referred to was a small boy of thirteen years of age or thereabouts with a pretty little face a grecian little nose a rosebud of a mouth curly fair hair bright blue eyes and a light handsome frame which however was a smart active and wiry frame  he was made to look as large and solid as possible by means of the rough costume of a fisherman and there was a bold look in the blue eyes which told of a strong will  what amused joe davidson most however was the tremendous swagger in the creatures gait and the imperturbable gravity with which he smoked a cigar  the little fellow was so deeply absorbed in thought as he passed the mate that he did not raise his eyes from the ground  an irresistible impulse seized on joe  he stooped and gently plucked the cigar from the boys mouth  instantly the creature doubled his little fists and without taking the trouble to look so high as his adversarys face rushed at his legs which he began to kick and pommel furiously  as the legs were cased in heavy seaboots he failed to make any impression on them and after a few moments of exhausting effort he stepped back so as to get a full look at his foe  what dee mean by that joe davidson you fathom of impudence he demanded with flushed face and flashing eyes  only that i wants a light answered the mate pulling out his pipe and applying the cigar to it  humph returned the boy mollified and at the same time tickled by the obvious pretence you might have axed leave first i think  so i might  i ax parding now returned joe handing back the cigar goodday billy  the little boy gazed after the fisherman in speechless admiration for the cool quiet manner in which the thing had been done had as he said taken the wind completely out of his sails and prevented his usually ready reply  replacing the cigar in the rosebud he went puffing along till he reached the house of david bright which he entered  your fathers gone billy said mrs bright  haste ye after him else youll catch it  oh do give up smokin dear boy  goodbye  god keep you my darling  she caught the little fellow in a hasty embrace  hold on mother youll bust me cried billy returning the embrace however with affectionate vigour  an if im late daddy will sail without me  let go  he shouted the last words as if the reference had been to the anchor of the evening star  his mother laughed as she released him and he ran down to the quay with none of his late dignity remaining  he knew his fathers temper well and was fearful of being left behind  he was just in time  the little smack was almost under weigh as he tumbled rather than jumped on board  ere long she was out beyond the breakers that marked the shoals and running to the eastward under a stiff breeze  this was little billys first trip to sea in his fathers fishingsmack and he went not as a passenger but as a hand  it is probable that there never sailed out of yarmouth a lad who was prouder of his position than little billy of the evening star  he was rigged from top to toe in a brandnew suit of what we may style nautical garments  his thin little body was made to appear of twice its natural bulk by a broadshouldered pilotcloth coat under which was a thick guernsey  he was almost extinguished by a large yellow souwester and all but swallowed up by a pair of seaboots that reached to his hips  these boots indeed seemed so capacious as to induce the belief that if he did not take care the part of his body that still remained outside of them might fall inside and disappear  altogetherwhat between pride of position vanity in regard to the new suit glee at being fairly at sea and doing for himself and a certain humorous perception that he was ridiculously smalllittle billy presented a very remarkable appearance as he stood that day on the deck of his fathers vessel with his little legs straddling wide apart after the fashion of nautical men and his hands thrust deep into the pockets of his seagoing coat  for some time he was so engrossed with the novelty of his situation and the roll of the crested waves that his eyes did not rise much higher than the legs of his comparatively gigantic associates but when curiosity at last prompted him to scan their faces great was his surprise to observe among them joe davidson the young man who had plucked the cigar from his lips in yarmouth  what are you one o the hands joe he asked going towards the man with an abortive attempt to walk steadily on the pitching deck  ay lad im your fathers mate replied joe  but surely you are not goin as a hand  thats just what i am returned billy with a look of dignity which was somewhat marred by a heavy lurch causing him to stagger  im part owner dee see an ready to take command when the old man retires so youd better mind your helm young man an steer clear of impudence in future if you dont want to lead the life of a dog aboard of this here smack  ill try sir said joe davidson touching his forelock while a humorous twinkle lit up his bright eyes  hallo  billy shouted the skipper who was steering come here boy you didnt come aboard to idle you know ive let you have a good look at the sea all for nothin  its time now that you went to work to larn your duties  zulu  the last word caused a woolly head to protrude from the after hatchway revealing a youth about twice the size of billy  having some drops of black blood in him this lad had been styled zuluand being a handy fellow had been made cook  here take this boy below said the skipper and teach him somethinganything you like so long as you keep him at work  no idlers allowed on board you know  yes sar said zulu  billy was delighted to obey  he was naturally a smart active fellow and not only willing but proud to submit to discipline  he descended a short ladder into the little cabin with which he had become acquainted as a visitor when the smack was in port on former occasions  with zulu he was also acquainted that youth having been for some time in his fathers service  kin you do cookin asked zulu with a grin that revealed an unusually large cavern full of glistening teeth mingled with more than an average allowance of tongue and gums  oh  i say remonstrated billy its growed bigger than ever  zulu expanded his mouth to its utmost and shut his eyes in enjoyment of the complimentary joke  oh course it hab he said on recovering is bliged to eat so much at sea dat de mout gits wider ebery trip  dat leetle hole what youve got in your face ll git so big as mine fore long billy  den you be like some ob de leetle fishes we catchall mout and no body worth mentioning  but you no tell me yit kin you do cookin  oh yes i can manage a yarmouth bloater replied billy  but said zulu kin you cook a tater widout makin hims outside all of a mush an hims inside same so as a stone  instead of answering billy sat down on the settle which ran round the cabin and looked up at his dark friend very solemnly  hallo exclaimed zulu  theretheres something wrong wi me said billy with a faint attempt to smile as he became rather pale  seeing this his friend quietly put a bucket beside him  i say zulu observed the poor boy with a desperate attempt at pleasantry i wonder whats up  des nuffin up yit but he wont be long replied the young cook with a look full of sympathy  it would be unjust to our little hero to proceed further  this being as we have said his first trip to sea he naturally found himself after an hour or two stretched out in one of the bunks which surrounded the little cabin  there he was permitted to lie and think longingly of his mother surrounded by dense tobacco smoke hot vapours and greasy fumes until he blushed to find himself wishing with all his heart that he had never left home  there we will leave him to meditate and form useless resolves which he never carried out while we introduce to the reader some of the other actors in our tale    chapter two  a contrast to chapter i  from that heaving grey wilderness of water called the north sea we pass now to that lively wilderness of bricks and mortar called london  westend mansions are not naturally picturesque or interesting subjects either for the brush or the pen and we would not willingly drag our readers into one of them did not circumstancesover which we have not a shadow of controlcompel us to do so  the particular mansion to which we now direct attention belonged to a certain mrs dotropy whose husbands ancestors by the way were said to have come over with the conquerorwhether in his own ship or in one of the bumboats that followed is not certain  they were de tropys at that time but having sunk in the social scale in the course of centuries and then risen again in succeeding centuries through the medium of trade they reappeared on the surface with their patronymic transformed as now presented  mother said ruth dotropy to a magnificent duchesslike woman ive come to ask you about the poor  ruth dear interrupted the mother i wish you would not worry me about the poor  theyre a troublesome illdoing set always grumbling dirty illnatured suspicious and envious of the richas if it was our fault that we are rich  i dont want to hear anything more about the poor  ruth who was a softcheeked softhanded and softhearted girl of eighteen stood hat in hand before her mother with a slight smile on her rosy lips  you are not quite just to the poor mother returned ruth scarce able to restrain a laugh at her parents vehemence  some of them are all that you say no doubt but there are many even among the poorest of the poor who are goodnatured welldoing unsuspicious and respectful not only to the rich but also to each other and to everybody  there is mrs wolsey for instance she  oh but shes an exception you know said mrs dotropy there are not many like mrs wolsey  and there is mrs gladman continued ruth  yes but shes another exception  and mrs robbie  why ruth whats the use of picking out all the exceptions to prove your point  of course the exception proves the ruleat least so the proverb saysbut a great many exceptions prove nothing that i know of exceptthat isbut whats the use of arguing child youll never be convinced  come how much do you want me to give  easygoing mrs dotropys mind we need scarcely point out was of a confused type and she hated argument  perhaps on the whole it was to the advantage of her friends and kindred that she did so  i only want you to give a little time mother replied ruth swinging her hat to and fro while she looked archly into mrs dotropys large dignified and sternlykind countenance if we may venture on such an expressioni want you to go with me and see  yes yes i know what youre going to say child you want me to go and see for myself which means that im to soil my boots in filthy places subject my ears to profanity my eyes to horrible sights and my nose to intolerable smells  no ruth i cannot oblige you  of what use would it be  if my doing this would relieve the miseries of the poor you might reasonably ask me to go among them but it would not  i give them as much money as i can afford to give and as far as i can see it does them no good  they never seem better off and they always want more  they are not even grateful for it  just look at lady openhand what good does she accomplish by her liberality and her tearful eyes and sympathetic heart even though her feelings are undoubtedly genuine only the other day i chanced to walk behind her along several streets and saw her stop and give money to seven or eight beggars who accosted her  she never can refuse any one who asks with a pitiful look and a pathetic cockandbull story  several of them were young and strong and quite undeserving of charity  three i observed went straight to a publichouse with what she had given them and the last a small street boy went into fits of suppressed laughter after she had passed and made faces at herfinishing off by putting the thumb of his left hand to his nose and spreading out his fingers as wide as possible  i do not understand the exact significance of that action but there is something in it so intensely insolent that it is quite incompatible with the idea of gratitude  yes mother i saw him too said ruth with a demure look it curiously enough happened that i was following you at the time  you afterwards passed the same boy with a refusal i suppose  yes child of courseand a reproof  i thought so  well after you had passed he not only applied his left thumb to his nose and spread his fingers but also put the thumb of his right hand against the little finger of his left and spread out the other five fingers at you  so whatever he meant lady openhand to receive he meant you to have twice as much  but lady openhand makes a mistake i think she does not consider the poor she only feels deeply for them and gives to them  only feels and gives repeated mrs dotropy with a look of solemn amazement  being quite incapable of disentangling or expressing the flood of ideas that overwhelmed her the good lady relieved herself after a few broken sentences with the assertion that it was of no use arguing with ruth for ruth would never be convinced  she was so far right in that her daughter could not change her mind on the strength of mere dogmatic assertion even although she was a pliant and teachable little creature  so at least mr lewis her pastor had found her when he tried to impress on her a few important lessonssuch as that it is better to give than to receive that man is his brothers keeper that we are commanded to walk in the footsteps of jesus who came to save the lost to rescue the perishing and who fed the hungry  but mother resumed ruth i want you to go with me today to visit some poor people who are not troublesome who are perfectly clean are never illnatured suspect nothing and envy nobody  they must indeed be wonderful people said mrs dotropy with a laugh at ruths enthusiasm quite angelic  they are as nearly so as mortals ever become i think returned ruth putting on her hat wont you come mother  now mrs dotropy had the faculty of giving in gracefully although she could not argue  rising with an amused smile she kissed ruths forehead and went to prepare for a visit to the poor  let us now turn to a small street scarcely ten minutes walk from the mansion where the above conversation took place  it was what may be styled a lilliputian street  almost everything in it was small  the houses were small the shops were small the rents well they were certainly not so small as they should have been the doors and windows were small and the very children that played in the gutter with an exceedingly small amount of clothing on them were rather diminutive  some of the doors stood open revealing the fact that it had been thought wise by the builders of the houses to waste no space in lobbies or entrance halls  one or two however displayed entries or passagesdark and narrowthe doors to which were blistered and severely battered because being the public property of several families they had no particular owner to protect them  there was a small flat over a greengrocers shop to which one of the cleanest of those entries led  it consisted of two rooms a lightcloset and a kitchen and was lowceilinged and poorly furnished but there was a distinct air of cleanliness about it with a consequent tendency to comfort  the carpet of the chief room was very old but it had been miraculously darned and patched  the table was little larger than that of a gigantic dollshouse but it was covered with a clean though threadbare cloth that had seen better days and on it lay several old and wellthumbed books besides two workbaskets  in an olda very oldeasychair at one side of the fire sat a lady rather beyond middle age with her hands clasped on her lap and her eyes gazing dreamily at the fire  perhaps she was speculating on the question how long two small lumps of coal and a little dross would last the grate in which that amount of fuel burned was a miniature specimen of simplicitya mere hollow in the wall with two bars across  the fire itself was so small that nothing but constant solicitude saved it from extinction  there was much of grey mingled with the fair tresses of the lady and the remains of beauty were very distinct on a countenance the lines of which suggested suffering gentleness submission and humility perchance the little sigh that escaped her as she gazed at the preposterously small fire had reference to days gone by when health revelled in her veins when wealth was lavished in her fathers house when food and fun were plentiful when grief and care were scarce whatever her thoughts might have been they were interrupted by the entrance of another lady who sat down beside her laid a penny on the table and looked at the lady in the easychair with a peculiar halfcomical expression  it is our last jessie she said and as she said it the expression intensified yet it seemed a little forced  there needed no magician to tell that these two were sisters  the indescribable similarity was strong yet the difference was great jessie was evidently though not much the elder  its almost absurd kate she said to think that we should actually havecomeat lastto  she stopped and kate looked earnestly at her  there was a tremulous motion about the corners of both their mouths  jessie laid her head on kates shoulder and both weptgently  they did not burst into tears for they were not by nature demonstrative  their position made it easy to slide down on their knees and bury their heads side by side in the great old easychair that had been carefully kept when all the rest was sold because it had belonged to their father  we may not record the scarce audible prayer  those who have suffered know what it was  those who have not suffered could not understand it after the prayer they sat down in a somewhat tranquil mood to talk it over  poor thingsthey had often talked it over without much result except that blessed one of evolving mutual sympathy  if i were only a little younger and stronger said kate who had been and still was of a lively disposition i would offer myself as a housemaid but that is out of the question now besides i could not leave you jessie the invalid of the familythat once was  come kate let us have no reference to the invalid of the family any more  i am getting quite strong  do you know i do believe that poverty is doing my health good my appetite is improving  i really feel quite hungry now  we will have tea then said kate getting up briskly the things that we got will make one good meal at all events though the cost of them has reduced our funds to the low ebb of one penny so let us enjoy ourselves while it lasts  kate seized the poker as she spoke and gave the fire a thrust that almost extinguished it  then she heaped on a few ounces of coal with reckless indifference to the future and put on a little kettle to boil soon the small table was spread with a white cloth a silver teapot and two beautiful cups that had been allowed them out of the family wreck a loaf of bread a very small quantity of brown sugar a smaller quantity of skimmilk and the smallest conceivable pat of salt butter  and this took all the money except one penny asked jessie regarding the table with a look of mingled sadness and amazement  allevery farthing replied kate and i consider the result a triumph of domestic economy  the sisters were about to sit down to enjoy their triumph when a bounding step was heard on the stair  thats ruth exclaimed kate rising and hurrying to the door quick get out the other cup jessie  oh  ruth darling this is good of you we were sure you would come this week as  she stopped abruptly for a large presence loomed on the stair behind ruth  i have brought mamma to see you katethe misses seaward mamma you have often heard me speak of them  yes dear and i have much pleasure in making the misses seawards acquaintance  my daughter is very fond of you ladies i know and the little puss has brought me here by way of a surprise i suppose for we came out to pay a very different kind of visit  she  oh but mamma hastily exclaimed ruth who saw that her mother whom she had hitherto kept in ignorance of the circumstances of the poor ladies was approaching dangerous ground our visit here has to do withwith the people we were speaking about  i have come she added turning quickly to miss jessie to transact a little business with youabout those poor people you remember whom you were so sorry for mamma will be glad to hear what we have to say about them  wont you mamma  of course of course dear replied mrs dotropy who however experienced a slight feeling of annoyance at being thus dragged into a preliminary consideration of the affairs of poor people before paying a personal visit to them  being goodnatured however and kind she submitted gracefully and took note while chairs were placed round the table for this amateur board that ladies with moderate meansobviously very moderateappeared to enjoy their afternoon tea quite as much as rich people  you see it never entered into mrs dotropys mindhow could itthat what she imagined to be afternoon tea was dinner tea and supper combined in one meal beyond which there lay no prospective meal except what one penny might purchase  with a mysterious look and a gleam of delight in her eyes ruth drew forth a wellfilled purse the contents of which in shillings sixpences and coppers she poured out upon the teatable  there she said triumphantly i have collected all that myself and ive come to consult you how much of it should be given to each and how we are to get them to take it  how kind of you ruth exclaimed kate and jessie seaward gazing on the coin with intense almost miserly satisfaction  nonsense its not kind a bit responded ruth if you knew the pleasure ive had in gathering it and telling the sad story of the poor people and then the thought of the comfort it will bring to them though it is so little after all  it wont appear little in their eyes ruth said kate for you cant think how badly off some of them are  i assure you when jessie and i think of it as we often do it makes us quite miserable  poor misses seaward  in their sympathy with the distress of others they had quite forgotten for the moment their own extreme poverty  they had even failed to observe that their own last penny had been inadvertently but hopelessly mingled with the coin which ruth had so triumphantly showered upon the table  ive got a paper here with the name of each continued the excited girl so that we may divide the money in the proportions you think best  that however will be easy but i confess i have puzzled my brain in vain to hit on a way to get poor bella tilly to accept charity  that will be no difficulty said jessie because we wont offer her charity  she has been knitting socks for sale lately so we can buy these  oh how stupid i am cried ruth the idea of buying something from her never once occurred to me  well buy all her socksyes and put our own price on them too capital  who is bella tilly asked mrs dotropy  a young governess replied jessie whose health has given way  she is an orphanhas not i believe a relative in the whole worldand has been obliged to give up her last situation not only because of her health but because she was badly treated  but how about poor mr garnet the musician resumed ruth has he anything to sell  i think not answered kate the sweet sounds in which he deals can now be no longer made since the paralytic stroke rendered his left arm powerless  his flute was the last thing he had to sell and he did not part with it until hunger compelled him and even then only after the doctors had told him that recovery was impossible  but i daresay we shall find some means of overcoming his scruples  he has relatives but they are all either poor or heartless and between the two he is starving  thus one by one the cases of those poor ones were considered until all ruths money was apportioned and mrs dotropy had become so much interested that she added a sovereign to the fund for the express benefit of bella tilly  thereafter ruth and her mother departed leaving the list and the pile of money on the table for the sisters had undertaken to distribute the fund  before leaving however ruth placed a letter in kates hand saying that it had reference to an institution which would interest them  now isnt that nice said kate sitting down with a beaming smile when their visitors had gone so like ruth  ah if she only knew how much we need a little of that money  well well we  the tea is quite cold interrupted jessie and the fire has gone out  jessie exclaimed kate with a sudden look of solemnitythe penny  jessie looked blankly at the table and saidgone  no it is there said kate  yes but ruth you know didnt count the money till she came here and so did not detect the extra penny and we forgot it  every farthing there has been apportioned on that list and must be accounted for  i couldnt bear to take a penny out of the sum and have to tell ruth that we kept it off because it was ours  it would seem so mean for she cannot know how much we need it  besides from which of the poor peoples little stores could we deduct it  this last argument had more weight with kate than the others so with a little sigh she proceeded to open ruths letter while jessie poured out a cup of cold tea gazing pathetically the while at the pile of money which still lay glittering on the table  ruths letter contained two 5 pounds bank of england notes and ran as follows    dearest jessie and katei sent your screen to the institution for   the sale of needlework where it was greatly admired  one gentleman   said it was quite a work of genius a lady who seemed to estimate   genius more highly than the gentleman bought it for 10 pounds which   i now enclose  in my opinion it was worth far more  however it is   gratifying that your first attempt in this way has been successful    your loving ruth  loving indeed exclaimed kate in a tremulous voice  jessie appeared to have choked on the cold tea for after some ineffectual attempts at speech she retired to the window and coughed  the first act of the sisters on recovering was to double the amount on ruths list of poor people and to work out another sum in short division on the back of an old letter  why did you deceive me dear said mrs dotropy on reaching the street after her visit  you said you were going with me to see poor people in place of which you have taken me to hear a consultation about poor people with two ladies and now you propose to return home  the two ladies are themselves very poor  no doubt they are child but you cannot for a moment class them with those whom we usually style the poor  no mother i cannot for they are far worse off than these  having been reared in affluence with tenderer feelings and weaker muscles as well as more delicate health they are much less able to fight the battle of adversity than the lower poor and i happen to know that the dear misses seaward are reduced just now to the very last extreme of poverty  but you have relieved them mother  i child  how  the nursery screen that you bought yesterday by my advice was decorated by jessie and kate seaward so i thought it would be nice to let you see for yourself how sweet and deserving are the poor people whom you have befriended    chapter three  introduces consternation to a delicate household  the day following that on which mrs dotropy and ruth had gone out to visit the poor jessie and kate seaward received a visit from a man who caused them no little anxietywe might almost say alarm  he was a seacaptain of the name of bream  as this gentleman was rather eccentric it may interest the reader to follow him from the commencement of the day on which we introduce him  but first let it be stated that captain bream was a finelooking man though large and rugged  his upper lip and chin were bare for he was in the habit of mowing those regions every morning with a blunt razor to see captain bream go through this operation of mowing when at sea in a gale of wind was a sight that might have charmed the humorous and horrified the nervous  the captains shoulders were broad and his bones big his waistcoat also was large his height six feet two his voice a profound bass and his manner boisterous but hearty  he was apt to roar in conversation but it was in a gale of wind that you should have heard him  in such circumstances the celebrated bull of bashan would have been constrained to retire from his presence with its tail between its legs  when we say that captain breams eyes were kind eyes and that the smile of his large mouth was a winning smile we have sketched a fulllength portrait of himor as painters might put it an extrafulllength  well when captain bream having mown his chin presented himself in public on the morning of the particular day of which we write he appeared to be in a meditative mood and sauntered slowly with the professional gait of a sailor through several narrow streets near london bridge  his hands were thrust into his coatpockets and a half humorous half perplexed expression rested on his face  evidently something troubled him and he gave vent to a little of that something in deep tones being apt to think aloud as he went along in disjointed sentences  very odd he murmured but that girl is always after some queer well no matter  its my business tobut it does puzzle me to guess why she should want me to live in such an outothewayhowever i suppose she knows and thats enough for me  shine yer boots sir said a small voice cutting short these broken remarks  what  shine yer boots sir an praps i can elp yer to clear up yer mind wen im a doin of it  it was the voice of a small shoeblack whose eyes looked wistful  the captain glanced at his boots they wanted shining sadly for the nautical valet who should have attended to such matters had neglected his duty that morning  where dee live my lad asked the captain who being largehearted and having spent most of his life at sea felt unusual interest in all things terrestrial when he chanced to be on shore  i live nowheres in partickler answered the boy  but where dee sleep of a night  vell that depends  mostly anywheres  got any father  no sir i haint nor yet no mothernever had no fathers nor mothers as i knows on an wots more i dont want any  theyre a chancey lot is fathers an mothersmost of em  better without em altogether to my mind  tother foot sir  looking down with a benignant smile at this independent specimen of humanity the captain obeyed orders  dee make much at this work now my lad asked the captain  not wery much sir  just about enough to keep soul an body together an not always that  it was ony last veek as i was starvin to that extent that my soul very nigh broke out an made his escape but the doctor he got old of it by the tail an eld on till e indooced it to stay on a bit longer  there you are sir might shave in em  how much to pay  vell genlemen usually gives me a penny but thats in ornary cases ven i has to shine boots like a pair o ships boats i looks for suthin hextrathough i dont always get it  there you are my lad said the captain giving the boy something hextra which appeared to satisfy him  thereafter he proceeded to the bridge and embarking on one of the river steamers was soon deposited at pimlico  thence traversing st georges square he soon found himself in the little street in which dwelt the misses seaward  he looked about him for some minutes and then entered a greengrocers shop crushing his hat against the top of the doorway  wishing the greengrocer goodmorning he asked if lodgings were to be had in that neighbourhood  well yes sir he replied but i fear that youd find most of em rather small for a man of your size  no fear o that replied the captain with a loud guffaw which roused the grocers cat a little im used to small cabins an smaller bunks dee see an can stow myself away easy in any sort of hole  why ive managed to snooze in a bunk only five foot four by clewin up my legs though it wasnt comfortable  but its not the size i care about so much as the character o the landlady  i like tidy respectable people you seehavin bin always used to a wellkept ship  ah  i know one wholl just suit you  up at the other end o the street  two rooms kept by a young widow who  hold hard there interrupted the captain none o your young widows for me  theyre dangerous  besides big as i am i dont want two rooms to sleep in  if you know of any old maid now with one room thats what would suit me to a tee an easygoing sort o woman who  i know of two elderly ladies interrupted the greengrocer thoughtfully theyre sisters and have got a small room to let but buttheyre delicate sort o creeters you know have seen better days an are raither timid an might want a female lodger or a man who who  out with it interrupted the captain a man who is softspoken and wellmannerednot a big noisy old seahorse like me  is that what you would say  just so answered the greengrocer with an amiable nod  whats the name of the sisters  seaward  seaward eh exclaimed the captain in surprise  thats odd now that a seafarin man should be sent to seaward for his lodgins even when he gets on shore  ha ha  ive always had a leanin to seaward ill try the sisters  they can only tell me to bout ship you know and be off on the other tack  and again the captain gave such boisterous vent to his mirth that the greengrocers cat got up and walked indignantly away for albeit well used to the assaults of small boys it apparently could not stand the noise of this new and bass disturber of the peace  having ascertained that the misses seaward dwelt above the shop in which he stood captain bream went straight upstairs and rapped heavily at their door  now although the sisters had been gradually reduced to the extreme of poverty they had hitherto struggled successfully against the necessity of performing what is known as the dirty work of a house  by stinting themselves in food working hard at anything they succeeded in getting to do and mending and remending their garments until it became miraculous even to themselves how these managed to hang together they had up to that period in their history managed to pay to a slender little girl out of their slender means a still more slender salary for coming night and morning to clean their grate light their fire carry out their ashes brush their boots wash their doorsteps and otherwise perform work for which the sisters were peculiarly unfitted by age training and taste  this girls name was liffie lee  she was good as far as she went but she did not go far  her goodness was not the result of principle  she had no principle did not know what the word meant but she had a nature and that nature was soft unselfish selfobliviousthe last a blessing of incalculable price  it was liffie lee who responded to captain breams knock  she was at the time about to leave the house in undisturbed possession of its ownersor rather occupiers  does a miss seaward live here  it was a dark passage and liffie lee almost quaked at the depth and metallic solemnity of the voice as she glanced up at the spot where it appeared to come from  yes sir  may i see her  iill see sir if youll wait outside sir  she gently yet quickly shut the door in the captains face and next moment appeared in the little parlour with a flushed face and widely open eyes  the biggest man she had ever seen or heard she said wanted to see miss seaward  why did he want to see her and what was his name  she didnt know and had omitted to ask his name having been so frightened that she had left him at the door which she had shut against him  an please miss continued liffie in a tone of suppressed eagerness if i was you id lock the parlour door in case he busts in the outer one  you might open the winder an screech for the pleece  oh  liffie what a frightened thing you are remonstrated jessie go and show the man in at once  oh no miss pleaded liffie youd better ave im took up at once youve no notion what dreadful men that sort are  i know em well weve got some of em where we live andand theyre awful  another knock at this point cut the conversation short and kate herself went to open the door  may i have a word with miss seaward asked the captain respectfully  yees certainly answered kate with some hesitation for although reassured by the visitors manner his appearance and voice alarmed her too  she ushered him into the parlour however which was suddenly reduced to a mere bandbox by contrast with him  being politely asked to take a chair he bowed and took hold of one but on regarding its very slender proportionsit was a cane chairhe smiled and shook his head  the smile did much for him  pray take this one said jessie pointing to the old armchair which was strong enough even for him our visitors are not usually such such  thumping walruses out with it miss seaward said the captain seating himselfgently for he had suffered in this matter more than once during his lifeim used to being found fault with for my size  pray do not imagine said jessie hastening to exculpate herself that i could be so very impolite asas to  yes yes i know that interrupted the captain blowing his noseand the familiar operation was in itself something awful in such a small roomand i am too big theres no doubt about that however it cant be helped  i must just grin and bear it  but i came here on business so well have business first and pleasure if you like afterwards  you may go now said kate at this point to liffie lee who was still standing transfixed in openmouthed amazement gazing at the visitor  with native obedience and humility the child left the room though anxious to see and hear more  you have a furnished room to let i believe ladies said the captain coming at once to the point  jessie and kate glanced at each other  the latter felt a strong tendency to laugh and the former replied  we have indeed one small rooma very small room in fact a mere closet with a window in the roofwhich we are very anxious to let if possible to a ladyafemale  it is very poorly furnished but it is comfortable and we would make it very cheap  is it about the hiring of such a room that you come  yes madam it is said the captain decisively  but is the lady for whom you act said jessie prepared for a particularly small room and very poorly furnished  yes she is replied the captain with a loud guffaw that made the very windows vibrate in fact i am the lady who wants the room  its true im not very ladylike but i can say for myself that ill give you less trouble than many a lady would an i dont mind the cost  impossible exclaimed miss seaward with a mingled look of amusement and perplexity which she did not attempt to conceal while kate laughed outright why sir the room is not much if at all longer than yourself  no matter returned the captain im nowise particular an ive been recommended to come to you so here i am ready to strike a bargain if youre agreeable  pray may i ask who recommended you said jessie  the seaman looked perplexed for a moment  well i didnt observe his name over the door he said but the man in the shop below recommended me  oh the greengrocer exclaimed both ladies together but they did not add what they thought namely that the greengrocer was a very impertinent fellow to play off upon them what looked very much like a practical joke  perhaps the best way to settle the matter said kate will be to show the gentleman our room  he will then understand the impossibility  thats right exclaimed the captain risingand in doing so he seemed about to damage the ceilinglets go below by all means and see the cabin  it is not downstairs remarked jessie leading the way we are at the top of the house here and the room is on a level with this one  so much the better  i like a deckcabin  in fact ive bin used to it aboard my last ship  on being ushered into the room which he wished to hire the sailor found himself in an apartment so very unsuited to his size and character that even he felt slightly troubled  its not so much the size that bothers me he said stroking his chin gently as the fittings  there was some ground for the seamans perplexity for the closet in which he stood apart from the fact of its being only ten feet long by six broad had been arranged by the tasteful sisters after the manner of a ladys boudoir with a view to captivate some poor sister of very limited means or perhaps some humbleminded and possibly undersized young clerk from the country  the bed besides being rather small and covered with a snowwhite counterpane was canopied with white muslin curtains lined with pink calico  the washhand stand was low fragile and diminutive  the little deal table which occupied an inconveniently large proportion of the space was clothed in a garment similar to that of the bed  the one solitary chair was of that cheap construction which is meant to creak warningly when sat upon by light people and to resolve itself into matchwood when the desecrator is heavy  two pictures graced the wallsone the infant samuel in a rosewood frame the other an oil paintingof probably the first century for its subject was quite undistinguishablein a gold slip  the latter was a relic of better daysa spared relic which the public had refused to buy at any price though the auctioneer had described it as a rare specimen of one of the oldthe very oldmasters with rembrandtesque proclivities  no chest of drawers obtruded itself in that small chamber but instead thereof the economical yet provident sisters foreseeing the importance of a retreat for garments had supplied a deal box of which they stuffed the lid and then covered the whole with green baize thus causing it to serve the double purpose of a wardrobe and a small sofa  however said captain bream after a brief but careful look round itll do  with a little cuttin and carvin here an there well manage to squeeze in for you must know ladies that we seafarin men have a wonderful knack o stuffin a good deal into small space  the sisters made no reply  indeed they were speechless and horrified at the bare idea of the entrance of so huge a lodger into their quiet home  look ye here now he continued in a comfortable selfsatisfied tone as he expanded his great arms along the length of the bed to measure it the bunks about five foot eight inches long  well im about six foot two in my sockssix inches short thats a difficulty no doubt but its getoverable this way well splice the green box to it  he grasped the sofawardrobe as he spoke and placed it to the foot of the bed then embracing the entire mass of mattresses and bedding at the lower end raised it up thrust the green box under with his foot and laid the bedding down on itthus adding about eighteen inches to the length  there you are dee seequite long enough an a foot to spare  but it does not fit urged kate who becoming desperate resolved to throw every possible obstruction in the way  thats true madam returned the captain with an approving nod  i see youve got a mechanical eyetheres a difference of elevation tween the box and the bed of three inches or more but bless you thats nothin to speak of  if youd ever been in a gale o wind at sea youd know that we seadogs are used to considerable difference of elevation between our heads an feet  my topcoat stuffed inll put that to rights  but youll have to furl the flummery topslsto lower em altogether would be safer  he took hold of the muslin curtains with great tenderness as he spoke fearing apparently to damage them  you see he continued apologetically im not used to this sort o thing  moreover ive a tendency to nightmare  dont alarm yourselves ladies i never do anything worse to disturb folk than give a shout or a yell or two but occasionally i do let fly with a leg or an arm when the fits on me an if i should get entangled with this flummery you know id be apt to damage it  yes the safest way will be to douse the topsls altogether  as to the chairwell ill supply a noo one thatll stand rough weather  if youll also clear away the petticoats from the table itll do well enough  in regard to the lookinglass i know pretty well what im like an dont have any desire to study my portrait  as for shavin ive got a bullseye sort of glass in the lid o my soapbox that serves all my purpose and i shave wi cold water so i wont be botherin you in the mornins for hot  ive got a paintin of my last shipthe daisydone in watercoloursits a pretty big un but by hangin samuel on the other bulkhead an stickin that black thing over the door we can make room for it  as captain bream ran on in this fashion smoothing down all difficulties and making everything comfortable the poor sisters grew more and more desperate and kate felt a tendency to recklessness coming on  suddenly a happy thought occurred to her  but sir she interposed with much firmness of tone and manner there is one great difficulty in the way of our letting the room to you which i fear cannot be overcome  the captain looked at her inquiringly and jessie regarded her with admiration and wonder for she could not conceive what this insurmountable difficulty could be  my sister and i continued kate have both an unconquerable dislike to tobacco  oh thats no objection cried the captain with a light laughwhich in him however was an earsplitting guffawfor i dont smoke  dont smoke repeated both sisters in tones of incredulity for in their imagination a seaman who did not smoke seemed as great an impossibility as a street boy who did not whistle  an whats more continued the captain i dont drink  im a teetotal abstainer  i leave smokin to steamfunnels an drinkin to the fish  but persisted kate on whom another happy thought had descended my sister and i keep very early hours and a latchkey we could never  pooh thats no difficulty again interrupted this unconquerable man of the sea i hate late hours myself when im ashore havin more than enough of em when afloat  ill go to bed regularly at nine oclock an wont want a latchkey  the idea of such a man going to bed at all was awesome enough but the notion of his doing so in that small room and in that delicately arranged little bed under that rooftree was so perplexing that the sisters anxiously rummaged their minds for a new objection but could find none until their visitor asked the rent of the room  then kate was assailed by another happy thought and promptly named double the amount which she and jessie had previously fixed as its valuewhich amount she felt sure would prove prohibitory  her dismay then may be imagined when the captain exclaimed with a sighperhaps it were better to say a breezeof relief  well then thats all comfortably settled  i consider the rent quite moderate  ill send up my chest tomorrow mornin an will turn up myself in the evenin  ill bid ye goodday now ladies an beg your pardon for keepin you so long about this little matter  he held out his hand  one after another the crushed sisters put their delicate little hands into the seamans enormous paw and meekly bade him goodbye after which the nautical giant strode noisily out of the house shut the door with an inadvertent bang stumbled heavily down the dark stair and passage and finally vanished from the scene  then jessie and kate seaward returned to their little parlour sat down at opposite sides of the miniature grate and gazed at each other for some minutes in solemn silenceboth strongly impressed with the feeling that they had passed through a tremendous storm and got suddenly into a profoundly dead calm    chapter four  billy bright the fisherboy visits londonhas a fightenlarges his mind and undertakes business  we must now return to the evening star fishingsmack but only for a few minutes at present  later on we shall have occasion to visit her under stirring circumstances  we saw her last heading eastward to her fishingground in the north sea  we present her now after a two months trip sailing to the west homeward bound  eight weeks at sea nine days on shore is the unvarying routine of the north sea smacksmans life summer and winter all the year round  two months of toil and exposure of the severest kind fairweather or foul and little more than one week of repose in the bosom of his family varied by visits more or less frequent to the taproom of the publichouse  it is a rugged life to body and soul  severest toil and little rest for the one strong temptation and little refreshment to the other  strong temptation you exclaim what out on the heaving billows and among the howling gales of winter on the north sea  ay stronger temptation than you might suppose as in the sequel you shall see  but we are homeward bound just now  one of the gales above referred to is blowing itself out and the evening star is threading her way among the shoals to her brief repose in yarmouth  the crew are standing about the deck looking eagerly towards the land and little billy is steering  see frontispiece  yes that ridiculous atom of humanity with a rope or steering lanyard round the tiller to prevent its knocking him down or sweeping him overboard stands there guiding the plunging smack on her course through the dangerous shoals  of course billys father has an eye on him but he does not require to say more than an occasional word at long intervals  need we observe that our little hero is no longer subject to the demon which felled him at starting and made his rosy face so pale  one glance at the healthy brown cheeks will settle that question  another glance at his costume will suffice to explain without words much of billys life during the past eight weeks  the souwester is crushed and soiled the coat is limp rent mended buttonbereaved more or less and bespattered and the boots wear the aspect of having seen service  the little hands too which even while ashore were not particularly white now bear traces of having had much to do with tar and grease and fishy substances besides being red with cold swelled with sundry bruises and seamed with several scarsfor billy is reckless by nature and it takes time and much experience of suffering to teach a man how to take care of his hands in the fisheries of the north sea  an hour or two more sufficed to carry our smack into port and then the various members of the crew hurried home  billy swaggered beside his father and tried to look manly until he reached his own door where all thought of personal appearance suddenly vanished and he leaped with an unmanly squeal of delight into his mothers arms  you may be sure that those arms did not spare him  youll not go down tonight david said mrs bright when having half choked her son she turned to her husband  no lassi wont said the skipper in a tone of decision  mrs bright was much gratified by the promise for well did she know from bitter experience that if her david went down to meet his comrades at the publichouse on his arrival his brief holidays would probably be spent in a state of semiintoxication  indeed even with this promise she knew that much of his time and a good deal of his hardly earned money would be devoted to the publican  well not have much of billys company this week i fear said mrs bright with a glance of pride at her son who returned it with a look of surprise  why so nell asked her husband  because he has got to go to london  to lunon exclaimed the father  lunon echoed the son  yes it seems that miss ruththat dear young lady miss ruth dotropy you remember her billy  remember her  i should think i does said the boy emphatically if i was to live as long as meethusilim id never forget miss dotropy  well continued mrs bright she wrote and asked joe davidsons wife to send her a fisherboy to london for a day or two and shed pay his railway fare up an back and all his expenses  what ever miss ruth wants to do with him i dont know nor any one else  mrs davidson couldnt find a boy that was fit to send so she said shed wait till you came back billy and send you up  well wonders aint agoin to cease yet a while exclaimed billy with a look of gratified pride  howsever im game for anythinkfrom pitch an toss upards  when am i to start mother  tomorrow by the first train  all rightan what sort o rig  i couldnt go in them ere slops you know  it wouldnt give em a krect idear o yarmouth boys would it  of course not sonny an ive got ready your old sunday coat it aint too small for you yetan some other things  accordingly rigged out as he expressed it in a wellmended and brushed pilotcloth coat a round bluecloth cap a pair of trousers to match and a pair of new shoes billy found himself speeding towards the great city with what he styled a stiff breakfast under hatches four or five shillings in the locker an a bustin heart beneath his veskit  in a few hours he found himself in the bewildering streets inquiring his way to the great square in the west end where mrs dotropy dwelt  the first person of whom he made inquiry was a street boy and while he was speaking the city arab regarded the provincial boys innocent facefor it was a peculiarly innocent face when in reposewith a look of mingled curiosity and cunning  now look ee here young un said the arab i dont know nothink about the vest end squares an whats more i dont want to but i do know a lot about the east end streets an if youll come with me ill  thank ee no interrupted billy with unlookedfor decision ive got business to look arter at the west end  yell cooriously enough returned the arab ive got business at the east end  by the vay you dont appen to ave any brownsany coppersabout youeh  of course i has  you dont suppose a man goes cruisin about lunon without any shot in the locker do you  to be sure not responded the street boy i might ave knowd that a man like you wouldnt anyhow  now it so appens that im wery much in want o change  you couldnt give me browns for a sixpence could you  the arab said this so earnestlyat the same time producing a sixpence or something that looked like one from his pocketsthat the provincial boys rising suspicions were quite disarmed  let me see he said plunging his hand into his trousers pocketone two threeno ive only got fourpence but  he was cut short by the arab making a sudden grasp at the coins which sent most of them spinning on the pavement  like lightning little billy sprang forward and planted his right fist on the point of the arabs nose with such vigour that the blow caused him to stagger backwards  before he could recover billy followed him up with a lefthander on the forehead and a righthander on the chest which last sent him over on his back  so sudden was the onset that the passersby scarcely understood what was occurring before it was all over  a grave policeman stepped forward at the moment  the arab rose glided into a whirl of wheels and horses legs and disappeared while billy stood still with doubled fists glaring defiance  now then my boy whats all this about said the man in blue placing a large hand gently on the small shoulder  hes bin and knocked my coppers about said our little hero indignantly as he looked up but the stern yet kindly smile on the policemans face restored him and he condescended on a fuller explanation as he proceeded to pick up his pence  having been cautioned about the danger of entering into conversation with strangers in londonespecially with street boysbilly was directed to a pimlico omnibus and deposited not far from his destination  inquiring his way thereafter of several policemenwho were as he afterwards related to admiring friends as thick in london as bloaters in yarmouthhe found himself in front of the dotropy residence  yes my little man said the footman who opened the door of the west end mansion miss ruth is at ome and as been expecting you  come this way  that footman lost ground in billys estimation because of using the word little  if he had said my boy it would have been all right my man would have been gratifying but my little man was repulsive  a smart servant girl who chanced to see him on his way to the library also caused him much pain by whispering to her fellow something about a sweet innocentfaced darling and he put on a savage frown as he was ushered into the room by way of counteracting the sweet innocence  a glass opposite suddenly revealed to its owner the smooth rosybrown visage screwed up in a compound expression  that expression changed so swiftly to sheer surprise that a burst of involuntary laughter was the result a deep flush and silence followed as the urchin looked with some confusion round the room to see if he had been observed or overheard and a sense of relief came as he found that he was alone  no one had seen or heard him except some of the dotropy ancestors who had come over with the conqueror and who gazed sternly from the walls  for you see being a family of note the diningroom could not hold all the ancestors so that some of them had to be accommodated in the library  that glance round had a powerful effect on the mind of the fisherboy so powerful indeed that all thought of self vanished for he found himself for the first time in a room the like of which he had never seen or heard or dreamed of  he knew of course that there were libraries in yarmouth and was aware that they had something to do with books but he had never seen a collection on a large scale and up to that time had no particular curiosity about books  indeed if truth must be told billy hated books because the only point in regard to which he and his mother had ever differed was a book  a tattered ragged muchsoiled book it was with big letters at the beginning simple arrangements of letters in the middle and maddening compounds of them towards the end  earnestly patiently lovingly yet perseveringly had mrs bright tried to drill the contents of that book into billys unwilling brain but with little success for albeit a willing and obliging child there was a limit to his powers of comprehension and a tendency in his young mind to hold in contempt what he did not understand  one day a somewhat pedantic visitor told billy that he would never be a great man if he did not try to understand the book in questionto thoroughly digest it  you hear what the gentleman says billy you dirty little gurnet said david bright on that occasion youve got to digest it my lad to digest it  yes father said billy with a finger in his mouth and his eyes on the visitor  the boys mind was inquisitive and ingenious  he pestered his father after the visitor had gone for an explanation as to what he meant by digesting the book  why sonny returned david knitting his brows very hard for the question was somewhat of a puzzler he means that youve got to stow away in your brain the knowledge thats in the book an work away at itdigest it dee seesame as you stow grub into yer stummick an digest that  billy pondered this a long time till a happy thought occurred to him  ill digest it said he slapping his thigh one day when he was left alone in the house  well all digest it together  he jumped up took the lid off a pot of peasoup that was boiling on the fire and dropped the hated book into it  whats this i the soup nell said david that day at dinner as he fished a mass of curious substance out of the pot  many a queer thing have i fished up i the trawl from the bottom o the north sea but neer afore did i make such a haul as this in a pot o peasoup  what ist  why david replied the wife examining the substance with a puzzled expression i do believe its the primer  they both turned their eyes inquiringly on the boy who sat gravely watching them  all right father he said i put im in  were agoin to digest it you know  dirty boy exclaimed his mother flinging the remains of the boiled book under the grate  youve ruined the soup  never a bit nell said the skipper who was in no wise particular as to his food clean paper an print cant do no damage to the soup  an after all i dont see why a man shouldnt take in knowledge as well through the stummick as through the brain  it dont matter a rokers tail whether you ship cargo through the mainhatch or through the forehatch so long as it gits inside somehow  come lets have a bowl of it  i never was good at letters myself an ill be bound to say that billy and i will digest the book better this way than the right way  thus was the finishing touch put to billy brights education at that time and we have described the incident in order that the reader may fully understand the condition of the boys mind as he stood gazing round the library of the west end mansion  books exclaimed billy afterwards when questioned by a yarmouth friend i should just think there was books  oh its o no manner o use tryin to tell ee about it  there was books from the floor to the ceilin all round the roombooks in red covers an blue covers an green an yellow an pink an whiteall the colours in the rainbow and all of em more or less kivered wi goldwyi dont know what their insides was worth but sartin sure am i that they couldnt come up to their outsides  mints of money must ave bin spent in kiverin of em  an there was ladders to git at ema short un to git at the books below an a long un to go aloft for em in the top rows what people finds to write about beats me to understand but who ever buys and reads it all beats me wuss  while new and puzzling thoughts were thus chasing each other through the fisherboys brain ruth dotropy entered  what  billy bright she exclaimed in a tone of great satisfaction hurrying forward and holding out her hand  im so glad they have sent you  i would have asked them to send you when i wrote but thought you were at sea  yes miss but ive got back again said billy grasping the offered hand timidly fearing to soil it  for the same reason he sat down carefully on the edge of a chair when ruth said heartily come sit down and lets have a talk together for you see he had become so accustomed to fishy clothes and tarred hands that he had a tendency to forget that he was now clean and in a splitnew rig  ruths manner and reception put the poor boy at once at his ease  for some time she plied him with questions about the fisherfolk of yarmouth and gorleston in whom she had taken great interest during a summer spent at the former townat which time she had made the acquaintance of little billy  then she began to talk of the sea and the fishery and the smacks with their crews  of course the boy was in his element on these subjects and not only answered his fair questioner fully but volunteered a number of anecdotes and a vast amount of interesting information about fishing which quite charmed ruth inducing her to encourage him to go on  oh yes miss he said its quite true what youve bin told theres hundreds and hundreds of smacks afishin out there on the north sea all the year round summer an winter  in course i cant say whether theres a popilation as you calls it of over twelve thousand always afloat never havin counted em myself but i know there must be amany thousand men an boys there  billy was right  there is really a population of over 12000 men and boys afloat all the year round on the north sea engaged in the arduous work of daily supplying the london and other markets with fresh fish  and what port do they run for when a storm comes on asked ruth  what port miss why they dont run for no port at all cos why theres no port near enough to run for  do you mean to say that they remain at sea during all the stormseven the worst  thats just what we does miss  blow high blow low its all the same we must weather it the best way we can  an you should see how it blows in winter  thats the time we catches it wust  its so cold too ive not bin out in winter yet myself but father says its cold enough to freeze the nose off your face an it blows ard enough amost to blow you inside out  you wouldnt like to face that sort o thing would you miss  with a light laugh ruth admitted that she disliked the idea of such north sea experiences  oh youve no idea miss how it do blow sometimes continued billy who was a naturally communicative boy and felt that he had got hold of a sympathetic ear  have you ever heard of the gale that blew so ard that they had to station two men an a boy to hold on to the captains hair for fear it should be blowed right off his ead  yes answered ruth with a silvery laugh  ive heard of that gale  have you miss said billy with a slightly surprised look  thats queer now  i thought nobody knowd o that gale cept us o the north sea an praps some o the people o yarmouth an gorleston  i rather think that i must have read of it somewhere said ruth billy glanced reproachfully at the surrounding books under the impression that it must have been one of these which had taken the wind out of his sails  well miss he continued i dont mean for to say i ever was in a gale that obliged us to be careful of the skippers hair but i do say that fathers seed somethink like it for many a time our smack has bin blowed over on her beamendsthat means laid amost flat miss with er sails on the sea  one night fathers smack was sailin along closehauled when a heavy sea struck er abaft the channels and filled the bag o the mainsl  she was just risin to clear herself when another sea follared filled the mainsl again an sent er on er beamends  the sea was makin a clean breach over er from stem to stern an cleared the deck o the boat an gear an everythink  down went all hands below an shut the companion to prevent er being swamped  meanwhile the weight o water bust the mainsl so that the vessel partly righted an let the hands come on deck agin  then after the gale had eased a bit two or three o their comrades bore down on em and towed em round so as the wind got under er an lifted er a bit but the ballast had bin shot from the bilge into the side so they couldnt right her altogether but had to tow er into port that way over two hundred milesthe snow an hail blowin too like one oclock  really they must have had a terrible time of it returned ruth though i dont know exactly how dreadful one oclock may be  but tell me billy do the fishermen like the worsted mitts and helmets and comforters that were sent to them from this house last year  oh dont they just  ive heard them blessin the ladies as sent em many a time  you see miss the oilskins chafe our wrists most awful when were workin of the gear  what is the gear billy  the nets miss an all the tackle as belongs to em  an then the salt water makes the sores wussit used to be quite awful but the cuffs keeps us all right  an the books an tracts too missthe hands are wery fond o them an  we will talk about the books and tracts another time said ruth interrupting but just now we must proceed to business  of course you understand that i must have some object in view in sending for a fisherboy from yarmouth  well miss it did occur to me that i wasnt axed to come here for nuffin  just so my boy  now i want your help so i will explain  we are to have what is called a drawingroom meeting here in a few days in behalf of the mission to deepsea fishermen and one of your fisher captains is to be present to give an account of the work carried on among the men of the fleet by the mission vessels  so i want you to be there as one of the boys  not to speak to em miss i hope said billy with a look of affected modesty  no not to speak replied ruth laughing only to represent the boys of the fleet  but thats not the main thing i want you for  it is this and remember billy that i am now taking you into my confidence so you must not tell what i shall speak to you about to any living soul  not even to mother asked the boy  no not evenwell you may tell it to your mother for boys ought to have no secrets from their mothers besides your mother is a discreet woman and lives a long way off from london  you must know then billy that i have two very dear friendstwo ladieswho are in deep poverty and i want to give them money  well why dont you give it em miss said billy seeing that ruth hesitated  you must have lots of it to give away he added looking contemplatively round  yes thank god who gave it to me i have as you say lots of it but i cannot give it to the dear ladies i speak of becausebecause  theyre too proud to take it praps suggested billy  no they are not proudvery far from it but they are sensitive  whats that miss  ruth was puzzled for a reply  itit means she said that they have delicate feelings which cannot bear the idea of accepting money without working for it when there are so many millions of poor people without money who cannot work for it  they once said to me indeed that if they were to accept money in charity they would feel as if they were robbing the really poor  why dont they work then asked billy in some surprise  why dont they go to sea as stooardesses or somethink o that sort  because they have never been trained to such work or indeed to any particular work returned ruth moreover they are in rather delicate health and are not young  their father was rich and meant to leave them plenty to live on but he failed and left them in broken health without a penny  wasnt it sad  indeed it was miss replied the boy whose ready sympathy was easily enlisted  well now billy i want you to go to see these ladies  tell them that you are a fisherboy belonging to the north sea trawling fleet and that you have called from a house which wants a job undertaken  you will then explain about the fishery and how the wrists of the men are chafed and break out into painful sores and how worsted mitts serve the purpose at once of prevention and cure  say that the house by which you have been sent has many hands at workand so i have billy for many ladies send the cuffs and things made by them for the fleet to me to be forwarded only they work gratuitously and i want the work done by my two friends to be paid for you understand  tell them that still more hands are wanted and ask them if they are open to an engagement you must be very matteroffact grave and businesslike you know  ask them how many pairs they think they will be able to make in a week and say that the price to be paid will be fixed on receipt of the first sample  but remember on no account are you to mention the name of the house that sent you you will also leave with them this bag of worsted now do you fully understand  billy replied by a decided wink coupled with an intelligent nod  after a good deal of further advice and explanation ruth gave billy the name and address of her friends and sent him forth on his mission    chapter five  how billy conducts the businesshow captain bream overcomes the sisters and how jessie seaward sees mystery in everything  i wonder said billy to himself on reaching the street as he looked down at the legs of his trousers i wonder if theyre any shorter yes they dont seem to be quite so far down on the shoes as when i left yarmouth  i must have growd an inch or two since i came up to lunon  under this gratifying impression the fisherboy drew himself up to his full height his little chest swelling with new sensations and his whole body rolling along with a nautical swagger that drew on him the admiration of some the contempt of others and caused several street boys to ask if his mother knowed e was hout and other insolent questions  but billy cared for none of these things  the provincial boy was quite equal to the occasion though his return chaff smacked much of salt water  arrived at the povertystricken street in which the misses seaward dwelt billy mounted the narrow staircase and knocked at the door  it was opened by liffie lee who had remained on that day to accomplish some extra work  is your missis at home my dear  there aint no missis here an i aint your dear was the prompt reply  billy was taken aback  he had not anticipated so ready and caustic a response in one so small and childlike  come nowno offence meant he said but youre not agoin to deny that the miss seawards does live here  i aint agoin to deny nothink replied liffie a little softened by the boys apologetic tone only when im expected to give a civil answer i expects a civil question  thats all fair an aboveboard  now will you tell the miss seawards i wants to see em on a matter of businessof importance  another minute and billy stood in the presence of the ladies he wished to see  prepared beforehand to like them his affections were at once fixed for ever by the first glimpse of their kindly faces  with a matteroffact gravity that greatly amused the sistersthough they carefully concealed their feelingslittle billy stated his business and in so doing threw his auditors into a flutter of hope and gratitude surprise and perplexity  but what is the name of the house that sends you asked miss jessie  that i am not allowed for to tell said the boyofbusiness firmly  a mercantile house in the city i suppose said kate  what sort o house it may be is more than a seafarin man like me knows an of course its in the city  you wouldnt expect a businesshouse to be in the country would you all i know is that they want mitts madehundreds of emno end o mittsan they haint got hands enough to make em so they sent me to ask if youll undertake to help in the work or if theyre to git some one else to do it  now will you or will you not thats the pint  of course we shall be only too happy answered jessie though the application is strange  how did you come to know that we were in want ofthat is who sent you to us  the house sent me as i said afore miss  yes but how did the house come to know of our existence and how is it that a house of any sort should send a sailorboy as its messenger  how the house came to know of you is more than i can say  they dont tell me all the outsanins of their affairs you know  as to a house sendin a sailorboy as its messengerdid you ever hear of the great house of messrs hewett and company what supplies billinsgate with fish  im not surewell yes i think i have heard of that house said kate though we are not in the way of hearing much about the commercial houses of london  well continued billy that house sends hundreds of fisherboys as messengers  it sends em to the deepsea with a message to the fish an the message iscome out o the water you skulkin critters an be sent up to billinsgate to be sold an eaten  the fish dont come willinly im bound for to say that but we make em come all the same willin or not for weve wonderful powers o persuasion  so you see houses do send fisherboys as messengers sometimes now what am i to say to the partikler house as sends me will you go in for mitts you may take comforters if you prefer it or helmets  what do you mean by helmets my boy  worsted ones of course  things made to kiver up a mans head and neck and come down to his shoulders with a hole in front just big enough to let his eyes nose and cheekbones come through  with a souwester on top and a comforter round the neck theyre not so bad in a stiff norwester in janoowairy  nows your chance ladies now or niver  there was something so ludicrous in the manly tone and decided manner of the smoothfaced little creature before them that the sisters burst into a hearty fit of laughter  forgive us dear boy but the idea of our being asked in this sudden way to make innumerable mitts and comforters and worsted helmets seems so odd that we cant help laughing  what is your name  that is not a secret i hope  by no means  my name is billy bright  if youre very partikler you may call me willum  i prefer billy said kate  now billy it is near our dinner hour will you stay and dine with us  if you do youll meet such a nice mansuch a big man tooand somewhat in your own line of life a seacaptain  we expect him every  no thank ee miss interrupted the boy rising abruptly  i sees more than enough o big seacaptings when im afloat  besides ive got more business on hand so ill bid ee goodday  pulling his forelock he left the room  the ladies has undertook some work for me my dear said billy to liffie lee as he stood at the door buttoning up his little coat so praps i may see you again  it wont break my art if you dont replied liffie no nor yet yours  speak for yourself young ooman  you dont know nothing about my art  as he spoke a heavy foot was heard at the bottom of the stair  thats our lodger said liffie no foot but his can bang the stair or make it creak like that  well im off cried billy descending two steps at a time  halfway down he encountered what seemed to him a giant with a chest on his shoulder  it was the darkest part of the stair where they met  look out ahead  hard a starboard growled captain bream who seemed to be heavily weighted  ay ay sir cried billy as he brushed past bounded into the street and swaggered away  what boy was that liffie asked the captain letting down the chest he carried with a shock that caused the frail tenement to quiver from cellar to rooftree  i dont know sir  he must be a sailorboy from his answer rejoined the captain  open the door o my cabin lass and ill carry it right in  its somewhat heavy  he lifted the chest which was within an eighth of an inch of being too large to pass through the little doorway and put it in a corner after which he entered the parlour and sat down in a solid wooden chair which he had supplied to the establishment for his own special use  you see he had said on the day when he introduced it ive come to grief so often in the matter of chairs that ive become chary as to how i use em  if all the chairs that ive had go crash under me was put together theyd furnish a goodsized house  look before you leap is a wellknown proverb but look before you sit down has become a more familiar experience to me through life  its an awkward thing bein so heavy and i hope youll never know what it is ladies  judging from their appearance just then there did not seem much prospect of that  now continued the captain rubbing his hands and looking benignantly at jessie i have settled the matter at last fairly said goodbye to old ocean an fixed to cast anchor for good on the land  have you indeed captain said jessie i should fancy that you must feel rather sorry to bid farewell to so old a friend  thats true miss seaward  an old and good friend the sea has been to me thank god  but im gettin too old myself to be much of a friend to it so ive fixed to say goodbye  and the question is am i to stop on here or am i to look out for another lodgin  you see ive been a good many weeks with you now an youve had a fair taste of me so to speak  i know im a rough sort o fish for the like o you to have to do with and like some o the hermit crabs rather too big for my shell so if you find me awkward or uncomfortable dont hesitate to say so  i wont be surprised though i confess i should be sorry to leave you  well captain bream said kate who was generally the speaker when delicate difficult or unpleasant subjects had to be dealt with since you have been so candid with us we will be equally candid with you when you first came to us i confess that we were much alarmed you seemedso very big the captain tried to shrink a littlewithout successand smiled in a deprecating manner and our rooms and furniture seemed so very small and delicate so to speak and then your voice was so fearfully deep and gruff the captain cleared his throat softlyin b natural of the bass clefand smiled again that we were almost frightened to receive you but now that we have had experience of you we are quite willing that you should continue with uson one condition however  and that is asked the captain anxiously  that you pay us a lower rent  aa higher rent you mean i suppose  no i mean a lower  captain breams benign visage became grave and elongated  you see captain continued kate flushing a little when you first came we triedexcuse meto get rid of you to shake you off and we almost doubled the rent of our little room hoping that  quite right quite right interrupted the captain and according to strict justice for aint i almost double the size of ornary men an dont i give more than double the trouble  not so returned kate firmly you dont give half the trouble that other men do  excuse me miss kate said the captain with a twinkle in his grey eye you told me i was your first lodger so how can you know how much trouble other men would give  no matter persisted kate a little confused you dont give half the trouble that other lodgers would have given if we had had them  ah hmwell returned the captain softly in the profoundest possible bass looking at the matter in that light perhaps you are not far wrong  but go on  well i have only to add continued kate that you have been so kind to us and so considerate and have given us so littleso very little trouble that it will give us both great pleasure to have you continue to lodge with us if you agree to the reduction of the rent  very well said captain bream pulling out an immense gold chronometerthe gift in days gone by of a band of highly grateful and appreciative passengers  ive got business in the city an hour hence we shall have dinner first  two hours afterwards i will return with a cab and take away my boxes  that will give you plenty of time to make out your little bill and  what do you mean captain interrupted kate in much surprise  i mean dear ladies that you and i entered into an agreement to rent your little cabin for so much  now it has been my rule in life to stick to agreements and i mean to stick to this one or throw up my situation besides im not goin to submit to have the half of my rent cut off i cant stand it  like old shylock i mean to stick to the letter of the bond  now is it to be or not to be as hamlet said to the ass  i was not aware that hamlet said that to an ass remarked jessie with a little laugh  oh yes he did returned the captain quite confidently he said it to himself you know an that was the same thing  but what about the agreement  well since you are so determined i suppose we must give in said kate  we cant resist you captain said jessie but there is one thing that we must positively insist on namely that you come and sit in this room of an evening  i suppose you read or write a great deal for we see your light burning very late sometimes and as you have no fire you must often feel very cold  cold shouted the captain with a laugh that caused the very windowframes to vibrate  my dear ladies im never cold  got so used to it i suppose that it has no power over me  why when a man o my size gets heated right through it takes three or four hours to cool him even a little  besides if it do come a very sharp frost ive got a bearskin coat that our shipcarpenter made for me one voyage in the arctic regions  it is hot enough inside almost to cook you  did i ever show it you  ill fetch it  captain bream rose with such energy that he unintentionally spurned his chairhis own solid peculiar chairand caused it to pirouette on one leg before tumbling backward with a crash  next minute he returned enveloped from head to foot in what might be termed a whitebear ulster with an enormous hood at the back of his neck  accustomed as the sisters were to their lodgers bulk they were not prepared for the marvellous increase caused by the monstrous hairy garment  it would puzzle the cold to get at me through this wouldnt it said its owner surveying it with complacency  it was my own invention tooat least the carpenter and i concocted it between us  the sleeves are closed up at the ends you see and a thumb attached to each so as to make sleeves and mittens all of a piece with a slit near the wrists to let you shove your hands out when you want to use them naked an a flap to cover the slit and keep the wind out when you dont want to shove out your hands  then the hood you see is large and easy so that it can be pulled well forardsoand this broad band behind it unbuttons and comes round in front of the face and buttons soto keep all snug when you lay down to sleep  wonderful exclaimed the sisters as the captain stood before them like a great pillar of white fur with nothing of him visible save the eyes and feet  but thats not all continued the ancient mariner turning his back to the sisters  you see that great flap hooked up behind  yes answered jessie and kate in the same breath  well then notice what i do  he sat down on the floor and unhooking the flap drew it round in front where he rehooked it to another row of eyes in such a manner that it completely covered his feet and lower limbs  there you see im in a regular furbag now all ready for a night in the snow  by way of illustration he extended himself on the floor at fulllength and by reason of that length being so great and the room so narrow his feet went into the windowrecess while his head lay near the door  all ignorant of this illustration of arctic life going on liffie lee intent on dinner purposes opened the door and drove it violently against the captains head  avast there he shouted rising promptly  come in lass  come in no damage done  oh sir exclaimed the horrified liffie i ax your parding  dont put yourself about my girl  im used to collisions and its not in the power o your small carcass to do me damage  disrobing himself as he spoke the lodger retired to his cabin to lay aside his curious garment and liffie assisted by kate took advantage of his absence to spread their little board  i never saw such a man said kate in a low voice as she bustled about  saw exclaimed jessie under her breath i never even conceived of such a man  he is so violent in his actions that i constantly feel as if i should be run over and killed  it feels like living in the same house with a runaway mail coach  how fortunate that his spirit is so gentle and kind  a tremendous crash at that moment caused jessie to stop with a gasp  hallo fetch a swaba dishclout or somethin liffie came thundering from the captains room  dont be alarmed ladies its only the washhand basin  knocked it over in hangin up the coat nothin smashed  its a tin basin you know  look alive lass else the waterll git down below for the caulkin of these planks aint much to boast of an youll have the greengrocer up in a towering rage  a few minutes later this curious trio sat down to dinner and the captain according to a custom established from the commencement of his sojourn asked a blessing on the meat in few words but with a deeply reverent manner his great hands being clasped before him and with his eyes shut like a little child  well now before beginning he said looking up let me understand is this matter of the lodging and rent settled  yes it is settled answered jessie  weve got used to you captain and should be very very sorry to lose you  come thats all right  lets shake hands on it over the leg of mutton  he extended his long arm over the small table and spread out his enormous palm in front of jessie seaward  with an amused laugh she laid her little hand in itto grasp it was out of the questionand the mighty palm closed for a moment with an affectionate squeeze  the same ceremony having been gone through with kate he proceeded to carve  and what a difference between the dinners that once gracedperhaps we should say disgracedthat board and those that smoked upon it now then tea and toast with sometimes an egg and occasionally a bit of bacon were the light viands now beef mutton peas greens potatoes and other things constituted the heavy fare  the sisters had already begun to get stronger on it  the captain would have got stronger no doubt had that been possible  and what a satisfactory thing it was to watch captain bream at his meals  there was something grandabsolutely majesticin his action being a profoundly modest and unselfish man it was not possible to associate the idea of gluttony with him though he possessed the digestion of an ostrich and the appetite of a shark  there was nothing hurried or eager or careless in his mode of eating  his motions were rather slow than otherwise his proceedings deliberate  he would even at times check a tempting morsel on its way to his mouth that he might more thoroughly understand and appreciate something that jessie or kate chanced to be telling him  yet with all that he compelled you while looking at him to whisper to yourselfhow he does shovel it in  i declare to you kate said jessie on one occasion after the captain had left the room i saw him take one bite today which ought to have choked him but it didnt  he stuck his fork into a piece of mutton as bigoh  im afraid to say how big it really seemed to me the size of your hand and he piled quite a little mound of green peas on it with a great mass of broken fragments and gravy and put it all into his mouth at once though that mouth was already pretty wellfilled with the larger half of an enormous potato  i thought he would never get it in but something you said caused him to laugh at the time and before the laugh was over the bite had disappeared  before it was properly swallowed he was helping himself to another slice from the leg of mutton  i declare to you kate that many a time i have dined altogether on less than that one bite  poor miss seaward had stated a simple truth in regard to herself but that truth was founded on want of food not on want of appetite or capacity for more  at first it had been arranged that an accountbook should be kept and that the captain should pay for onethird of the food that was consumed in the house but he had consumed so much and the sisters so ridiculously little that he refused to fall in with such an arrangement and insisted on paying for all the food consumed with the exception of the cup of coffee cream and sugar with which he regaled himself every day after dinner  of course they had had a battle over this matter also but the captain had carried the day as he usually did for he had marvellous powers of suasion  he had indeed so argued and talked and bamboozled the meek sisterssometimes seriously oftener jocularly that they had almost been brought to the belief that somehow or other their lodger was only doing what was just  after all they were not so far wrong for all that they ate of the captains provisions amounted to a mere drop in the bucket while the intellectual food with which they plied their lodger in return and the wealth of sympathy with which they surrounded him was far beyond the power of gold to purchase  no said captain bream sipping his coffee and shaking his head when jessie again pressed on him the propriety of sitting in the parlour of an evening i cant do it  the fact is that im studyingthough you may think im rather an oldish studentand i cant study except when im alone  what are you studying asked kate and then observing that the captain looked slightly confused and feeling that she ought not to have put the question she quickly changed the subject by addingfor whatever it is you will be quite free from interruption here  my sister and i often sit for hours without talking and  no no dear miss kate  say no more interrupted the captain i must stick to my own cabin except at mealtimes and of course when we want a bit of a talk together  there is one thing however that i would like  i know you have family worship with your little lass  may i join you  oh it would give us such pleasure exclaimed kate eagerly if you would come and conduct worship for us  the captain protested that he would not do that but finally gave in and afterwards acted the part of chaplain in the family  by the way he said when about to quit the parlour ive brought another chest to the house  yes said kate we felt the shock when you put it down  well it is a bit heavy  ive fairly given up my connection with my last ship and as the new commander took possession this morning i was obliged to bring away my last box  now i dont want liffie to move it about when putting things to rights or to meddle with it in any way when we want to sweep behind or under it ill shift it myself  but after all youre safe not to move it for the three of you together couldnt if you were to try ever so much  so goodday  ill be back to tea  kate said jessie after he was gone i am quite sure that there is some mystery connected with that box  of course you are replied kate with a laugh you always see mystery in things that you dont understand  you saw mystery too didnt you in the late sitting up and studies of captain bream  indeed i did and i am quite sure that there is some mystery about that too  just so and i have no doubt that you observe mystery of some sort added kate with a humorous glance in the order for worsted work that we have just received  undoubtedly i do replied jessie with decision  the whole affair is mysteriousridiculously so  in truth it seems to me that we are surrounded by mystery  well well sister mine said the matteroffact kate going to a small cupboard and producing an ample workbox that served for both whatever mysteries may surround us it is our business to fulfil our engagements so we will at once begin our knitting of cuffs and comforters for the fishermen of the north sea    chapter six  the curse of the north sea and the trawls at work  there are few objects in nature we think more soothing to the feelings and at the same time more heartstirring to the soul than the wide ocean in a profound calm when sky and temperature health hour and other surrounding conditions combine to produce unison of the entire being  such were the conditions one lovely morning about the end of summer which gladdened the heart of little billy bright as he leaned over the side of the evening star and made faces at his own reflected image in the sea while he softly whistled a slow melody to which the gentle swell beat time  the evening star was at that time the centre of a constellationif we may so call itof fishingsmacks which floated in hundreds around her it was the short blue fleet of deepsea trawlers so named because of the short square flag of blue by which it was distinguished from other deepsea fleetssuch as the grimsby fleet the columbia fleet the great northern yarmouth red cross and other fleetswhich do our fishing business from years end to years end on the north sea  but billy was thoughtless and apt to enjoy what was agreeable without reference to its being profitable  some of the conditions which rejoiced his heart had the reverse effect on his father  that gruffspirited fisherman did not want oily seas or serene blue skies or reflected clouds and sunshineno what he wanted was fish and before the evening star could drag her ponderous gear along the bottom of the sea so as to capture fish it was necessary that a stiffish breeze should not only ruffle but rouse the billows of the north seaall the better if it should fringe their crests with foam  my usual luck growled david bright as he came on deck after a hearty breakfast and sat down on the bulwarks to fill his pipe and do what in him lay to spoil his digestionthough to do david justice his powers in that line were so strong that he appeared to be invulnerable to tobacco and spirits  we use the word appeared advisedly for in reality the undermining process was going on surely though in his case slowly  his hands having enjoyed an equally good breakfast were moving quietly about paying similar attention to their digestions  there was our tall friend joe davidson the mate and ned spivin a man of enormous chest and shoulders though short in the legs and luke trevor a handsome young fellow of middle size but great strength and activity and john gunter a big sourfaced man with a low brow rough black hair and a surly spirit  billy was supposed to be minding the tiller but in the circumstances the tiller was left to mind itself zulu was the only active member on board to judge from the clatter of his pots and pans below  my usual luck said the skipper a second time in a deeper growl  seems to me said gunter in a growl that was even more deep and discontented than that of the skipper that luck is always down on us  tis the same luck that the rest o the fleet has got anyhow observed joe davidson who was the most cheerful spirit in the smack but indeed all on board with the exception of the skipper and gunter were men of a hearty honest cheerful nature more or less careless about life and limb  to the mates remark the skipper said humph and gunter said that he was the unluckiest fellow that ever went to sea  youre always growling jack said ned spivin who was fond of chaffing his mates they should have named you grunter when they were at it  i only wish the coper was alonside said the skipper but shes always out of the way when shes wanted  who saw her last  i did said luke trevor just after we had crossed the silver pits and i wish we might never see her again  why so mate asked gunter  because shes the greatest curse that floats on the north sea returned luke in a tone of indignation  ahyou hate her because youve jined the teetotallers returned gunter with something of a sneer  no mate i dont hate her because ive jined the teetotallers but ive jined the teetotallers because i hate her  pretty much the same thing aint it  no more the same thing retorted luke than it is the same thing to put the cart before the horse or the horse before the cart  it wasnt totalabstainin that made me hate the coper but it was hatred of the coper that made me take to totalabstainindont you see  not he said billy bright who had joined the group gunter never sees nothing unless you stick it on to the end of his nose an even then youve got to tear his eyes open an force him to look  gunter seized a ropesend and made a demonstration of an intention to apply it but billy was too active he leaped aside with a laugh and then getting behind the mast invited the man to come on an do his wust  gunter laid down the ropesend with a grim smile and turned to luke trevor  but im sure youve got no occasion he said to blackguard the coper for you havent bin to visit her much  no thank god i have not said luke earnestly yet ive bin aboard often enough to wish i had never bin there at all  its not that mates that makes me so hard on the coper but it was through the accursed drink got aboard o that floatin grogshop that i lost my best friend  how was that luke we never heerd on it  the young fisherman paused a few moments as if unwilling to talk on a distasteful subject  well it aint surprisin you didnt hear of it he said because i was in the morgan fleet at the time an its more than a year past the way of it was this  we was all becalmed on a mornin much like this not far off the borkum reef when our skipper jumped into the boat ordered my friend sterlin an me into it an went off cruisin we visited one or two smacks the skippers o which were great chums of our skipper an he got drunk there  soon after a stiff breeze sprang up an the admiral signalled to bear away to the norwestard  we bundled into our boat an made for our smack but by ill luck we had to pass the coper an nothin would please the skipper but to go aboard and have a glass  sterlin tried to prevent him but he grew savage an told him to mind his own business  well he had more than one glass and by that time it was blowin so ard we began to think wed have some trouble to get back again  at last he consented to leave an a difficult job it was to get him into the boat wi the sea that was runnin  when we got alongside of our smack he laid hold of sterlins oar an told him to throw the painter aboard  my friend jumped up an threw the end o the painter to one of the hands  he was just about to lay hold o the side an spring over when the skipper stumbled against him caused him to miss his grip an sent him clean overboard  poor sterlin had on his long boots an a heavy jacket  he went down like a stone  we never saw him again  did none o you try to save him asked joe quickly  we couldnt replied luke  i made a dash at him but he was out o sight by that time  he went down so quick that i cant help thinkin he must have struck his head on the side in goin over  luke trevor did not say as he might have truly said that he dived after his friend being himself a good swimmer and nearly lost his own life in the attempt to save that of sterling  dye think the skipper did it a purpose mate asked david  sartinly not answered luke  the skipper had no illwill at him but he was so drunk he couldnt take care of himself an didnt know what he was about  that wasnt the fault o the coper growled gunter  you say he got halfscrewed afore he went there an he might have got deaddrunk without goin aboard of her at all  so he might retorted luke nevertheless it was the coper that finished him off at that timeas it has finished off many a man before and will no doubt be the death o many more in time to come  the copers which luke trevor complained of so bitterly are dutch vessels which provide spirits and tobacco the former of a cheap bad and peculiarly fiery nature  they follow the fleets everywhere and are a continual source of mischief to the fishermen many of whom like men on shore find it hard to resist a temptation which is continually presented to them  there goes the admiral sang out little billy who while listening to the conversation had kept his sharp little eyes moving about  the admiral of the fleet among north sea fishermen is a very important personage  there is an admiral to each fleet though we write just now about the admiral of the short blue  he is chosen for steadiness and capacity and has to direct the whole fleet as to the course it shall steer the letting down of its gear or trawls etcetera and his orders are obeyed by all  one powerful reason for such obedience is that if they do not follow the admiral they will find themselves at last far away from the steamers which come out from the thames daily to receive the fish for it is a rule that those steamers make straight for the admirals vessel  by day the admiral is distinguished by a flag half way up the maintopmast stay  by night signals are made with rockets  while the crew of the evening star were thus conversing a slight breeze had sprung up and billy had observed that the admirals smack was heading to windward in an easterly direction  as the breeze came down on the various vessels of the fleet they all steered the same course so that in a few minutes nearly two hundred smacks were following him like a shoal of herring  the glassy surface of the sea was effectually broken and a field of rippling indigo took the place of the ethereal sheet of blue  thus the whole fleet passed steadily to windward the object being to get to such a position on the fishinggrounds before nightfall that they could put about and sail before the wind during the night dragging their ponderous trawls over the banks where fish were known to lie  night is considered the best time to fish though they also fish by day the reason being it is conjectured that the fish do not see the net so well at night it may be also that they are addicted to slumber at that period  be the reason what it may the fact is wellknown accordingly about ten oclock the admiral hoveto for a few minutes so did the fleet  on board the evening star they took soundings and found twentyfive fathoms  then the admiral called attention by showing a flare  look out now billy said david bright to his son who was standing close by the capstan  billy needed no caution  his sharp eyes were already on the watch  a green rocket  there she goes father  the green rocket signified that the gear was to be put down on the starboard side and the fleet to steer to the southward  bustling activity and tremendous vigour now characterised the crew of the evening star as they proceeded to obey the order  a clear starry sky and a bright moon enabled them to see clearly what they were about and they were further enlightened by a lantern in the rigging  the trawl which they had to put down was as we have said a huge and ponderous affair and could only be moved by means of powerful blocks and tackle aided by the capstan  it consisted of a thick spar called the beam about fortyeight feet long and nearly a foot thick supported on a massive iron hoop or runner at each end  these irons were meant to drag over the bottom of the sea and keep the beam from touching it  attached to this beam was the bagneta very powerful one as may be supposed with a small mesh  it was seventy feet long and about sixteen feet of the outermost end was much stronger than the rest and formed the bag named the codend in which the fish were ultimately collected  besides being stronger the codend was covered by flounces of old netting to prevent the rough bottom from chafing it too much  the cost of such a net alone is about 7 pounds  to the beam attached at the two ends was a very powerful rope called the bridle it was twenty fathoms long  to this was fastened the warpa rope made of best manilla and hemp always of great strength  the amount of this paid out depended much on the weather if very rough it might be about 40 fathoms if moderate about 100  sometimes such net and gear is carried away and this involves a loss of about 60 pounds sterling  we may dismiss these statistics by saying that a good nights fishing may be worth from 10 pounds to 27 pounds and a good tripof eight weeks may produce from 200 to 280 pounds  soon the gear was down in the twentyfive fathom water and the trawlwarp became as rigid almost as an iron bar while the speed of the smack through the water was greatly reducedperhaps to three miles an hourby the heavy drag behind her a drag that ever increased as fish of all sorts and sizes were scraped into the net  why the fish are such idiots as to remain in the net when they could swim out of it at the rate of thirty miles an hour is best known to themselves  besides the luminaries which glittered in the sky that night the sea was alive with the masthead lights of the fishing smacks but these lower lights unlike the serenely steady lights above were ever changing in position as well as dancing on the crested waves giving life to the dark waters and creating at least in the little breast of billy bright a feeling of companionship which was highly gratifying  now lad go below and see if zulu has got something for us to eat said david to his son  here luke trevor mind the helm  the young fisherman who had been labouring with the others at the gear like a hercules stepped forward and took the tiller while the skipper and his son descended to the cabin where the rest of the men were already assembled in anticipation of supper  the cabin was remarkably snug but it was also preeminently simple  so also was the meal the arts of upholstery and cookery had not been brought to bear in either case  the apartment was about twelve feet long by ten broad and barely high enough to let joe davidson stand upright  two wooden lockers ran along either side of it  behind these were the bunks of the men  at the inner end were some more lockers and aft there was an open stove or fireplace alongside of the companionladder  a clock and a barometer were the chief ornaments of the place  the atmosphere of it was not fresh by any means and volumes of tobacco smoke rendered it hazy  but what cared these heavybooted roughhanded bigframed ironsinewed stronghearted men for fresh air  they got enough of that during their long hours on deck to counteract the stifling odours of the regions below  now then boys dar you is said zulu placing a huge pot on the floor containing some sort of nautical soup  is cook you soup an tea an dars sugar an butter an lots o fish and biskit so you fire away till you bust yourselves  the jovial zulu bestowed on the company a broad and genial grin as he set the example by filling a bowl with the soup  the others did not require a second bidding  what they lacked in quality was more than made up in quantity and rendered delicious by appetite  conversation flagged of course while these hardy sons of toil were busy with their teeth balancing themselves and their cups and bowls carefully while the little vessel rolled heavily over the heaving waves  by degrees the teeth became less active and the tongues began to wag  i wish that feller would knock off psalmsingin said gunter with an oath as he laid down his knife and wiped his mouth  he referred to luke trevor who possessed a sweet mellow voice and was cheering himself as he stood at the helm by humming a hymn or something like one for the words were not distinguishable in the cabin  i think that luke if he was here would wish some other feller to knock off cursin an swearin said joe  come joe said the skipper dont you pretend to be one o the religious sort for you know youre not  thats true returned joe and i dont pretend to be but surely a man may object to cursin without bein religious  ive heard men say that they dont mean nothin by their swearin  praps the psalmsingin men might say the same but for my part if they both mean nothin by it id rather be blessed than cursed by my mates any day  the admirals signallin sir sung out luke putting his head down the companion at that moment  the men went on deck instantly nevertheless each found time to light the inevitable pipe before devoting himself entirely to duty  the signal was to haul up the trawl and accordingly all the fleet set to work at their capstans the nets having by that time been down about three or four hours  it was hard work and slow that heaving at the capstans hour after hour with the turbulent sea tossing about the little smacks few of which were much above seventy tons burden  one or two in the fleet worked their capstans by steampoweran immense relief to the men besides a saving of time  its hard on the wrists said gunter during a brief pause in the labour as he turned up the cuffs of his oiled frock and displayed a pair of wrists that might well have caused him to growl  the constant chafing of the hard cuffs had produced painful sores and swellings which were further irritated by salt water  my blessins on de sweet ladies what takes so much trouble for us said zulu pulling up his sleeves and regarding with much satisfaction a pair of worsted cuffs nebber had no sore wrists since i put on dese wy you no use him gunter  cause ive lost em you black baboon was gunters polite reply  nebber mind you longnosed white gorilla was zulus civil rejoinder you kin git another pair when nixt we goes aboard de missionship till den you kin grin an enjoy youself  heave away lads said the skipper and away went the capstan again as the men grasped the handles and bent their strong backs sometimes heaving in a few turns of the great rope with a run as the trawl probably passed over a smooth bit of sand sometimes drawing it in with difficulty inch by inch as the net was drawn over some rough or rocky place and occasionally coming for a time to a dead lock whenas is not unfrequently the casethey caught hold of a bit of old wreck or worse still were caught by the fluke of a lost anchor  thus painfully but steadily they toiled until the bridle or rope next to the beam appeared above the waves and then they knew that the end of all their labour was at hand    chapter seven  a haul and its consequencesmysterious news from the land  now billy you shrimp cried david bright seizing his son by the collar and giving him a friendly shake that would have been thought severe handling by any but a fisherboy dont go excitin of yourself youll never make a man worth speakin of if you cant keep down your feelins  but billy could not keep down his feelings  they were too strong for him  he was naturally of an excitablewhat we may call a jovial jumpingdisposition and although he had now been some months at sea he had not yet succeeded in crushing down that burst of delight with which he viewed the codend of the great deepsea net as it was hoisted over the side by the power of block and tackle  you never trouble yourself about my feelins father so longs i do my dooty said the boy with native insolence as he looked eagerly over the side at the mass of fish which gleamed faintly white as it neared the surface while he helped with all his little might to draw in the net  but i want to teach you more than dooty my boy returned the skipper ive got to make a man of you  i promised that to your mother you know  if you want to be a man you must foller my examplebe cool an steady  if im to foller your example father why dont you let me foller it all round an smoke an drink as well  shut up you agrawatin sinner growled the skipper  heave away lads  here hand me the rope an send aft the tackle  by this time the heavy beam had been secured to the side of the vessel most of the net hauled in and the bag or codend was above the surface filled almost to bursting with upwards of a ton of turbots soles haddocks plaice dabs whitings etcetera besides several hundredweight of mud weeds stones and oysters  sometimes indeed this bag does burst and in one moment all the profit and toil of a nights fishing is lost  when the skipper had secured a strong rope round the bag and hooked it on to a block and tackle made fast to the rigging the order was given to heave away and gradually the ponderous mass rose like an oval balloon or buoy over the vessels side  when it cleared the rail it was swung inwards and secured in a hanging position with the lower end sweeping the deck as the smack rolled from side to side  in all these operations from the prolonged heaving at the capstan to the hauling in of the net hand over hand the men were exerting their great physical powers to the uttermostalmost without a moments relaxationbesides being deluged at times by spray which however their oiled frocks long boots and souwesters prevented from quite drenching them  but now all danger of loss was over and they proceeded to liberate the fish  the codend had its lower part secured by a strong rope  all that had to be done therefore was to untie the rope and open the bottom of the net  it fell to luke trevor to do this  billy was standing by in eager expectation  ned spivin stood behind him  now we have said that spivin was fond of chaffing his mates and of practical jokes  so was billy and between these two therefore there was a species of rivalry  when spivin observed that luke was about to pull out the last loop that held the bag he shouted in a loud voice of alarm  hallo  billy catch hold of this rope quick  billy turned like a flash of light and seized the rope held out to him the momentary distraction was enough  before he could understand the joke the bottom of the bag opened the tonandahalf more or less of fish burst forth spread itself over the deck like an avalanche swept billy off his little legs and almost overwhelmed him to the immense delight of spivin who impudently bent down and offered to help him to rise  come here billy and ill help you up he said kindly as the tail of a skate flipped across the boys nose and almost slid into his mouth  billy made no reply but clearing himself of fish jumped up seized a gaping cod by the gills and sent it all alive and kicking straight into spivins face  the aim was true  the man was blinded for a few moments by the fish and his mates were wellnigh choked with laughter  come comeno skylarking growled the skipper  play when your work is done boys  thus reproved the crew began to clear away the mass of weeds and refuse after which all hands prepared the trawl to be ready for going down again and then they set to work to clean and sort the fish  this was comparatively easy work at that season of the year but when winter gales and winter frosts sweep over the north sea only those who suffer it know what it is to stand on the slimy pitching deck with naked and benumbed hands disembowelling fish and packing them in small oblong boxes called trunks for the london market  and little do londoners think perhaps when eating their turbot sole plaice cod haddock whiting or other fish by what severe nightwork amid bitter cold and too often tremendous risks the food has been provided for them  it is not however our purpose to moralise just now though we might do so with great propriety but to tell our story on which some of the seemingly trifling incidents of that night had a special bearing  one of those incidents was the cutting of a finger  ned spivin whose tendency towards fun and frolic at all times rendered him rather slapdash and careless was engaged in the rather ignoble work of cutting off skates tailsthese appendages not being deemed marketable this operation he performed with a hatchet but some one borrowed the hatchet for a few minutes and spivin continued the operation with his knife  one of the tails being tough and the knife blunt the impatient man used violence  impatience and violence not unfrequently result in damage  the tail gave way unexpectedly and spivin cut a deep gash in his left hand  cuts gashes and bruises are the frequent experience of smacksmen  spivin bound up the gash with a handkerchief and went on with his work  before their work was quite done however a gale which had been threatening from the norwest set in with considerable force and rapidly increased so that the packing of the last few trunks and stowing them into the hold became a matter not only of difficulty but of danger  by that time the sky had clouded over and the lantern in the rigging alone gave light  it will blow harder said trevor to billy as they stood under shelter of the weather bulwarks holding on to the shrouds  does it never come into your mind to think where we would all go to if the evening star went down  no luke  i cant say as it does  somehow i never think of fathers smack goin down  and yet returned luke in a meditative tone it may happen you know any night  its not six months since the raven went down with all hands though she was as tight a craft as any in the fleet and her captain was a firstrate seaman besides bein steady  ay but then you see said billy she was took by three heavy seas one arter the other and no vessel you know could stand that  no not even the evening star if she was took that fashion an we never know when its goin to happen  i suspect billy that the psalmsingers as gunter calls em has the best of it  they work as well as any men in the fleetsometimes i think betteran then theyre always in such a jolly state o mind  if good luck comes they praise god for it an if bad luck comes they praise god that its no worse whatever turns up they appear to be in a thankful state o mind and that seems to me a deal better than growlin swearin and grumblin as so many of us do at what we cant change  what dee think billy  well to tell ee the truth luke i dont think about it at all anyhow ive never thought about it till tonight  but its worth thinkin about billy  thats true returned the boy who was of a naturally straightforward disposition and never feared to express his opinions freely  just then a sea rose on the weather quarter threatening apparently to fall inboard  so many waves had done the same thing before that no one seemed to regard it much but the experienced eye of the skipper noticed a difference and he had barely time to give a warning shout when the wave rushed over the side like a mighty river and swept the deck from stem to stern  many loose articles were swept away and lost and the boat which lay on the deck alongside of the mast had a narrow escape billy and his friend luke being well under the lee of the bulwarks escaped the full force of the deluge but ned spivin who steered was all but torn from his position though he clung with all his strength to the tiller and the rope that held it fast  the skipper was under the partial shelter of the mizzenmast and clung to the belayingpins  john gunter was the only one who came to grief  he was dashed with great violence to leeward but held on to the shrouds for his life  the mate was below at the moment and so was zulu whose howl coming from the cabin coupled with a hiss of water in the fire told that he had suffered from the shock  the immense body of water that filled the mainsail threw the vessel for a short time nearly on her beamendsa position that may be better understood when we say that it converts one of the sides of the vessel into the floor the other side into the ceiling and the floor and deck respectively into upright walls  fortunately the little smack got rid of the water in a few seconds arose slowly and appeared to shake herself like a duck rising out of the sea  sail had already been reduced to the utmost nevertheless the wind was so strong that for three hours afterwards the crew never caught sight of the leebulwarks so buried were they in foam as the evening star leaned over and rushed madly on her course  towards morning the wind moderated a little and then the crew gazed anxiously around on the heaving grey waves for well did they know that such a squall could not pass over the north sea without claiming its victims  it blowed that ard at one time said ned spivin to joe davidson that i expected to see the mainmast tore out of er  im afeard for the rainbow said joe  shes nothin better than a old bunch o boards  sometimes them old things hold out longer than we expect returned ned  he was right  when the losses of that night came to be reckoned up several good vessels were discovered to be missing but the rotten old rainbow still remained undestroyed though not unscathed and a sad sight met the eyes of the men of the fleet when daylight revealed the fact that some of the smacks had their flags flying halfmast indicating that many men had been washed overboard and lost during the night  as the day advanced the weather improved and the fishermen began to look anxiously out for the steamer which was to convey their fish to market but none was to be seen  although a number of steamers run between billingsgate and the short blue fleet it sometimes happens that they do not manage to find the fleet at once and occasionally a day or more is lost in searching for itto the damage of the fish if the weather be warm  it seemed as if a delay of this kind had happened on the occasion of which we write the admiral therefore signalled to let down the nets for a day haul  while this was being done a vessel was seen to join the fleet from the westward  thats singin peter said david bright to his mate  id know his rig at any distance  so it is  praps hes got letters for us  singing peter was one of the many fishermen who had been brought to a knowledge of jesus christ and saved from his sins  wild and careless before conversion he afterwards became an enthusiastic follower of the lamb of god and was so fond of singing hymns in his praise that he became known in the fleet by the sobriquet of singing peter  his beaming face and wholly changed life bore testimony to what the holy spirit had wrought in him  peter had been home to gorleston on his week of holiday and had now returned to the fleet for his eight weeks fishingcruise carrying a flag to show that he had just arrived bringing letters and clothes etcetera for some of the crews  i used to think peter warnt a bad feller said david bright as the new arrival drew near he was always good company an ready for his glass but now hes taken to singin psalms i can make nothin of im  theres them in the fleet that like him better since he took to that said luke trevor  it may be so lad but thats not accordin to my taste retorted the skipper  david was however by no means a surly fellow  when peters vessel came within hail he held up his hand and shouted  what cheer what cheer peter as heartily as possible  singing peter held up his hand in reply and waved it as he shouted back  what cheer  all well praise the lord  dye hear that billy said luke in a low voice  he never forgets to praise the lord  when the vessels drew nearer peter again waved his hand and shouted  ive got letters for ee  all right my hearty  ill send for em  in less than five minutes the boat of the evening star was launched over the side sternforemost and she had scarce got fairly afloat on the dancing waves when joe and luke swarmed into her had the oars out and were sweeping off so as to intercept peters vessel they soon reached her received a packet wrapped up in a bit of newspaper and quickly returned  the packet contained two lettersone for the skipper the other for the matefrom their respective wives  joe said the skipper when he had perused his letter come down below  i want to speak to ee  thats just what i was goin to say to yourself for the letter from my missis says somethin that consarns you  when master and mate were alone together in the cabin each read to the other his letter  my missis said the skipper unfolding his letter and regarding it with a puzzled expression although shes had a pretty good edication has paid little attention to her pothooksbut this is how it runs pretty near  dear old man shes always been an affectionate woman joe though i do treat her badly when im in liquor i hope you are having a good time of it and that darling billy likes the sea and is a good boy  my reason for writing just now is to tell you about that dear sweet creature miss ruth dotropy  she has been down at yarmouth again on a visit and of course she has been over to see me and mrs davidson in such a lovely blue ah well joe theres no need to read you that bit its all about dressas if dress could make miss ruth better or worse  but womens minds will run on ribbons an suchlike  well after yawin about for a bit she comes back to the pint an steers a straight course again  she goes on after a blot or two that i cant make nothin of youll be surprised to hear david that shes been making some particular inquiries about you and me which i dont understand at all and looking as if she knew a deal more than she cared to tell  shes been asking mrs davidson too about it and what puzzles me most is theres another aggrawatin blot here joe so that i cant make out what puzzles her  look here  can you spell it out  joe tried but shook his head  its a puzzler to her he said an shes took good care to make it a puzzler to everybody else but go on  theres nothin else to go on wi joe for after steerin past the blot she runs foul o miss ruths dress again and the only thing worth mentionin is a postscript where she says i think theres something wrong dear david and i wish you was here  thats all  now that is strange for my missis writes about the wery same thing said joe only she seems to have gone in for a little more confusion an blots than your missis an that blessed little babby of ours is always gittin in the way so she cant help runnin foul of it but that same puzzler crops up every now an then  see heres what she writes  darlin joe a touch more affectionate than yourseh skipper if our dear darlin babby will let me im agoin to write you a letter there i knowd she wouldnt  shes bin and capsized the washtub though as you know she cant walk yet but she rolls about most awful joe just what you say the evening star does in a gale on the north sea  an shes got most dreadful heelsoh youve no idear  whativer they comes down upon goes theres a big blot here said joe with a puzzled look goeswhativer they comes down upon goes no i cant make it out  goes to sticks an stivers praps said the skipper  no my maggie never uses words like that said joe with decision  goes all to smash then suggested the skipper  no nor it aint that my maggies too softtongued for that  well you know things must go somewhere or somehow joe when such a pair o heels comes down on embut steer clear o the blot and the babby an see what comes next  well continued joe reading on i was goin to tell you when babby made that last smash i told you it was a smash said david softly that dear miss ruth has bin worritin herselfif babby would only keep quiet for two minutesworritin herself about mrs bright in a way that none of us can understand  shes anxious to make inquiries about her and her affairs in a secret sort o way but the dear young lady is so honesttheres babby again  now ive got her all right it was the milkcan this time but there warnt much in it an the cats got the benefit  well darlin joe where was ioh the dear young ladys so honest an straitforard that even a child could see through her though none of us can make out what shes drivin at yesterday she went to see mrs bright an took a liar with her  hallo  joe surely shed niver do that said the skipper in a remonstrative tone  she means a lawyer returned joe apologetically but maggie niver could spell that word though ive often tried to teach ermaggie says i you mustnt write liar but lawyer  la yer jokin says she  no says i im not thats the way to spell it an as maggies a biddable lass she got to do it all right but her memory aint over strong so you see shes got back to the old story  howsever she dont really mean it you know  just so returned the skipper heave ahead wi the letter joe  knitting his brows and applying himself to the muchsoiled and crumpled sheet the mate continued to read  an the liar he puzzled her with all sorts o questions just as if he was a schoolmaster and she a schoolgirl  he bothered her to that extent she began to lose temper he better take care muttered the skipper chuckling but miss ruth she sees that an putt a stop to it in her own sweet way lucky for the liar muttered the skipper an so they went away without explainin  weve all had a great talk over it an were most of us inclined to thinkoh that babby shes bin an rammed her darlin futt into the tarbucket but it aint much the worse though its cost about halfapound o butter to take it off an that aint a joke wi butter at 1 shilling 4 pence a pound an times so badwell as i was goin to say if that blessed babby would only let me were all inclined to think it must have somethin to do wi that man as david owes money to who said last year that hed sell his smack an turn him an his family out o house an home if he didnt pay up though what miss ruth has to do wi that or how she come for to know it we cant make out at all  the blackguard growled the skipper fiercely referring to that man if i only had his long nose within three futt o my fist id let him feel what my knuckles is made of  steamer in sight father sang out billy at that moment down the companionhatch  the conference being thus abruptly terminated the skipper and mate of the evening star went on deck to give orders for the immediate hauling up of the trawl and to have a squint at the steamer which was seen at that moment like a little cloud on the horizon    chapter eight  dangers difficulties and excitements of the traffic loading the steamer  bustling activity of the most vigorous kind was now the order of the day in the short blue fleet for the arrival of the carryingsteamer and the fact that she was making towards the admiral indicated that she meant to return to london in a few hours and necessitated the hauling of the trawls cleaning the fish and packing them getting up the trunks that had been packed during the night launching the boats and transshipping them in spite of the yet heavy sea  as every one may understand such perishable food as fish must be conveyed to market with the utmost possible despatch  this is accomplished by the constant running of fast steamers between the fleets and the thames  the fish when put on board are further preserved by means of ice and no delay is permitted in transshipment  as we have said the steamers are bound to make straight for the admirals smack knowing this the other vessels keep as near to the admiral as they conveniently can so that when the steamer is preparing to return they may be ready to rush at her like a fleet of nautical locusts and put their fish on board  hot haste and cool precision mark the action of the fishermen in all that is done for they know well that only a limited time will be allowed them and if any careless or wilful stragglers from the fleet come up when the time is nearly past they stand a chance of seeing the carrier steam off without their fish which are thus left to be shipped the following day and to be sold at last as an inferior article or perhaps condemned and thrown away as unfit for human food  the evening star chanced to be not far from the admiral when the steamer appeared  it was one of the fleet of steamcarriers owned by the wellknown fish firm of messrs hewett and company of london  when it passed david brights smack the crew had got in the trawl and were cleaning and packing the catchwhich was a good oneas if their very lives depended on their speed  they immediately followed in the wake of the carrier toward the admiral  as all the smacks were heading towards the same centre they came in on every tack and from all points of the compass  look sharp boys said david bright who was steering we must git every fish aboard  its now eight oclock an she wont wait beyond eleven or twelve you may be sure  there was no need for the caution  every man and boy was already doing his utmost  it fell to billys lot to help in packing the trunks and deftly he did itkeeping soles turbot and halibut separate to form boxes or trunks of prime and packing other fish as much as possible according to their kind until he came to roker dabs gurnets etcetera which he packed together under the name of offal  this does not mean refuse but only inferior fish which are bought by hawkers and sold to the poor  the trunks were partly open on top but secured by cords which kept the fish from slipping out and each trunk was labelled with the name of the smack to which it belonged and the party to whom it was consigned  as the fleet converged to the centre the vessels began to crowd together and friends to recognise and hail each other so that the scene became very animated while the risk of collision was considerable indeed it was only by consummate skill judgment and coolness that in many cases collisions were avoided  theres the sparrow said billy to trevor eagerly as he pointed to a smack whose master jim frost he knew and was fond of  it bore down in such a direction as to pass close under the stern of the evening star  what cheer what cheer cried billy holding one of his little hands high above his head  what cheer came back in strong hearty tones from the sparrows deck  what luck jim asked david bright as the vessel flew past  we fouled an old wreck this mornin an tore the net all to pieces but we got a good haul last nightpraise the lord  which piece o luck dye praise the lord for demanded david in a scoffing tone  for both shouted frost promptly  it might have bin worse  we might have lost the gear you knowor one o the hands  when this reply was finished the vessels were too far apart for further intercourse  humph ejaculated gunter one o the psalmsingin lot i suppose  if its the psalmsingin said spivin as makes jim frost bear his troubles wi good temper an thank god for foul weather an fair the sooner you take to it the better for yourself  ay an for his mates added zulu with a broad grin  shove out the boat now lads said the skipper  at this order the capacious and rather clumsy boat which had hitherto lain on the deck of the evening star like a ponderous fixture was seized by the crew  a vigorous pull at a block and tackle sent it up on the side of the smack  a still more vigorous shove by the mensome with backs applied some with arms and all with a willsent it sternforemost into the sea  it took in a few gallons of water by the plunge but was none the worse for that  at the same moment zulu literally tumbled into it  no stepping or jumping into it was possible with the sea that was running  indeed the fishermen of the north sea are acrobats by necessity and their tumbling is quite as wonderful though not quite so neat as that of professionals  perchance if the arena in which the latter perform were to pitch about as heavily as the evening star did on that occasion they might be beaten at their own work by the fishermen  zulu was followed by ned spivin while gunter taking a quick turn of the long and strong painter round a belayingpin held on  the evening star was now lyingto not far from the steamcarrier her boat danced on the waves like a cork pitching heavily from side to side with now the stern and now the bow pointing to the sky at one moment leaping with its gunwale above the level of the smacks bulwarks at the next moment eight or ten feet down in the trough of the waves never at rest for an instant always tugging madly at its tether and often surging against the vessels side from actual contact with which it was protected by strong rope fenders  but indeed the boats great strength of build seemed its best guarantee against damage  to one unaccustomed to such work it might have seemed utterly impossible to put anything whatever on board of such a pitching boat  tying a mulepack on the back of a bouncing wild horse may suggest an equivalent difficulty to a landsman  nevertheless the crew of the evening star did it with as much quiet determination and almost as much speed as if there was no sea on at all  billy and trevor slid the trunks to the vessels side the mate and gunter lifted them rested them a moment on the edge zulu and spivin stood in the surging boat with outstretched arms and glaring eyes  a mighty swing of the boat suggested that the little craft meant to run the big one down  they closed two trunks were grappled let go deposited and before the next wave swung them alongside again spivin and zulu were glaring upready for morewhile joe and gunter were gazing downready to deliver  when the boat was loaded the painter was cast off and she dropped astern  the oars were shipped and they made for the steamer  from the low deck of the smack they could be seen now pictured against the sky on a waves crest and then lost to view altogether for a few seconds in the watery valley beyond  by that time quite a crowd of little boats had reached the steamer and were holding on to her while their respective smacks layto close by or sailed slowly round the carrier so that recognitions salutations and friendly chaff were going on all roundthe confusion of masts and sails and voices ever increasing as the outlying portions of the fleet came scudding in to the rendezvous  there goes the boy jim said luke trevor pointing towards a smart craft that was going swiftly past them  whos the boy jim growled gunter whose temper at no time a good one had been much damaged by the blows he had received in the fall of the previous night  hes nobodyits the name o that smack answered luke  an her master john johnston is one o my best friends said billy raising his fist on high in salutation  what cheer john what cheer my hearty  the master of the boy jim was seen to raise his hand in reply to the salutation and his voice came strong and cheerily over the sea but he was too far off to be heard distinctly so billy raised his hand again by way of saying all right my boy  at the same time a hail was heard at the other side of the vessel  the crew turned round and crossed the deck  its our namesakeor nearly sothe morning star said trevor to gunter for the latter being a new hand knew little of the names of either smacks or masters  is her skipper a friend o yours too asked gunter of billy  yes bowers is a friend o minean a firstrate fellow too which is more than you will ever be retorted billy again stretching up the ready arm and hand  what cheer joseph what cheer  what cheer  billywhy i didnt know you youve growd so much shouted the master of the morning star whose middlesized but broad and powerful frame was surmounted by a massive countenance with good humour in the twinkling eyes and kindly chaff often in the goodlysized mouth  yes ive growd retorted billy an i mean to go on growin till im big enough to wallop you  your cheek has been growin too billy  so it has but nothin like to your jaw joseph  what luck shouted david as the morning star was passing on  fifteen trunks  what have you got  the skipper held up his hand to acknowledge the information and shouted nineteen in reply  you seem to have a lot o friends among the skippers billy said gunter with a sneer for he was fond of teasing the boy who to do him justice could take chaff well except when thrown at him by illnatured fellows  yes i have a good lot retorted billy  i met em all first in yarmouth when ashore for their weeks holiday  theres joseph white master of the mission smack cholmondeley a splendid feller he is an bogers of the cephas an snell of the ruth an kiddell of the celerity an moore of the maa an roberts of the magnet an goodchild and brown an a lot more all firstrate fellers whose little fingers are worth the whole o your big body  well well what a lucky fellow you are said gunter with affected surprise an have you no bad fellers at all among your acquaintance  oh yes returned the boy quickly i knows a good lot o them too theres dick the swab of the white cloud who drinks like a fish an pimply brock who could swear you out o your oiled frock in five minutes an a lot of others more or less wicked but not one of em so bad as a big ugly feller i knows named john gunter who  billy was interrupted by gunter making a rush at him but the boy was too nimble for the man besides which gunters bruises to which we have before referred were too painful to be trifled with  soon afterwards the boat returned for another cargo of trunks and the crew of the evening star went to work again  meanwhile the power of littles began to tell on the capacious hold of the steamer  let us go on board of her for a few minutes and mount the bridge  the fleet had now closed in and swarmed around her so thickly that it seemed a miracle that the vessels did not come into collision from the smacks boat after boat had run alongside and made fast until an absolute flotilla was formed on either side  as each boat came up it thrust itself into the mass the man who had pulled the bowoar taking the end of the long painter in his hand ready for a leap  some boats crews having transshipped their trunks were backing out others were in the midst of that arduous and even dangerous operation while still more came pouring in seeking a place of entrance through the heaving mass  the boat of the evening star was ere long among the latter with her second loadzulu grinning in the bow and spivin in the stern  zulu was of that cheery temperament that cannot help grinning  if he had been suddenly called on to face death himself we believe he would have met him with a grin  and truly we may say without jesting that zulu had often so faced the king of terrors for it is a sad fact that many a bold and brave young fellow meets his death in this operation of transshipping the fisha fall overboard is so very easy and hampered as these men are with huge seaboots and heavy garments it too often happens that when they chance to fall into the sea they go down like a stone  they never seem to think of that however  certainly zulu did not as he crouched there with glittering eyes and glistening teeth like a dark tiger ready for a spring  there was strict discipline but not much interference with the work on board the steamer  no boat was permitted to put its trunks aboard abaft a certain part of the vessel but in front of that the fishermen were left to do the work as best they could  they were not however assistednot even to the extent of fastening their paintersthe crew of the steamer being employed below in stowing and iceing the fish  when the evening stars boat therefore had forced itself alongside zulu found himself heaving against the steamers side now looking up at an iron wall about fifteen feet high anon pitching high on the billows till he could see right down on the deck  he watched his opportunity threw himself over the iron wall with the painter in one hand while spivin and the boat seemed to sink in the depths below rolled over on the deck scrambled to his feet made the painter fast to the foremast shrouds and ran to look over the side  spivin was there ready for him looking up with a trunk on the boats gunwale  next moment he was looking down for a wave had lifted the boats gunwale absolutely above the vessels bulwark for an instant  no words were needed  each knew what to do  zulu made a powerful grab spivin let go the trunk was on the steamers rail whence it was hurled to the deck narrowly missing the legs and toes of halfadozen reckless men who seized it and sent it below  almost before zulu could turn round spivin was up again with another trunk another wild grab was made but not successfully and spivin sank to rise again  a second effort proved successfuland thus they went on now and then missing the mark but more frequently hitting it until the boat was empty  you have only to multiply this little scene by forty or fifty and you have an idea of the loading of that steamer on the high seas  of course you must diversify the picture a little for in one place you have a man hanging over the side with a trunk in midair barely caught when in its descent and almost too heavy for him by reason of his position  in another place you have a man glaring up at a trunk in another glaring downin all cases action the most violent and most diversified coupled with cool contempt of crushed fingers and bruised shins and toes  at last the furore began to subside  by degrees the latest boats arrived and in about three hours from the time of commencing the crew of the steamer began to batten down the hatches  just then like the late passenger the late trawler came up  the captain of the steamer had seen it long before on the horizon doing its best to save the market and goodnaturedly delayed a little to take its fish on board but another smack that came up a quarter of an hour or so after that found the hatches closed and heard the crushing reply to his hailtoo late  then the carryingsteamer turned her sharp bow to the souwest put on full steam and made for the thamesdistant nearly 300 mileswith over 2000 trunks of fresh fish on board for the breakfast luncheon and dinner tables of the great city  thus if the steamer were to leave early on a monday it would arrive on tuesday night and the fish be sold in the market on wednesday morning about five oclock  with little variation this scene is enacted every day all the year round on the north sea  it may not be uninteresting to add that on the arrival of the steamer at billingsgate the whole of her cargo would probably be landed and sold in less than one hour and a half    chapter nine  another dragnet hauledthe mission smack  when the steamer left the fleet the wind was beginning to moderate and all eyes were turned as usual towards the admirals smack to observe his movements  the fishing vessels were still crowded together running to and fro out and in without definite purpose plunging over the heaving swellssome of them visible on the crests others half hidden in the hollowsand behaving generally like living creatures that were impatiently awaiting the signal to begin a race  while in this position two smacks came so near to the evening star on opposite sides that they seemed bent on running her down  david bright did not concern himself however  he knew they were well able to take care of themselves  they both sheered off to avoid him but after doing so ran rather near to each other  one o them blongs to the swab said billy  ay said joe if he hadnt swabbed up too much liquor this morning he wouldnt steer like that  why he will foul her  as he spoke the swabs bowsprit passed just inside one of the ropes of the other vessel and was snapped off as if it had been a pipestem  sarves him right growled gunter  its a pity all the same said trevor  if we all got what we deserve wed be in a worse case than we are today mayhap  come now gunter said joe dont look so cross  well have a chance this arternoon i see to bear away for the missionship an git somethin for your shins and a bandage for spivins cut as well as some cuffs for them that wants em  captain bright did not like visiting the missionship having no sympathy with her work but as she happened to be not far distant at the time and he was in want of surgical assistance he had no reasonable ground for objecting  by this time the admiral had signalled to steer to the noreast and the fleet was soon racing to windward all on the same tack  gradually the evening star overhauled the missionship but before she had quite overtaken her the wind which had been failing fell to a dead calm the distance between the two vessels however not being great the boat was launched and the skipper luke trevor gunter and billy went off in her  the mission vessel to which reference has more than once been made is a fishingsmack in the service of the mission to deepsea fishermen and serves the purpose of a floating church a dispensary a temperance halt and a library to a portion of the north sea fleet  it fills a peculiar as well as a very important position which requires explanation  only a few years ago a visitor to the north sea fleet observed with much concern that hundreds of the men and boys who manned it were living godless as well as toilsome lives with no oneat least in winterto care for their souls  at the same time he noted that the dutch copers or floating grogshops were regularly appointed to supply the fleets with cheap and bad spirits and stuck to them through fairweather and foul in summer and winter enduring hardship and encountering danger and great risk in pursuit of their evil calling  up to that time a few lay missionaries and biblereaders had occasionally gone to visit the fleets in the summertime see appendix but the visitor of whom we write felt that there was a screw loose here and reasoned with himself somewhat thus  shall the devil have his missionships whose crews are not afraid to face the winter gales and shall the servants of the lord be mere fairweather christians carrying their blessed and allimportant message of love and peace to these hardworking and almost forsaken men only during a summertrip to the north sea  if fish must be caught and the lives of fathers husbands brothers and sons be not only risked but lost for the purpose has not the master got men who are ready to say the glorious gospel must be carried to these men and we will hoist our flag on the north sea summer and winter so as to be a constant witness there for our god and his christ  for thirty years before it has been said a very few earnest christians among the fishermen of the fleet had been praying that some such thoughts might be put into the hearts of men who had the power to render help  we venture to observe in passing that perchance those praying fishermen were not so few as appearances might lead us to suppose for god has his hidden ones everywhere and some of these may have been at the throne of grace long prior to the thirty years here mentioned  let not the reader object to turn aside a few minutes to consider how greatly help was neededfortysix weeks or so on the sea in all weathers all the year round broken by a week at a timeor about six or seven weeks altogetheron shore with wife and family the rest hard unvarying toil and exposure with nothing to do during the brief intervals of leisurenothing to read nothing new to think of no church to raise the mind to the creator and distinguish the sabbath from the weekday and no social intercourse of a natural kind for a society of men only is not natural to elevate them above the lower animals and with only drinking and gambling left to degrade them below these creatures and this for forty or fifty years of their lives with in too many cases neither hope nor thought beyond  at last the fishermens prayers were answered the thoughts of the visitor bore fruit and convinced that he was being led by god he began to move in the matter with prayer and energy  the result was that in the year 1881 he received the unsolicited offer of a smack which should be at his entire disposal for mission purposes but should endeavour to sustain herself if possible by fishing like the rest of the fleet  the vessel was accepted  a christian skipper and fisherman named budd and a likeminded crew were put into her she was fitted out with an extra cabin with cupboards for a library and other conveniences  the hold was arranged with a view to being converted into a chapel on sundays and it was decided that in order to keep it clear on such days the trawl should not be let down on saturday nights a large medicinechestwhich was afterwards reported to be one of the greatest blessings in the fleetwas put on board the captain made a colporteur of the bible society agent for the shipwrecked mariners society and of the church of england temperance society  the religious tract society and various publishers made a grant of books to form the nucleus of a free lending library the national lifeboat institution presented an aneroid barometer and messrs hewett and company made a present of the insurance premium of 50 pounds  thus furnished and armed as aforesaid as a mission church temperance hall circulating library and dispensary the little craft one day sailed in amongst the smacks of the short blue fleet amid the boisterous greetings of the crews and took up her position under the name of the ensign with a great twentyfeet missionflag flying at the mainmasthead  this then was the style of vessel towards which the boat of the evening star was now being pulled over a superficially smooth but still heaving sea  the boat was not alone  other smacks the masters of which as well as some of the men were professed christians had availed themselves of the opportunity to visit the mission smack while not a few had come like the master of the evening star to procure medicine and books so that when david bright drew near he observed the deck to be pretty well crowded while a long tail of boats floated astern and more were seen coming over the waves to the rendezvous  it was no solemn meeting that  shoregoing folk who are too apt to connect religious gatherings with sunday clothes subdued voices and long faces would have had their ideas changed if they had seen it  men of the roughest cast mentally and physically were there in heavy boots and dirty garments laughing and chatting and greeting one another some of the younger among them skylarking in a mild waythat is giving an occasional poke in the ribs that would have been an average blow to a landlubber or a tip to a hat which sent it on the deck or a slap on the back like a pistolshot  there seemed to be no humbug as the saying goes among these men no pretence and all was kindly goodfellowship for those who were on the lords side showed itif need were said itwhile those who were not felt perhaps that they were in a minority and kept quiet  come along joe what cheer  here you are billhow goes it my hearty  all well praise the lord  ay hasnt he sent us fine weather at the right time just to let us have a comfortable meetin  thats so dick the master does all things well  what cheer  johnson im glad to see you here  the boy has got some cocoa forardhave some  thank ee i will  such were some of the expressions heartily uttered which flew about as friend met friend on the mission deck  i say harry cried one was it you that lost your bowsprit this mornin  no it was the swab said harry but we lost our net and all the gear last night  that was unfortnit remarked a friend in a tone of sympathy which attracted the attention of some of those who stood near  ah lads said the master of the missionship that was a small matter compared with the loss suffered by poor daniel rodger  did you hear of it  yes yes said some  no said another  i thought i saw his flag halfmast this mornin but was too fur off to make sure  most of the men crowded round the master of the smack while in deep sad tones he told how the son of daniel rodger had during the night been swept overboard by a heavy sea and drowned before the boat could be launched to rescue him  but continued the speaker in a cheerful voice the dear boy was a follower of jesus and he is now with him  when this was said praise the lord and thank god broke from several of the men in tones of unmistakable sincerity  it was at this point that the boat of the evening star ranged alongside  the master of the mission smack went to the side and held out his hand which david bright grasped with his right grappling the smacks rail at the same time with his left and vaulted inboard with a hearty salutation  as heartily was it returned especially by the unbelievers on board who perchance regarded him as a welcome accession to their numbers  billy gunter and the others tumbled on to the deck in the usual indescribable manner and the former making fast the long painter added the evening stars boat to the lengthening flotilla astern  your man seems to be hurt said the master of the mission smackwhom we may well style the missionarynot badly i hope  youre limpin a bit  oh nothin to speak of growled gunter ony a bit o skin knocked off  well put that all right soon returned the missionary shaking hands with the other members of the crew  but praps youd like to go below with us first  were goin to hold a little service  itll be more comfortable under hatches than on deck  no thank ee replied gunter with decision  ill wait till yer done  praps you would like to come said the missionary to the captain  well ii may as well as not said david with some hesitation  come along then lads and the genial sailormissionary led the way to the capacious hold which had been swept clean and some dozens of fishboxes set up on end in rows  these besides being handy formed excellent seats to men who were not much used to armchairs  in a few seconds the little church on the ocean wilderness was nearly full of earnest thoughtful men for these fishermen were charmingly natural as well as enthusiastic  they did not assume solemn expressions but all thought of skylarking or levity seemed to have vanished as they entered the hold and earnestness almost necessarily involves gravity  with eager expectation they gazed at their leader while he gave out a hymn  youll find little books on the table here those of you who havent got em he said pointing to a little pile of redcovered booklets at his side  well sing the 272nd    sing them over again to me   wonderful words of life  really reader it is not easy to convey in words the effect of the singing of that congregation  nothing that we on land are accustomed to can compare with it  in the first place the volume of sound was tremendous for these men seemed to have been gifted with leathern lungs and brazen throats  many of the voices were tuneful as well as powerful  one or two indeed were little better than cracked teakettles but the good voices effectually drowned the cracked kettles  moreover there was deep enthusiasm in many of the hearts present and the hold was small  we leave the rest to the readers imagination but we are bound to say that it had a thrilling effect and they were sorry too when the hymn was finished  this was obvious for when one of the singers began the last verse over again the others joined him with alacrity and sang it straight through  even gunter and those likeminded men who had remained on deck were moved by the fervour of the singing  then the sailormissionary offered a prayer as simple as it was straightforward and short after which a chapter was read and another hymn sung  then came the discourse founded on the words whosoever will  there you have it ladsclear as the sun at noondayfree as the rolling sea  the worst drunkard and swearer in the short blue comes under that whosoeveray the worst man in the world for jesus is able and willing to save to the uttermost  praise god ejaculated one of the earnest listeners fervently  but fear not reader we have no intention of treating you to a seminautical sermon  whether you be christian or not our desire is simply to paint for you a true picture of life on the north sea as we have seen it and as it were unwise to omit the deepest shadows from a picture so would it be inexcusable to leave out the highest lights even although you should fail to recognise them as such  the discourse was not long but the earnestness of the preacher was very real  the effect on his audience was varied  most of them sympathised deeply and seemed to listen as much with eyes as ears  a few who had not come there for religious purposes wore somewhat cynical even scornful expressions at first but these were partially subdued by the manner of the speaker as he reasoned of spiritual things and the world to come  on deck gunter and those who had stayed with him became curious to know what the preachin skipper was saying and drew near to the forehatch up which the tones of his strong voice travelled  gradually they bent their heads down and lay at fulllength on the deck listening intently to every word  they noted also the frequent ejaculations of assent and the aspirations of hope that escaped from the audience  not one but two or three hymns were sung after the discourse was over and one after another of the fishermen prayed  they were very loath to break up but a breeze having arisen it became necessary that they should depart so they came on deck at last and an animated scene of receiving and exchanging books magazines tracts and pamphlets ensued then also gunter got some salve for his shins ned spivin had his cut hand dressed and plastered  cuffs were supplied to those whose wrists had been damaged and gratuitous advice was given generally to all to give up drink  an dont let the moderate drinkers deceive you lads said the skipper as theyre apt to doan no wonder for they deceive themselves  moderate drinkin may be good for all i know for old folk an sick folk but its not good for young and healthy men  they dont need stimulants an if they take what they dont need theyre sure to suffer for it  theres a terrible line in drinkin an if you once cross that line your case is all but hopeless  i once knew a man who crossed it and when that man began to drink he used to say that he did it in moderation an he went on in moderation an the evil was so slow in workin that he never yet knew when he crossed the line an he died at last of what he called moderate drinkin  they all begin in moderation but some of em go on to the ruin of body soul an spirit rather than give up their moderation  come now lads i want one or two o you young fellows to sign the temperance pledge  it cant cost you much to do it just now but if you grow up drinkers you may reach a pointi dont know where that point liesto come back from which will cost you something like the tearing of your souls out o your bodies  youll come wont you  yes ill go said a bright young fisherman with a frame like hercules and a face almost as soft as that of a girl  thats right  come down  and ive brought two o my boys said a burly man with a castiron sort of face who had been himself an abstainer for many years  while the master of the mission smack was producing the materials for signing the pledge in the cabin he took occasion to explain that the signing was only a help towards the great end of temperance that nothing but conversion to god and constant trust in the living saviour could make man or woman safe  its not hard to understand he said looking the youths earnestly in the eyes  see here suppose an unbeliever determines to get the better of his besettin sin  hes man enough to strive well for a time  at last he begins to grow a little weary o the battleit is so awful hard  better almost to die an be done with it he sometimes thinks then comes a day when his temptation is ten times more than he is able to bear  he throws up the sponge he has done his best an failed so away he goes like the sow that was washed to his wallowing in the mire but he has not done his best  he has not gone to his maker an surely the maker of a machine is the best judge o how to mend it  now when a believer in jesus comes to the same point o temptation he falls on his knees an cries for help an he gets it too for faithful is he that has promised to help those who call upon him in trouble  many a man has fallen on his knees as weak as a baby and risen up as strong as a giant  here said a voice close to the speakers elbow here hand me the pen an ill sign the pledge  what you billy bright said the missionary smiling at the precocious manliness of the little fellow  does your father want you to do it  oh you never mind what my father wants  he leaves me pretty much to do as i pleaseexcept smoke and as he wont let me do that  i mean to spite him by refusin to drink when he wants me to  but im afraid billy returned the missionary laughing that thats not quite the spirit in which to sign the pledge  did i say it was old boy retorted billy seizing the pen dabbing it into the ink and signing his name in a wild straggling sort of way ending with a huge round blot  there thatll do instead of a full stop he said thrusting his little hands into his pockets as he swaggered out of the cabin and went on deck  hell make a rare good man or an awful bad un that said the missionary skipper casting a kindly look after the boy  soon afterwards the boats left the mission smack and her crew began to bustle about making preparation to let down the gear whenever the admiral should give the signal  we carry two sorts of trawlnets andrew said the captain to his mate who was likeminded in all respects and i think we have caught some men today with one of empraise the lord  yes praise the lord said the mate and apparently deeming this as it was a sufficient reply he went about his work in silence  the breeze freshened  the shades of night gathered the admiral gave his signal the nets were shot and the short blue fleet sailed away into the deepening darkness of the wild north sea  note  since that day additional vessels have been attached to the missionfleet which now 1886 consists of five smacksand will probably ere long number many moreall earning their own maintenance while serving the mission cause  but these do by no means meet the requirements of the various north sea fleets  there are still in those fleets thousands of men and boys who derive no benefit from the mission vessels already sent out because they belong to fleets to which missionships have not yet been attached and it is the earnest prayer of those engaged in the good work that liberalminded christians may send funds to enable them not only to carry on but to extend their operations in this interesting field of labour    chapter ten  a strong contrasta victim of the coper  birds of a feather flock together undoubtedlyat sea as well as on land  as surely as johnston and moore and jim frost and such men hung about the missionshipready to go aboard and to have a little meeting when suitable calms occurred so surely did david bright the swab and other likeminded men find themselves in the neighbourhood of the coper when there was nothing to be done in the way of fishing  two days after the events narrated in the last chapter the swabwhose proper name was dick herring and who sailed his own smack the white cloudfound himself in the neighbourhood of the floating grogshop  get out the boat brock said herring to his matewho has already been introduced to the reader as pimply brock and whose nose rendered any explanation of that name unnecessary take some fish an get as much as you can for em  the swab did not name what his mate was to procure in barter with the fish neither did brock ask  it was an oldestablished order well understood  soon brock and two hands were on their way to the floating poisonshop as one of the men had named it  he was affectionately received there and ere long returned to the white cloud with a supply of firewater  youre good at a bargain brock said his master with an approving nod tossing off a glass of the demon that held him as if in chains of steelchains that no man could break  i wish he added looking round on the sea wistfully that some of our friends would come to join us in a spree  so do i said brock slightly inflaming his nasal pimples by pouring a glass of spirits down his throat  there must be some strange subtle sympathy between drunkards for at the very time these two men expressed their wish the master of the evening star said to gunter get out the boat  ill go cruisin  it must not be supposed that by this he meant to declare his intention of going off on a lengthened voyage in his little boat  david bright only meant that having observed through his telescope the little transaction between the white cloud and the coper his intention was to pay that vessel a visitto go carousing or as the north sea smacksmen have it cruisin  gunter obeyed the order with satisfaction and alacrity  jump in spivin and you come too billy  i say father said the boy in a low voice are ye goin to drink wi the swab after what ye heard aboard the mission smack  you clap a stopper on your jaw an obey orders replied the skipper angrily  although full of lighthearted insolence which his mates called cheek billy was by no means a rebellious boy  he knew from sad experience that when his father made up his mind to go in for a drinkingbout the consequences were often deplorable and fain would he have dissuaded him but he also knew that to persist in opposing him would only make matters worse and probably bring severe chastisement on himself  with an air of quiet gravity therefore that seemed very unnatural to him he leaped into the boat and took an oar  what cheer david said the swab offering his rugged hand when the former jumped on the deck of the white cloud  i thought youd come  you was right dick returned david shaking the proffered hand  come below an wet your whistle  bring your men too said dick this is a new hand pointing to ned  ay hes noo is ned spivin but he can drink  come down then all of ee  now ned spivin was one of those yielding goodnatured youths who find it impossible to resist what may be styled goodfellowship  if you had tried to force ned spivin to order him or to frighten him into any course he would have laughed in your face and fought you if necessary but if you tempted ned to do evil by kindly tones and looks he was powerless to resist  youre right skipper i can drinksometimes  they all went below leaving billy on deck to look after the boat as his father said though being made fast the boat required no looking after  immediately the party in the little cabin had a glass round  ere long it occurred to them that they might have another glass  of course they did not require to be reminded of their pipes and as nearly all the crew was in the little cabin besides the visitors the fumes from pipes and glasses soon brought the atmosphere to a condition that would have failed to support any but the strongest kind of human life  it supported these men well enough however for they soon began to use their tongues and brains in a manner that might have surprised a dispassionate observer  it is perhaps needless to say that they interlarded their conversation with fearful oaths to which of course we can do no more than make passing reference  by degrees the conversation degenerated into disputation for it is the manner of some men when in liquor to become intensely pugnacious as well as owlishly philosophical  the subjectmatter of dispute may be varied but the result is nearly always the samea series of amazing convolutions of the brain which is supposed to be profound reasoning waxing hotter and hotter as the utterances grow thicker and thicker and the tones louder and louder until the culminating point is reached when the point which could not be proved by the mind is hammered home with the fist  to little billy who had been left in sole charge of the deck and whose little mind had been strangely impressed on board the missionship the words and sounds to say nothing of the fumes which proceeded from the cabin furnished much food for meditation  the babel of tongues soon became incessant for three if not four or five of the speakers had become so impressed with the importance of their opinions and so anxious to give their mates the benefit that they all spoke at once this of course necessitated much loud talking and gesticulation by all of them which greatly helped no doubt to make their meaning clear at least it did not render it less clear  as the din and riot increased so did the tendency to add fuel to the fire by deeper drinking which resulted in fiercer quarrelling  at last one of the contending voices shouted so loud that the others for a few moments gave way and the words became audible to the little listener on deck  the voice belonged to gunter  you said he shouted fiercely that i  no i didnt retorted brock breaking in with a rather premature contradiction  hear him out  nnothin like fair play in arargiment said an extremely drunken voice  right you are cried another fire away gunter  you said resumed gunter with a little more of argument in his tone though still vehemently that i saidthatthatwell whativer it was i said ill take my davy that i niver said anything o the sort  thats a lie cried brock  youre another shouted gunter and waved his hand contemptuously  whether it was accident or design we know not but gunters hand knocked the pipe out of brooks mouth  to billys ear the wellknown sound of a blow followed and he ran to look down into the cabin where all was instantly in an uproar  choke him off cried david bright  knock his brains out suggested herring  billy could not see well through the dense smoke but apparently the more humane advice was followed for after a good deal of gasping a heavy body was flung upon the floor  all right shove him into a bunk cried the swab  at the same moment ned spivin sprang on deck and stretching himself with his arms extended upwards drew a long breath of fresh air  there billy he said ive had enough of it  of grog dye mean asked the boy  no but of the helluponearth down there replied the young man  well ned i should just think you have had enough o that said billy an of grog toothough you dont seem much screwed after all  im not screwed at all billynot even halfseasover  its more the smoke an fumes that have choked me than the grog  come lad lets go forard an git as far from it as we can  the man and boy went to the bow of the vessel and seated themselves near the heel of the bowsprit where the sounds from the cabin reached them only as a faint murmur and did not disturb the stillness of the night  and a day of quiet splendour it certainly wasthe sea as calm as glass insomuch that it reflected all the fleecy clouds that hung in the bright sky  even the oceanswell had gone to rest with just motion enough left to prove that the calm was not a dead one but a slumber  all round the numerous vessels of the short blue fleet floated in peaceful idleness  at every distance they lay from a hundred yards to the faroff horizon  we say that they floated peacefully but we speak only as to appearance for there were other hells in the fleet similar to that which we have described and the soft sound of distant oars could be distinguished now and then as boats plied to and fro between their smacks and the coper fetching the deadly liquid with which these hells were set on fire  other sounds there were however which fell pleasantly on the ears of the two listeners  psalmsingers said billy  they might be worse replied ned  what smack does it come from think ee  the boy jim or the cephasnot sure which for i cant make out the voices  it might be from the sparrow but thats it close to us and there could be no mistake about jim frosts voice if he was to strike up  what has jim frost hoisted the bethelflag  ay didnt you see it flyin last sunday for the first time  no i didnt returned ned but im glad to hear it for though im not one o that set myself  i do like to see a man not ashamed to show his colours  the flag to which they referred is supplied at half cost to the fleet by the mission to deepsea fishermenand is hoisted every sabbathday by those skippers in the fleet who having made up their minds boldly to accept all the consequences of the step have come out decidedly on the lords side  while the two shipmates were conversing thus in low tones enjoying the fresh air and the calm influences around them the notes of an accordion came over the water in tones that were sweetened and mellowed by distance  ha thats jim frost now said billy in subdued excitement while pleasure glittered in his eyes  oh  ned i does like music  it makes my heart fit to bust sometimes it does  an jim plays that that whats is nameso beautiful  his accordion said ned  yeshis accordium  no billy not accordium but accordion  well wellno matter  i dont care a button what you calls it so long as jim plays it  why hed make his fortin if he was to play that thing about the streets o lunon  listen  jim frost deserved all the praise that the enthusiastic boy bestowed on him for besides possessing a fine ear and taste for music and having taught himself to play well he had a magnificent tenor voice and took great delight in singing the beautiful hymns which at that time had been introduced to the fleet  on this particular day he was joined by his crew whose voicesmore or less tunefulcame rolling over the water in a great volume of melody  hes got singin peter avisitin him said billy  dont you hear him  ay i hear him boy  theres no mistakin singin peters voice  id know it among a thousand  if its hell here remarked billy with a great sigh of satisfaction after the hymn was done it do seem like heaven over there  i only wish we had jim frost on board of us instead of that brute gunter  dont be hard on gunter billy said ned  we dont know what hes got to bear  some men are born you see wi narves that are for ever screwin at em an ticklin of em up an other men have narves that always keep smoothin of em down  the last are the pleasantest to have to do with no doubt but the others aint quite so bad as they look sometimes  their bark is worse than their bite  hush exclaimed the boy holding up a finger at the moment for jim frosts accordion again sent forth its rich tones in the prelude to a hymn  a few moments later and the tuneful voices came rolling towards them in that beautiful hymn the chorus of which ends    we shall know each other better when the mists are rolled away  when the last verse was sung little billy found a tear struggling to get out of each eye and a lump sticking in his throat so he turned his head away to conceal them  aint it beautiful he said when the lump had disappeared  and aint it curious answered ned that it should touch on what we was talkin about afore they began  praps we shall know john gunter better when the mists are rolled away  billy shook his head dubiously  im not so sure o that he said anyhow theres a deal o mist to be rolled away before we can know him better  theres a breeze comin up from the southard remarked ned who to say truth did not seem to care very much about getting to know his surly shipmate better well have to get your father aboard soon  that wont be an easy matter said billy and he was right for when david bright was set down with a friend and a glass and a pack of cards it was very difficult to move him  he was indeed as fond of gambling as of drinking and lost much of his hardly earned gains in that way  billy therefore received little but abuse when he tried to induce him to return to his own vessel but the freshing of the breeze and a sudden lurch of the smack which overturned his glass of grog into gunters lap induced him at last to go on deck  there the appearance of things had changed considerably  clouds were beginning to obscure the bright sky the breeze had effectually shattered the clear mirror of the sea and a swell was beginning to roll the white cloud so that legs which would have found it difficult to steady their owners on solid land made sad work of their office on the heaving deck  haul up the boat cried brock in a drivelling voice as he came on deck where are you steerin to  let me take the helm  he staggered toward the tiller as he spoke but dick herring and one of his mates seeing that he was quite unable to steer tried to prevent him  brock however had reached that stage of drunkenness in which men are apt to become particularly obstinate and being a powerful man struggled violently to accomplish his purpose  let him have it said herring at last  he cant do much damage  when set free the miserable man grasped the tiller and tried to steady himself  a lurch of the vessel however rendered his effort abortive the tiller fell to leeward  brock went headlong with it stumbled over the side and before any one could stretch out a hand to prevent it fell into the sea and sank  his comrades were apparently sobered in an instant  there was no need for the hurried order to jump into the boat alongside  ned spivin and billy were in it with the painter cast off and the oars out in a couple of seconds  the boat of the white cloud was also launched with a speed that only north sea fishermen perhaps can accomplish and both crews rowed about eagerly while the smack layto  but all without success  the unfortunate man was never more seen and the visitors left the vessel in sobered silence and rowed without exchanging a word to their own smack which lay about a quarter of a mile distant on the port quarter    chapter eleven  ruth and captain bream take to scheming  returning to london we will follow captain bream who one fine morning walked up to mrs dotropys mansion at the west end and applied the knocker vigorously  is miss ruth at home  yes miss ruth was at home and would he walk in  he was ushered into the library of the mansion that room in which the dotropy ancestors who could not find space among their kindred in the diningroom held so to speak an overflow meeting to themselves  ruth soon joined him  im so glad to see you captain bream she said shaking with much fervency the hand held out to her  sit down  it is so kind of you to come at once to help me in my little schemesthough i have not seen you to explain why i asked youbut there i was almost off on another subject before i had begun the one i wish to consult you about  and do you know captain added ruth with a slightly perplexed look i find scheming a very troublesome business  i should think you did miss ruth and it seems to me that its always better to go straight at what youve got to do without schemingall fair an aboveboard  excuse me my dear but an old man who has sailed your lamented fathers ships for over thirty years and known you since you were a baby may be allowed to say hes surprised that you should take to scheming  an old man who has not only sailed my dear fathers ships for over thirty years said ruth but has brought me toys from all parts of the world and has besides been as true to the family as the needle to the poleor truer if all be true that is said of needlesmay say to my fathers daughter exactly what he pleases without the smallest chance of giving offence  but let me tell you sir that you are a foolish old man and much too quick in forming your opinions  scheming is both justifiable and honourable at timesas i shall soon convince you  a beaming smile overspread the captains visage as he said  very well miss ruth  go on  but before i go on tell me how are the miss seawards  quite well i believe  at least i have no reason to think otherwise rather thinnish if anything but filled out wonderfully since i first saw em  thats good said ruth laughing  and now do you know why i asked you to go and lodge with them  well i always thought it was because you knew i wanted a lodgin though i confess it has puzzled me to make out why you wanted me to come to such an outotheway part o the city and to tell you the truth it is rather inconvenient but your letter was so urgent miss ruth that i knew you must have some good reason and as your dear fathers daughter has a right to command me i obeyed as you know without question  you are a good old man returned ruth laying her hand on the brown fist of the captain and looking up in his face with the same loving girlish look that she had bestowed on him many a time in years past on his frequent visits with foreign toys and i shall test your goodness a good deal before i have done with you  test away miss ruth  youll find i can stand a good deal of testin i havent sailed the salt sea for forty years for nothing  well then said ruth looking slightly perplexed again  what would you do captain bream if you knew of two ladies who were unable to work or to find suitable work and so poor as to be literally starvingwhat would you do  give em money of course  but suppose that owing to some delicacy of feeling or perhaps some sort of mistaken pride they would not accept money and flushed very much and felt hurt if you ventured to offer it to them  why then id send em victuals  but suppose continued ruth that there were great difficulties in the way of doing that and they felt as much objection to receive gratuitous victuals as money what would you do then you would not let them starve would you  of course not returned the captain promptly  if it fairly came to that id be apt to treat em as nurses do obstinate infants and castor oil  id take em on my knee force open their mouths and shove the victuals down their throats  ruth burst into a merry little laugh at this  but said she dont you think that before proceeding to such forcible treatment you might scheme a little to get them to take it willingly as nurses sometimes disguise the taste of the oil with coffee or milk  well you might scheme a little on that sort of principle miss ruth but in ordinary cases i prefer straightforward plans myself  then why let me ask said ruth with some severity in her look do you dare to scheme with the wind as you and all sailors do when it is dead against you  youre becomin too deep for me now my dear what dee mean  when the wind blows dead against you say from the north replied ruth dont you begin your naughtyat least your nauticalscheming at once  dont you lay your course to the norwest and pretend you are going in that direction and then dont you soon tack aboutisnt that what you call itand steer noreast pretending that you are going that way when all the time you are wanting to go due north  what do you call that sir if it is not scheming to circumvent the wind  while she was speaking captain breams smile expanded and broke forth at last in one of his bass broadsides of laughter which gave ruth great delight for she had as a little girl enjoyed these thunderous laughs excessively and her taste for them had not departed  well my dear said her visitor i admit that there are some sorts o fairanaboveboard schemin which aint dishonourable or unworthy of a british sailor  very good returned ruth then listen while i reveal some of my recent scheming  some time ago i found out that two very dear friends of minewho were in delicate health and quite unable to work hard as well as being unable to find any kind of work whateverwere on the point of starvation  they would not accept money  i schemed a little to get them to earn money but it was not easy and the result was not a sufficiently permanent income  at last i thought i would try to get them a boardera somewhat rich boarder whose powerful appetite and large meals might leave some crumbs for  you dont mean to tell me miss ruth interrupted the captain in amazement that the miss seawards were in a state of starvation when i went to em  indeed i do replied ruth at least as nearly in that state as was compatible with existence  well well said the captain no wonder they looked so thin and no wonder theyre beginnin to be a little better in flesh now wi the legs o mutton an chops an such like things that i get in to take the edge off my appetitewhich as you justly observe miss ruth is not a bad one  im glad youve told me this however for ill go in for extra heavy feedin now  thats right  but stay captain bream i have not nearly done with my scheming yet  and i shall still want you to help me  go ahead my dear  im your man for to tell ee the downright truth ive taken a great fancy to these two sisters an would steer a long way out o my course to help em  i knew you would returned ruth with a little look of triumph whoever comes in contact with these dear friends of mine thinks exactly as you do  now their health is not nearly as good as it ought to be so i want them to have a change of air  you see the poor little street in which they live is not the freshest in london  exactly so  they want a trip to brighton or broadstairs or ramsgate and a whiff of fresh seaair eh said the captain with a look of satisfaction  no not to these places said ruth i thought of yarmouth  well yarmouthjust as good  any part o the coast will do to blow the london cobwebs out o their brainssay yarmouth  very good captain but my difficulty is how to manage it  nothing easier miss ruth  i will take an afternoon train run down hire a lodgin come up tomorrow an carry the miss seawards off wi me  but suppose they wont go  but they must go  im quite able to take up one under each arm an carry em off by force if they wont  i would highly approve of that method captain if it were possible but im afraid such things are not permitted in this free country  no if done at all the thing must be gone about with a little more care and delicacy  well then ill go down an take a lodgin an write up and ask them to pay me a visit for the benefit of their health  ruth shook her pretty little head and frowned  wont do she said  i know them too well  theyre so unselfish that they wont budge a step to benefit themselves  hm  i see miss ruth we want a little scheming hereeh  well ill manage it  you leave this little matter in my hands and see if i dont get em to visit yarmouth by hook or by crook  by the way miss ruth was it one o your little schemes givin em these mitts and comforters to make  of course it was ruth replied with a laugh and a blush  you see these things are really very much wanted by the north sea fishermen and a great many benevolent women spend much time in knitting for themand not only women but also boys  boys echoed the captain in surpriseboys knit mitts and comforters  yes  i assure you that the telegraph boys of the notting hill branch of the postoffice have actually spent some of their spare time in doing this work  ill look upon telegraph boys with more respect ever after this said the captain with emphasis  well as i was saying continued ruth mamma bought far more worsted for me than i could ever find time to work up into mitts or comforters so i have employed the miss seawards to do it for meat so much a pair but they dont know its for me so be careful not to  yes yes i seemore scheming  well ill take care not to blab  and i sent the worsted and arranged the transaction through such a dear pretty little fisherboy from yarmouth  but perhaps you have seen him at your lodging  no i havent seen him but ive heard a good deal about him  the ladies seem to be as much impressed with his sweetness and prettiness as yourself miss ruth  for my part im not over fond o sweet pretty boys  i prefer em roughcast or even ugly so longs theyre smart an willin  oh but you have no idea what a smart and willing boy he is said ruth firing up in defence of her little friend  i assure you he is most willing and intelligent and i do believe he would scratch his face and twist his little nose into a screw if by so doing he could make himself ugly for i have observed that he is terribly annoyed when people call him prettyas they often foolishly do  well ill be off now on this little business said the captain rising and smoothing his hat with his cuff  butbutmiss ruth excuse me you said something about sending the miss seawards a rich lodger when you sent me  how dee know im rich  well i only guessed it returned ruth with a laugh and you know more than once you have hinted to me that you had got on very wellthat god had prospered youi think these were the words you have sometimes used  these are the words i would always use returned the captain  the prosperity that has attended me through life i distinctly recognise at being the result of gods will not of my wisdom  dont we see that the cleverest of men sometimes fail and on the other hand the most stupid fellows sometimes succeed  it is god that setteth up one and putteth down another  im glad to hear that you think so clearly on this point captain though i did not know it before  it is another bond between us however if i have been wrong in supposing you to be rich i  nay i did not deny it miss ruth but it does not follow that a man means to say he is rich when he says that he has got on very well however my dear i dont mind tellin you as a secret that i am richas rich that is as theres any use to be an far richer than i deserve to be  you must know continued the captain sinking his voice to a hoarse whisper that your dear father used to allow me to put my savins into his hands for investment and the investments succeeded so well that at last i found myself in possession of five hundred a year  captain bream said this with much deliberation and an emphatic nod for each word while he gazed solemnly in ruths face  not a bad fortune for an old bachelor eh  then he continued after a moments pause when i was wrecked two years ago in australia i took a fancy to have a look at the gold diggins so off i went to bendigo and i set to work diggin for the mere fun o the thing and the very first day i turned up a nugget as big as my fist and two of the same sort the day after an then a lot o little ones in fact i had got hold of a firstrate claim an when i had dug away for a month or so i put it all in a big chest sold the claim and came straight home bringin the chest with me  i have it now up in my cabin yonder  it wellnigh broke my back gittin it up the stair though my back aint a weak one  and how much is the gold worth eagerly asked ruth who had listened with a sympathetic expression on her face  thats more than i can tell  i scarce know how to go about convertin it into cash but im in no hurry  now mind miss ruth not a word o this to any livin soul  not even to your own mother for she aint my mother dee see an has no right to know it  in fact ive never told it to any one till this day for i have no one in the wide world to care about it  once indeed i had  he stopped short  ah you are thinking of your sister said the sympathetic ruth the sister whom you once told me about long ago  yes miss ruth i was thinkin o her but he stopped again  do tell me about her said ruth earnestly  has she been long dead  dead my dear  i didnt say she was dead an yet it aint unlikely she is for its long long since i heard of her  theres not much to tell about her after all said the captain sadly  but she was a dear sweet little girl at the timejust turned eighteenan very fond o me  we had no parents living an no kindred except one old aunt with whom my sister lived  i was away at the time on a long voyage and had to take a cargo from the east indies to china before returnin home  at hongkong i fell ill an was laid up there for months  altogether a good many troubles came on me at that timethough they were blessed troubles to me for they ended in the saving o my soul through my eyes bein opened to see my sins and jesus christ as my saviour  it was three years before i set foot in england again and when i got back i found that my old aunt was dead and that my dear sister had married a seaman and gone awayno one knew where  and youve never heard of her since asked ruth  never  and dont know who she married  know nothin more about her my dear than ive told ee  goodbye now miss ruth  i must look sharp about this business of yours  he showed such evident disinclination to continue the painful subject that ruth forbore to press it and they parted to prosecute their respective schemes    chapter twelve  captain bream develops a capacity for scheming  at dinner that day captain bream paused in the act of conveying a whole potato to his mouth on the end of his fork and said  miss seaward im going to leave you  leave us cried kate interrupting him with a look of consternation for she and jessie had both become so fond of the amiable seaman with the frame of goliath and the heart of samuel that they were now as much afraid of losing as they had formerly been of possessing him  leave us captain  only for a time miss kateonly for a time he replied hastily as he checked the power of further utterance with the potato  only for a time he repeated on recovering the power  you see ive got a little bit of business to transact down at yarmouth and it will take me a good while to do it  some weeks at the leastperhaps some months but theres no help for it for the thing must be done  the captain said this with so much decision that kate could scarcely forbear laughing as she said  dear me it must be very important business since you seem so determined about it  is there anything or any one likely to oppose you in transacting the business  well not exactly at present returned the captain blandly but there are two obstinate friends of mine who i have been told would oppose me pretty stoutly if i was to tell em all the truth about it  is there any necessity asked jessie for telling these obstinate friends anything about the business at all  well yes replied the captain with a chuckle that almost brought on a choking fit i cant well avoid tellin them somethin about it for theyve a right to know but  wouldnt it save you all trouble then broke in kate seeing his hesitation to tell them just as much of the business as they were entitled to know and no more  thats just the very thing i mean to do replied the captain bursting into a laugh so deep and thunderous that the small domestic liffie lee entered the room abruptly to ask if anything was wanted but in reality to find out what all the fun was about  having been dismissed with a caution not to intrude again till rung for the captain helped himself to an enormous slice of beef earnestly but unsuccessfully pressed the sisters to go in for more and grow fat and then continued his discourse  you must know ladies that i have taken to studyin a good deal in my old age  another potatothank ee  yes we have observed that said kate  may i ask what is the nature of your studiesnavigation  navigation shouted the captain with another laugh so rich and racy that poor liffie lee almost entered in defiance of orders no miss kate it aint navigation  ive bin pretty well grounded in that subject for the last forty years  no my study now is theology  theology exclaimed the sisters in surprise  yes theology  is it so strange then that a man drawin near the close of life should wish to be more particular than when he was young in tryin to find out all he can about his maker returned the captain gravely  forgive us said jessie hastening to explain it is not that  if you had said you had taken to reading the bible carefully and systematically we would not have been surprised but itit wasyour talking so quietly about theology that made us  yes yes i see interrupted the goodnatured seaman well it is reading the word of god that i mean  you see i regard the bible as my classbook my book o logarithms chart compass rudder etcetera all rolled into one  now i dont mind tellin you a secret  when i first went to sea i was a very wild harumscarum young fellow an havin some sort of influence over my mates i did em a deal of damage and led em astray  well when the lord in his great mercy saved my soul i could not forget this and although i knew i was forgiven my heart was grieved to think of the mischief i had done  i felt as if i would give anything in life to undo it if i could  as this was not possible however i bethought me that the next best thing would be to do as much good as i could to the class that i had damaged so when i came home and left the sea for good i used to go down about the docks and give away bibles and testaments to the sailors  then i got to say a word or two to em now and then about their souls but i soon found that there are professed unbelievers among the tars an they put questions that puzzled me at times so i took to readin the bible with a view to answering objectors an bein able to give a reason of the hope that is in meto studyin in fact what i call theology  but i aint above takin help continued the captain with a modest look from ordinary good books when i come across emmy chief difficulty bein to find out what are the best books to consult and this has led me sometimes to think of buyin up all the theological books i can lay hands on an glancin em all through so as to make notes of such as seemed worth readin with care  the labour however seems so great that up to now ive bin kept back but ive had a talk with a friend today which has decided me so ill go off to yarmouth tomorrow an buy a whole lot o theological booksa regular library in factand set to work to read up  but theres one thing i would like which would save me an enormous amount o labour if i could get it  what is that asked the sisters eagerly and in the same breath for they had become quite interested in their friends aspirations  i would like said the captain slowly and fixing his eyes on his plate for he was now beginning to scheme i would like to find some onea clever boy perhaps though a girl would be preferablewho would take the trouble off my hands of glancin through the books first an makin notes of their contents for me so as to prevent my wastin time on those that are worthless  i fear said jessie that few boys or girls would be capable of such work for it would require not only intelligence but a considerable amount of scriptural knowledge  the captain heaved a deep sigh  yes he said shaking his head slowly youre right and im afraid ill have to get some grownup person to help me but that wont be easy  and then dee know i dont feel as if i could git on in such investigations with a stranger  what a pity said kate that you could not bring the books here and then i could help you for although i do not pretend to be deeply learned in scriptural knowledge i daresay i know enough for your purpose but why not get the books in london  is there any necessity for buying them in yarmouth  poor captain bream was so unused to scheming that he had made no preparation for such a question and felt much confused  he could give no good reason for making his purchase in yarmouth and nothing would have induced him to tell a falsehood  well really he said after a few moments hesitation there are circumstances sometimes in a mans life which render it difficult for him to explain things butbut i have a reason for wishin to buy this library in yarmouth an it seems to me a good one  besides ive got a likin for seaair bein my native air so to speak and ive no doubt that theology would come more easy to me if i was in a snug little room facin the sea where i could see the blue waters dancin an the shipping go by an the youngsters playin on the sands  yes it must be done at yarmouth  london would never do its too hot an stuffy not that i care for that but then you mightahthat isi mean to sayyou might agree with me on this point if you were there  but why he added with fresh animation as he saw the way opening up before him why miss kate since you are so kind as to say youd like to help me why might you not take a run down to yarmouth with me an help me there  because answered kate laughing i could not very well leave my sister alone  of course notquite right but theres no need for that she could come too and it would do you both much good not to speak o the immense advantage to me  i do assure you id feel wellnigh as helpless as an infant if left to tackle this business alone  from this point there began a regular skirmish between the captain and the sisters the one trying to convince the others that it would be doing him a favour for which he could never find words to thank them and the others endeavouring to show by every sort of argument that the thing was utterly unpossible that the captain little knew what a burden he proposed to take on his shoulders and that there was no use whatever in talking about it  but captain bream was a man of resolution  he stuck to his point and pleaded his own cause so powerfully that the sisters began to waver  but think urged kate who did the most of the fighting you forget liffie lee  she is no longer a mere visitor for an hour or two of a morning as she used to be but a regular hired servant and we could not leave her behind  i know that  it was my coming that made you hire her and now i think of it ive a right to claim at least part of her so she can come too an well lock up the house an get mr greengrocer to look after it air it now and then  come just make up your minds  only think how beautiful the blue sea will be just now an the sunny skies an the yellow sandsi declare it makes me long to go  an then youll see that pretty boy youve taken such a fancy towhats is name  billy bright said kate  just sobilly brightthough i cant say that im over fond o pretty little boys  theyre too often soft an  but i tell you hes as bold as a lion and wise as a man and tough asas  as a beefsteak said the captain yes yes i know all that and im quite prepared to believe that he is an exception  well now its agreed tois it  but the sisters did not at once give in  they fought on with true feminine courage until the captain tried the effect of deep dejection and innocent submission when their tender hearts could stand out no longer and hauling down their colours they finally agreed to become librarians and accompany their lodger to yarmouth  then the captain left them to report the victory to his commodore ruth dotropy  i never had such a battle in my life he said to that scheming young creature  they didnt give in till theyd fired off every shot in their locker  trafalgar and the nile were nothin to it  but do you really mean to say asked ruth who could hardly speak at first for laughing that you intend to buy all these theological books and set the sisters to work  to be sure i do  you didnt suppose that i was goin to tell a parcel o lies to help out your schemes my dear  it has been for some months past simmerin in my brain that i ought to go through a small course of education in that line  and all you have done for me is to make me go in for it somewhat sooner and a little heavier than i had intended in the way of books  and theres no doubt ill study better at the seaside than in london  besides i shall have the fishermen to try the effects of my studies on and you may be sure i wont let the poor things work too hard at the books  ill trust you for that said ruth  now while these little plans were being arranged an event was pending in the north sea fleet which merits particular notice    chapter thirteen  run down in a fogcaptain bream acts surprisingly  one day a fishingsmack was on the eve of quitting the short blue fleet for its little holiday of a week in port  it was the sparrow of which jim frost was master  a flag was flying to indicate its intention and invite letters etcetera for home if any of the crews should feel disposed to send them  several boats put off from their respective smacks in reply to the signal  one of these belonged to singing peter  glad to see you peter said jim frost as the former leaped on the sparrows deck  same to you lad  i wish you a pleasant spell ashore and may the master be with you returned peter  the master is sure to be with me replied frost for has he not said i will never leave thee  isnt it a fine thing peter to think that whatever happens the lord is here to guard us from evil  ay jim an to take us home when the time comes  which is far better responded jim  youll not get away tonight remarked peter as he gazed out upon the sea  its goin to fall calm  no matter  i can wait  what say ye lad to a hymn said peter  im your man replied jim with a laugh i thought it wouldnt be long before singin peter would want to raise his pipe  he cant help it dee see returned peter answering the laugh with a smile if i didnt sing id blow up  its my safetyvalve jim an i like to blow off steam when i gets alongside o likeminded men  were all likeminded here  fetch my accordion said jim turning to one of his men  in a few minutes a lively hymn was raised in lusty tones which rolled far and wide over the slumbering sea  then these likeminded men offered up several prayers and it was observed that jim frost was peculiarly earnest that night  of course they had some more hymns for as the calm was by that time complete and it was not possible for any sailing vessel to quit the fleet there was no occasion to hurry indeed there is no saying how long these ironframed fishermen would have kept it up if it had not been for a slight fog which warned the visitors to depart  as the night advanced the fog thickened so that it was not possible to see more than fifty yards around any of the fishingsmacks  now it is probably known to most people that the greatest danger to which those who do business on the sea are exposed is during fog  when all around is calm and peaceful when the sound of voices comes with muffled sound over the smooth water when the eye sees nothing save a ghostly white horizon all round close at hand when almost the only sound that breaks on the ear is the gentle lapping of the sea or the quiet creak of plank and spar as the vessel slowly lifts and falls on the gentle swell and when landsmen perchance feel most securethen it is that the dark cloud of danger lowers most heavily though perhaps unrecognised over the mariner and stirs him to anxious watchfulness when apparently in profoundest repose  jim frost knew well the dangers of the situation but he had been long accustomed to face all the dangers peculiar to his calling on the deep without flinchingstrong in the confidence of his welltried courage and seamanship and stronger still in his trust in him who holds the water in the hollow of his hand  many a time had he been becalmed in fog on the north sea  he knew what to do kept the foghorn blowing and took all the steps for safety that were possible in the circumstances  but somehow the young fisherman did not feel his usual easygoing indifference on that particular night though his trust in god was not less strong  he felt no fear indeed but a solemn sobriety of spirit had taken the place of his wonted cheery temperament and instead of singing in lively tones as he paced the deck he hummed airs of a slow pathetic kind in a soft undertone  it is often said that men receive mysterious intimations sometimes of impending disaster  it may be so  we cannot tell  certainly it seemed as if jim frost had received some such intimation that night  i cant understand it evan he said to his mate when the latter came on deck a little after midnight to relieve him  a feeling as if something was going to happen has taken possession of me and i cant shake it off  you know im not the man to fancy danger when theres none  evana youth whom he had been the means of rescuing when about to fall under great temptationreplied that perhaps want of sleep was the cause  you know he said men become little better than babbies when they goes long without sleep an youve not had much of late  what with that tearin o the net an the gale thats just gone an that book you know  ah interrupted jim you mustnt lay the blame on the book evan  i havent bin sittin up very late at it though i confess im uncommon fond o readin  besides its a good book more likely to quiet a mans mind than to rouse it  how we ever got on without readin before that missionship came to us is more than i can understand  why it seems to have lifted me into a new world  thats so  im fond o readin myself said evan who although not quite so enthusiastic or intellectual as his friend appreciated very highly the librarybags which had been recently sent to the fleet  but the strange thing is said jim returning to the subject of his impressionsthe strange thing is that my mind is not runnin on danger or damaged gear or books or gales but on my dear wife at home ive bin thinkin of nancy in a way that i dont remember to have done before an the face of my darlin lucy wi her black eyes an rosy cheeks so like her mother is never absent from my eyes for a moment  want o sleep said the practical evan  youd better turn in an have a good spell as long as the calm lasts  you remember the patch o green in front o my cottage in gorleston asked jim paying no attention to his mates advice  yes answered evan  well when i was sittin forard there not halfanhour since i seed my nancy asittin on that green as plain as i see you sewin away at somethin an lucy playin at her knee  they was so reallike that i couldnt help sayin nancy an i do assure you that she stopped sewin an turned her head aone side for a moment as if she was listenin  an it was all so reallike too  you was dreamin that was all said the unromantic evan  no mate  i wasnt dreamin returned jim  i was as wide awake as i am at this moment for i was lookin out all round just as keen as if i had not bin thinkin about home at all  well youd as well go below an dream about em now if you can suggested evan an ill keep a sharp lookout  no lad i cant  im not a bit sleepy  as jim said this he turned and went to the bow of the smack  at that moment the muffled sound of a steamers paddles was heard probably the fog had something to do with the peculiarity of the sound for next moment a fogwhistle sounded its harsh tone close at hand and a dark towering shadow seemed to rush down upon the sparrow  even if there had been a breeze there would have been no time to steer clear of the danger  as it was the little vessel lay quite helpless on the sea evan shouted down the companion for the men to turn out for their lives  the man at the bow sounded the foghorn loud and long  at the same instant jim frosts voice rang out strong and clear a warning cry  it was answered from above  there were sudden screams and cries the fogwhistle shrieked  engines were reversed  hard aport was shouted  steam was blown off and amid confusion and turmoil indescribable an ocean steamer struck the little sparrow amidships and fairly rammed her into the sea  it could scarcely be said that there was a crash  the one was too heavy and the other too light for that  the smack lay over almost gracefully as if submitting humbly to her inevitable doom  there was one great cry and next moment she was rolling beneath the keel of the monster that had so ruthlessly run her down  not far offso near indeed that those on board almost saw the catastrophelay the evening star  they of course heard the cries and the confusion and knew only too well what had occurred  to order out the boat was the work of an instant  with powerful strokes joe spivin trevor and gunter caused it to leap to the rescue  on reaching the spot they discovered and saved the mate  he was found clinging to an oar but all the others had disappeared  the steamer which had done the deed had lowered a boat and diligent search was made in all directions round the spot where the fatal collision had occurred no other living soul however was found  only a few broken spars and the upturned boat of the smack remained to tell where jim frost and the rest of his likeminded men had exchanged the garb of toil for the garments of glory  as a matter of course this event made a profound impression for a time on board of the evening star and of such vessels as were near enough next morning to be informed of the sad news  a large portion of the fleet however was for some time unaware of what had taken place and some of the masters and crews who were averse to what they styled psalmsingin and prayin did not seem to be much affected by the loss  whether grieved or indifferent however the work of the fleet had to be done  whether fishermen live or die sink or swim the inexorable demand of billingsgate for fish must be met  accordingly next day about noon a fresh breeze having sprung up and a carriersteamer being there ready for her load the same lively scene which we have described in a previous chapter was reenacted and after the smacks were discharged they all went off as formerly in the same direction like a shoal of herrings to new fishinggrounds  when they had got well away to the eastward and were beating up against a stiff northerly breeze david bright who stood near the helm of the evening star said to his son in a peculiarly low voice  now billy you go below an fetch me a glass of grog  billy went below as desired but very unwillingly for he well knew his fathers varying moods and recognised in the peculiar tone in which the order was given a species of despondencyalmost amounting to despair which not unfrequently ushered in some of his worst fits of intemperance  your fadders in de blues today said zulu as he toiled over his cooking apparatus in the little cabin when he spok like dat he goes in for heavy drink  i know that well enough returned billy almost angrily  why you no try him wid a speriment asked the cook wrinkling up his nose and displaying his tremendous gums  for any sake dont open your mouth like that zulu but tell me what you mean by a speriment said the boy  how kin i tell whats a speriment if im not to open my mout  shut up you nigger an talk sense  der you go agin billy  how kin i talk sense if im to shut up  dont you know what a speriment is  why itsitsjust a speriment you knowa dodge  if you mean a dodge why dont you say a dodge retorted billy well what is your dodge look alive for daddyll be shoutin for his grog in a minute  you jus listen said the cook in a hoarse whisper as he opened his enormous eyes to their widest you jus take a wineglassde big un as your fadder be fond ofan put in im two teaspoonfuls o vinegar one tablespoonful o parafine hoil one leetle pinch o pepper an one big pinch ob salt with a leetle mustard an give im dat  your fadder never take time to smell hims grogalways toss im off quick  yes an then hed toss the wineglass into my face an kick me round the deck afterwards if not overboard said billy with a look of contempt  no zulu i dont like your speriment but youve put a notion into my head for even when a fool speaks a wise man may learn  yes i often tink dat said the cook interrupting with a look of innocence  you quite right so speak away billy an ill learn  you fetch me the wineglass said the boy sharply  zulu obeyed  now fill it up with waterso an put in a little brown sugar to give it colour  thats enough stir him up  not bad rumto look at ill try father wi that  accordingly our little hero went on deck and handed the glass to his fatherretreating a step or two promptly yet quietly after doing so  as zulu had said david bright did not waste time in smelling his liquor  he emptied the glass at one gulp and then gazed at his son with closed lips and gradually widening eyes  its only sugar and water daddy said billy uncertain whether to laugh or look grave  for a few moments the skipper was speechless  then his face flushed and he said in a voice of thunder go below an fetch up the keg  there was no disobeying that order  the poor boy leaped down the ladder and seized the rumkeg  your speriment might have been better after all zulu he whispered as he passed up again and stood before his father  what may have passed in the mind of that father during the brief interval we cannot tell but he still stood with the empty wineglass in his hand and a fierce expression on his face  to billys surprise however instead of seizing the keg and filling out a bumper he said sternlysee here and tossed the wineglass into the sea  now lad he added in a quiet voice throw that keg after it  the poor boy looked at his sire with wondering eyes and hesitated  overboard with it said david bright in a voice of decision  with a mingling of wild amazement glee and goodwill billy exerting all his strength hurled the rumkeg into the air and it fell with a heavy splash upon the sea  there billy said david placing his hand gently on the boys head you go below and say your prayers an if ye dont know how to pray get luke trevor to teach you an dont forget to thank god that your old fathers bin an done it at last  we are not informed how far billy complied with these remarkable orders but certain we are that david bright did not taste a drop of strong drink during the remainder of that voyage  whether he tasted it afterwards at all must be left for this chronicle to tell at the proper time and place  at present it is necessary that we should return to yarmouth where captain bream in pursuance of his deeplaid schemes entered a booksellers shop and made a sweeping demand for theological literature  what particular work do you require sir asked the surprised and somewhat amused bookseller  i dont know that i want any one in particular said the captain i want pretty well all that have bin published up to this date  you know the names of em all i suppose  indeed no sir answered the man with a look of uncertainty theological works are very numerous and some of them very expensive perhaps if  now look here  ive got neither time nor inclination to get upon the subject just now said the captain  you just set your clerk to work to make out a list o the principal works o the kind youve got on hand an ill come back in the evenin to see about it  never mind the price  i wont stick at thatnor yet the quality  anything that throws light on religion will do  but sir said the shopman some of the theological works of the present day are supposedat least by the orthodoxto throw darkness instead of light on religion  all right returned the captain throw em all in  i dont expect divines to agree any more than doctors  besides ive got a chart to steer by called the bible thatll keep me clear o rocks an shoals you make your mind easy an do as i bid you  get the books together by six oclock this evening an the account made out for i always pay cash down  goodday  leaving the bookseller to employ himself with this astounding order captain bream next went to that part of the town which faces the seabeach and knocked at the door of a house in the window of which was a ticket with lodgings inscribed on it  let me see your rooms my good girl said the captain to the little maid who opened the door  the little maid looked up at the captain with some surprise and no little hesitancy  she evidently feared either that the rooms would not be suitable for the applicant or that the applicant would not be suitable for the rooms  she admitted him however and leading him upstairs ushered him into the parlour of the establishment  splendid exclaimed the captain on beholding the large window from which there was seen a glorious view of the sea so near that the ships passing through the deep water close to the beach seemed as if they were trying which of them could sail nearest to land without grounding  splendid he repeated with immense satisfaction as he turned from the view to the room itself now this is what i call fortunate  the very thingsofa for miss jessieeasychair for miss katerocking chair for both of em  nothin quite suitable for me looking round but thats not difficult to remedy  glass over the chimney to see their pretty faces in and what have we herea press  no sir said the little maid pushing open the door a small room off this one sir  glorious shouted the captain entering and striking the top of the doorway with his head in doing so  nothing could be better  this is the theological library  just the thinggoodsized window same view small table andwell i declare if there aint empty bookshelves  very sorry sir said the little maid hastening to apologise we have no books but theyll be handy for any books you may bring to the seaside with you sir or for any little knickknacks and odds and ends  yes yes my good girl  ill fetch a few theological odds and ends tonight thatll praps fill em up  by the way youve a bedroom i hope  he looked anxious and the maid who seemed inclined to laugh said that of course they had a nice airy bedroom on the same floor on the other side of the passagealso commanding the sea  the captains face beamed again  and now my girlbut by the way i shall want another bedroom  have you  im sorry to say that we have not  the rest of the house is quite full  captain breams face again became anxious  thats bad he said of course i can get one out o the house but it would be inconvenient  there is a hattic sir said the maid but it is igh up and so very small that i fear  let me see the attic said the captain promptly  the maid conducted him up another flight of steps to a room or rather closet which did not appear to be more than five feet broad and barely six feet long including the stormwindow it might have been perhaps seven feet long  it was situated in a sort of angle so that from the window you could have a view of a piece of slate roof and two crooked chimney pots with a slice of the sea between them  as there was much traffic on the sea off that coast the slice referred to frequently exhibited a ship or a boat for a few seconds  my study murmured the captain looking round on the bare walls and the wooden chair and a low bedstead which constituted the furniture not much room for the intellect to expand here  however ive seen worse  we consider it a very good hattic sir said the little maid somewhat hurt by the last remark  i meant no offence my dear said the captain with one of his blandest smiles only the berth is rather small dee see for a man of my size  it is firstrate as far as it goes but if it went a little furtherin the direction of the sea you knowit might give me a little more room to kick about my legs  but itll do  itll do  ill take all the rooms so youll consider them engaged  but you havent asked the price of em yet sir said the little maid  i dont care tuppence about the price my dear  are you the landlady  la no sir replied the girl laughing outright as they returned to the parlour  well then you send the landlady to me and ill soon settle matters  when the landlady appeared the captain was as good as his word  he at once agreed to her terms as well as her stipulations and paid the first weeks rent in advance on the spot  now said he on leaving ill come back this evening with a lot of books  tomorrow forenoon the ladies for whom the rooms are taken will arrive please god and you will have everything ready and in applepie order for em  ill see about grub afterwards but in the meantime you may give orders to have sent in tomorrow a lot o fresh eggs and milk and creamlots of creamand fresh butter and tea and coffee an suchlike  but i neednt do more than give a wink to a lady of your experience  with this last gallant remark captain bream left the lodging and strolled down to the seabeach    chapter fourteen  ruths hopes as to her plot brighten a little  mother said ruth one day to her dignified parent shall you be soon free of engagements  yes probably by the end of next week  why do you ask  because i am longing to get away to yarmouth  i had a letter from dear kate seaward today  they have been a week in their lodging now and are enjoying it immensely  here is the letter  let me read a bit of it to you  she says you have no idea how much we are charmed with this place  it is a perfect paradise  perhaps part of our feeling of delight is due to the great change from our smoky little residence in london but you would not wonder at my enthusiasm if you saw the sweet little window beside which i am writing and the splendid sealike a great field of clear glass which spreads away on all sides to the horizon  oh  i do love the seato look at i mean  you must not suppose dear that i have any love left when i am on it  oh no  the memory of my last crossing of the channelthat dreadful british channelis as fresh as if it had happened yesterdaythe heaving of the steamer and the howling of the wind the staggering of the passengers and the expression of their faces to say nothing of their colour  and then the sensations  appalling is a mild word  it is not appropriate if i might coin a word horrific seems more suitable  but words utterly fail when deep and powerful sensations are concerned  i do assure you ruth that i was absolutely indifferent as to what should become of me that dreadful day as i lay extended flat on my back on one of the saloon sofas  and when that nurse with the baby was forced by a lurch of the ship to sit down on me i do believe that i could have thanked her if she had crushed me out of existence  yes i hate the sea as a place of residence but i love it as an object to be looked at especially when it is calm and glittering as it now is in the early morning sun  talking of the early morning reminds me of good captain bream who is one of the most singular and incomprehensible creatures i ever met with he is an early risernot that that makes him singularbut instead of going out to walk he remains up in his pigeonhole of a room studying theology  and such a miscellaneous collection of books he has got on all sorts of religious controversy  he say he wants to be able to meet the objections of unbelievers whom he sometimes encounters when preaching to sailors  jessie and i have heard him preach to a number of sailors and fishermen assembled in an old boatshed and you have no idea ruth how delightful it is to hear him  so different from what one expected and so very unlike the preaching of many men  i have often wondered why it is that some mensensible men too in other mattersshould think it necessary to talk in a singsong or whiny voice with a pathetic drawl or through their noses when they have to speak on religious subjects  i once heard an indignant clergyman say that he thought it was a device of the devil to turn sacred things into ridicule but i cannot agree with that  it seems to me that men are often too ready to saddle satan with evil devices which they ought to fix on their own stupid shoulders  captain bream simply talks when he preaches just as if he were talking on any business matter of great importance and he does it so nicely too and so earnestly like a father talking to his children  many of the roughlooking fishermen were quite melted and after the meeting a good many of them remained behind to talk with him privately  jessie and i are convinced that he is doing a great and good work here  but he is a most eccentric man and seems a good deal perplexed by his theological studies  the other day jessie ventured to question him about these and he became quite energetic as he said  i tell ee what it is ladies when i go cruisin out and in among these theological volumes until i lose my reckoning altogether an git among shoals an quicksands that i never so much as heard of before i just lay hold o the cable thats made fast to my sheetanchor and i haul in on that  here is the sheetanchor he said pulling his little bible from his pocket the word of god  thats it  when i feel how ignorant an stoopid an unlearned i am i just keep haulin on the cable till i come to some such word as this not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord an so im comforted an my minds made easy for after all we may think and say and read it must come to thislet every man be fully persuaded in his own mind every man must work out his own theology for himself accordin to that word and ive worked it out so far by gods blessin that jesus christthe godmanis my foundation the holy spirit is my guide and salvation from sin is my aim and endnot only for myself but for my fellowsinners  but i must not go on quoting the captains sayings and eccentric doings else i shall never stop  when are you and your mother coming down  i cannot tell how much we long to have you with us to share in our enjoyment of this charming place  and the fisherpeople are so interesting too  i dont wonder you took such a fancy to them  of course we have not had time to make acquaintance with many of them yet  and jessie has become so engrossed with the captains theological books that i cant tear her away from them  at first she began to inspect their contents with a view to tabulate them and help the captain but she gets so deep in them that she forgets time altogether and i have often found her after having been several hours in the library sitting there poring over a huge volume without having made a single note or jotting  the captain is quite facetious about it and said yesterday that if she didnt work a little harder hed have to dismiss her from the service an ship a new hand  then he dragged us both out for a long walk on the beach  we cannot resist him  nobody can  and such cream as we havemore like thin butter than cream  and such quantities of it too for he declares he is very fond of it and must always have plenty on hand  but i cannot help thinking it is for our sakes he has it for although he talks much about it and makes great demonstration and noise when he drinks it he does not really consume muchand you know it must be drunk by somebody else it would spoil  oh we are having as the captain himself says a remarkably jolly time of it here and only want you to make our happiness complete  but with all his fun and energy and cheerfulness i cannot avoid noticing that dear captain bream is frequently very pensive and absent  i cannot help thinking sometimes that he is the victim of some secret sorrow  at this point ruth looked up in her mothers face and burst into a fit of hilarious laughter  only think mother she said of great big stout jolly old captain bream having a secret sorrow  my dear said mrs dotropy in a reproachful tone you are too flippant in your references to stout old people  you should remember that even the stoutest of them may once have been thin  and it is not impossible that captain bream may still be suffering from unrequited affection or  again ruth burst into silvery laughter but checked it and apologised  i cant help it mother  it does seem so funny to think of captain bream having ever been thin or with hair on his head or suffering from disappointed love  i wonder that it does not occur to kate that the good man is perhaps suffering because of the sorrows of others  it would be much more like his generous and unselfish nature  but now mother may i write to kate and tell her to expect us next week  yes i think you may  but why are you in such haste child  because im burning to clear up that little mystery that i told you ofif indeed it is a mystery and not a mere fancy  ruth sighed as if her spirit were slightly troubled  really child you have quite raised my curiosity about that mystery as you call it why will you not confide in me  because i may be all wrong and when i find out that im rightif i find out that im rightthen you shall know all about it  and theres that chest too that the captain sent here for us to take care of when he left town continued mrs dotropy you make quite a mystery about that too for i see that you know something about it  if i had not perfect confidence in your heart child i should feel quite anxious for it is the first time in your life that you have concealed anything from me  thank you mother for trusting my heart said ruth putting an arm round the dignified ladys neck and kissing her  thats all very well ruth but i do not put so much trust in your head  im sorry for that mother but meantime my head says that while it would be wrong in me to keep any secret about myself from you i have no right to reveal the secrets of others  but about this chesthas the banker sent for it yet  no not yet but i expect some one from the bank every minute she consulted a small jewelled watch and it is probable that our young friend mr dalton himself may come  mr dalton exclaimed ruth with a sudden flush that might have indicated pleasure or annoyance  mrs dotropy however did not observe the flush but continued  the chest seems miraculously heavy  i told james to put it into the storeroom but he could not lift it although he is a strong man and had to get the butlers assistance  at that moment the conversation was interrupted by the door being thrown open and mr dalton was announced  he was a young man of handsome face and figure with dark eyes short curly hair and a pleasing address  apologising for not being more punctual in calling for the chest he explained that pressingbusiness had detained him  of course of course said mrs dotropy with the familiarity of an old friendfor such she was to the youthyou men of business always carry about that cloak of pressingbusiness to cover your sins and shortcomings with  nay you are unjust said the young man i appeal to miss ruth  did i not say to captain bream that i might perhaps have difficulty in getting away at the hour named as it was a business hour and the transaction being of a friendly and private nature  my dear sir interrupted mrs dotropy if it is private pray do not make it public  has not miss ruth then told you  he stopped and looked from one lady to the other  miss ruth said that young lady flushing deeply is supposed to know nothing whatever about your transactions with captain bream  shall i go and tell james to carry the box downstairs mother  mrs dotropy gave permission and ruth retired  a few minutes later young dalton drove away with the captains chest of gold  a week after that the mother and daughter drove away from the same door to the railway station and in process of time found themselves one pleasant afternoon at yarmouth in the little parlour with the window that commanded the gorgeous view of the sea taking tea with the captain himself and his friends jessie and kate seaward  a lodging had been secured quite close to their own by the dotropys  now said ruth to jessie that evening in private with flushed cheeks and eager eyes i shall be able to carry out my little plot and see whether i am right now that i have at last got captain bream down to yarmouth  what little plot asked jessie  i may not tell you yet said ruth with a laugh  i shall let you know all about it soon  but ruth was wrong  there was destined to be a slip twixt the cup and her sweet lip just then for that same evening captain bream received a telegram from london which induced him to leave yarmouth hastily to see a friend he said and keep an oldstanding engagement  he promised however to be back in two or three days at furthest    chapter fifteen  a cloud comes over ruths hopes and dims their brightness  to prevent the reader supposing that there is any deeplaid scheme or profound mystery with which we mean to torment him during the course of our tale we may as well say at once that the little plot which ruth had in view and which began to grow quite into a romance the longer she pondered it was neither more nor less than to bring captain bream and mrs david bright face to face  ruth had what we may style a constructive mind  give her a few rough materials and straightway she would build a castle with them  if she had not enough of material she immediately invented more and thus continued her castlebuilding  being highly imaginative and romantic her structures were sometimes amazing edifices at which orthodox architects might have turned up their nosesand with some reason too for poor little ruths castles were built frequently on bad foundations and sometimes even in the air so that they too often fell in splendid ruins at her feet  it would not be just however to say that none of ruths buildings stood firm  occasionally she built upon a good foundation  now and then she made a straight shot and hit the mark  for instance the little edifice of cuffs and comforters to the north sea trawlers survived and remains to the present day a monument of usefulness which few monuments are and of wellplaced philanthropy  it may not perhaps be just to say that ruth actually laid the foundationconceived the first ideaof that good work but she was at all events among the first builders became an active overseer and did much of the work with her own hands still as we have said too many of ruths castles came to the ground and the poor thing was so well used to the sight of falling material that she had at last begun to be quite expert in detecting the first symptoms of dissolution and often regarded them with despairing anxiety  it was so with her when captain bream was summoned so suddenly away from yarmouth  eagerly anxiously had she planned to get him down to that town for the purpose of confronting him with mrs david brightthe reason being that from various things the captain had said to her at different times and from various remarks that mrs bright had made on sundry occasions she felt convinced that the north sea fishermans wife was none other than captain breams longlost sister  it would be wellnigh impossible as well as useless to investigate the process of reasoning and the chain of investigation by which she came to this conclusion but having once laid the foundation she began to build on it with her wonted enthusiasm and with a hopefulness that partial failure could not destroy  the captains departure just when she hoped to put the copestone on her little edifice was a severe blow for it compelled her to shut up her hopes and fears in her own breast and being of a sympathetic nature that was difficult  but ruth was a wise little woman as well as sympathetic  she had sense enough to know that it might be a tremendous disappointment to captain bream if after having had his hopes raised it were discovered that mrs bright was not his sister  ruth had therefore made up her mind not to give the slightest hint to him or to any one else about her hopes until the matter could be settled by bringing the two together when of course they would at once recognise each other  although damped somewhat by this unlookedfor interruption to her little schemes she did not allow her efforts to flag  i see she said one day on entering the theological library where jessie having laid down a worsted cuff which she had been knitting was deep in leslies short and easy method with the deists and kate having dropped a worsted comforter had lost herself in chalmerss astronomical discourses  i see you are both busy so i wont disturb you  i only looked in to say that im going out for an hour or two  we are never too busy darling said jessie to count your visits an interruption  would you like us to walk with you  nno  not just now  the fact is i am going out on a little private expedition said ruth pursing her mouth till it resembled a cherry  oh about that little plot asked jessie laughing  ruth nodded and joined in the laugh but would not commit herself in words  now dont work too hard kate she cried with an arch look as she turned to leave  it is harder work than you suppose miss impudence said kate what with cuffs and contradictions comforters and confusion worsted helmets and worse theology my brain seems to be getting into what the captain calls a sort of semitheological lopscowse that quite unfits me for anything  go away you naughty girl and carry out your dark plots whatever they are  ruth ran off laughing and soon found herself at the door of mrs brights humble dwelling  now mrs bright although very fond of her fair young visitor had begun as we have seen to grow rather puzzled and suspicious as to her frequent inquiries into her past history  you told me i think that your maiden name was bream said ruth after a few remarks about the weather and the prospects of the short blue fleet etcetera  yes miss ruth answered mrs bright but the answer was so short and her tone so peculiar that poor scheming little ruth was quelled at once she did not even dare to say another word on the subject nearest her heart at the time and hastily if not awkwardly changed the subject to little billy  here indeed she had touched a theme in regard to which mrs bright was always ready to respond  ah he is a good boy is billy she said an uncommonly good boy though he is not perfect by any means  and hes a little too fond of fighting  but after all its not for its own sake he likes it dear boy  its only when theres a good reason for it that he takes to it did i ever tell you about his kicking a boy bigger than himself into the sea off the end of the pier  no you never told me that  well this is how it was  theres a small girl named lilly brassa sweet little tot of four years old or thereabouts and billys very fond of her  lilly has a brother named tommy whos as full of mischief as an egg is full of meat and he has a trick of getting on the edge of the pier near where they live and tryin to walk on it and encouraging lilly to follow him  the boy had been often warned not to do it but he didnt mind and my billy grew very angry about it  i dont care about little brass himself mother said billy to me one day he may tumble in an be drownded if he likes but im afeared for little lilly for she likes to do what he does  so one day billy saw tommy brass at his old tricks with lilly looking on quite delighted and what did my boy do think ye  he went up to brass who was bigger and older than himself and gave him such a hearty kick that it sent him right off into the sea  the poor boy could not swim a stroke and the water was deep so my billy who can swim like a fish jumped in after him and helped to get him safe ashore  tommy brass was none the worse so after wringing the water out of his clothes he went up to billy and gave him a slap in the face  billy is not a boastful boy  he does not speak much when hes roused but he pulled off his coat and gave brass such a thump on the nose that he knocked him flat on the sand  up he jumped however in a moment and went at billy furiously but he had no chance  my boy was too active for him  he jumped a one side struck out his leg and let him tumble over it giving him a punch on the head as he went past that helped to send his nose deeper into the sand  at last he beat him entirely and then as he was puttin on his jacket again he saidtommy brass it aint so much on account o that slap you gave me that ive licked you but because you ticed lilly into danger  and you mark what i say every time i catch you walkin on that there pieredge or hear of you doin of it ill give you a lickin  tommy brass has never walked on that pieredge since concluded mrs bright but im sorry to say that ever since that day lilly brass has refused to have a word to say to billy and when asked why she says cause he sowsed an whacked my brudder tommy  thus did mrs bright entertain her visitor with comment and anecdote about billy until she felt at last constrained to leave without having recovered courage to broach again the subject which had brought her to the fishermans home  that same afternoon mrs bright paid a friendly visit to the wife of her husbands mate  i cant think whatever miss ruth dotropy is so curious about me for shes bin at me again said mrs bright to mrs davidson who was busy with her needle on some part of the costume of her blessed babby which lay like an angel in its little crib behind the door  praps its all along of her bein so interested in you replied pretty mrs davidson  she asks me many odd questions at times about myself and my dear joe and the babbythough i admit she dont inquire much about my past life  well thats not surprising said mrs bright with a laugh as she sat down on a stool to have a chat  you see maggie you havent got much of a past life to inquire about and joe is such a good man that youve no call to be suspecting anything but it wasnt always so with my dear david  i wouldnt say it even to you maggie if it wasnt that everybody in yarmouth knows itmy david drinks hard sometimes and although i know hes as true as gold to me an never broke the laws of the land everybody wont believe that you know and the dear man might fall under suspicion  but you dont suppose if he did said mrs davidson with a look of surprise that miss ruth would go about actin the part of a detective do you  well no i dont replied her friend looking somewhat puzzled  all the same it is mysterious why she should go on as shes bin doin asking me what my maiden name was and who my relations were and if i ever had any brothers and when and where i first met wi david  but whatever her reasons may be im resolved that shell get nothing more out of me  of course returned maggie you must do as you think right in that matter  all i can say is i would tell miss ruth all that was in my mind without any fear that shed abuse my confidence  ah  maggie i might say that too if my mind and conscience were as clear as yours  but theyre not  it is true i have long ago brought my sins to jesus and had them washed away in his precious blood  and i never cease to pray for my dear david butbut  dont you fear nell said mrs davidson earnestly and in a tone of encouragement  your prayer is sure to be answered  oh  maggie i try to believe itindeed i do  but when i see david go down to thatthat publichouse and come up the worse o liquor an sometimes little billy with him with a cigar in his sweet little mouth an the smell o drink on him my heart fails me for you know what an awful snare that drink is once it gets the upper handand  poor mrs bright fairly broke down at this point for a few seconds and no wonder for not even to her most confidential and sympathetic friend could she tell of the terrible change for the worse that came over her husband when the accursed firewater burned in his veins  nell said maggie laying her work in her lap and taking her friends hand  dont give way like that  god would never ask us to pray for one another if he didnt mean to answer us  would he now  thats true maggie thats true said mrs bright much comforted i never thought of that before  youre young but youre wise dear of course the good lord will never mock us and if theres anything i have asked for of late it has been the salvation of david and billy what was it maggie that made your joe first turn his thoughts to the lord  it was one of his mates  you remember when he sailed wi that good man singin peter  well peter used often to speak to him about his soul to no purpose but that fine man luke trevor who also sailed wi singin peter at the time had a long talk with joe one night an the holy spirit made use of his words for joe broke down an gave in theyre both wi your david and billy now so you may be sure they wont throw away the chance they have of speakin to em  god grant them success murmured mrs bright earnestly  amen responded the younger woman  but nell you havent told me yet what you think o the miss seawards  think  i think that next to miss ruth they are the sweetest ladies i ever met returned mrs bright with enthusiasm  they are so modest and humble that when they are putting themselves about to serve you they almost make you feel that youre doing them a favour  dont you remember only last week when they came to see poor jakes boy that was nearly drowned and insisted on sitting up with him all nightfirst one and then the other taking her turn till daylight because mrs jake was deaddrunk and not able for anything  remember it exclaimed maggie i should think i does and the awful way mrs jake swore at them afore she rightly understood what was wrong  well did you hear what mrs jake said in the afternoon of that same day  noexcept that she was more civil to em so i was told  civil yes she was more civil indeed  shed got quite sober by the afternoon and the neighbours told her how near the boy was to death and that the doctor said if it hadnt been for the wise and prompt measures taken by the miss seawards before he arrived he didnt believe the boy would have livedwhen they told her that she said nothing when the miss seawards came back in the afternoon they tapped so gently at the door that you would have thought they were beggars who expected a scolding an when mrs jake cried out gruffly in her manlike voice whos that they replied as softly as if they had been doing some mischief may we come in  may you come in shouted mrs jake so that you might have heard her half way down the street as she flung the door wide open may angels from heaven come in yes you may come in an with that she seized the younger one round the neck an fairly hugged her for you see mrs jake has strong feelins an is very fond of her boy an then she went flop down on a chair threw her apron over her head and howled  i can call it by no other name  the poor ladies were almost scared and didnt seem rightly to know how to take it and miss katethe younger one you knowhad her pretty new summer dress awfully crushed by the squeeze as well as dirtied for mrs jake had been washin besides cleaning up a bit just before they arrived  well i never exclaimed maggie in great admiration  i always thought there was a soft spot in mrs jakes heart if only a body could find it out  my dear said mrs bright impressively theres a soft spot i believe in everybodys heart though in some hearts its pretty well choked up an overlaid  at that moment a bursting yell from the crib behind the door went straight to the soft spot in mrs davidsons heart and sank deeply into it  that blessed babby she cried leaping up in such haste that her work went into the grate in which however there was happily no fire  oh my darling youre joe to the backbonethough you are a girl all bounce an bang an tenderness  seizing the infant in her strong arms she gave it a hug which ought to have produced another yell but the little one was tough besides which she was used to it and said nothing  the calm did not last long however  little mag as she was called felt that her interior somewhere was somehow in want of something and took the usual way to publish the fact  after that conversation became impossible  a storm had burst upon the friends which increased rapidly so mrs bright rose to say goodbye in the midst of a squall which ought to have blown her through the doorway or out at the window into the street  she was not irritated however as she left the house followed by the squall which was soon moderated to a stiffish breeze by distance the sound called up reminiscences of little billy and she smiled as she thought of the unvarying continuity of human affairsthe gush of infant memories and the squalls of other days    chapter sixteen  temptation on the deep  let us return once more to the north sea  it was drawing towards the close of another fishing period and the crew of the evening star were beginning to think of the pleasures of their week on shore when one afternoon their vessel found herself becalmed near to the dutch mantrapthe vessel laden with that greatest of the worlds cursesstrong drink  it is usual we believe in ordinary warfare that on the eve of a great battle there should be preparations and indications more or less obvious of the coming fight but it is not always so in spiritual warfare  sometimes the hardest and most important battles of the great war are fought on unselected ground the assault having been delivered unexpectedly and when the soul was off its guard or perchance when it was presuming on fancied security and relying on its own might instead of the strength of the lord  so it was at this time with david bright skipper of the evening star  who would have thought as he sat that day on the rail of his little vessel calmly looking out to the horizon in anticipation of a good fishingbreeze that the mighty forces of good and evil were mustering unseen for a tremendous conflict on which perchance the angels were permitted to look down with interest and that the battlefield was to be the soul of that rugged fisherman of the north sea  he knew not little dreamed of what was pending but the captain of his salvation knew it all  there was but one entrance to that battlefieldthe gate of mans freewill  through that portal the powers of darkness must enter if they gained admittance at all  elsewhere the walls were high as heaven deeper than hell for except at this point the fortress was impregnable  yet although david bright knew not the power nor the number of the mighty forces that were marshalling he was not entirely ignorant of the war that was going on  there had been some skirmishing already in front of the gate in which he had come off victorious  the demon habit had assaulted him more than once and had pressed him sore for a terrible thirstsuch it is said as only confirmed drunkards understandhad more than once tormented him  when the first attack was made the sturdy fisherman stood quietly on his deck with hands in pockets and eyes on the horizon looking as if nothing were going on and he smiled grimly as he muttered to himself rather than to the demon lucky for me that i made billy heave it overboard  oh but said the demon you were a weak fool when you did that theres the coper alongside now go get another keg  it is cheap and you can just take a little drop to relieve that desperate craving come now be a man and show that you have powers of selfrestraint you have always boasted of the strength of your will havent you  show it now  ay an prove the strength of my will replied david with another grim smile by givin in to your will  no devil  i am a fool but not quite such a fool as that comes to  the demon fell back at that and left him  on the next attack the skipper was wornout with fatigue and watching they had had a long spell of dirty weather  work of the hardest kind even for a hardy framehad been done and there was still work to do and davids great physical powers were wellnigh used up  the gear was down and a stiff norwest breeze not only drove the smack over the surging waves but caused her to plunge into them like a wild horse bridled and held back  you cant hold out much longer at this rate whispered the demon take a drop just by way of a medicine to keep you awake and tide you over this bout and by good luck your man gunter has some grog left in that bottle he got yesterday from the coper  billy said david in a quiet voice without deigning a reply to his foe billy my lad you fetch me a pot o coffee or teawhatevers ready an let it be hot  yes father said billy hastening smartly to obey for he had a very slight suspicion of the conflict that was raging though his conceptions were far far short of the reality  the demon received a staggering blow that time and he slunk away scowling when he noted the gleam of satisfaction on the victors face as he handed back the empty pot to his son  warfare yes little do those who are dead in trespasses and sins and those who swim gaily with the current of selfindulgence know of the ferocious fights the raging storms that are going on all round them on battlegrounds which to all outward appearance are calm and undisturbed  but we have said that this was merely skirmishing outside the gate  it was not till the afternoon referred to at the beginning of this chapter that the grand assault was made  on that day the skipper of the evening star had been subjected to more than ordinary troubles  in the first place he had brought up a dead man in his net along with the fisha by no means unknown incident in trawlfishing experience for bodies of men who have been washed out of vessels in gales or drowned in other ways are sometimes entangled in the gear and brought to the surface  at other times bales and boxes goods that have been cast away or wreckedare fished up in this way  being in a depressed state of mind the sight of the dead man made david uncomfortable for a time but having thrown the corpse overboard again he soon forgot it  the next thing that happened was the fishing up of an enormous mass of wreckage which tore the net almost to pieces and compelled him to bend on a new one  this was not only a heavy loss of itself but entailed the loss of the fish that would otherwise have been in the net and poor david bright already at zero in his spirits sank considerably below that point  but the final disaster was reserved for a later hour  the new net had been shot and one of the best banks of the fishingground had been gone over  the breeze which had carried the fleet along was just beginning to die down when the admiral made the signal to haul up  to work they went thereforeall through the fleetto hoist in the harvest of the deep  it was slow and weary work as well as hard that hauling in of the great cable with its gear  between two or three hours they laboured and toiled at it while the thick veins stood out like cords on the mens necks and beads of perspiration trickled down their brows  its goin to be a big haul father said billy as the crew stopped for a few moments to rest  praps another lump of wreck replied the skipper somewhat bitterly  i hope not returned billy in a cheery voice resuming his work of passing the warp down below as it came off the capstan  at last the end of the bridle came inboard and the fishermen knew that their toil for that time at least was drawing to a close  excitement of a mild type began to arise in the enthusiastic and hopeful among them  now boys heave away said joe davidson setting the example  it seems unwillin to come dont it growled gunter  dats cause him full ob fishes said zulu heave away boys altogidder  he strained with all his might  so did the rest of the crew  round went the capstan and in a few minutes the great fortyeight feet beam appeared  this was soon hoisted up by means of tackle and made fast to the side and then began the hauling inwe might almost say clawing inof the net hand over hand until the codend was visible near the surface  it now became evident that a grand haul had indeed been made and that it had been the mere weight of the fish that had delayed them so long  great was the anxiety of course to secure the prize and energetic the action displayed  zulu being the most active and catlike was ordered to pass a rope round the net to which a powerful double block was applied  haul away now boys said the skipper whose spirits were somewhat revived by the sight  soon the great balloonshaped codend with its solid mass of fish rose slowly into the air and some of the men laid hold to be ready to swing it inboard and deposit it on the deck when suddenly the stout rope that bound the lower end of the bag gave way  the entire mass of fish dropped back into the sea and sank to the bottom  for a few seconds dead silence ensued while the men glanced at the empty codend and at each other  then a terrible oath burst from john gunter and a sort of sigh broke from some of the others as if words were incapable of expressing their feelingsas indeed they were  the skipper was standing by the companionhatch at the moment with a handspike in his grasp  a deeptoned curse issued from his lips when the fish went down and he dashed the handspike to the deck with fearful violence  once again at this critical moment the demon ventured to raise his head  the copers close on the port bow he whispered go drown it all in grog man and be jolly  jolly  how many men have cast away their souls for the sake of what is implied in that little word  and now alas the gate of mans freewill was creaking on its hinges no created power above or below could have moved that gate save the power of david bright himself  shove out the boat shouted the miserable man with a fierceness of expression and tone that there was no misunderstanding  poor billy understood it well enough  oh no father  dont do it father he cried in an entreating voice but already the little boat was dancing on the waves alongside with john gunter in her  jump in luke said joe davidson hastily for he was anxious that at least one trusty man should be of the party  luke jumped in at once and was instantly followed by billy  the painter was cast off and they pulled towards the floating grogshop  the tempter received them with a hearty salute  cheap spirits an cheap baccy said john gunter as he sat on the rail of the coper drinking the one and smoking the other thats what i likes an plenty of both  thats so john returned david bright who sat beside him and having already drained several bumpers of the fiery fluid had quite got over his troubles  you an i are of the same mind john nevertheless youre a great sulkyfaced humbug for all that  what dee mean by that demanded gunter who was becoming rapidly drunk and quarrelsome  what do i mean why i mean that youre the best man in the smack out o sight an its a rare pity that your mother hasnt got halfadozen more like you  if she had id man the evening star with your whole family  here give us a hold o your grappliniron old man  he seized gunters fist as he spoke and gave it a shake so hearty and powerful that he almost hurled that lover of cheap grog and baccy overboard  hold on skipper growled the fisherman who was for a moment uncertain whether to return the friendly grasp or fight but the fierce wild contemptuous laugh with which david bright concluded the speech decided him  yyouyoure a jolly good fellow he stammered here fill up again  the poor skipper filled up again and again until his speech began to grow thick and unsteady  yesh continued gunter doubling his fist and smiting his knee i do like sheap grog an sheap baccy an the copers the place to get em both  aint it  he looked up sharply at the owner of the coper who stood in front of him and who of course assented cheerfully to the question  aint it he repeated still more sharply turning to luke trevor who sat close to him with a grave anxious look  why dont you drink he added  because i dont want to returned luke quietly  ddodont want to returned gunter angrilyfor it takes little to make some drunk men angryyou dont want to spend your money you young miserthats what you mmean  an yet its sheap enough im sure  youll not git anything in the fleet so sheap as you will in the coper  there you are wrong returned luke decidedly  youll get things cheaper aboard the missionship for theyll give you physic an books an good advice and help as far as they can all for nothingwhich is cheaper than the copers wares  right you are luke  pitch into him cried david bright who was fast drinking himself into a state of madness  father whispered billy with an anxious look dont you think youve had enough  the reply to this was a tremendous cuff on the ear which sent the poor boy staggering backwards so that he nearly fell  recovering himself he retired behind the copers boat and tried to crush down the sobs that rose in his throat  he was to some extent successful but a few tears that could not be restrained hopped over his sunburnt cheeks  it was not pain nor even the indignity that drew forth those tears and choking sobs but the thought that the father he was so fond of had dealt the blow  meanwhile luke trevor who felt that matters had reached a dangerous point rose and went to the place where the boats painter had been tied  david bright was sitting close to the spot  dont you think it is time we were going skipper he said respectfully as he laid his hand on the rope  no i dont replied the skipper sharply  leave go that rope  luke hesitated  instantly the enraged skipper leaped up and struck him a blow on the chest which knocked him down  at the same moment observing that gunter looked on with a leer of drunken amusement he transferred his wrath to him flung the remains of the spirits he had been drinking in the mans face and made a rush at him  fortunately gunter who had risen staggered and fell so that the skipper missed his aim and tumbled over him  in a moment gunter had regained his feet and prepared for combat but his adversarys head had struck on the side of the vessel and he lay stunned and helpless on the deck  luke who had recovered almost immediately now assisted gunter and billy to raise the prostrate man  it was not an easy matter to handle one whose frame was so heavy but with the assistance of the owner of the coper they managed it  its only a slight cut said billy looking anxiously round at trevor  ay lad it aint the cut or the blow as keeps him down but the grog come we must git him aboard sharp  haul up the boat gunter while i stop the leak in his skull  with a kerchief luke soon bound up the slight wound that the wretched man had received and then they tried to rouse him but the effort was in vain  david did indeed recover sufficient intelligence to be able to bellow once or twice for more grog but he could not be brought to the condition of helping himself in any way  whatll we do luke asked billy in a tone and with a look of deep distress as the huge form of his father lay a scarcely animate mass on the deck at his feet  we must get him aboard somehow  never fear billy my boy said luke cheerfully well get him aboard somehow  its not the first time ive had to do it  come along gunter lend a hand  not i said gunter with a drunken swagger  im not goin for an hour or more  oh yes you are returned luke dipping one of the copers buckets over the side and pulling it up full of water  no i aint  wholl make me  i will said luke and he sent the contents of the bucket straight into his comrades face  hooray shouted billy convulsed at once with delight and surprise at the suddenness of the act to say nothing of its violence  give it im lukepolish im off  luke did not however take the pugnacious boys advice instead of awaiting the attack of the enraged gunter he ran laughing round the capstan and defied him to catch him  gunter soon found after bruising his shins and elbows and stumbling over ropes etcetera that the effort was hopeless and gave it up  but ill pay you off wen i gits a hold of ee luke  you make sure o that he growled as he gave up the chase  all right gunter ill give you a chance tomorrow lad if youll only bear a hand wi the skipper just now  without another word gunter who was somewhat sobered by the cold bath went to where the skipper lay and attempted to raise him  being joined by the others the skipper was rolled to the side of the vessel and then lifted in a halfsitting position on to the rail where he was held in the grasp of gunter and the copers skipper while luke and billy jumping into the boat hauled it close under the spot  there was what billy called a nasty jobble of a sea on so that many difficulties met in the job they had in hand  these may be best stated by the actors themselves  now then boy haul up a bitever so little there too much ease off a bit  hold on  all right luke but she pitches about so that a feller cant hit the exact spot  look out now gunter said luke let im go so as hell come plump into my arms  not too soon else youll stand a chance o sendin us both through the bottom of the boat  no nor yet too late cried the anxious billy else hell go flop into the sea  it was nervous work for if he should go flop into the sea he would have been certain to go down like a stone  one or two attempts were made  the boat rising up from a hollow in the sea to a height of several feet surged close to where the men with their drunken burden stood  look out cried luke with arms extended and ten fingers in a clawlike position  now then growled gunter  but the treacherous wave fell short and david bright was on the point of being dropt into the sea when his friends fingers clawed him back to safety  better make fast a rope to him suggested billy in breathless anxiety  the skipper of the coper acted on the advice at once and made the end of a rope fast round brights waist  again the boat rose surged seaward then swooped towards the coper against which it would have been dashed but for the strong arms of luke it rose so high that the drunk man was for a moment on a level with the gunwale  it was too good a chance to be missed  shove roared gunter  over went the skipper into the arms of luke who lost his balance and both rolled into the bottom of the boat as it sank into the succeeding hollow  the danger being past poor billy signalised the event and at the same time relieved his feelings with a lusty cheer  in a very short time joe davidson steered the evening star close to their tossing boat  billy stood ready with the painter and the instant the sides touched he was over the rail like a monkey and made fast  the taking of the drunk man out of the boat was by no means so difficult as getting him into it had been  joe luke spivin and zulu as well as billy leaned over the side of the smack with their ten arms extended and their fifty fingers curled like crabs claws or grapplingirons ready to hook on and hold on  david brights extended and helpless form was held in position by gunter  when it came within reach the fifty fingers closed the boat surged away and david was safe though still held in suspense over the deep  but that was only for a moment  a good heave placed him on the vessels rail and another laid him on the deck  brought on board his own smack like a dead pig muttered gunter whose anger at the skipper rekindled when he saw him once more in safety  hes fifty times better than you even as he lies you surly old grampus cried billy with flushed cheeks and flashing eyes  come billy said joe davidson kindly lend a hand boy to carry him below  its a sad breakdown but rememberhes not past redemption  come  four of the fishermen raised the skipper in their strong arms and conveyed him to his own bunk where they left him to sleep off the effects of his debauch    chapter seventeen  converse in the cabinthe tempter againan accident  one night some days after the incident just recorded the evening star shot her gear in obedience to orders on the port hand and proceeded with the rest of the fleet to give a pressing invitation to those fish which inhabited that particular shoal in the north sea known to fishermen by the name of skimlico  the name when properly spelt runs thus schiermonikoog  but our fishermen with a happy disregard of orthography and perhaps with an eye to that brevity which is said to be the soul of wit prefer to call it skimlico  when the gear was down the men retired to their little cabin to refresh themselves with a meal and a pipe  the skipper who had recovered neither his spirits nor his selfrespect since his recent fall preferred to remain on deck  billy who had never lost either joined the revellers belowwith all the more satisfaction that evan the rescued mate of the sparrow was with them  out o the road zulu cried ned spivin pushing the cook aside and sitting down close to the fire ill have a bit o fish  he stuck on the end of his knife a piece of sole out of which the life had barely departed and held it up before the fire to roast  hand me a mug o tea an a biscuit zulu said joe davidson fill it up boy  i like good measure  are them taters ready asked luke trevor  an the plumduff  you havent got any for us today have ee  shut up cried zulu  how many hands you tink ive got  eight at the very least said spivin an i can prove it  how you do dat asked zulu opening up his great eyes  easy  hold out your paws  isnt that one hand  pointing to his left  yes  an doesnt that make two hands  pointing to his right  yes  well aint one hand and two hands equal to three hands you booby an dont you know that monkeys have hands instead o feet  so as youre a monkey thats six hands  and havent you a handsome face an a handsome figgur which is eight you grampus  come use one o your many hands an pass the biscuits  sartinly said zulu at once kicking a small bit of biscuit which spivin still held in his hand to the other end of the cabin where it fell into the lap of trevor who thanked zulu kindly and ate it up  oh forgib me massa cried zulu in mock repentance  is nebber nebber do it again  but you know you ax me to use one o my hands to pass de biskit  well i bey orders  i use im an pass de biskit on to luke  come ned zulus more than a match for you there  let him alone cried joe davidson and dont be so stingy with your sugar zulu here fill up again  the conversation at this point became what is sometimes styled general but was interrupted now and then as one and another of the men dropped into the anecdotal tone and thus secured undivided attention for a longer or shorter space according to his powers in storytelling  what a appetite youve got luke said joe as he helped his comrade to a second large plateful of salt beef potatoes and duff  hold on joe  ive a pretty fair appetite but am not quite up to that  nonsense luke youve only got to try  a man has no notion what e can do till e tries  ah thats true said ned spivin checking a lump of salt beef on the end of his claspknife half way to his mouth did i ever tell ee lads that little hanecdote about a man we called glutton he was such an awful eater  no never heard on it said several voices  well then this is ow it was said spivin clearing his voice  you must know i was once in callyforny where all the goold comes from  me an most o my mates had runned away from our ship to the diggins you see which of course none on us would have thought of doinoh dear noif it hadnt bin that the skipper runned away too so it was no use for us to stop behind dee see  well we was diggin one day in a place where there was a lot o red injinsnot steam engines you know but the sort o niggers what lives out there  one o them injins was named gluttonhe was such an awful eaterand one o my mates whose name was samson bet a bag o goolddust that hed make the glutton eat till he busted  im afeard that samson was groggy at the time howiver we took him up an invited glutton to a feast next day  he was a great thin savage over six futt high with plenty breadth of beam about the shoulders and a mouth that seemed made a purpus for shovellin wittles into  we laid in lots of grub because we was all more or less given to feedinan some of us not bad hands at it before we began the feast samson who seemed to be repentin of his bet took us aone side an says now mind says he i cant say exactly how hell bust or when hell bust or what sort of a bust hell make of it  oh never mind that says we laughin  we wont be partickler how he does it  if he busts at all in any fashion well be satisfied and admit that youve won  well we went to work an the way that injin went in for grub was quite awful  you wouldnt have believed it if youd seen it  praps not said zulu with a grin  an when wed all finished we sat glarin at him some of us half believin that hed really go off but he took no notice  on he went until hed finished a small leg o pork two wildducks six plover eight mugs o tea an fifteen hardboiled eggs  but there was no sign o bustin  glutton was as slim to look at as before he began  at this pint samson got up an went out o the hut  in a minute or so he came back with a bark basket quite shallow but about fourteen inches square an full of all kinds of eggsfor the wildbirds was breedin at the time  whats that for says we  for glutton when hes ready for em says he  theres six dozen here an if that dont do it ive got another basket ready outside  with that he sets the basket down in front o the injin who just gave a glance at it over a goose drumstick he was tearin away at  well samson turned round to sit down in his place again when somethin or other caught hold of his foot tripped him up an down he sat squash into the basket of eggs  you niver did see sich a mess  there was sich a lot an samson was so heavy that the yolks squirted up all round him an a lot of it went slap into some of our faces  for one moment we sat glarin we was so took by surprise and glutton was so tickled that he gave a great roar of laughter an swayed himself from side to side an fore an aft like a dutchman in a cross sea  of course we joined him  we couldnt help it but we was brought up in the middle by samson sayin while he scraped himself well boys ive won  won says i how so  he aint busted yet  hasnt he cried samson  hasnt he gone on eatin till he busted out larfin  we was real mad at im for a course that wasnt the kind o bustin we meant and the end of it was that we spent the most o that night disputin the pint whether samson had lost or won  we continued the dispute every night for a month an sometimes had a free fight over it by way of a change but i dont think it was ever settled  leastways it wasnt up to the time when i left the country  here zulu hand me a mug o tea said billy bright the biggest one youve got  whats make you turn so greedy asked zulu  its not greed returned billy but neds little story is so hard an tough that i cant get it down dry  i should think not  it would take the glutton himself to swallow it with a bucket of tea to wash it down said luke trevor  at this point the conversation was interrupted by an order from the skipper to go on deck and jibe the smack an operation which it would be difficult as well as unprofitable to explain to landsmen  when it was completed the men returned to the little cabin where conversation was resumed  wholl spin us a yarn now something more believable than the last asked billy as they began to refill pipes  do it yourself boy said joe  not i  never was a good hand at it returned billy but i know that the mate o the sparrow there can spin a good yarn  come evan tell us about that dead man what came up to point out his own murderer  im not sure said evan that the story is a true one though theres truth at the bottom of it for we all know well enough that we sometimes pick up a corpse in our nets  know it exclaimed joe i should think we do  why its not so long ago that i picked one up myself  but what were ye goin to say mate  i was goin to say that this yarn tells of what happened long before you an me was born so we cant be wery sure on it you know  why not interrupted ned spivin  the battle o trafalgar happened long before you an me was born so did the battle o waterloo yet were sure enough about them aint we  right you are ned returned evan it would be a bad lookout for the world if we couldnt believe or prove the truth of things that happened before we was born  come shut up your argiments growled gunter an let evan go on wi his yarn  well as i was agoin to say resumed evan the story may or may not be true but its possible an it was told to me when i was a boy by the old fisherman as said he saw the dead man hisself  one stormy night the fleet was outfor you must know the fishin was carried on in the old days in the same way pretty much though they hadnt steamers to help em like we has now  they was goin along closehauled with a heavy sea on not far it must have been from the silver pitsthough they wasnt discovered at that time  we may interrupt evan here to explain that the silver pits is a name given to a particular part of the north sea which is frequented by immense numbers of soles  the man who by chance discovered the spot kept his secret it is said long enough to enable him to make a considerable amount of money  it was observed however that he was in the habit of falling behind the fleet frequently and turning up with splendid hauls of prime fish  this led to the discovery of his haunt and the spot named the silver pits is still a prolific fishingground  well continued evan there was a sort of half furriner aboard  he wasnt a reglar fishermannever served his apprenticeship to it you knowan was named zola  the skipper whose name was john dewks couldnt abide him an they often used to quarrel specially when they was in liquor  there was nobody on deck that night except the skipper and zola but my old frienddawson was his namewas in his bunk lyin wide awake  he heard that zola an the skipper was disputin about somethin but couldnt make out what was saidonly he knowd they was both very angry  at last he heard the skipper say sharplyha would you dare  yes i vill dare cries zola in his broken english i vill cut your throat  with that there seemed to be a kind of scuffle  then there was a loud cry and dawson with the other men rushed on deck  oh cried zola lookin wild de skipper him fall into de sea quick out wid de boat  some ran to the boat but the mate stopped em  its no use boys she couldnt live in such a sea an our poor skipper is fathoms down by this time  it would only sacrifice more lives to try  this was true dawson said for the night was as dark as pitch an a heavy sea on  dawson went to the man an whispered in his ear  you know you are lying zola you cut the skippers throat  no i didnt he felled overboard answered the man in such an earnest tone that dawsons opinion was shook  but next day when they was at breakfast he noticed that the point of zolas claspknife was broken off  hallo  zola says he whats broke the point of your knife  the man was much confused but replied quickly enough that he broke it when cleaning fishit had dropped on the deck an broke  this brought back all dawsons suspicion but as he could prove nothing he thought it best to hold his tongue  that afternoon however it fell calm an they found themselves close aboard of one of the smacks which had sailed astern of them on the port quarter durin the night  she appeared to be signallin so the mate hoveto till he came up  weve got the body o your skipper aboard they said when near enough to hail  dawson looked at zola  his lips were compressed and he was very stern but said nothin  nobody spoke except the mate who told them to shove out the boat and fetch the body  this was done and it was found that the poor man had been wounded in the breast  murdered the men whispered as they looked at zola  why you looks at me so he says fiercely skipper falls over an sink git among wrecks at de bottom an a nail scratch him  nobody answered but when the corpse was put down in the hold the mate examined it and found the broken point of zolas knife stickin in the breastbone  that night at supper while they were all eatin an talkin in low tones the mate said in an easy offhand tone hand me your knife zola for a moment  now his askin that was so naturallike that the man at once did what he was asked though next moment he saw the mistake  his greatest mistake however was that he did not fling the knife away when he found it was broken but they do say that murder will out  the mate at once fitted the point to the broken knife  zola leaped up and tried to snatch another knife from one o the men but they was too quick for him  he was seized and his hands tied and they were leadin him along the deck to put him in the hold when he burst from them and jumped overboard  they hoveto at once an out with the boat but never saw zola again he must have gone down like a stone  that was a terrible end said joe and him all unprepared to die  true joe but are we all prepared to die rejoined evan looking around earnestly  it is said that theres a day comin when the sea shall give up all its dead and the secrets of men whatever they are shall be revealed  from this point evan whose earnest spirit was always hungering after the souls of men led the conversation to religious subjects and got his audience into a serious attentive state of mind  we have said that david bright had remained that light on deck but he did not on that account lose all that went on in the little cabin  he heard indeed the light conversation and chaff of the earlier part of the night but paid no heed to it  when however evan began the foregoing anecdote his attention was aroused and as the speaker sat close to the foot of the companion every word he uttered was audible on deck  at the time our fallen skipper was giving way to despair  he had been so thoroughly determined to give up drink had been so confident of the power of his really strong will and had begun the struggle so well and also continued for a time so successfully that this fall had quite overwhelmed him  it was such a thorough fall too accompanied by such violence to his poor boy and to one of his best men that he had no heart for another effort  and once again the demon tempter came to him as he stood alone there and helpless on the deserted deck  a faint gleam of light shooting up the companion illuminated his pale but stern features which had an unusual expression on them but no eye was there to look upon those features save the allsearching eye of god  it was soon over with him he muttered as he listened to evan telling of zolas leap into the sea  an a good riddance to myself as well as to the world it would be if i followed his example  i could drop quietly over an theyd never find it out tillbut  come dont hesitate whispered the demon  i thought you were a man once but now you seem to be a coward after all  it was at this critical point that evan the mate of the sparrow all ignorant of the eager listener overhead began to urge repentance on his unbelieving comrades and pointed to the crucified oneshowing that no sinner was beyond hope that peter had denied his master with oaths and curses and that even the thief on the cross had life enough left for a saving look  we have nothing to do lads only to submit he said earnestly  nothing to do thought david bright in surprise not unmingled with contempt as he thought of the terrible fight he had gone through before his fall  nothing to do exclaimed john gunter in the cabin echoing as it were the skippers thought with much of his surprise and much more of his contempt  why mate i thought that you religious folk felt bound to pray an sing an preach an work  no ladnonot for salvation returned evan we have only to accept salvationto cease from refusing it and scorning it  after we have got it from and in jesus we will pray and sing and work ay an preach too if we can for the love of the master who loved us and gave himself for us  light began to break in on the dark mind of david bright as he listened to these words and earnestly did he ponder them long after the speaker and the rest of the crew had turned in  daylight began to flow softly over the sea like a mellow influence from the better land when the net was hauled  soon the light intensified and showed the rest of the fleet floating around in all directions and busily engaged in the same worktwo of the nearest vessels being the mission smack and that of singing peter ere long the fish were cleaned packed put on board the steamer and off to market  by that time a dead calm prevailed compelling the fishermen to take things easy  billy said david bright fetch me that bit of wood and a hatchet  billy obeyed  now then lets see how well youll cut that down to the size o this trunkto fit on where that bit has bin tore off  the skipper was seated on a pile of boxes he flung his left hand with a careless swing on the fishbox on which billy was about to cut the piece of wood and pointed to the trunk which needed repair  billy raised the axe and brought it down with the precision and vigour peculiar to him  instead of slicing off a lamp of wood however the hatchet struck a hard knot glanced off and came down on his fathers open palm into which it cut deeply  oh father exclaimed the poor boy dropping the axe and standing as if petrified with horror as the blood spouted from the gaping wound flowed over the fishbox and bespattered the deck  he could say no more  shove out the boat boys said the skipper promptly as he shut up the wounded hand and bound it tightly in that position with his pockethandkerchief to stop the bleeding  joe davidson who had seen the accident and at once understood what was wanted sprang to the boat at the same moment with luke and spivin  a good heave at the tackle a hearty shove with strong shoulders and the stern was over the rail  another shove and it was in the sea  lucky we are so close to her said joe as he jumped into the boat followed by luke and gunter  lucky indeed responded luke  somehow david bright managed to roll or jump or scramble into his boat as smartly with one hand as with two  it is a rare school out there on the north sea for the practice of freehand gymnastics  bear away for the mission smack joe  no need to give joe that order  ere the words had well passed the skippers lips he and luke trevor were bending their powerful backs and with little billy at the steering oar the boat of the evening star went bounding over the waves towards the fishermans floating refuge for wounded bodies and souls    chapter eighteen  a day of calm followed by a night of storm  a finetoned manly voice was heard as the boat approached the mission smack singing one of the popular hymns which are now pretty wellknown throughout the fishing fleets  no mistaking that voice said david bright turning an amused look on billy singin peter wont knock off till hes under the sod or under the sea  then hell never knock off at all returned billy for luke there has bin tellin me that we only begin to sing rightly a song of praise that will never end when we git into the next world  that depends lad on whether we goes up or down  well i spose it does  but tell me daddy aint the hand very bad im so awful sorry you know  it might ha bin worse billy but dont you take on so my boy  well be all right an shipshape when we gets it spliced or fixed up somehow on board the missionship  the hand was not however so easily fixed up as david bright seemed to expect  come down an lets have a look at it david said the skipper when the vessels deck was gained  by that time singing peter had stopped his tune or rather he had changed it into a note of earnest sympathy for he was a very tenderhearted man and on terms of warm friendship with the master of the evening star  its a bad cut said peter when the gaping gash in the poor mans palm was laid bare and the blood began to flow afresh  well have to try a little o the surgeons business here  you can take a stitch in human flesh i daresay skipper  if you cant ill try  the mission skipper was however equal to the occasion  he sponged the wound clean put a couple of stitches in it with sailorlike neatness whether with surgeonlike exactness we cannot telldrew the edges of the wound still more closely together by means of strips of sticking plaster applied lint and bandages and finally did up our skippers fist in a manner that seemed quite artistic to the observant men around him  a regular boxinglove exclaimed david hitting the operator a gentle tap on the nose with it  thank ee friend said the amateur surgeon as he proceeded to restow his materials in the medicine chest you know that the fishermens mission never asks a rap for its services but neither does it expect to receive a rap without asking  come david you mustnt flourish it about like that  we all know youre a plucky fellow but itll never splice properly if you go on so  hold on mr missionary cried gunter as the lid of the chest was being closed dont shut up yet  i wants some o your doctors stuff  all right my hearty  what do you want  he wants a pair o eyeglasses cried billy whose heart was comforted and whose spirits were raised by the success of the operation on his fathers hand you see hes so shortsighted that he cant see no good in nobody but hisself  shut up you young catfish  see here said gunter stretching out his wrists which were red and much swollen  oh  i can give you something for that so saying the skipper supplied the fisherman with a little ointment and then going to a cupboard produced a pair of worsted cuffs  you rub em well with that first he said an then wear the cuffs  hell want more cuffs than that said billy  i think not my boy said the skipper with a benignant look as he stooped to lock the chest  when these are wornout he can have more  well if youd take my advice returned billy youd give him another pair  a cuff on each side of his head would do him a world of good  gunter turned sharply to make a grasp at his young tormentor but the lad had taken care to have the cabin table between them and at once sprang laughing up the companion  hes a smart boy that remarked the mission skipper  rather too smart growled gunter as he pocketed his salve and cuffs and went on deck  smart enough remarked david bright with a low chuckle of satisfaction  come now said the missionary youll stop and have some coffee or cocoa with us  you cant work wi that hand you know  besides therell be no fishin till this calms over  so we mean to have a little meetin in the afternoon  were in luck too just now he added in a lower voice for weve got a real parson aboard  thats him talkin to my mate  hes here on a visitpartly for his health i believea regular clergyman of the church of england and a splendid preacher let me tell you  youll stop now wont you  david brights countenance grew sad  the memory of his recent failure and fall came over him  whats the use o me attendin your meetins he said almost angrily my souls past recovery for i dont believe in your prayin an psalmsingin  you trusted me freely wi your hand david though im no surgeon  why wont you trust me a little wi your soul though im no parson especially as it seems to be in a very bad way by your own account have a talk wi the parson  hes got such a way with him that hes sure to do you good  it was not so much the words thus spoken as the grave kind sensible tones and looks which accompanied them that won the despairing fisherman  well ill stop he said with a short laugh the cocoa may do me good even though the meetin dont  now youre becoming soft and unmanlya regular old wife whispered the demon who had watched him anxiously throughout the whole morning  the boats alongside father billy called out at that moment down the open skylight  thats right replied the father in a strong hearty voice  you go aboard wi the rest my boy an come back in the arternoon when you see em hoist the missionflag  im goin to stop aboard an well all attend the meetin together  an look you billy fetch my noo testament with eethe one your mother gave me  praise the lord for these words said the mission skipper  he did not say it very loud for he was not by nature a demonstrative man neither did he whisper it for he was not ashamed to thank his god for mercies received  at the same moment the demon fled away for that timeaccording to the true word resist the devil and he will flee from you  david bright did not talk much that afternoon  his injured hand gave him considerable pain but it was not that which silenced him  thoughts too deep for utterance were passing through his brain  it was the turningpoint of his life and while his mind was busy with the great issues that must be faced sooner or later by all mankind he listened with mingled surprise hope fear and pleasure to the free and hearty converse of the godly crew of the gospelship as they discoursed pleasantly now of the homes in yarmouth or gorleston now of the home above or sang with stentorian voices some of the lively hymns that are happily current in the present day or prayed in the ungrammatical language and with the intense fervour of untutored but thoroughly earnest men  they thought that david was suffering from his injury and wisely let him alone though they occasionally gave him a cheering word and frequently plied him with hot cocoa which he preferred much he said to coffee  this may seem to some a rather incongruous way of presenting religious and secular things  it may be so but we are not careful to preserve congruity or to dilute our dish to please the palate of the fastidious this world is full of incongruities and we are endeavouring to present that portion of it now under consideration as it actually is at the present time  the heartiest the most genial and perhaps the noisiest fisherman there that day was the man whom we have referred to more than once as singing peter  it seemed as if he were intoxicated with joy and could not refrain from bursting into song in praise of redeeming love  but peter was by no means exclusive in his ideas  he could descend to the simple matters of this life when needful  like david bright he was a temporary visitor to the missionship and waited for the afternoon meeting peter possessed    a heart at leisure from itself   to soothe and sympathise  and found time to have a private talk with david whom he drew out so tenderly yet powerfully that he wormed from him the whole story of his spiritual as well as spirituous warfare  he even got him down into the cabin alone and when there proposed that they should pray together to this david at once agreed and the good man prayed with such simple fervour that david found himself ere long weeping like a child  that the prayer of singing peter was in harmony with his spirit was evident from the deep amen which he uttered at its conclusion  many a time peter he said grasping his friends hand as they rose from their knees many a time has my face bin washed wi salt water from the sea but its not often bin dabbled wi salt water from my eyes  in the afternoon the weather became unusually sultry and as the calm continued many of the fishingsmacks closed by imperceptible degrees around the missionship whose flag flying at the mizzen told that the worship of god was soon to begin  several of the other smacks also flew bethelflags  these belonged to the wholehearted ones who had fairly and boldly come out on the lords side  others drew near although they did not fly the flag  some of these belonged to the halfhearted who wanted medicines or books and were rather indifferent about the meeting though willing enough perhaps to remain to it  one way or another there was soon a long tail of boats floating astern of the gospelship and a goodly congregation on her deck  her skipper was very busy  books were being actively exchanged  one or two men wanted to sign the pledge  salves and plasters and pills were slightly in demand for even north sea fishermen tough though they be are subject to physical disturbance  at last the hour arrived and the heavybooted roughjacketed souwestered burly congregation adjourned to the hold where appropriately seated on fishtrunks they opened their hymnbooks and began to sing  they had a harmoniumprovided of course by the missionand it chanced that the mission skipper had music enough in him to play a simple accompaniment on it but the stronglunged congregation drowned it out in the first five minutes  then the invalid clergyman stood up and prayed and read a chapter of gods word after which he preacheday preached in a way that drew tears from some and hearty exclamations of thankfulness from others it was not the power of rhetoric or of eloquence though he possessed both so much as that mighty power which consists in being thoroughly and intensely earnest in what one says and in using a natural conversational tone  there were more signings of the temperance pledge after the service and one or two whose minds had been wavering before now came forward and offered to purchase bethelflags  others wanted to purchase testaments prayerbooks and gospel compassesthe latter being the invention of an ingenious christian  it consisted of a mariners compass drawn on cardboard with appropriate texts of gods word printed on the various points  the same ingenious gentleman has more recently constructed a spiritual chart so to speak on which are presented to the eye the various shoals and quicksands and rocks of sin and danger and temptation that beset the christian pilgrim as well as the streams rivers and channels that conduct him from the regions of darkness into the realms of light  all this took up so much time that it was getting dark when our fishermen began to go over the side and proceed to their several vessels  soon after that the aspect of nature entirely changed  the sultry calm gave place to a fast increasing breeze which raised white crests on the darkening waves  a dirty night were going to have of it remarked david bright to singing peter as he got into his tossing boat with some difficulty  its all in the masters hands replied peter looking up with a glad expression on his weatherworn face  with these words he left the mission smack and returned to his own vessel  the fishermen of the north sea had cause to remember that night for one of the worst gales of the season burst upon them  fishing was impossible  it was all that they could do to weather the gale  sails were split and torn rigging was damaged and spars were sprung or carried away  the wind howled as if millions of wicked spirits were yelling in the blast  the sea rose in wild commotion tossing the little smacks as if they had been corks and causing the straining timbers to groan and creak  many a deck was washed that night from stem to stern and when grey morning broke cold and dreary over the foaming sea not a few flags halfmast high told that some souls had gone to their account  disaster had also befallen many of the smacks  while some were greatly damaged a few were lost entirely with all their crews  singing peters vessel was among the lost  the brightening day revealed the fact that the wellknown craft had disappeared  it had sunk with all hands and the genial fishermans strong and tuneful voice had ceased for ever to reverberate over the north sea in order that it might for ever raise a louder and still more tuneful strain of deeptoned happiness among the harmonies of heaven    chapter nineteen  ruth finds that everything seems to go against her  anxiously did ruth dotropy await the return of captain bream to yarmouth and patiently did she refrain in the meantime from questioning mrs bright as to her history before marriage for that good womans objection to be so questioned was quite sufficient to check her sensitive spirit  but poor ruths enthusiastic hopes were doomed to disappointment at that time for only a few days after the captains departure she received a letter from him part of which ran as follows  dear miss ruthi am exceedingly sorry and almost ashamed to be obliged to say that i am unable to return to yarmouth for some weeks at least  the fact is that i have for a long time been engaged in a piece of businessa sort of searchwhich has caused me much anxiety and frequent disappointment  my lawyer however now thinks he has hit on the right clue so that i have good hope of being successful  in the meantime will you do your best to comfort the miss seawards in my absence and explain to them that nothing but necessity could make me leave them in the lurch in this fashion etcetera  how very provoking exclaimed ruth with a pretty little frown on her innocent face after reading the letter to her stately mother  why provoking dear asked mrs dotropy  surely we can enjoy the fine air of yarmouth without captain bream and although the dear miss seawards are very fond of him they will not pine or lose their health because of his absence for a short time  besides have they not that wonderful theological library to divert them  yes motherits not that but i was so anxious to find out  she stopped short  find out what child  well now mother i can not keep it from you any longer  i will tell you my little secret if you promise not to reveal it to any living soul  how absurd you are ruth  do you suppose that i shall go about the streets proclaiming your secret whatever it is to tom dick and harry even if it were worth telling much less when it is probably not worth remembering  of course i might let it slip you know by accident and when a thing slips there is no possibility of recovery as i said once to your dear father that time when he slipped off the end of the pier into the water and had to be fished up by the waistband of his trousers with grapplingirons i think they called themat all events they were very dangerouslooking things and ive often argued with himthough i hate argumentthat they might have gone into his body and killed him yet he would insist that being blunt the thing was out of the question though as i carefully explained to him the question had nothing to do with itbut it is useless arguing with you ruthi mean it was useless arguing with your father dear man for although he was as good as gold he had a very confused mind you know  what was it we were talking aboutoh yesyour secret  well what is it  with a flushed face and eager look ruth said mother i cannot help being convinced that mrs bright the fishermans wife is no other than captain breams lost sister  if you cannot help being convinced child it is of no use my attempting to reason with you  but why think of such nonsense  if she is what you suppose she must have been a miss bream before marriage  so she was exclaimed ruth with a look of triumph  i have found that outonly i fear that is not proof positive because you know although not a common name bream is by no means singular  well but she would have been a ladyoror would have had different manners if she had been captain breams sister objected mrs dotropy  that does not follow said ruth quickly  the captain may have risen from the ranks we cannot tell besides mrs bright is very refined both in manner and speech compared with those around her  i was on the point one day of asking if she had a brother when she seemed to draw up and cut the matter short so i have had to fall back on my original plan of trying to bring the two face to face which would at once settle the question for of course theyd know each other  dear child why make such a mystery about it said mrs dotropy why not tell the captain of your suspicion and ask him to go and see the woman  because it would be so cruel to raise his expectations mother and then perhaps find that i was wrong  it would disappoint him so terribly  but this reference to a search in his letter makes me feel almost sure he is searching for this lost sister  foolish child  it is a wild fancy of your romantic brain  who ever heard said the mother of a lawyer being employed to search for a sister  depend upon it this captain is in search of some deeda lost will or aan old parchment or a document of some sort perhaps referring to a mismanaged property or estate or fortune for things of that kind are often seen in the newspapers though how the newspapers come to find out about them all is more than i can understand  ive often wondered at it  ah your dear father used to say in his facetious way that he was lost in the times when he wanted to be let alone i dont mean advertised for as lost of course though he might have been for i have seen him lose his head frequently indeed i have been almost forced to the conclusion more than once that the times had a good deal to do with your fathers mental confusion it told such awful lies sometimes and then a month or two afterwards would flatly contradict them all by telling the truthat least it was probably the truth since it was the opposite of the lies but its of no use talking i always find that  what were you saying child  well mother i was going to say answered ruth with a sigh that i must just have patience and be content to wait  now you talk like the dear good sensible little thing that you are said mrs dotropy rising run put on your hat and ill walk with you by the sea or go visit the fisherfolk if you likeor the miss seawards  in this amiable frame of mind the mother and daughter set off to the shore  ruths patience was indeed tried more severely than she had anticipated for whatever the search was in which captain bream had engaged it compelled him to remain in town much longer than he had intended  meanwhile the evening star returned to port and david bright with billy joe and the rest of the crew went to enjoy themselves in their various ways during their brief holiday  mrs bright chanced to be spending the afternoon with mrs joe davidson and her wonderful babby when the skipper and mate walked in upon them there were two little shrieks of joy then the two wives were enfolded and for a few seconds lost to view in the stupendous embrace of the two fishermen while the babby was for the moment absolutely forgotten but she took care not to be forgotten long  on recovering from her first surprise she gave utterance to a howl worthy of a seamans daughter  joe immediately seized her in his arms and half smothered her in a fond embrace to which apparently she did not object  meanwhile little billy stood looking on approvingly with his hands in his pockets and his booted legs wide apart  i wonder when somebodys agoin to pay some sort of attention to me he said after a minute or two  why billy i didnt see ye cried mrs joe holding out her hand how are ye puss in boots  if it was any other female but yourself maggie as said that id scorn to notice you returned billy half indignant  my darling boy cried mrs bright turning to her son and enfolding him in her arms  ah thats the way to do it responded billy submitting to the embrace  youre the old ooman as knows how to give a feller a good hearty squeeze  but dont come it too strong mother else youll put me all out o shape  see daddys agoin to show hisself off  this last remark had reference to a small bundle which david bright was hastily untying  see here nell he said with a strange mixture of eagerness and modesty ive joined em at last old girl  look at that  he unrolled a mdsf flag which he had purchased from the skipper of the mission smack  an ive signed the pledge too lass  oh  david she exclaimed grasping her husbands right hand in both of hers  but her heart was too full for more  yes nell ive had grace given me to hoist the lords colours in the short blue an it was your little book as done it  id ha bin lost by now if it hadnt bin for the blessed word of god  again nell essayed to speak but the words refused to come  she laid her head on her husbands shoulder and wept for joy  we have said that david bright was not by nature given to the melting mood but his eyes grew dim and his voice faltered at this point and it is not improbable that there would have been a regular breakdown if joes blessed babby had not suddenly come to the rescue in the nick of time with one of her unexpected howls  as temporary neglect was the cause of her complaint it was of course easily cured  when quiet had been restored mrs bright turned to her sonnow billy my boy i must send you off immediately  but what if i wont go offlike a bad skyrocket said the boy with a doubtful expression on his face  but youll have to goand youll be willing enough too when i tell you that its to see miss ruth dotropy you are going  whatthe angel  yes shes here just now and wants to see you very much and made me promise to send you to her the moment you came home  so off you go she lives with her mother in the old place you know  all right i know  farewell mother  in a few minutes billy was out of sight and hearingwhich last implies a considerable distance for billys whistle was peculiarly loud and shrill  he fortunately had not to undergo the operation of being cleaned for this visit having already subjected himself to that process just before getting into port  the only portions of costume which he might have changed with propriety on reaching shore were his long boots but he was so fond of these that he meant to stick to them he said through thick and thin and had cleaned them up for the occasion  at the moment he turned into the street where his friends and admirers dwelt ruth chanced to be at the window while the miss seawards then on a visit to her mother were seated in the room  oh the darling exclaimed ruth with something almost like a little shriek of delight  which darlingyouve got so many asked her mother  oh  billy bright the sweet innocentlook at him quick  thus adjured the sisters ran laughing to the window but the stately mother sat still  dyou mean the boy with the boots on asked jessie who was shortsighted  yes yes thats him  if you had said the boots with the boy in them jessie observed kate you would have been nearer the mark  in a few minutes billy fully alive to his importance in the ladies eyes sat gravely in the midst of them answering rapid questions  youve not had tea billy i hope said ruth rising and ringing the bell  no miss i havent an if i had im always game for two teas  soon billy was engaged with bread butter cakes and jam besides other luxuries some of which he had never even dreamed of before  what an excellent appetite you have said jessie seaward scarcely able to restrain her admiration  yes maam said billy accepting another bun with much satisfaction we usually does pretty well in the short blue in that way though we dont have sich grub as this to tickle our gums with  you see we has a lot o fresh air out on the north sea an its pretty strong air too specially when it blows ard  wy ive seed it blow that ard that it was fit to tear the masts out of us an once it throwd us right over on our beamends  on what ends boy asked mrs dotropy who was beginning to feel interested in the selfsufficient little fisherman  our beamends maam  the beams as lie across under the deck so that wen we gits upon their ends you know were pretty well flat on the water  how dreadful exclaimed jessie but when that happens how can you walk the deck  we cant walk the deck maam  we has to scramble along the best way we can holdin on by hands and teeth and eyelids  thank ee miss but i really do think id better not try to eat any more  i feels chockfull already an it might be dangerous  theres severe laws now against overloadin you know  no such laws in this house billy said ruth with a laugh  but now if you have quite done i should like to put a few questions to you  fire away then miss said the boy looking exceedingly grave and wise  well billy began ruth with an eager look i want to know something about your dear mother  she hesitated at this point as if uncertain how to begin and the boy sought to encourage her withwery good miss i knows all about her what dee want to ax me  i want to ask said ruth slowly if you know what your mothers name was before she was married  ruth did not as the reader knows require to ask this question but she put it as a sort of feeler to ascertain how far billy might be inclined to assist her  well now that is a stumper exclaimed the boy smiting his little thigh  i didnt know as she had a name afore she was married leastwise i never thought of it or heerd on it not havin bin acquainted with her at that time  with a short laugh ruth said well never mind but perhaps you can tell me billy if your mother ever had a brother connected with the seaa sailor i mean  stumped again exclaimed the boy whod have thought i was so ignorant about my own mother  if she ever had sich a brother he must have bin drownded for i never heerd tell of im  then you never heard either your father or mother mention any other name than brighti mean in connection with yourselves said ruth in a disappointed tone  never miss as i can recklect on  i would willinly say yes to please you but id raither not tell no lies  thats right my good boy said mrs dotropy with a stately but approving nod for you know where all liars go to  yes maam an i knows where liars dont go to returned billy looking up with pious resignation whereat the miss seawards and ruth burst into a laugh  it must not be supposed that billy meant to be profane but he had taken a dislike to mrs dotropy and did not choose to be patronised by her  as poor ruth found that it was useless to pursue her investigations in this direction further she changed the subject to the north sea fishery with the details of which her little friend was of course quite conversant  then she proposed to accompany billy home  i want to make the acquaintance of your father she said  ah hes a true blue now he is said billy  was your father not always a true blue asked ruth as they went along the street together  well it aint right for me to say ought agin my fatherbuthes true blue now anyhow  and ruth found that the reformed drunkard was indeed true blue and very glad to see her nevertheless she obtained no information from him on the subject she was so anxious aboutnot because he was uncommunicative but because ruth being very timid had not courage to open her lips upon it  the shades of evening were beginning to descend when she rose to leave both father and son offered to escort her home but she declined the offer with many thanks and went off alone    chapter twenty  details two robberies and an awful situation  the attainment of felicity is said to be the aim of all mankind  in order to this end men in all ages have voluntarily submitted themselves to prolonged infelicity  they have toiled in daily pain and sorrow throughout a long life to attain at last if possible to the coveted condition  some have pursued it in eager intensity dancing and singing as they went  others have rushed after it in mad determination cursing and grumbling as they ran  many have sought it in rapt contemplation of the sublime and beautiful  thousands have grubbed and grovelled for it in the gratification or the drowning of the senses while not a few have sought and found it in simple loving submission to their makers will as made known by conscience and revelation  of all the varied methods john gunter the fisherman preferred the grubandgrovelling method and the favourite scene of his grovelling was a low grogshop in one of the lower parts of yarmouth  it must be said at this point that gunter was not considered by his mates as a regular outandout fisherman  he had never served his apprenticeship but being a powerful and sufficiently active seaman was tolerated among them  it is said that adversity makes strange bedfellows  it is not less true that strong drink makes strange companions  gunters shipmates having had more than enough of him on the sea were only too glad to get clear of him when on land  he therefore found himself obliged to look out for new companionships for it is certain that man yearns after sympathy of some sort and is not under ordinary circumstances content to be alone  the new friends he sought were not difficult to find  in one of the darkest corners of the publichouse referred to he found theman accidental groupconsisting of an exclerk an exparson and a burglar not ex as yet  they had met for the first time yet though widely separated as regards their training in life they had found the sympathetic level of drink in that dingy corner  of course it need hardly be said that the first two had swung far out of their proper orbits before coming into harmonious contact with the last  of course also no one of the three desired that his antecedents should be known there was not much chance indeed that the former occupations of the clerk or the parson would be guessed at for every scrap of respectability had long ago been washed out of them by drink and their greasy coats battered hats dirty and ragged linen were if possible lower in the scale of disreputability than the rough garments of the burglar  the subject of their conversation was suitable to all ages and countries to all kinds and conditions of men for it was politics  a fine healthy flexible subject so utterly incomprehensible to fuddled brains that it could be distended contracted inflated elongated and twisted to suit any circumstances or states of mind  and such grand scope too for difference or agreement of opinion  oh it was pitiful to see the idiotic expressions of these fallen men as they sat bound together by a mutual thirst which each abhorred yet loved and which none could shake off  and there was something outrageously absurd tooyes it is of no use attempting to shirk the factsomething intolerably funny in some of the gestures and tones with which they discussed the affairs of the nation  hail fellow well met was the generous tendency of gunters soul when ashore  accosting the three in gruff offhand tones with some such sentiment he sat down beside them  same to you pal said the burglar with a sinister glance at the newcomer from under his heavy brows  how do ol salt exclaimed the clerk who was by far the most tipsy of the three  come ere  well make you rfreeumpireto shettle zish dshpute  queshn is whether its the dooty of the poor to help the rishno zhats not it  wwether its dooty of rish to help the poorwhats itby sharin all they have with em or  thats not the question at all cried gunter grufflythe question is whatll you have to drink  bravo exclaimed the parson that is the question  youre a trump said the burglar  well exclaimed the clerk with a tremendous assumption of winkingdignity ishnt zhat zactly what i was goin to shay if youd ony listen  whatll you ave to drink jus so  now if you want to argue it out properly youll  he was checked and almost floored by a tremendous though facetious slap on the back from gunter who said that they wouldnt argue it out that they would drink it out first and argue it out afterwards  in pursuance of this plan he called the landlord and ordering spirits and water treated the assembled company all roundincluding a few bloated and wretched women some of whom carried children in their arms  whatever of the ludicrous might have struck an observer of the scene while listening to the above conversation it would have been all put to flight by the sight of these poor women and perchance by the thought that they had been brought up to that life had never known better and would never have a chance of knowing better unless some exceptional rays of heavenly light should penetrate the dark region in which they lived  praise be to god such rays do visit such haunts at times and brands are often plucked from the fire but with these we have nothing to do at present  our object just now is to trace the course of john gunter  you may be sure that one who spent his money so freely and at the same time drank heavily was not likely to escape the special attention of his new friend the burglar  that worthy besides being an expert in the heavier branches of his art was not unacquainted with its lighter work  he watched the fisherman narrowly observed in which pocket he kept his money waited until he was sufficiently drunk for his purpose and then picked his pockets at an engrossing moment when the clerk was unfolding a perfect scheme of national reform to the parson who with eyes shut and supposed to be listening intently was in reality fast asleep  his object accomplished the burglar said he would go out and have a look at the weather which he did and having quietly hidden his spoils he returned to report the weather all right and to make quite sure that he had left nothing whatever in any of gunters pockets  having satisfied himself on this point he was about to retire to take a final look at the weather when gunter saidhold on mate ave another glass  he felt in his pocket for the wherewith to pay for the drink and missed his money  he was by no means as drunk as he appeared to be and at once suspected his comrade  youve stole my blunt he shouted without a moments hesitation  youre a liar returned the burglar promptly  gunter was fierce by nature  he made no rejoinder but struck a blow at the other which would have felled him had it taken effect  the burglar however was a pugilist  he evaded the blow and returned it with such force that the fisherman staggered but recovered himself and grappled with his adversary  in a moment all was uproar and confusion benches were upset spittoons kicked about and pipes smashed as the two powerful men swayed about and tried fiercely to strangle each other  the women rushed screaming from the place the landlord and his assistants interfered but it was not until the police were called in that the combatants were separated then there occurred a violent scene of explanation allegation recrimination and retort during which the guardians of the peace attempted to throw oil on the troubled waters for it is always their aim we believe to quiet down drunken uproars when possible rather than to take up the rioters  as the burglar with an injured innocent look denied the charge made against him and turned all his pockets inside out in proof of his veracity gunter was fain to content himself with the supposition that he had lost his money in some incomprehensible manner  in a very sulky mood he flung out of the publichouse and sauntered away  he knew not where to go for he had no friends in yarmouthat least none who would have welcomed himand he had not wherewith to pay for a bed even in the poorest lodging  as he walked along conscience began to smite him but he was in no mood to listen to conscience  he silenced it and at the same time called himself with an oath a big fool  there is no question that he was right yet he would have denied the fact and fought any one else who should have ventured so to address him  the evening was beginning to grow dark as he turned down one of the narrow and lonely rows  now it so happened that this was one of the rows through which ruth dotropy had to pass on her way home  ruth was not naturally timid but when she suddenly beheld a halfdrunken man coming towards her and observed that no one else was near something like a flutter of anxiety agitated her breast  at the same moment something like a sledgehammer blow smote the concave side of john gunters bosom  shes got more than she needs he growled between his teeth an ive got nothin  as his conscience had been silenced this was a sufficient argument for john  ill thank you for a shillin miss he said confronting the now frightened girl after a hasty glance round  oh yes yeswillingly gasped poor ruth fumbling in her pocket for her purse  the purse however chanced to have been left at home  oh how provoking  i have not my purse with me but if these few pence will  never mind the pence miss said gunteraccepting the pence however as he spokethat nice little watch will do jist as well  he snatched the watch which hung at ruths waistbelt snapped the slender guard that held it and made off  when sufficiently out of danger of pursuit he paused under a lamp to examine his prize  to his intense disgust he found that the little watch instead of being a gold one as he had expected was only a silver one of comparatively little value  well your first haul in this line aint worth much he grumbled howsever ive got coppers enough for a nights lodgin an grub  saying which he pocketed the watch and went on his way  meanwhile ruth having given vent to a sob of relief when the man left her ran towards home as fast as she could never pausing till she reached the miss seawards door which chanced to be a little nearer than her own  against this she plunged with wonderful violence for one so gentle and tender and then hammered it with her knuckles in a way that would have done credit to a lightweight prizefighter  the door was opened hastily by liffie lee who being a much lighter weight than her assailant went down before her rush  lawk  miss ruth she exclaimed on recovering her feet wats aappened  but she asked the question of the empty air for ruth was already half sobbing half laughing on the sofa with a highly agitated sister on either side trying to calm her  oh what a little donkey i am she exclaimed flinging off her bonnet and attempting to laugh  what has happened gasped jessie  do tell us dear cried kate  iive been robbed by adreadful manso awfully gruff a sailor i think andoh  ruth became suddenly much calmer  it did not occur to me till this momentit is the watchpapas little silver watch that captain bream brought him as a sort of curiosity from abroad long ago  oh  i am so sorry  it was such a favourite with dear papa and he told me to take such care of it when he gave it to me for there was a romantic little history connected with it  what was it dear asked jessie glad to find that the sudden diversion of her thoughts to the lost watch had done more to calm ruth than all their demonstrative comfort  ruth at once proceeded to relate the story of the watch but we will not inflict it on the reader as it has no particular bearing on our tale it had something to do however with detaining ruth far later than she had intended to remain so that she jumped up hastily at last saying she must really go home  are you sure the robber was a sailor asked kate sailors are such dear nice men that i can hardly believe it  im almost quite sure returned ruth at all events he was dressed like oneand oh he was so gruff  from this point ruth diverged into further and more minute details of the robbery over which the three gloated with a species of fascination which is more frequently associated with ghost stories than true tales indeed we may say that four gloated over it for liffie lee unable to restrain her curiosity put her head in at the doorat first with the more or less honest intention of asking if hany think was wanted and afterwards let her head remain from sheer inability to withdraw it  at one point in the thrilling narrative she became intensely excited and when ruth tried in sepulchral tones to imitate john gunters gruff voice she exclaimed oh lawks in such a gasp that the three ladies leaped up with three shrieks like three consciencesmitten kittens caught in a guilty act  liffie was rebuked but from pity or perhaps sympathy was allowed to remain to hear the end  when that point was reached it was found to be so late that the streets were almost deserted and the particular part in which their lodging stood was dreadfully silent  how am i ever to get home asked ruth  it is not more than twenty doors off said kate and liffie will go with you  lawks maam said liffie what could the likes o me do if we was attacked  an theni should ave to return alone  that is true said the tenderhearted jessie what is to be done our landlady goes to bed early  it would never do to rouse herand then she may perhaps be as great a coward as we are  oh if there was only a man in the house  even a boy would do  ah  i jist think e would said liffie  if little billy was ere i wouldnt ax for no man  ill tell you what said kate with a bright look of decision well all go together  get on your bonnet jessie  there was no resisting kate when once she had made up her mind  she put on her own bonnet and her sister quickly returned ready with a heart as byron says for any fate  now dont speak any of you whispered kate  if we are attacked let us give a united shriek  that will raise some one to our aid  i should think it would maam  it would amost raise the dead said liffie who also prepared herself for the ordeal  dark and deserted streets at late hours with dangerous characters known to be abroad have terrors to some small extent even for the averagely brave what must they have then for those tender ones of the weaker sex whose spirits are gentle perhaps timid and whose nerves have been highly strung by much converse on subjects relating to violence  the first shock experienced by our quartette was caused by the door from some inscrutable impulse liffie lee had locked it after ruth had rushed in  open it gently whispered jessie for the party had now got to the condition of feeling very much as if they were themselves burglars engaged in some unholy enterprise and feared to arouse sleepers  but they need not have feared for their landlady was one of the seven sleepers of yarmouth  liffie exerted her little strength with caution but the lock was stiff it would not move  she screwed up her mouth and putto more strength still it would not move  screwing up her eyebrows as well as her mouth she tried again  it would not budge  she even screwed up her nose in a stupendous effort but all in vain  if there had been no need for caution the thing would have been easy but jessie kept whispering softly liffie softly and ruth echoed softly  at last liffie screwed herself up entirely body and soul in one supreme effort she agonised with the key  it yielded and the bolt flew back with a crack like a pistolshot  oh burst in four different keysnot doorkeysfrom the partyunder their breath however  open whispered jessie  liffie obeyed and when the halfopened door revealed intense darkness outside a feeling of horror caused their very flesh to creep  how i wish i hadnt stayed  ill never do it again whispered poor ruth in the tones of a child about to be punished  whats that exclaimed jessie with a start that caused ruth almost to shriek  cats said liffie lee  impossible said kate  but it was not impossible for there in a corner not far off were dimly seen two intensely black objects with backs and tails arranged on the moorisharch principle and a species of low thunder issuing from them suggestive of dynamite in the stomach  relieved to find it was nothing worse the party emerged into the street  the cats were too much enraged and engaged with each other to observe them  they like the ladies were evidently cowards for they continued to threaten without attacking  liffie was left on guard with strict injunctions to stand inside hold tight to the doorhandle let in the returning sisters and then slam the door in the face of all the world beside  a run was now made for the dotropy residence  we could not call it a rush for the three ladies were too light and elegant in form to proceed in such a manner  they tripped itif we may say soon light fantastic toe though with something of unseemly haste  ruth being young and active reached the door first and as before went with a rebounding bang against it  the anxious mrs dotropy had been for some time on the watch  she opened the door  ruth  mamma  your daughter exclaimed the miss seawards in needless explanation as they pushed her in and then turning round fled homeward with so much noise that the attention of a night watchman was naturally attracted the sisters heard his approaching footfalls  they put on in sporting language a spurt  just as the door was reached the two cats becoming suddenly brave filled the nightair with yells as of infants in agony an irrepressible shriek burst from the sisters as they tripped over each other into the passage and the faithful liffie slammed the door in the face of the discomfited policeman  it was a crucial test of friendship and the miss seawards came to the conclusion that night before retiring to rest that nothing on earth would ever induce them to do it again    chapter twenty one  a hopeful club discovered  when captain bream as before mentioned was obliged to hurry off to london and forsake the miss seawards as well as his theological studies he hastened to that portion of the city where merchants and brokers and moneylenders and men of the law do love to congregate  turning down cheapside the captain sought for one of the many labyrinths of narrow streets and lanes that blush unseen in that busy part of the great hive  only a penny sir only a penny  the speaker was an illconditioned man and the object offered for sale was a climbing monkey of easily deranged mechanism  do you suppose said the captain who being full of anxious thought was for the moment irascible do you suppose that i am a baby  oh dear no sir  from appearances i should say youve bin weaned some little timeonly a penny sir  a nice little gift for the missus sir if you aint got no childn  can you direct me said the captain with a bland lookfor his tempers were shortlivedto brockley court  first to the left sir second to the right straight on an ask againonly a penny sir climbs like all alive sir  dropping a penny into the mans hand with a hope that it might help the monkeys to climb captain bream turned into the labyrinth and soon after found himself in a dark little room which was surrounded by piles of japanned tin boxes and littered with bundles of documents betokening the daily haunt of a manoflaw  the lawyer himselfa bland man with a rugged head a roman nose and a sharp eyesat on a hardbottomed chair in front of a square desk  why should business men by the way subject themselves to voluntary martyrdom by using polished seats of hardwood  is it with a view to doing penance for the sins of the class to which they belong  have you found her mr saker asked captain bream eagerly on entering  no not got quite so far as that yetpray sit down but we have reason to believe that we have got a cluea slight one indeed but then the information we have to go upon in our profession is frequently very slightvery slight indeed  true too true assented the captain  i sometimes wonder how with so little to work on at times you ever begin to go about an investigation  the lawyer smiled modestly in acknowledgment of the implied compliment  we do indeed proceed on our investigations occasionally with exceeding little information to go upon but then my dear sir investigation may be said to be a branch of our profession for which we are in a manner specially trained  let me see now  he took up a paper and opening it began to read with a running commentary  fair hair slightly grey delicate features complexion rather pale brown eyes gentle manners  thats herthats her from the captain  age apparently a little over thirty  you said i think that your sister was  yes yes interrupted the captain in some excitement she was considerably younger than me poor girl  let me however caution you my dear sir not to be too sanguine said the manoflaw looking over his spectacles at his client you have no idea how deceptive descriptions are  people are so prone to receive them according to their desires rather than according to fact  well but returned the captain with some asperity you tell me that this woman has fair hair slightly grey delicate features pale complexion brown eyes and gentle manners all of which are facts  true my dear sir but they are facts applicable to many women replied the solicitor  still i confess i have some hope that we have hit upon the right scent at last  if you could only have given us the name of her husband our difficulty would have been comparatively slight  i suppose you have no means of hunting that up now  no distant relative or  no none whatever  all my relations are dead  she lived with an old aunt at the time who died soon after the poor girls foolish elopement leaving no reference to the matter behind her  it is now fifteen years since then  i was away on a long voyage at the time  on my return the old lady as i have said was dead and her neighbours knew nothing except that my sister was reported to have run away with a seafaring man  some who had seen him about the place said he seemed to be beneath her in station but none knew his name  is it not strange asked the solicitor that she has never in all these years made inquiries about you at the mercantile house which employed you  well not so strange as it would seem for my sisters memory for names was a bad one  she used constantly to forget the name of the ship i commanded and as far as i can remember did not trouble herself about the owners  i have no doubt she must have made many efforts to discover meunless she was ashamed of having made a low match  at all events added the captain with a weary sigh i have never ceased to make inquiries about her although i have not until now made the attempt through a lawyer  but where is this person you have heard of to be found  on board of an emigrant ship said the solicitor  where bound for demanded the captain in peat surprise  for australia and she sails the day after tomorrow i am told  her name cried the captain starting up  calm yourself my dear sir  i have made all needful arrangements for your going off tomorrow  it is too late today  sit down and let me explain and above all bear in mind that this may turn out to be a wrong scent after all  of course you may surmise that we lawyers obtain our information from many and various sources  the source whence the information concerning your matter has come is peculiar namely a laymissionary who is going to visit the ship tomorrowhaving some friends on board  happening to meet the man the other day i mentioned your matter to him  he is a very sharpwitted man and one whose accuracy of observation i should trust implicitly even if his own interests were involved  well he said that on board of the steamship talisman now lying off gravesend he saw that very day a woman among the steerage emigrants who answered to my description exactly and added that he had heard her spoken of as the wife of a somewhat dissipated man who had all the appearance of a seafaring person named richards of course i attach no importance to the name as you say you never knew it but his being a sailorlike man and the fact that he was probably beneath his wife in station coupled with the correct description of the wife while it does not justify our being too sanguine raises our hopes you see  i see i seeyes  i beg that you will give me the agents name and address cried the captain whose hopes despite the guarded and cautious statements of the solicitor had been raised to the highest point  here is his name with the part of the river where you are to meet him said the calm man of law handing his client a slip of paper but let me my dear sir impress on you the advisability of not allowing yourself to become too sanguine  disappointments are invariably more severe in cases where expectations have been too high and i fear that you may be already building too trustfully upon the very slender foundation supplied by this information  admitting the force of this truism and putting the slip of paper in his purse captain bream bade his solicitor goodbye with many protestations of undying gratitude and left the room with the highest possible hopes of success    chapter twenty two  in the mission boat on the thamesthe damping of the body cannot damp the ardent spirit  next morning captain bream accompanied the laymissionary to gravesend where they took a boat and put off to the emigrant ship  great was the captains satisfaction to find that his companion had been a sailor and could talk to himin nautical language tooabout seafaring matters and distant climes  it is a good work in which you are engaged he said are you going to preach to em  no only to distribute testaments tracts and good booksthough i may preach if i get the chance  my work lies chiefly among emigrants and boat and barge men but i also do a good deal among regular sailors  ah  thats the work that im fond of said the captain with enthusiasm  of course i dont mean to say that the soul of a sailor is of more value than that of any other man but i lean to sailors naturally havin been among em the greater part of my life  ive done a little myself in the way of preachin to em  have you exclaimed the missionary with a pleased look  and from this point the two men went off into a confidential and animated talk about their varied experiences on the sea of spiritual work on which they had both been launched while the boatmanan old and evidently sympathetic manpulled them to the vessel which lay at some distance from the place of embarkation  while the two friendsfor such they had become by that timewere chatting thus with each other a little accident was in store for captain bream which not only disarranged his plans but afterwards considerably affected his career  having reached the age of sixty years our captain was not quite as active in body as he had once been  he was however quite as active in heart and mind besides having much of the fire of youth still burning in him  hence he was apt at times to forget his body in the impulsive buoyancy of his spirit  an instance of this forgetfulness occurred that day  the missionary paid a passing visit to a vessel on their way to the emigrant ship  having run alongside captain bream put his foot on the first step of the ladder with intent to mount the vessels side  have a care sir said the old boatman who was assisting him with some anxiety  it may be that the captains too youthful spirit spurned assistance or that he had miscalculated the powers of his too ancient body for at the moment his foot slipped while as yet his hold of the manropes was not secure and he fell with a lionlike roar that might have shamed the stoutest king of the african forests  it was not a cry of fear still less was it a shout for help  it seemed rather like an effervescing roar of indignant surprise  the boatman held up his arms to catch the unfortunate man but his strength availed nothing against such a weight  he was hurled into the bottom of the boat for his pains and the captain went into the water feet first as deep as the waist  here however the disaster was checked for his strong arms caught the boat and held on  the missionary meanwhile sprang forward and laid hold of him while his man rose with wonderful agility and lent his aid  heaveahoy cried the missionary grasping a waistband  yo heave ho shouted the boatman seizing a leg  another moment and the captain was safe in the bottom of the boat which by that time was floating quietly down the thames  great was the regret expressed by the missionary at this unfortunate event and loud was the laughter with which it was treated by the captain himself on being reseated in the stern sheets  we must go ashore and get a change of dry clothes for you sir  not a bit of it cried the captain  row back to the ship ill mount that ladder yet  if i didnt id keep dreaming of my discomfiture for a twelvemonth to come  they ran alongside the vessel a second time and went up the side in safety  but arrived on deck the skipper who happened to be a hospitable man and friendly to the missionary insisted on having captain bream down into his cabin  now youll put on a suit of my clothes he said till your own are dry  the captain would not hear of it  just let me wring my own out he said and ill be all right  have a glass of wine then or brandy  impossible thankee im an abstainer  but you need it to prevent catching cold you know  take it as physic  physic exclaimed the captain  i never took physic in my life and i wont begin wi the nasty stuff now  thankee all the same  some coffee then  ive got it all ready  aythats betterif youre sure youve got it handy  while the captain and the skipper were discussing the coffee the wet garments were sent to the galley and partially dried  meanwhile the missionary made the most of his opportunity among the men  by the time he had finished his visit the captains nether garments were partially dried so they continued their voyage to the emigrant ship  when they reached her the poor captains interest in other peoples affairs had begun to fail for his anxiety about his longlost sister increased as the probability of finding her at last became greater    chapter twenty three  how captain bream fared in his search and what came of it  the finding of an individual in a large emigrant ship may not inaptly be compared to the finding of a needle in a haystack  foreseeing the difficulty the missionary asked captain bream how he proposed to set about it  you say that you do not know the married name of your sister he said as they drew near to the towering sides of the great vessel  no i do not  and you have not seen her for many years  not for many years  nevertheless you are quite sure that you will recognise her when you do see her  ay as sure as i am that id know my own face in a lookinglass for she had points about her that im quite sure time could never alter  you are involved in a great difficulty i fear continued his friend for in the first place the time at your disposal is not long you cannot ask for the number of her berth not having her name and there is little probability of your being able to see every individual in a vessel like this while they keep moving about on deck and below  the captain admitted that the difficulties were great and his countenance grew longer for being as we have said a remarkably sympathetic man the emotions of his heart were quickly telegraphed to his features  it strikes me continued the missionary in a comforting tone that your best chance of success will be to enter my service for the occasion and go about with me distributing new testaments and tracts you will thus as it were have a reason for going actively about looking into peoples faces and even into their berths  excuse me for askingwhat do you think of doing if you find your sister for the vessel starts in a few hours  oh ill get herandand her husband to give up the voyage and return ashore with me  im well enough off to make it worth their while  the missionary did not appear to think the plan very hopeful but as they ran alongside at the moment them was no time for reply  it was indeed a bewildering scene to which they were introduced on reaching the deck  the confusion of parting friends of pushing porters with trunks and boxes perplexed individuals searching for lost luggage distracted creatures looking for lost relatives calm yet energetic officers in merchantservice uniform moving about giving directions active seamen pushing through the crowds in obedience to orders children of all sizes playing and getting in peoples way infants of many kinds yelling hideously or uttering squalls of final despair there was pathos and comicality too intermingled  behold on one side an urchin sitting astonishedup to his armpits in a bandbox through which he has just crashedand an irate parent trying to drag him out while on your other side stands a griefstricken mother trying to say farewell to a son whose hollow cheeks glittering eyes and short cough give little hope of a meeting again on this side the grave  above all the din as if to render things more maddening the tug alongside keeps up intermittent shrieks of its steamwhistle for the first bell has rung to warn those who are not passengers to prepare for quitting the steamer  soon the second bell rings and the bustle increases while in the excitement of partings the last farewells culminate  we dont need to mind that bell having our boat alongside said the missionary to captain bream as they stood a little to one side silently contemplating the scene  you see that smart young officer in uniform close to the cabin skylight  yes  thats the captain  indeed  he seems to me very young to have charge of such a vessel  not so young as he looks returned the other  i shall have to get his permission before attempting anything on board so we must wait here for a few minutes  you see he has gone into his cabin with the owners to have a few parting words  while we are standing youll have one of the best opportunities of seeing the passengers for most of them will come on deck to bid relatives and friends farewell and wave handkerchiefs as the tug steams away so keep your eyes open meanwhile i will amuse you with a little chitchat about emigrants this vessel is one of the largest that runs to australia  indeed responded the captain with an absent look and tone that would probably have been the same if his friend had said that it ran to the moon  the missionary did not observe that his companion was hopelessly sunk in the sea of abstraction  yes he continued and do you know it is absolutely amazing what an amount of emigration goes on from this port continually nowadays you would scarcely believe it unless brought as i am into close contact with it almost daily  why there were no fewer than 26000 emigrants who sailed from the thames in the course of last year  how many hogsheads did you say asked the captain still deeply sunk in abstraction  a laugh from his friend brought him to the surface however in some confusion  excuse me he said with a deprecatory look the truth is my mind is apt to wander a bit in such a scene and my eyes chanced to light at the moment you spoke on that hogshead over there  how many emigrants did you say  no fewer than 26000 repeated the missionary goodnaturedly and went on to relate some interesting incidents but the captain was soon again lost in the contemplation of a poor young girl who had wept to such an extent at parting from a female friend then in the tug that her attempts to smile through the weeping had descended from the sublime to the ridiculous  she and her friend continued to wave their kerchiefs and smile and cry at each other notwithstanding quite regardless of public opinion until the tug left  then the poor young thing hid her sodden face in her moist handkerchief and descended with a moan of woe to her berth  despite the comical element in this incident a tear was forced out of captain breams eye and we rather think that the missionary was similarly affected  but to say truth the public at large cared little for such matters  each was too much taken up with the pressing urgency of his or her own sorrows to give much heed to the woes of strangers  people in such frames of mind are easily touched by kind words and influences said the missionary in a low voice  true the ground is well prepared for you returned the captain softly for another group had absorbed his attention  and i distribute among them testaments gospels and tracts besides bags filled with books and magazines  was there much powder in em asked the captain struggling to the surface at the last word  i dont know about that replied his friend with a laugh but i may venture to say that there was a good deal of fire in some of them  fire exclaimed the captain in surprise  explanation was prevented by the commander of the vessel issuing at that moment from the cabin with the owners  hearty shakings of hands and wishes for a good voyage followed  the officers stood at the gangway the last of the weeping laggards was kindly but firmly led away the tug steamed off and the emigrant vessel was left to make her final preparations for an immediate start on her long voyage to the antipodes with none but her own inhabitants on board save a few who had private means of quitting  now is our time said the missionary hastening towards the captain of the vessel  for one moment the latter gave him a stern look as if he suspected him of being a man forgotten by the tug but a bland smile of goodwill overspread his features when the former explained his wishes  certainly my good sir go where you like and do what you please  armed with this permission he and captain bream went to work to distribute their gifts  most of the people received these gladly some politely a few with suspicion as if they feared that payment was expected and one or two refused them flatly  the distributers meanwhile had many an opportunity afforded when asked questions of dropping here and there a word in season  as this was the first time captain bream had ever been asked to act as an amateur distributer of testaments and tracts he waited a few minutes with one of his arms wellfilled to observe how his companion proceeded and then himself went to work  of course during all this time he had not for an instant forgotten the main object of his journey  on the contrary much of the absence of mind to which we have referred was caused by the intense manner in which he scanned the innumerable faces that passed to and fro before him  he now went round eagerly distributing his gifts though not so much impressed with the importance of the work as he would certainly have been had his mind been less preoccupied  it was observed however that the captain offered his parcels and testaments only to women a circumstance which caused a wag from erin to exclaim  hallo old gentleman dont ye think the boys has got sowls as well as the faimales  this was of course taken in good part by the captain who at once corrected the mistake  but after going twice round the deck and drawing forth many humorous as well as caustic remarks as to his size and general appearance he was forced to the conclusion that his sister was not there  the lower regions still remained however  descending to these with some hope and a dozen testaments he found that the place was so littered with luggage passengers and children that it was extremely difficult to move  to make the confusion worse nearly the whole space between decks had been fitted up with extra berthshere for the married there for the unmarriedso that very little room indeed was left for passage and exceedingly little light entered  but captain bream was not affected by such matters  he was accustomed to them and his eyesight was good  he was bent on one object which he pursued with quiet unflagging perseverancenamely that of gazing earnestly into the face of every woman in the ship  so eager was the poor man about it that he forgot to offer the last armful of testaments which he had undertaken to distribute and simply went from berth to berth staring at the females  he would undoubtedly have been considered mad if it had not been that the women were too much taken up with their own affairs to think much about any one with whom they had nothing to do  one distracting and also disheartening part of the process was that owing to the general activity on board he came again and again to the same faces in different parts of the vessel but he so frequently missed seeing others that hope was kept alive by the constant turning up of new faces  alas none of them bore any resemblance to that for which he sought so earnestly  at last he returned to the place where his friend was preaching  by that time however the crowd was so great that he could not enter turning aside therefore into an open berth with a feeling of weariness and depression creeping over his mind and body he was about to sit down on a box when a female voice at the other end of the berth demanded to know what he wanted  hope was a powerful element in captain breams nature  he rose quickly and stopped to gaze attentively into a female face but it was so dark where she sat on a low box that he could hardly see her and took a step forward  well mr imprence i hope as youll know me again said the woman whose face was fiery red and whose nature was furious  what do you want here  the captain sighed profoundly  that was obviously not his sister then a confused feeling of incapacity to give a good reason for being there came over him  suddenly he recollected the testaments  have one he said eagerly as he offered one of the little black books  have what  a testament  no i wont have a testament im a catholic said the woman as she looked sternly up  captain bream was considering how he might best suggest that the word of god was addressed to all mankind when a thought seemed to strike the woman  are you the capn she asked  yes he replied absently and with some degree of truth  then its my opinion capn an i tell it you to your face that you ought to be ashamed of yourself to put honest men an wimen in places like thisneither light nor hair nor nothink in the way of hornament to  captain bream are you there sir cried the voice of his friend the missionary at that moment down the companionhatch  ay ay im here  ive found her at last sir  the captain incontinently dropped the dozen testaments into the womans lap and went up the companionladder like a treesquirrel  this way sir  shes sittin abaft the funnel  in a few seconds captain bream and his companion stood before a prettyfaced fairhaired woman with soft gentle eyes which suddenly opened with surprise as the two men hurried forward and came to a halt in front of her  the captain looked anxiously at his friend  is this the he stopped  yes thats her said the missionary with a nod  the captain turned slowly on his heel and an irrepressible groan burst from him as he walked away  there was no need for the disappointed missionary to ask if he had been mistaken  one look had sufficed for the captain  sadly they returned to the shore and there the missionary being near his house invited captain bream to go home with him and have a cup of tea  it will revive you my dear sir he said as the captain stood in silence at his side with his head bowed down  the disappointment must indeed be great  dont give up hope however  but your clothes are wet still  no wonder you shiver having gone about so long in damp garments  come away  captain bream yielded in silence  he not only went and had a cup of his hospitable friendss tea but he afterwards accepted the offer of one of his beds where he went into a high fever from which he did not recover for many weary weeks    chapter twenty four  the wreck of the evening star  about the time that captain bream was slowly recovering from the fever by which he had been stricken down a disaster occurred out on the north sea in connection with the short blue which told powerfully on some of the men of that fleet  this was nothing less than the wreck of the evening star  the weather looked very unsettled the morning on which david brights turn came about to quit the fleet and sail for port  he had flown the usual flag to intimate his readiness to convey letters etcetera on shore and had also with a new feeling of pride run up his bethelflag to show his true colours as he said and to intimate his willingness to join with christian friends in a parting hymn and prayer  some had availed themselves of the opportunity and just before starting the evening star ran close to the mission smack  lower the boat billy said the skipper to his son as they sat in the cabin  ay ay daddy  there was a kindliness now in the tone of david brights voice when he spoke to billy that drew out the heart of that urchin as it had never been drawn out before save by his mothers soft voice and which produced a corresponding sweetness in the tones of the boyfor love begets love  the mission skipper received his visitor with unwonted heartiness  i pray the lord to give you a good time on shore david he said as they went down to the cabin where some of the other skippers were having a chat and a cup of coffee  hell do that said david  he did it last time  my dear missis could scarce believe her ears when i told her i was converted or her eyes when she saw the bethelflag and the temperance pledge  praise the lord exclaimed two or three of those present with deep sincerity as david thus referred to his changed condition  i cant bide with ee lads said david for times up but before startin i would like to have a little prayer with ee an a hymn to the masters praise  we need not say that they were all ready to comply  after concluding they saw him into his boat and bade him godspeed in many a homely but hearty phrase  goodbye skipper fare ye well billy the lord be with ee joe  john gunter was not omitted in the salutations and his surly spirit was a little though not much softened as he replied  fare ye well mates shouted david as he once more stood on his own deck and let his vessel fall away  a toss of the hand followed the salutation  little billy echoed the sentiment and the toss and in a few minutes the evening star was making her way out of the fleet and heading westward  the night which followed was wild and the wind variable  next day the sun did not show itself at all till evening and the wind blew dead against them  at sunset red and lurid gleams in the west and leaden darkness in the east betokened at the best unsteady weather  little did these bold mariners however regard such signsnot that they were reckless but years of experience had accustomed them to think lightly of dangerto face and overcome it with equanimity  in addition to his native coolness david bright had now the mighty power of humble trust in god to sustain him  it still blew hard when they drew near to land but the wind had changed its direction blowing more on the shore and increasing at last to a gale which lined the whole coast with breakers  before the evening star could find refuge in port night had again descended unfortunately it was one of the darkest nights of the season accompanied with such blinding sleet that it became a difficult matter to distinguish the guiding lights  a dirty night billy said david bright who himself held the tiller  ay father itll be all the pleasanter when we get home  true lad the same may be said of the heavenly home when the gales of life are over  dee see the light boy  no father not quite sure  either its not very clear or the sleet an spray blinds me  let the lower lights be burning murmured the skipper as a tremendous wave which seemed about to burst over them rushed beneath the stern raising it high in the air  you see the meanin o that line o the hymn now billy though you didnt when your dear mother taught it you  bless her heart her patience and prayers ha done it all  for some minutes after this there was silence  the men of the evening star were holding on to shroud or belayingpin finding shelter as best they could and looking out anxiously for the lower lights  therell be some hands missin i doubt in the short blue fleet tomorrow father remarked billy with a solemn look  likely enough god have mercy on em returned bright  it wasnt a much stiffer gale than this not many years gone by when twentyseven smacks foundered and a hundred and eighty souls were called to stand before their maker  as david spoke a sullen roar of breaking water was heard on the port bow  they had been slightly misled either by their uncertainty as to the position of the true lights or by some false lights on shore  at all events whatever the cause they were at that moment driving towards one of the dangerous sandbanks in the neighbourhood of yarmouth  the course of the smack was instantly changed but it was too late  almost before an order could be given she struck heavily her mainmast went over the side carrying part of the mizzen along with it  at the same time a wave broke just astern and rushed over the deck though happily not with its full force  even in that moment of disaster the bold fishermen did not quail  with their utmost energy indeed but without confusion they sprang to the boat which although lifted had not been washed away  accustomed to launch it in all weathers they got it into the water and almost mechanically ned spivin and gunter tumbled into it while joe davidson held on to the painter  billy bright was about to follow but looking back shouted come along father  david however paid no attention to him  he still stood firmly at the tiller guiding the wreck which having been lifted off or over the part of the sand on which she had struck was again plunging madly onward  a few moments and one of those overwhelming seas which even the inexperienced perceive to be irresistible roared after the disabled vessel  as it reached her she struck again  the billow made a clean sweep over her  everything was carried away  the boat was overturned the stout painter snapped and the crew left struggling in the water  but what of the people on shore when this terrible scene was being enacted  they were not entirely ignorant of it  through driving sleet and spray they had seen in the thick darkness something that looked like a vessel in distress  soon the spectral object was seen to advance more distinctly out of the gloom  well did the fishermen know what that meant and procuring ropes they hastened to the rescue while spray foam sand and even small pebbles were swept up by the wild hurricane and dashed in their faces  among the fishermen was a young man whose long ulster and cap told that he was a landsman yet his strength and his energy were apparently equal to that of the men with whom he ran  he carried a coil of thin rope in his left hand  with the right he partly shielded his eyes  theyll be certain to strike here cried one of the fishermen whose voice was drowned in the gale but whose action caused the others to halt  he was right  the vessel was seen to strike quite close for the water was comparatively deep  shes gone exclaimed the young man already referred to as the vessel was seen to be overwhelmed  he flung off his topcoat as he spoke and making one end of the small line fast round his waist ran kneedeep into the water  some of the fishermen acted in a somewhat similar fashion for they knew well that struggling men would soon be on the shore  they had not to wait long for the crew of the evening star were young and strong and struggled powerfully for their lives  in a few minutes the glaring eyes of zulu appeared and the young man of the ulster made a dash caught him by the hair and held on  it seemed as if the angry sea would drag both men back into its maw but the men on the beach held on to the rope and they were dragged safely to land  a cheer on right and left told that others were being rescued  then it became known who the wrecked ones were  its the evening star exclaimed one  poor david said another  then the cry was raised have ee got little billy  ay here he comes shouted a strange voice  it was that of the youth of the ulster who now stood waistdeep eagerly stretching out his hands towards an object with which the wild waves seemed to sport lovingly  it was indeed little billy his eyes closed his face white and his curly yellow hair tossing in the foam but he made no effort to save himself evidently the force of the sea and perhaps the cold had been too much for his slight frame to bear  twice did the young man make a grasp and miss him  to go deeper in would have perhaps insured his own destruction  the third time he succeeded in catching the boys hair the men on shore hauled them in and soon little billy lay on the beach surrounded by anxious fishermen  come mates said one in a deep voice lets carry him to his mother  not so said the young man who had rescued billy and who had only lain still for a moment where he had fallen to recover breath  let him lie  undo his necktie one of you  while he spoke he was busy making a tight roll of his own coat which he immediately placed under the shoulders of billy and proceeded at once to attempt to restore breathing by one of the methods of resuscitating the drowned  the fishermen assisted him some hopefully some doubtfully a few with looks of disbelief in the process  the youth persevered however with unflagging patience well knowing that halfdrowned people have been restored after nearly an hour of labour  who is he inquired one fisherman of another referring to the stranger  dont you know him mate asked the other in surprise  no ive just come ashore you know  thats mr dalton the young banker as takes such a lift o the temprance coffeetaverns an blueribbon movement  hes cominto sir exclaimed a voice eagerly  this had reference to little billy whose eyelids had been seen to quiver and who presently heaved a sigh  fetch my coat said dalton  he will indeed be restored thank god  the big ulster was brought  billy was carefully wrapped up in it and one of the stoutest among his fisher friends lifted him in his arms and bore him off to his mother  have all the others been rescued inquired dalton eagerly when billy had been carried away  no one could answer the question  all knew that some of the evening stars crew had been saved but they could not say how many  theyve bin taken to the sailors home sir said one man  then run up like a good fellow and ask if all are safe said dalton meanwhile i will remain here and search the beach lest there should be more to rescue  turning again to the foaming sea the young banker proceeded slowly along the shore some distance when he observed the body of a man being rolled up on the sand and dragged back by each returning wave  rushing forward he caught it and with the aid of the fishermen carried it beyond the reach of the hungry waves  but these waves had already done their worst  dalton applied the proper means for restoration but without success and again the fishermen began to look gravely at each other and shake their heads  poor woman they murmured but said no more  their feelings were too deep for speech as they mourned for one who was by that time a widow though she knew it not  at that moment some of the men came running down from the townone a tall strong figure ahead of them  it was joe davidson  he had been more exhausted than some of the others on being rescued and had been led to the sailors home in a scarcely conscious condition  when they began to reckon up the saved and found that only one was missing joes life seemed to return with a bound  breaking from those who sought to restrain him he ran down to the beach  he knelt beside the drowned fisherman with a wild expression in his eyes as he laid hold of something that partly covered the drowned man  it was his own bethelflag which david bright had twisted round his body joe sprang up and clasped his hands as if to restrain them from violent action  oh david he said and stopped suddenly while the wild look left his eyes and something like a smile crossed his features  can it be true that yeve gone so soon to the better land  the words gathered in force as they were uttered and it was with a great cry of grief that he shouted oh david david my brother and fell back heavily on the sand    chapter twenty five  billy and his father return home  who can describe the strange mingling of grateful joy with bitter anguish that almost burst the heart of david brights widow on that terrible night  she was singing one of the songs of zion and busy with household cares preparing for the expected return of her husband and her son when they carried billy in  it might be supposed that she would be anxious on such a stormy night but if the wives of north sea fishermen were to give way to fears with every gale that blew they would be filled with overwhelming anxiety nearly all the year round  when the knock at the door came at last the song ceased and when the stout fisherman entered with his burden and a fair curl escaping from the folds of the ulster told what that burden was the colour fled from the poor womans cheeks and a sinking of the heart under a great dread almost overcame her  hes all right missus said the man quickly  thank god gasped mrs bright  areare the rest safe  i blieve they are  some of em are i know  obliged to be content for the moment with the amount of relief conveyed by these words she had billy laid on a bed and bustled about actively rubbing him dry wrapping him in blankets applying hot bottles and otherwise restoring him for as yet the poor boy showed only slight symptoms of returning vitality  while thus engaged the door burst open and maggie davidson rushed in  oh nell she exclaimed what has happenedis it truebillydead no thank god for that butbutthe evening star must be wrecked are the rest safe  is joe  the excited young wife stopped and gasped with anxiety  the lord has been merciful in sending me my billy returned mrs bright with forced calmness but i know nothing more  turning at once maggie rushed wildly from the house intending to make straight for the shore  but she had not gone far when a crowd of men appeared coming towards her  foremost among these was her own husband  with a sharp cry of joy she rushed forward and threw herself into his ready arms  oh praise the lord she said but as she spoke the appearance of her husbands face alarmed her  glancing hastily at the crowd behind she cast a frightened look up at joes face  who is it she asked in a whisper as four men advanced with slow measured tread bearing between them the form of a man  david he said while an irrepressible sob convulsed him  for one moment the comely face of maggie wore an expression of horror then she broke from joe ran quickly back and seizing mrs bright in her arms attempted in vain to speak  whatwhats wrong maggie  the poor sympathetic young wife could not utter a word  she could only throw her arms round her friends neck and burst into a passion of tears  but there was no need for words  mrs bright knew full well what the tears meant and her heart stood still while a horror of darkness seemed to sink down upon her  at that moment she heard the tread of those who approached  another minute and all that remained of david bright was laid on his bed and his poor wife fell with a low wail upon his inanimate form while billy sat up on his couch and gazed in speechless despair  in that moment of terrible agony god did not leave the widow utterly comfortless for even in the first keen glance at her dead husband she had noted the bethelflag which he had shown to her with such pride on his last holiday  afterwards she found in his pocket the testament which she had given to him that year and thus was reminded that the parting was not to befor ever  we will not dwell on the painful scene  in the midst of it ruth dotropy glided in like an angel of light and kneeling quietly by the widows side sobbed as if the loss had been her own  poor ruth  she did not know how to set about comforting one in such overwhelming grief perhaps it was as well that she did not try for certainly in time she succeeded  how ruth came to hear of the wreck and its consequences was not very apparent but she had a peculiar faculty for discovering the locality of human grief a sort of instinctive tendency to gravitate towards it and like her namesake of old to cling to the sufferer  returning to her own lodging she found her mother and told her all that had happened  and now mother she said i must go at once to london and tell captain bream of my suspicions about mrs bright and get him to come down here so as to bring them face to face without further delay  my dear child you will do nothing of the sort said mrs dotropy with unwonted decision  you know well enough that captain bream has had a long and severe illness and could not stand anything in the nature of a shock in his present state  yes mother but they say that joy never kills and if  who says interrupted mrs dotropy who are they who say so many stupid things that every one seems bound to believe  joy does kill sometimes  besides what if you turned out to be wrong and raised hopes that were only destined to be crushed  dont you think that the joy of anticipation mightmight be neutralised by the expectationi mean the sorrow ofofbut its of no use arguing  i set my face firmly against anything of the sort  well perhaps you are right mother said ruth with a little sigh indeed now i think of it i feel sure you are for it might turn out to be a mistake as you say which would be an awful blow to poor captain bream in his present weak state  so i must just wait patiently till he is better  which he will very soon be my love said mrs dotropy for he is sure to be splendidly nursed now he has got back to his old quarters with these admirable miss seawards  but tell me more about this sad wreck  you say that the fisherman named joe davidson is safe  yes i know he is for i have just seen him  im glad of that for i have a great regard for him and am quite taken with his good little wife  indeed i feel almost envious of them they do harmonise and agree so well togethernot of course that your excellent father and i did not agreefar from it  i dont think that in all the course of our happy wedded life he ever once contradicted me but somehow he didnt seem quite to understand thingseven when things were so plain that they might have been seen with a magnifyingglassi mean a microthat isno matter  i fear you would not understand much better ruth darling for you are not unlike your poor father  but who told you about the wreck  a policeman mother  he said it was the evening star and the moment i heard that i hurried straight to mrs bright getting the policeman to escort me there and back  he has quite as great an admiration of joe as you have mother and gave me such an interesting account of the change for the better that has come over the fishermen generally since the mission vessels carried the gospel among them  he said he could hardly believe his eyes when he saw some men whom he had known to be dreadful characters changed into absolute lambs  and you know mother that the opinion of policemen is of much weight for they are by no means a soft or sentimental race of men  true ruth returned her mother with a laugh  after the scene enacted in front of our windows the other day when one of them had so much trouble and suffered such awful pommelling from the drunken ruffian he took up i am quite prepared to admit that policemen are neither soft nor sentimental  now mother i cannot rest said ruth rising i will go and try to quiet my feelings by writing an account of the whole affair to the miss seawards  but you have not told me child who is the young man who behaved so gallantly in rescuing little billy and others  a deep blush overspread the girls face as she looked down and in a low voice said it was our old friend mr dalton  ruth exclaimed mrs dotropy sharply with a keen gaze into her daughters countenance you are in love with mr dalton  no mother i am not replied ruth with a decision of tone and a sudden flash of the mild sweet eyes that revealed a little of the old spirit of the de tropys  surely i may be permitted to admire a brave man without the charge of being in love with him  quite true quite true my love replied the mother sinking back into her easychair  you had better go now as you suggest and calm yourself by writing to your friends  ruth hurried from the room sought the seclusion of her own chamber flung herself into a chair and put the question to herself am i in love with mr dalton  it was a puzzling question one that has been put full many a time in this worlds history without receiving a very definite or satisfactory answer  in this particular case it seemed to be not less puzzling than usual for ruth repeated it aloud more than once am i in love with mr dalton without drawing from herself an audible reply  she remained in the same attitude for a considerable time with her sweet little head on one side and her tiny hands clasped loosely on her lapabsorbed in meditation  from this condition she at last roused herself to sit down before a table with pen ink and paper  then she went to work on a graphic description of the wreck of the evening starin which of course mr dalton unavoidably played a very prominent part  human nature is strangely and swiftly adaptable  ruths heart fluttered with pleasure as she described the heroism of the young man and next moment it throbbed with deepest sadness as she told of mrs brights woe and the paper on which she wrote became blotted with her tears    chapter twenty six  the house of mourning  we have it on the highest authority that it is better to go to the house of mourning than to the house of feasting  this fallen world does not readily believe that but then the world is notoriously slow to believe the truth and also rather apt to believe what is false  it was long before even the learned world could be got to believe that the world itself moves round the sun  indeed it is more than probable that more than half the world does not believe that yet  on the other hand much of it very likely believes still that the world is flat  a savage of the prairie would almost certainly entertain that fallacy while a savage of the mountains would perhaps laugh him to scorn yet neither would admit that it was a globe  so mankind is very unwilling to accept the truth that it is better to give than to receive though such is certainly the case if there be truth in holy writ  john gunter had been much impressed and not a little softened by the recent catastrophe of the shipwreck and of his skippers death but he had not yet been subdued to the point of believing that it would be better to spend an hour with widow bright than to spend it in the publichouse even though his shipmate joe davidson did his best to persuade him of that truth  come said joe as a last appeal come john whatll our shipmates think of ee if you never go near the poor thing to offer her a word o comfort  i cant comfort nobody replied gunter with a surly heave of his shoulder  yes you can said joe earnestly why the very sight o you bein there out o respect to david would do her poor heart good  the idea of anybody deriving comfort from a sight of him so tickled gunter that he only replied with a sarcastic laugh nevertheless he followed his mate sulkily and as it were under protest  on entering the humble dwelling they found spivin trevor and zulu already there  mrs bright arose with tearful eyes to welcome the new guests  billy rose with her  he had scarcely left his mothers side for more than a few minutes since the dark night of the wreck though several days had elapsed  it was a great era in the life of the fisherboya new departure  it had brought him for the first time in his young life into personal contact as it were with the dark side of life and had made an indelible impression on his soul  it did not indeed abate the sprightly activity of his mind or body but it sobered his spirit and in one day made him more of a man than several years of ordinary life could have accomplished  the most visible result was a manly consideration of and a womanly tenderness towards his mother which went a long way to calm mrs brights first outbreak of sorrow  these rough fishermenrough only in outward appearancehad their own method of comforting the widow  they did not attempt anything like direct consolation however but they sat beside her and chatted in quiet undertonesthrough which there ran an unmistakable sound of sympathy  their talk was about incidents and events of a pleasant or cheering kind in their several experiences  and occasionally though not often they referred to the absent david when anything particularly favourable to him could be said  weve got good news joe said billy when the former was seated  ay billy im glad o that  what may the good news be  another evening star has been raised up to us by the lord said mrs bright but oh it will never shine like the first one to me the poor woman could go no further so billy again took up the story  you know he said that our kind friend miss ruth dotropy has been greatly taken up about us since father wentwent home and it seems that shes bin writin to lunon about us tellin all about the wreck an about our mistake in goin to sea last trip without bein inspected which lost us the insurancemoney  an theres a rich friend o hers as has sent her a thousand pound to buy mother another smack  you dont say thats true billy exclaimed joe with a look of surprise  thats just what i do say joe  the smack is already bought and is to be fitted out at once an mother has made you her skipper joe an the rest have all agreed to gozulu as cookand gunter too  wont you john  the boy who was somewhat excited by the news he had to tell frankly held out his hand to gunter and that worthy grasping it with an unwonted display of frankness on his part growledim with ee lad  yes its all arranged resumed billy and well not be long o being ready for sea so you wont be left to starve mother  up to this point the poor boy had held on with his wonted vivacity but he stopped suddenly  the corners of his mouth began to twitch and laying his head on his mothers bosom he sobbed aloud  it did the widow good to comfort him  the fishermen had an instinctive perception that their wisest course lay in taking no notice and continuing their lowvoiced intercourse  well now said joe i have read in storybooks of folk bein as libral sometimes as to give a thousand pounds but i never thought id live to see em do it  why joe where have your eyes and ears bin said luke trevor  dont you know it was a libral gentleman if not two or praps three as lent the ensign our first gospelship to the mission  thats true luke i forgot that when i spoke an theres more gospelsmacks comin im told presented in the same way by libral folk  its my belief said luke with emphasis at the same time striking his right knee with his hand its my belief that afore long well have a gospelship for every fleet on the north sea  right you are boy said joe an the sooner the better  moreover ive heard say that theres a talk about sellin baccy on board of the missionships cheaper than what they do aboard o the copers  did any of ee hear o that  i heard somethin about it answered luke but its too good news to be true  if they do itll drive the copers off the sea  of course it will  thats just what theyre agoin to do it for i suppose  reader the mode of dealing with the abominable coper traffic referred to by these men has at last happily been adopted and the final blow has been dealt by the simple expedient of underselling the floating grogshops in the article of tobacco  very considerable trouble and expense have to be incurred by the mission however for the tobacco has to be fetched from a foreign port but the result amply repays the cost for the men naturally prefer paying only 1 shilling per pound on board the missionship to paying 1 shilling 6 pence on board the coper the smacksmans advantages in this respect may be better understood when we say that on shore he has to pay 4 shillings per pound for tobacco but his greatest advantage of allthat for which the plan has been adoptedis his being kept away from the vessel where while purchasing tobacco he is tempted to buy poisonous spirits  of course the antismoker is entitled to say it were better that the smacksman should be saved from tobacco as well as drink  but of two evils it is wise to choose the less  tobacco at 1 shilling 6 pence procured in the coper with to some its irresistible temptation to get drunk on vile spirits is a greater evil than the procuring of the same weed at 1 shilling in a vessel all whose surroundings and internal arrangements are conducive to the benefit of soul and body  dye mind the old swan boys asked an elderly mana former friend of david bright who had dropped in with his mite of genuine sympathy  what the first gospelship as was sent afloat some thirty years ago it would be hard to remember what existed before i was born  well youve heard of her anyhow  she was lent by the admiralty for the work in the year eighteen hundred and something not to go out like the ensign to the north sea fleets but to cruise about an visit in the thames  i was in the swan myself for a few months when i was a young fellow and we had grand times aboard of that wessel  it seemed to me like a sort o home to the sailors that theyd make for arter their woyages was over  once i reklect we had a evenin service an as several ships had come in from furrin parts that mornin we had the swan chockfull o noo hands but bless you though they was noo to us they warnt noo to each other  they had many of em met aboard the swan years before  some of em hadnt met for seven and ten year and sich a shakin o hands there was an recognisin of each otheri thought wed never get the service begun  many of em was christian men and felt like brothers you see  did many of the masters an mates come to the services in those days asked joe davidson  ay amany of em  wy ive seed lots o both masters an mates wolunteerin to indoose their men to come wen some of em warnt willintakin their own boats too to the neighbourin ships an bringin off the men as wanted to wen the swans bell was aringin for service  i heard one man say he hadnt bin to a place o worship for ten year an if hed knowd what the swan was like hed ha bin to her sooner  i mind meetin wery unexpected with a friend at that time continued the old fisherman who saw that his audience was interested in his talk and that the mind of poor mrs bright was being drawn from her great sorrow for a little  i hadnt met im for eight or ten years  hallo  abel says i is that you  thats me says he ketchin hold o my grapnel an givin it a shake that amost unshipped the shoulder  leastwise its all thats left o me  what dee mean says i  i mean says he that ive just lost my wessel on the gunfleet sands but thank god i havent lost my life nor none o my men though it was a close shave  how did it happen abel says i  says he it happened pretty much in the usual way  a gale wi sleet that thick we could hardly see the end o the jibboom  the moment we struck i knowd it was all over wi the old wessel but i didnt see my way to go under without a struggle so we made a desprit attemp to git out the boats but a sea saved us the trouble for it swept em all away before we got at em as if theyd bin ony chips o wood  then as if to mock us another sea pitched us higher on the sands so as the decks wasnt washed by every wave quite so bad but we knew that wouldnt last for the tide was makin fast so i calls the crew together an says i now lads ive often prayed with you an for you  in a few minutes well have to take to the riggin an you know what the end o thats likely to be  before doin so ill pray again for nothin is impossible to the lord an it may be his will to spare us yet a while well i prayed  then we took to the riggin to wait for deathor rescue  an sure enough after we had bin six hours there an was all but frozen a fishinsmack came past and took us off  now mates said joe davidson after they had chatted thus in subdued tones for some time it do seem to me that as most of us are of one mind here and we are so to speak of one fisherfamily it might do mrs bright good if we was to have a bit of the word together and a prayer or two  as every one agreed to this either heartily or by silence a bible was produced and joebeing mate of the late evening star and therefore a sort of natural head of the familyread the portion where god promises to be a husband to the widow and a father to the fatherless  then they all knelt while he prayed in simple language for comfort and a blessing to the mourning household  he was followed with a very few but intensely earnest words by luke  even john gunter put up an unpremeditated prayer in the words god help us uttered in a choking voice and the old fisherman followed them all with a deep amen  after that they shook hands tenderly with the widow and billy and went out silently from the house of mourning    chapter twenty seven  the captains appetite restored and ruth in a new light  captain bream reclined one day on a sofa in the sittingroom of the house where he had first made the acquaintance of the miss seawards both ladies were seated by his side the one working worsted cuffs and the other comforters and both found the utmost difficulty in repressing tears when they looked at their kind nautical friend for a great change had come over him since we last saw him  we will not venture to state what was the illness that had laid the captain as he himself expressed it on his beamends but whatever it might have been it had reduced him to a mere shadow  his once round cheeks were hollow his eyes were so sunken that they appeared to have retired into the interior of his head out of which as out of two deep caverns they gleamed solemnly  his voice having been originally pitched so low that it could not well get lower had become reduced to the sound of a big drum muffled it had also a faint resemblance to a bassoon with a bad cold  his beard and moustache having been allowed to grow bore a striking likeness to a wornout clothesbrush and his garments appeared to hang upon a living skeleton of large proportions  it is right however to add that this was the worst that could be said of him  the spirit within was as cheery and loving and tender as ever it had beenindeed more soand the only wonder was that it did not break a hole in the once tough but now thin shell of its prisonhouse and soar upwards to its native regions in the sky  you must not work so hard at these cuffs miss jessie he said with a pleasant though languid smile  if you do ill reduce my board  but that would only render it necessary that i should work harder returned jessie without checking the pace of the needles  it is hard resumed the captain that i should be disobeyed at every turn now that im on my beamends with little more strength in me than a newborn kitten  but never mind im beginnin to feel stronger and ill pay you off my dear when im able to move about  do you really feel a little stronger asked kate who although more livelyeven mischievous in a small waythan her sister had been more deeply affected by the captains long illness and could not shake off the impression that he was going to die  feel stronger exclaimed the wrecked giant  give me your hand  dee feel that  that which kate was to feel was a squeeze as a test of strength  there  doesnt it hurt you  i believe i could make you cry if i was to try  and the captain did make her cry even without trying for kate was so deeply touched with the weakness of the trembling squeeze coupled with the hearty kindness and little touches of fun in the prostrate man that she could not keep it down  rising hurriedly therefore she flung her unfinished comforter into jessies lap left the room and retiring to her chamber wept quietly there  those tears were not now however as they had often been tears of anxious sorrow but of thankful joy  having accomplished this little matter and relieved her feelings she returned to the parlour  ive been just trying to persuade him kate said jessie as the former entered that in a week or two a trip to yarmouth will do him so much good but he does not seem to think he will be equal to it  come now miss jessie thats not a fair way to put it  i have no doubt that i shall be able enoughthanks to the good lord who has spared mebut what i think is that yarmouth pleasant though it be is not exactly what i want just now  what then do you think would be better for you asked kate  the sea  the sea  the open sea  the blue the fresh the ever free answered the captain with a gleam in the sunken eyes such as had not been seen there for many days  horrible thought said jessie with a pretended shudder  you know the proverb whats one mans meat is another mans poison returned the captain  ah ladies only those who have been cradled on the deep for three quarters of a lifetime and who love the whistling winds and the surging waves and the bounding bark know what it is to long as i do for another rest upon my mothers breast    and a mother she was and is to me   for i was bornwas born on the open sea  i had no idea you were so poetical said jessie much surprised at the invalids enthusiasm  sickness has a tendency to make people poetical  i suppose returned the captain  but how are you to manage it  you can scarcely walk yet  then excuse me you havent got a ship and i fear that not many owners would intrust one to you till you are stronger  so what will you do  go as a passenger my dear  see here its all arranged said the captain holding up a letter  i got this by the post this morning and want to consult with you about it  knowing my condition and desires that excellent man the chaplain who took me out in his steamlaunch the day i got the first shot of this illness had made known my case to the director of the mission to deepsea fishermen and he has kindly agreed to let me go a trip to the north sea in one of the missionships on the understanding that i shall do as much of a missionarys work as i am fit for when there  but youre not fit for work of any kind exclaimed kate with a flush of indignation which was partly roused by the idea of her friend being taken away from her at a time when he required so much nursing and partly by the impropriety of so sick a man being expected to work at all  true my dear but i shall be fit enough in a week or two  why i feel strength coming back like a torrent  even now im so hungry that i could devour mymy  your dinner cried kate as at that opportune moment the door opened and liffie lee appeared with a tray in her hand  there could be no doubt as to the captains appetite  not only did his eyes glare in quite a wolfish manner at the food while it was being set before him but the enormous quantity he took of that food became quite a source of alarm to the sisters who watched and helped him  now captain said jessie laying her hand at last on his thin arm as it was stretched out to help himself to more you really must not  you know the doctor said that it would never do at first to  my dear interrupted the invalid hang the doctor  well i have no objection to his being hanged if you dont ask me to do it returned jessie but really  oh let him alone said kate who being very healthy shared the captains unreasonable contempt for medical men and was more than pleased at the ravenous tendencies of her old friend  now for the spongecakes said the captain wiping his mouth and rubbing his hands on finishing the first course  you are to have none said kate firmly  the captains face elongated into a look of woe  because you are to have ricepudding and thick cream instead continued kate  the captains face shortened again into a beaming smile  liffie lee appeared at the moment with the viands named  i never saw anything like it exclaimed jessie with a short laugh and a look of resignation  i enjoy it so much said kate pouring out the cream with liberal hand  liffie said nothing but if the widest extension of her lips and the exposing of her bright little teeth from ear to ear meant anything it meant that her sympathies were entirely with kate  the captain was helped to pudding in a soup plate that being relatively a rather small dessert plate for him  he was about to plunge the dessert spoon into it but stopped suddenly and gazed at it  then he turned his awful gaze on the small servant who almost shrank before it  liffie my dear  yyes sir  bring me a tablespoon the biggest one you have  yes sir she saidand vanished  presently she returned with an enormous gravy spoon  ha ha shouted the captain with much of his old fire thats better than i had hoped for  hand it here liffie itll do  he seized the weapon and liffie uttered an involuntary squeal of delight as she saw him sweep up nearly the whole of his first helping and make one bite of it  he then attempted to smile at liffies expression of joy but did it awkwardly in the circumstances  just as he had finished his little repast and was tranquilly stirring a breakfast cup of coffee the door bell rang  a minute later liffie appeared with her mouth and eyes like three round os  if you please maam heres mister and missis dalton as wants to know if they may come in  mr and mrs who exclaimed both sisters  mister an missis dalton repeated liffie  show them inat once child  some ridiculous mistake said jessie glancing at kate  but stay liffieyou have no objection captain  none in the least  another moment and ruth appeared blushing in the doorway with a handsome young man looming in the background  mr and mrs dalton said the two sisters with a dazed look as they sank into two chairs  oh no darling jessie cried ruth rushing forward and throwing her arms round her friend notnot quite that yet butbutengaged  and we determined that the very first call we made should be to you darling  well now this is capital  quite a picture growled the captain does more good to my digestion than  come interrupted jessie taking ruth by the hand  come to our room  regardless of all propriety the sisters hurried ruth off to their bedroom to have it out with her there leaving young dalton to face the captain  i congratulate you my lad said the captain frankly extending his hand  sit down  dalton as frankly shook the hand and thanked the captain as he took a seat beside him  im deeply grieved captain bream to see you so much reduced yet rejoiced to find that you are fairly convalescent  humph  i wouldnt give much for the depth of either your grief or joy on my account seein that youve managed to get hooked on to an angel  well i confess said the youth with a laugh that the joy connected with that fact pretty much overwhelms all other feelings at present  the admission does you credit boy for she is an angel  im not usin figures o speech  shes a real darlin a1 at lloyds  true blue through and through  and let me tell you young fellow that i know her better than you do for i saw her before you were bor no that couldnt well be but i knew her father before you were born and herself ever since she saw the light  im delighted to have your good opinion of her though of course it cannot increase my estimation of her character  nothing can do that  which means that my opinion goes for nothing  well the conceit of the rising generation is only equalled byby that o the one that went before it  but now isnt it strange that you are the very man i want to see  it is indeed replied dalton with a slightly incredulous look  yes the very man  look ye here  have you got a notebook  i have  pull it out then  i want you to draw out my will  your will captain bream  my will repeated the captain  last will an testament  but im not lawyer enough to  i know that man  i only want you to sketch it out  listen  im going in a week or two to the north sea in a fishingsmack  well theres no sayin what may happen there  im not infallibleor invulnerableor waterproof though i am an old salt  now you are acquainted with all my money matters so i want you to jot down who the cash is to be divided among if i should go to the bottom then take the sketch to my lawyeryou know where he livesand tell him to draw it out all shipshape an bring it to me to sign  now are you ready  but my dear sir this may take a long time and the ladies will probably return before we  you dont bother your head about the ladies my lad but do as i tell ee  miss ruth has got hold of two pair of ears and two hearts that wont be satisfied in five minutes  besides my will wont be a long one  are you ready  yes said dalton spreading his notebook on his knee  well resumed the captain after makin all the usual arrangements for all expensesfuneral etcetera of which therell be none if i go to the bottom an some legacies of which ill tell the lawyer when i see him i leave all that remains to miss jessie and miss kate seaward share an share alike to do with it as they please an to leave it after them to whomsoever they like  there  is that all  yes thats all returned the captain sadly  i once had a dear sister but every effort i have made to find her out has failed  of course if i do come across her before it pleases the lord to take me home ill alter the will  in the meantime let it be drawn out so  soon after this important transaction was finished the ladies returned much flushed and excited and full of apologies for their rude behaviour to their male friends    chapter twenty eight  out with the short blue again  pleasant and heartstirring is the sensation of returning health to one who has sailed for many weeks in the doldrums of disease weathered point danger crossed the line of weakness and begun to steer with favouring gales over the smooth sea of convalescence  so thought captain bream one lovely summer day some time after the events just narrated as he sat on the bridge of a swift steamer which cut like a fish through the glassy waves of the north sea  it was one of hewett and companys carriers bound for the short blue fleet  over three hundred miles was the total run she had already made the greater part of it  the exact position of the evermoving fleet was uncertain  nevertheless her experienced captain was almost certainas if by a sort of instinctto hit the spot where the smacks lay ready with their trunks of fish to feed the insatiable maw of billingsgate  captain breams cheeks were not so hollow as they had been when we last saw him  neither were they so pale  his eyes too had come a considerable way out of the caves into which they had retreated and the wolfish glare in the presence of food was exchanged for a look of calm serenity  his coat instead of hanging on him like a shirt on a handspike had begun to show indications of muscle covering the bones and his vest no longer flapped against him like the topsail of a dutchman in a dead calm  altogether there was a healthy look about the old man which gave the impression that he had been into dock and had a thorough overhaul  enough of weakness remained however to induce a feeling of blessed restfulness in his entire being  the once strong and energetic man had been brought to the novel condition of being quite willing to leave the responsibility of the world on other shoulders and to enjoy the hitherto unknown luxury of doing nothing at all  so thoroughly had he abandoned himself in this respect that he did not even care to speak but was satisfied to listen to others or to gaze at the horizon in happy contemplation or to pour on all around looks of calm benignity  how do you feel today sir asked the mate of the steamer as he came on the bridge  my strongest feeling said captain bream is one of thankfulness to god that i am so well  a good feelin that doesnt always come as strong as it ought to or as one would wish does it sir said the mate  thats true answered the captain but when a man after bein so low that he seems to be bound for the next world finds the tide risin again the feelin is apt to come stronger dee see  dyou expect to make the fleet today  yes sir we should make it in the evenin if the admiral has stuck to his plans  the captain became silent again but after a few minutes fearing that the mate might think him unsociable he said  i suppose the admiral is always chosen as being one of the best men of the fleet  thats the idea sir and the one chosen usually is one of the best though of course mistakes are sometimes made  the present admiral is a firstrate mana thoroughgoing fisherman well acquainted with all the shoals and a christian into the bargain  ah i suppose that is an advantage to the fleet in many respects said the captain brightening up on finding the mate sympathetic on that point  it is for the advantage of the fleet in all respects sir  i have known an ungodly admiral on a sunday when they couldnt fish an the weather was just right for heavinto an going aboard the mission smack for serviceive known him keep the fleet movin the whole day for nothin at all but spite  of course that didnt put any one in a good humour an you know sir men always work better when theyre in good spirits  ay well do i know that said the captain for ive had a good deal to do wi men in my time and i have always found that christian sailors as a rule are worth more than unbelievers just because they work with a willas the bible puts it unto the lord and not unto men  youve heard of general havelock no doubt  oh yes sir you mean the indian general who used to look after the souls of his men  thats the man returned the captain  well ive been told that on one occasion when the commanderinchief sent for some soldiers for special duty and found that most of em were drunk he turned an said send me some of havelocks saints they can be depended on  im not sure if ive got the story rightly but anyhow thats what he said  ay sir i sometimes think it wonderful said the mate that unbelievers dont themselves see that the love of god in a mans heart makes him a better and safer servant in all respectsaccording to the word godliness is profitable to the life that now is as well as that which is to come  theres the fleet at last sir  while speaking the mate had been scanning the horizon with his glass which he immediately handed to the captain who rose at once and saw the line of the short blue like little dots on the horizon  the dots soon grew larger then they assumed the form of vessels and in a short time the carryingsteamer was amongst them making straight for the admiral whose smack was distinguishable by his flag  what is the admirals name asked the captain as they advanced  davidsonjoe davidson one of the brightest young fellows i ever knew answered the captain of the steamer who came on the bridge at that moment and a true christian  he is master of the evening star  why i thought that was the name of a smack that was wrecked some time ago near yarmouthat least so my friends there wrote me said captain bream with sudden interest and well might he feel interest in the new evening star for it was himself who had given the thousand pounds to purchase her at ruth dotropys request but he had not been told that her skipper joe davidson had been made admiral of the fleet  so it was the evening star sir that was wrecked but some openhanded gentleman in london bought a new smack for widow bright and she called it by the same name an the young man who had been mate with her husband she has made skipper till her son billy is old enough to take charge of her  the strangest thing is that all the old crew have stuck together and the smack is now one of the best managed in the fleet  joe wouldnt have been made admiral if that wasnt so  to this and a great deal more the captain listened with great joy and thankfulness without however giving a hint as to his own part in the matter  originally he had given the thousand pounds to please ruth and he had been at that time glad to think that the gift was to benefit a deserving and unfortunate widow  it was not a little satisfactory therefore to hear that his gift had been so well bestowed that it had even become the admirals vessel and that he was about to have the opportunity of boarding the new evening star and himself inspecting its crew  tell me a little more about this evening star he said to the captain of the steamer  i have sometimes heard of her from a lady friend of mine who takes a great interest in her owner but i was so ill at the time she wrote that i couldnt pay much attention to anything  thus invited the captain proceeded to tell all he knew about david bright and his wife and billy and luke trevor spivin gunter zulu the wreck the launch of the new smack etceteramuch of which was quite new to captain bream and all of which was of course deeply interesting to him  while these two were conversing the fleet gradually thickened around them for a light breeze which seemed to have sprung up for the very purpose enabled them to close in  some of the smacks were close at hand others more distant  to those within hail the captain and mate of the steamer gave the customary salute and toss of the fist in the air as they passed  theres the admiral said the captain two points off the port bow  an the gospelship close alongside said the mate  dont you see the mdsf flag  trust joe for bein near to her when he can manage it  here they come fast an thick  theres the fern id know her a mile off an the martin an rover coquette truant  what cheer boys  is that the cherub or the andax abeam of us asked the captain  its neither  its the guide or the boy jim or the retriever not quite sure which  now captain bream shall we put you on board the missionship at once or will you wait to see us boarded for empty trunks  ill wait returned captain bream  soon the steamer hoveto not far from the admirals vessel  the smacks came crowding round like bees round a hive each one lowering a boat when near enough  and once again was enacted a scene similar in many respects to that which we have described in a previous chapter with this difference that the scramble now was partly for the purpose of obtaining empty boxes  another steamer had taken off most of their fish early that day and the one just arrived meant to wait for the fish of the next morning  it chanced that a good many of the rougher men of the fleet came on board that evening so that captain bream whose recent experiences had led him half to expect that all the north sea fishermen were amiable lions had his mind sadly but effectively disabused of that false idea the steamers deck soon swarmed with some four hundred of the roughest and most boisterous men he had ever seen and the air was filled with coarse and profane language while a tendency to fight was exhibited by several of them  theyre a rough lot sir said the mate as he leant on the rail of the bridge gazing down on the animated scene but they were a rougher lot before the gospelship came out to stay among them and some of the brightest christians now in the fleet were as bad as the worst you see down there  ay jesus came to save the lost and the worst said the captain in a low tonepraise to his name  as soon as the trunks had been received the admiral bore away to windward and the fleet began to follow and make preparation for the nights fishing for the fish which were destined so soon to smoke on london tables were at that moment gambolling at the bottom of the sea  we must run down to the mission smack and put you aboard at once sir said the mate for she follows the admiralthough she does not fish on saturday nights so that the hold may be clear of fish and ready for service on sundays  captain bream was ready  they know you are coming i suppose  yes they expect me  in a few minutes the steamer was close to the missionship and soon after the powerful arms of its hospitable skipper and mate were extended to help the expected invalid out of the boat which had been sent for him  were makin things all snug for the night said the skipper as he led his guest into the little cabin an when were done we shall have tea but if youd like it sooner  no no skipper ill wait  though im just come from the shore you dont take me for an impatient landlubber do you  go finish your work and ill rest a bit  ive been ill you see an cant stand as much as i used to he added apologetically  when left alone captain breams mode of resting himself was to go down on his knees and thank god for having brought him to so congenial a restingplace on the world of waters and to pray that he might be made use of to his glory while there  how that prayer was answered we shall see    chapter twenty nine  another fight andvictory  it is interesting to observe the curious and oftentimes unlikely ways in which the guilt of man is brought to light and the truth of that word demonstratedbe sure your sin shall find you out  although john gunters heart was softened at the time of his old skippers death it was by no means changed so that after a brief space it became harder than ever and the man who had been meltedto some extent washedreturned ere long with increased devotion to his wallowing in the mire  this made him so disagreeable to his old comrades that they became anxious to get rid of him but joe davidson whose disposition was very hopeful hesitated and the widow having a kindly feeling towards the man because he had sailed with her husband did not wish him to be dismissed  thus it came to pass that when captain bream joined the short blue fleet he was still a member of the crew of the new evening star  the day following that on which the captain arrived was sunday and as usual the smacks whose skippers had become followers of the lord jesus began to draw towards the missionship with their bethelflags flying among them was the new admiraljoe of the evening star  his vessel was pointed out of course to the captain as she approached  we need scarcely say that he looked at her with unusual interest and was glad when her boat was lowered to row part of her crew to the service about to be held in the hold of the gospelship  it was natural that captain bream should be much taken with the simple cheery manners of the admiral as he stepped aboard and shook hands all round  it was equally natural that he should take some interest also in john gunter for was it not obvious that that worthy was a fine specimen of the gruff halfsavage raw material which he had gone out there to work upon  why did you not bring billy joe asked the skipper of the mission vessel  well you know we had to leave some one to look after the smack an i left luke trevor as he said hed prefer to come to evenin service an billy said hed like to stay with luke  by this time a number of boats had put their roughclad crews on the deck and already a fair congregation was mustered  shaking of hands salutations question and reply were going briskly on all round with here and there a little mild chaffing and occasionally a hearty laugh while now and then the fervent thank god and praise the lord revealed the spirits of the speakers  you mentioned the name of billy just now said captain bream drawing joe davidson aside  is he a man or a boy  hes a boy sir though he dont like to be reminded o the fact said joe with a laugh  hes the son of our skipper who was drownedan a good boy he is though larky a bit  but that dont do him no harm bless ye  i wonder returned the captain if he is the boy some lady friends of mine are so fond of who was sent up to london some time ago to  thats him sir interrupted joe it was billy as was sent to lunon by the wish of a miss ruth pontrapme or some such name  i never can remember it rightly but shes awful fond o the fisherfolks  ah i know miss ruth dotropy also said the captain  strange that i should find this billy that theyre all so fond of in the new evening star  i must pay your smack a visit soon davidson for i have a particular interest in her  ill be proud to see you aboard her sir returned joe  wont you come after service  the calm will last a good while i think  well perhaps i may  the conversation was interrupted here by a general move to the vessels hold where the usual arrangements had been madea table for a pulpit and fishboxes for seats  do you feel well enough to speak to us today captain bream asked the skipper of the missionship  oh yes ill be happy to do so  the trip out has begun to work wonders already said the captain  now the truth of that proverb one man may take a horse to the water but ten men cant make him drink is very often illustrated in the course of human affairs  you may even treat a donkey in the same way and the result will be similar  joe davidson had brought john gunter to the missionship in the earnest hope that he would drink at the gospel fountain but after having got him there joe found that so far from drinking gunter would not even go down to the services at all  on this occasion he said that he preferred to remain on deck and smoke his pipe  unknown to all the world save himself john gunter was at that time in a peculiarly unhappy state of mind  his condition was outwardly manifested in the form of additional surliness  youre like a bear with a sore head spivin had said to him when in the boat on the way to the service  more like a blackface baboon wid de cholera said zulu  invulnerable alike to chaff and to earnest advice gunter sat on the forehatch smoking while psalms of praise were rising from the hold  now it was the little silver watch which caused all this trouble to gunter  bad as the man was he had never been an absolute thief until the night on which he had robbed ruth dotropy  the horror depicted in her pretty innocent face when he stopped her had left an impression on his mind which neither recklessness nor drink could remove and thankfully would he have returned the watch if he had known the young ladys name or residence  moreover he was so inexperienced and timid in this new line of life that he did not know how to turn the watch into cash with safety and had no place in which to conceal it  on the very day about which we write seeing the coper not far off the unhappy man had thrust the watch into his trousers pocket with the intention of bartering it with the dutchman for rum if he should get the chance small chance indeed with joe davidson for his skipper but there is no accounting for the freaks of the guilty  the watch was now metaphorically burning a hole in gunters pocket and that pocket being somewhat similar in many respects to the pockets of average schoolboys ruths pretty little watch lay in company with a few coppers a bit of twine a broken claspknife two buttons a short pipe a crumpled tract of the mission to deepsea fishermen and a halffinished quid of tobacco  but although john gunter would not drink of his own freewill he could not easily avoid the water of life that came rushing to him up the hatchway and filled his ears  it came to him first as we have said in song and the words of the hymn sinner list to the loving call passed not only his outer and inner ear but dropped into his soul and disturbed him  then he got a surprise when captain breams voice resounded through the holdthere was something so very deep and metallic about it yet so tender and musical  but the greatest surprise of all came when the captain without a word of preface or statement as to where his text was to be found looked his expectant audience earnestly in the face and said slowly thou shalt not steal  poor captain bream nothing was further from his thoughts than the idea that any one listening to him was actually a thief but he had made up his mind to press home with the spirits blessing the great truth that the man who refuses to accept salvation in jesus christ robs god of the love and honour that are his due robs his wife and children and fellowmen of the good example and christian service which he was fitted and intended to exert and robs himself so to speak of eternal life  the captains arguments had much weight in the hold but they had no weight on deck  many of his shafts of reason were permitted to pierce the tough frames of the rugged men before him and lodge with good influence in tender hearts but they all fell pointless on the deck above  it was the pure unadulterated word of god without note or comment that was destined that day to penetrate the iron heart of john gunter and sink down into his soul  thou shalt not steal  that was all of the sermon that gunter heard the rest fell on deaf ears for these words continued to burn into his very soul  influenced by the new and deep feelings that had been aroused in him he pulled the watch from his pocket with the intention of hurling it into the sea but the thought that he would still deserve to be called a thief caused him to hesitate  hallo  gunter what pretty little thing is that youve got  the words were uttered by dick herring of the white cloud who being likeminded with john had remained on deck like him to smoke and lounge  youve got no business wi that growled gunter as he closed his hand on the watch and thrust it back into his pocket  i didnt say i had mate retorted herring with a puff of contempt which at the same time emptied his mouth and his spirit  herring said no more but when the service was over and the men were chatting about the deck he quietly mentioned what he had seen and some of the waggish among the crew came up to gunter and asked him with significant looks and laughs what time o day it was  at first gunter replied in his wonted surly manner but at last feeling that the best way would be to put a bold face on the matter he said with an offhand laugh  herring thinks hes made a wonderful discovery but surely theres nothing very strange in a man buyin a little watch for his sweetheart  you dont mean to say that you have a sweetheart do you said a youth of about seventeen who had a tendency to be what is styled cheeky  gunter turned on him with contempt  well now he replied if i had a smooth babyface like yours i would not say as i had but bein a man you see i may ventur to say that i have  come gunter youre too hard on im cried spivin i dont believe youve bought a watch for her at all at least if you have it must be a pewter one  thus taunted gunter resolved to carry out the bold line of action what dee call that he cried pulling out the watch and holding it up to view  captain bream chanced to be an amused witness of this little scene but his expression changed to one of amazement when he beheld the peculiar and unmistakable watch which years before he had given to ruth dotropys father  recovering himself quickly he stepped forward  a very pretty little thing he said and looks uncommonly like silver  let me see it  he held out his hand and gunter gave it to him without the slightest suspicion of course that he knew anything about it  yes undoubtedly it is silver and a very curious style of article too continued the captain in a low offhand tone  youve no objection to my taking it to the cabin to look at it more carefully  of course gunter had no objection though a sensation of uneasiness arose within him especially when captain bream asked him to go below with him and whispered to joe davidson in a low tone as he passed him to shut the cabin skylight  no sooner were they below with the cabindoor shut than the captain looked steadily in the mans face and said  gunter you stole this watch from a young lady in yarmouth  an electric shock could not have more effectually stunned the convicted fisherman  he gazed at the captain in speechless surprise  then his fists clenched a rush of blood came to his face and a fierce oath rose to his white lips as he prepared to deny the charge  stop said the captain impressively and there was nothing of severity or indignation in his voice or look  dont commit yourself gunter  see i place the watch on this table  if you bought it to give to your sweetheart take it up  if you stole it from a pretty young lady in one of the rows of yarmouth some months ago and would now wish me to restore it to herfor i know her and the watch welllet it lie  gunter looked at the captain then at the watch and hesitated  then his head drooped and in a low voice he said  i am guilty sir  without a word more captain bream laid his hand on the poor mans shoulder and pressed it  gunter knew well what was meant  he went down on his knees  the captain kneeled beside him and in a deep intensely earnest voice claimed forgiveness of the sin that had been confessed and prayed that the sinners soul might be there and then cleansed in the precious blood of jesus  john gunter was completely broken down tears rolled over his cheeks and it required all his great physical strength to enable him to keep down the sobs that wellnigh choked him  fishermen of the north sea are tough  their eyes are not easily made to swell or look red by salt water whether it come from the ocean without or the mightier ocean within  when gunter had risen from his knees and wiped his eyes with the end of a comforter which had probably been worked under the superintendence of ruth herself there were no signs of emotion leftonly a subdued look in his weatherworn face  i give myself up sir he said to suffer what punishment is due  no punishment is due my man  jesus has borne all the punishment due to you and me  in regard to man you have restored that which you took away and well do i know that the young ladylike her masterforgives freely  i will return the watch to her  you can go back to your comradesnobody shall ever hear more about this  if they chaff you or question you just say nothing and smile at them  butbut sir said gunter moving uneasily  i aint used to smilin  iive bin so used to look gruff that  look gruff then my man interrupted the captain himself unable to repress a smile  if youre not gruff in your heart it wont matter much what you look like  just look gruff an keep your mouth shut and theyll soon let you alone  acting on this advice john gunter returned to his mates looking gruffer if possible and more taciturn than ever but radically changed from that hour in soul and spirit    chapter thirty  the climax reached at last  as the calm weather continued in the afternoon joe davidson tried to persuade captain bream to pay the evening star a visit but the latter felt that the excitement and exertion of preaching to such earnest and thirsting men had been more severe than he had expected  he therefore excused himself saying that he would lie down in his bunk for a short time so as to be ready for the evening service  it was arranged that the skipper of the mission smack should conduct that service and he was to call the captain when they were ready to begin  when the time came however it was found that the exhausted invalid was so sound asleep that they did not like to disturb him  but although captain bream was a heavy sleeper and addicted to sonorous snoring there were some things in nature through which even he could not slumber and one of these things proved to be a hymn as sung by the fishermen of the north sea  when therefore the lifeboat hymn burst forth in tones that no cathedral organ ever equalled and shook the timbers of the missionship from stem to stern the captain turned round yawned and opened his eyes wide and when the singers came to    leave the poor old stranded wreck and pull for the shore  he leaped out of his bunk with tremendous energy  pulling his garments into order running his fingers through his hair and trying to look as if he had not been asleep he slipped quietly into the hold and sat down on a box behind the speaker where he could see the earnest faces of the rugged congregation brought into strong relief by the light that streamed down the open hatchway  what the preacher said or what his subject was captain bream never knew for before he could bring his mind to bear on it his eyes fell on an object which seemed to stop the very pulsations of his heart while his face grew pale  fortunately he was himself in the deep shadow of the deck and could not be easily observed  yet the object which created such a powerful sensation in the captains breast was not in itself calculated to cause amazement or alarm for it was nothing more than a prettyfaced curlyhaired fisherboy who with lips parted and his bright eyes gazing intently was listening to the preacher with all his powers  need we say that it was our friend billy bright and that in his fair face captain bream thought or rather felt that he recognised the features of his longlost sister  with a strong effort the captain restrained his feelings and tried to listen but in vain  not only were his eyes riveted on the young face before him but his whole being seemed to be absorbed by it  the necessity of keeping still however gave him time to make up his mind as to how he should act so that when the service was brought to a close he appeared on deck without a trace of his late excitement visible  what lad is this he asked going up to joe who was standing close to billy  this said joe laying his hand kindly on the boys shoulder is billy bright son of the late owner of the old evenin star  what exclaimed the captain unable to repress his surprise son of the widow who owns the new evening star then that proves that your mother must be alive  in course she is returned billy with a look of astonishment  come down to the cabin with me billy said the captain with increasing excitement  i want to have a chat with you about your mother  our little hero although surprised at once complied with the invitation taking the opportunity however to wink at zulu in passing and whisper his belief that the old genlman was mad  setting billy on a locker in front of him captain bream began at once  is your mother alive billytut of course shes alive i mean is she wellin good health  billy became still more convinced that captain bream was mad but answered that his mother was well and that she had never been ill in her life to the best of his knowledge  while speaking billy glanced round the cabin in some anxiety as to how he should escape if the madman should proceed to violence  he made up his mind that if the worst should come to the worst he would dive under the table get between the old gentlemans legs trip him up and bolt up the companion before he could regain his feet  relieved by the feeling that his mind was made up he waited for more  billy resumed the captain after a long gaze at the boys features is your mother like you  i should think not replied billy with some indignation  shes a woman you know an im aaman  yesof course murmured the captain to himself there can be no doubt about itnone whateverevery gestureevery look  then aloud what was her name my boy  her name sir why her names bright of course  yes yes but i mean her maiden name  billy was puzzled  if you mean the name my father used to call er he said it was nell  ah thats itnearly at least  nellie she used to be known by  yes yes but thats not what i want to know  can you tell me what her name was before she was married  well now that is odd answered billy ive bin pumped somethink in this way before though nuffin good came of it as i knows on  no i dont know what she was called afore she was married  did you ever hear of the name of bream asked the captain anxiously  oh yes ive heerd o that name said the boy promptly  theres a fish called bream you know  it soon became evident to poor captain bream that nothing of importance was to be learned from billy he therefore made up his mind at once as to how he should act  feeling that with such a possibility unsettled he would be utterly unfit for his duties with the fleet he resolved to go straight to yarmouth  what is your mothers address he asked  billy gave it him  now my boy i happen to be much interested in your mother so im goin to yarmouth on purpose to see her  its wery good o you sir an if you takes your turn ashore afore we do just give mother my respecs an say im all alive and kickin  i will my boy said the captain patting billy on the head and actually stooping to kiss his forehead affectionately after which he gave him leave to return on deck  i don know how it is said billy to zulu afterwards but ive took a likin for that old man an at the same time a queer sort o fear of im i cant git it out o my noddle that hes goin to yarmouth to inweigle my mother to marry him  zulu showed all his teeth and gums shut his eyes gave way to a burst of laughter and said nonsense  it may be nonsense retorted billy but if i thought he really meant it i would run my head butt into his breadbasket an drive im overboard  explaining to the surprised and rather disappointed skipper of the mission vessel that an unexpected turn of affairs required his immediate presence in yarmouth the captain asked what means there were of getting to land  one of our fleet the rainbow starts tomorrow morning sir was the reply so you can go without loss of time  but i hope we shall see you again  oh yes please god i shall come off againyou may depend on that for ive taken a great fancy to the men of the short blue although ive been so short a time with themmoreover i owe service as well as gratitude to the mission for sending me here  accordingly next morning he set sail with a fair wind and in due course found himself on shore  he went straight to the old abode of mrs dotropy and to his great satisfaction found ruth there  he also found young dalton which was not quite so much to his satisfaction but ruth soon put his mind at rest by saying  oh  captain bream im so glad to have this unexpected visit because for months and months past i have wanted you to go with me to visit a particular place in yarmouth and you have always slipped through my fingers but im determined that you shant escape again  thats odd my dear returned the captain because my object in coming here is to take you to a certain place in yarmouth and although i have not had the opportunity of letting you slip through my fingers ive no doubt youd do so if you were tempted away by a bait that begins with a d  how dare you sir said ruth blushing laughing and frowning all at oncebut no  even d will fail in this instancefor my business is urgent  well miss ruth my business is urgent also  the question therefore remains which piece of business is to be gone about first  how can you be so ungallant  are not a ladys wishes to be considered before those of a gentleman  come sir are you ready to go  i am quite ready and fortunately d to whom you dared to refer just now has gone to the post with a letter  although extremely anxious to have his mind set at rest captain bream gave in with his accustomed goodnature and went out with ruth to settle her business first  rejoiced to have her little schemes at last so nearly brought to an issue the eager girl hurried through the town till she came to one of its narrow rows  well my dear said the captain it is at all events a piece of good luck that so far you have led me in the very direction i desired to lead you  indeed  well that is odd  but after all returned ruth with a sudden feeling of depression it may turn out to be a wildgoose chase  what may turn out to be a wildgoose chase  thisthis fancythis hope of mine but you shall know directly come  ruth was almost running by this time and the captain being still far from strong found it difficult to keep up with her  this way down here she cried turning a corner  what this way exclaimed the captain in amazement  yes why not said ruth reflecting some of his surprise as she looked up in his face  whywhy because this is the very row i wanted to bring you to  that is strangebutbut never mind just now youll explain afterwards  come along  poor ruth was too much excited to attend to any other business but that on which her heart was set just then and fear lest her latest castle should prove to have no foundations and should fall like so many others in ruins at her feet caused her to tremble  here is the door she said at last coming to a sudden halt before widow brights dwelling and pressing both hands on her palpitating heart to keep it still  wonders will never cease exclaimed the captain  this is the very door to which i intended to bring you  ruth turned her large blue eyes on her friend with a look that made them larger and if possible bluer than ever  she suddenly began to feel as deep an interest in the captains business as in her own  this door she said pointing to it emphatically  yes that door  widow bright lives there dont she  yesoh yes said ruth squeezing her heart tighter  well ive come here to search for a longlost sister  oh gasped ruth  but she got no time to gasp anything more for the impatient captain had pushed the door open without knocking and stood in the middle of the widows kitchen  mrs bright was up to the elbows in soapsuds at the moment busy with some of the absent billys garments  beside her sat mrs joe davidson endeavouring to remove with butter a quantity of tar with which the blessed babby had recently besmeared herself  they all looked up at the visitors but all remained speechless as if suddenly paralysed for the expression on our big captains face was wonderful as well as indescribable  mrs bright opened her eyes to their widest also her mouth and dropped the billygarments  mrs davidsons buttery hands became motionless so did the babbys tarry visage  for three seconds this lasted  then the captain said in the deepest bass notes he ever reached  sister nellie  a wild scream from mrs bright was the reply as she sprang at captain bream seized him in her arms and covered the back of his neck with soapsuds  the castle was destined to stand after all  ruths joy overflowed she glanced hurriedly round for some object on which to expend it there was nothing but the blessed babbyand that was covered with tar but genuine feeling does not stick at trifles  ruth caught up the filthy little creature pressed it to her bounding heart wept and laughed and covered it with passionate kisses to such an extent that her own fair face became thoroughly besmeared and it cost mrs joe an additional half hours labour to get her clean besides an enormous expenditure of butterthough that was selling at the time at the high figure of 1 shilling 6 pence a pound    chapter thirty one  the last  there came a day not very long after the events narrated in the previous chapter when a grand wedding took place in yarmouth  but it was not meant to be a grand one by any means  quite the contrary  the parties principally concerned were modest retiring and courted privacy  but the more they courted privacy the more did that conditionlike a coy maidenfly away from them  the name of the bride was ruth and the name of the bridegroom began as captain bream was fond of sayingwith a dee  neither bride nor groom had anything particular to do with the sea yet that wedding might have easily been mistaken for a fishermans wedding as well as a semipublic one so numerous were the saltsyoung and oldwho attended it some with invitation and others without  you see the ceremony being performed in the old parish church any one who chose had a right to be there and look on  the reason of this nautical character of the wedding was not far to seek for had not the bridegroomwhose name began with a deerisked his life in rescuing from the deep a brightwe might almost say the brightestyoung life belonging to the fishing fleets of the north sea and was not the lovely bride one of the best and staunchest friends of the fisherman  and was she not mixed up somehow with the history of that good old seacaptainif not actually a relation of hiswho preached so powerfully and who laboured so earnestly to turn seamen from darkness to light  and had not the wedding been expressly delayed until the period of one of the smacks return to port so that six fishermennamely joe davidson ned spivin luke trevor john gunter billy bright and zulumight be invited guests  besides these there were the skipper and crew of the gospelship which was also in port at that time and other fishermen guests there were known by such names as mann white snow johnston goodchild brown bowers tooke rogers snell moore roberts and many moreall good men and truewho formed part of that great population of 12000 which is always afloat on the north sea  besides these guests and a host of others who were attracted by the unusual interest displayed in this wedding there were several people with whom we may claim some slight acquaintancesuch as miss jessie seaward and her sister who wept much with joy and laughed not a little at being so foolish as to cry and liffie lee who was roused with excitement to the condition of a halftamed wildcat but was so dressed up and brushed down and washed out that her best friend might have failed to recognise her  but if we go on we shall never have donefor the whole of yarmouth seemed to be therehigh and low rich and poor of course mrs dotropy was also there grand confused sententious as ever amiable and unable to command her feelingsin a state so to speak of melting magnificence  and a great many swell peopleas billy styled themcame down from london for mrs dotropy to their disgust had positively refused to have the wedding in the west end mansion for reasons best known to herself  you should have heard the cheer that followed the happy couple when they finally left the church and drove away  we do not refer to the cheering of the multitude that though very well in its way was a mere mosquitosqueak to the deeptoned deafening reverberating shout of an enthusiasmborn upon the sea fed on the bread and water of life strengthened alike by the breezes of success and the gales of adversitywhich burst in hurricane violence from the leathern lungs and throats of the north sea fishermen  we leave it reader to your imagination  there was no wedding breakfast proper for the happy pair left yarmouth immediately after the knot was tied but there was a small select party which drove off in a series of cabs to a feast prepared in a certain cottage not far from the town  this party was composed chiefly of fishermen and their wives and children  it was headed by captain bream and his sister mrs bright  in the same carriage were mrs dotropy the miss seawards and mrs joe davidson and her baby  it was a big oldfashioned carriage capable of holding six inside and billy bright swarmed upon the dickey  arrived at the cottage which had a fine lawn in front and commanded a splendid view of the sea captain bream got down took up a position at the gardengate and shaking hands with each guest as he or she entered bade him or her welcome to short blue cottage  tis a pleasant anchorage he said to the sisters seaward as they passed in very pleasant at the end of lifes voyage  praise the lord who gave it me  show them the way nellie theyll know it better before long  youll find gooseberry bushes in the back garden an the theological library in the starboard attic  their own berths are on the groundfloor  you may be sure that with such a host the guests were not long in making themselves at home  captain bream had not invited the party merely to a wedding feast  it was the season of fruits and flowers and he had set his heart on his friends making a day of it  accordingly he had made elaborate preparations for enjoyment  with that practical sagacity which frequently distinguishes the nautical mind he had provided bowls and quoits for the men battledore and shuttlecock for the younger women football and cricket and hoops with some incomprehensible eastern games for the children and a large field at the side of the cottage afforded room for all without much chance of collision  the feast was of course a strictly temperance one and we need scarcely say it was all the more enjoyable on that account  you see my friends said the host referring to this in one of his brief speeches as long as it may please god to leave me at anchor in this snug port ill never let a drop o strong drink enter my doors except in the form of physic and even then ill have the bottle labelled poisonto be taken under doctors prescription  so my ladsmy friends i mean beggin the ladies pardonyoull have to drink this toast and all the other toasts in lemonade ginger beer soda water seltzer zoedone tea coffee or cold water all of which wholesome beverages have been supplied in overflowing abundance to this fallen world and are to be found represented on this table  hear hear from john gunter and it was wonderful to hear the improvement in the tone of gunters voice since he had left off strong drink  his old foe but now fast friend luke trevor who sat beside him echoed the hear hear with such enthusiasm that all the others burst into a laugh and ended in a hearty cheer  now fill upfill up lads continued the captain  let it be a bumper whatever tipple you may choose  if our drink is better than it used to be our cups ought not to be less fulland my toast is worthy of all honour  i drink to the success and prosperity temporal and spiritual of the north sea trawlersthere was a symptom of a gathering cheer at this point but the captain checked it with a raised finger especially to that particular fleet which goes by the name of the short blue  the pentup storm burst forth now with unrestrained vehemence insomuch that three little ragged boys who had climbed on the low garden wall to watch proceedings fell off backwards as if shot by the mere sound  observing this and being near them mrs bright rose quietly leaned over the wall and emptied a basket of strawberries on their heads by way of consolation  we cannot afford space for the captains speech in full  suffice it to say that he renewed his former promise to revisit the fleet and spend some time among the fishermen as often as he could manage to do so and wound up by coupling the name of joe davidson skipper of the evening star with the toast  whereupon up started joe with flashing eyes intense enthusiasm overcoming sailorlike modesty and delivered a speech in which words seemed to tumble out of him anyhow and everyhowlongwise shortwise askew and upsidedownwithout much reference to grammar but with a powerful tendency in the direction of common sense  we have not space for this speech either but we give the concluding words  i tell ee wot it is boys  capn bream has drunk prosperity to the short blue an so have we for we love it but theres another short blue  a perfect storm of cheering broke forth at this point and drowned joe altogether  it would probably have blown over the three ragged boys a second time but they were getting used to such fire and besides were engaged with strawberries  theres another short blue resumed joe when the squall was over which my missis an me was talkin about this very day when our blessed babby fell slap out o bed an set up such a howl  joe could get no further because of the terrific peals of laughter which his words coupled with the pathetic sincerity of his expression drew forth  again and again he tried to speak but his innocent look and his mighty shoulders and tender voice with the thoughts of that blessed babby were too much for his mates so that he was obliged to finish off by shouting in a voice of thunderlets drink success to short blue cottage and with a toss of his hand in the true north seasalute style sat down in a tempest of applause  yes as an irish fisherman remarked it was a great day intoirely that day at short blue cottage and as no description can do it full justice we will turn to other mattersremarking however before quitting the subject that we do not tell the reader the exact spot where the cottage is situated as publicity on this point might subject our modest captain to much inconvenience  billy said captain bream one day a few months after the weddingday just described come with me to the theological library i want to have a chat with ee lad  billy followed his newfound uncle and sat down opposite to him  now lad the time has come when you and i must have it out  youre fond o hard work im told  well uncle i wont say as im exactly fond of it but i dont object to it  so far good returned the captain  well you know im your uncle an ive got a goodish lot of tin an im goin to leave the most of it to your motherfor shes the only relation i have on earthbut you neednt expect that im goin to leave it to you after her  i never said as i did expect that uncle said billy with such a straightforward look of simplicity that the captain burst into one of his thundering laughs  good my boy he said in a more confidential tone  well then this is how the matter stands  ive long held the opinion that those who can work should work and that all or nearly all the cash that people have to spare should be given or left to those who cant work such as poor invalidsspecially womenand those who have come to grief one way or another and lost the use o their limbs  right you are uncle said billy with strong emphasis  glad you agree so heartily boy  well that bein so i mean to leave the interest of all that i have to your dear mother as long as she livesexcept a legacy to the miss seawards and some other poor folk that i know of  meanwhile they have agreed as long as i live to stay wi me here in this cottage as my librarians and assistants in the matter of theology  i had a tough job to get em to agree but i managed it at last  so you see billy i dont mean to leave you a sixpence  well uncle said billy with a quiet look i dont care a brass farden  again the captain laughed  but he continued im very fond o you billy an theres no reason why i shouldnt help you to help yourself so if youre willin ill send you to the best of schools and after that to college an give you the best of educationin short make a man of you an put you in the way of makin your fortune  captain bream looked steadily into the fair boys handsome face as he made this glowing statement but somewhat to his disappointment he got no responsive glance from billy  on the contrary the boy became graver and graver and at last his mind seemed lost in meditation while his gaze was fixed on the floor  what think ye lad demanded the captain  billy seemed to awake as from a dream and then looking and speaking more like a man than he had ever done before he said  it is kind of you unclevery kindbut my dear dad once said he would make a man of me and he did  ill do my best to larn as much as ever i can o this worlds larnin but ill never leave the sea  now my boy said the captain think well before you decide  you could do far more good if you were a highly educated man you know  right you may be uncle an i dont despise edication by no means but some folk are born to it and others aint  besides good of the best kind can be done without much edication when the hearts right an the will strong as ive seed before now on the north sea  im sorry you look at it this way billy for i dont see that i can do much for you if you determine to remain a fisherman  oh yes you can uncle cried billy rising up in his eagerness and shaking back his curly hair  you can do this  you can take the money you intended to waste on my schoolin an send out books an tracts and medicines an all sorts o things to the fishin fleets  an if youre awful richas you seem to be by the way you talkyou can give some thousands o pounds an fit out two or three more smacks as you did the noo evenin star an hand em over to the mission to become gospelships to the fleets that have got none yet  thats the way to do good wi your coppers  as for memy daddy was a fisherman and my mother was a fishermans wife and im a fisherman to the backbone what my father was before me i mean to be after him so god permittin ill sail wi joe davidson till im old enough to take command o the evenin star and then ill stick through thick an thin to the north sea and live and die a fisherman of the short blue  billy brights determination was unalterable so captain bream fell in with it and heartily set about that part of the work which his nephew had recommended to him  whether he and billy will remain of the same mind to the end the future alone can showwe cannot tell but this weyou and i readercan do if we willwe can sympathise with our enthusiastic young trawler and do what in us lies to soften the hard lot of the fisherman by aiding those whose lifework it is to fish for souls of men and to toil summer and winter in the midst of life and death tempest and cold to rescue the perishing on the north sea
