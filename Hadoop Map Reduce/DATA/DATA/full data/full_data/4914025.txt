4914025	the battle of the books and other short pieces   by jonathan swift  cassell  company limited london paris new york  melbourne 1886     introduction   jonathan swift was born in 1667 on the 30th of november  his father was a jonathan swift sixth of the ten sons of the rev thomas swift vicar of goodrich near ross in herefordshire who had married elizabeth dryden niece to the poet drydens grandfather  jonathan swift married at leicester abigail erick or herrick who was of the family that had given to england robert herrick the poet  as their eldest brother godwin was prospering in ireland four other swifts dryden william jonathan and adam all in turn found their way to dublin  jonathan was admitted an attorney of the kings inns dublin and was appointed by the benchers to the office of steward of the kings inns in january 1666 he died in april 1667 leaving his widow with an infant daughter jane and an unborn child  swift was born in dublin seven months after his fathers death  his mother after a time returned to her own family in leicester and the child was added to the household of his uncle godwin swift who by his four wives became father to ten sons of his own and four daughters godwin swift sent his nephew to kilkenny school where he had william congreve among his schoolfellows  in april 1782 swift was entered at trinity college as pensioner together with his cousin thomas son of his uncle thomas  that cousin thomas afterwards became rector of puttenham in surrey  jonathan swift graduated as ba at dublin in february 1686 and remained in trinity college for another three years  he was ready to proceed to ma when his uncle godwin became insane  the troubles of 1689 also caused the closing of the university and jonathan swift went to leicester where mother and son took counsel together as to future possibilities of life  the retired statesman sir william temple at moor park near farnham in surrey was in highest esteem with the new king and the leaders of the revolution  his father as master of the irish rolls had been a friend of godwin swifts and with his wife swifts mother could claim cousinship  after some months therefore at leicester jonathan swift aged twentytwo went to moor park and entered sir william temples household doing service with the expectation of advancement through his influence  the advancement he desired was in the church  when swift went to moor park he found in its household a child six or seven years old daughter to mrs johnson who was trusted servant and companion to lady gifford sir william temples sister  with this little esther aged seven swift aged twentytwo became a playfellow and helper in her studies  he broke his english for her into what he called their little language that was part of the same playful kindliness and passed into their afterlife  in july 1692 with sir william temples help jonathan swift commenced ma in oxford as of hart hall  in 1694 swifts ambition having been thwarted by an offer of a clerkship of 120 pounds a year in the irish rolls he broke from sir william temple took orders and obtained through other influence in january 1695 the small prebendary of kilroot in the north of ireland  he was there for about a year  close by in belfast was an old college friend named waring who had a sister  swift was captivated by miss waring called her varina and would have become engaged to marry her if she had not flinched from engagement with a young clergyman whose income was but a hundred a year  but sir william temple had missed jonathan swift from moor park differences were forgotten and swift at his wish went back  this was in 1696 when his little pupil esther johnson was fifteen  swift said of her i knew her from six years old and had some share in her education by directing what books she should read and perpetually instructing her in the principles of honour and virtue from which she never swerved in any one action or moment of her life  she was sickly from her childhood until about the age of fifteen but then grew into perfect health and was then looked upon as one of the most beautiful graceful and agreeable young women in london only a little too fat  her hair was blacker than a raven and every feature of her face in perfection  this was the stella of swifts afterlife the one woman to whom his whole love was given  but side by side with the slow growth of his knowledge of all she was for him was the slow growth of his conviction that attacks of giddiness and deafness which first came when he was twenty and recurred at times throughout his life were signs to be associated with that which he regarded as the curse upon his life  his end would be like his uncle godwins  it was a curse transmissible to children but if he desired to keep the influence his genius gave him he could not tell the world why he refused to marry  only to stella who remained unmarried for his sake and gave her life to him could all be known  returned to moor park swift wrote in 1697 the battle of the books as well as the tale of the tub with which it was published seven years afterwards in 1704  perrault and others had been battling in france over the relative merits of ancient and modern writers  the debate had spread to england  on behalf of the ancients stress was laid by temple on the letters of phalaris tyrant of agrigentum  wotton replied to sir william for the moderns  the hon charles boyle of christ church published a new edition of the epistles of phalaris with translation of the greek text into latin  dr bentley the kings librarian published a dissertation on the epistles of phalaris denying their value and arguing that phalaris did not write them  christ church replied through charles boyle with dr bentleys dissertation on the epistles of phalaris examined  swift entered into the war with a light heart and matched the ancients in defending them for the amusement of his patron his incidental argument between the spider and the bee has provided a catchphrase sweetness and light to a combatant of later times  sir william temple died on the 27th of january 1699  swift then became chaplain to lord berkeley in dublin castle and it was as a little surprise to lady berkeley who liked him to read to her robert boyles meditations that swift wrote the meditation on a broomstick  in february 1700 he obtained from lord berkeley the vicarage of laracor with the living of rathbeggan also in the diocese of meath  in the beginning of 1701 esther johnson to whom sir william temple had bequeathed a leasehold farm in wicklow came with an elder friend miss dingley and settled in laracor to be near swift  during one of the visits to london made from laracor swift attacked the false pretensions of astrologers by that prediction of the death of mr partridge a prophetic almanac maker of which he described the accomplishment so clearly that partridge had much ado to get credit for being alive  the lines addressed to stella speak for themselves  cadenus and vanessa was meant as polite and courteous admonition to miss hester van homrigh a young lady in whom greensickness seems to have produced devotion to swift in forms that embarrassed him and with which he did not well know how to deal  h m     the bookseller to the reader   this discourse as it is unquestionably of the same author so it seems to have been written about the same time with the tale of a tub i mean the year 1697 when the famous dispute was on foot about ancient and modern learning  the controversy took its rise from an essay of sir william temples upon that subject which was answered by w wotton bd with an appendix by dr bentley endeavouring to destroy the credit of aesop and phalaris for authors whom sir william temple had in the essay before mentioned highly commended  in that appendix the doctor falls hard upon a new edition of phalaris put out by the honourable charles boyle now earl of orrery to which mr boyle replied at large with great learning and wit and the doctor voluminously rejoined  in this dispute the town highly resented to see a person of sir william temples character and merits roughly used by the two reverend gentlemen aforesaid and without any manner of provocation  at length there appearing no end of the quarrel our author tells us that the books in st jamess library looking upon themselves as parties principally concerned took up the controversy and came to a decisive battle but the manuscript by the injury of fortune or weather being in several places imperfect we cannot learn to which side the victory fell  i must warn the reader to beware of applying to persons what is here meant only of books in the most literal sense  so when virgil is mentioned we are not to understand the person of a famous poet called by that name but only certain sheets of paper bound up in leather containing in print the works of the said poet and so of the rest     the preface of the author   satire is a sort of glass wherein beholders do generally discover everybodys face but their own which is the chief reason for that kind reception it meets with in the world and that so very few are offended with it  but if it should happen otherwise the danger is not great and i have learned from long experience never to apprehend mischief from those understandings i have been able to provoke for anger and fury though they add strength to the sinews of the body yet are found to relax those of the mind and to render all its efforts feeble and impotent  there is a brain that will endure but one scumming let the owner gather it with discretion and manage his little stock with husbandry but of all things let him beware of bringing it under the lash of his betters because that will make it all bubble up into impertinence and he will find no new supply  wit without knowledge being a sort of cream which gathers in a night to the top and by a skilful hand may be soon whipped into froth but once scummed away what appears underneath will be fit for nothing but to be thrown to the hogs     a full and true account of the battle fought last friday between the ancient and the modern books in saint jamess library   whoever examines with due circumspection into the annual records of time will find it remarked that war is the child of pride and pride the daughter of richesthe former of which assertions may be soon granted but one cannot so easily subscribe to the latter for pride is nearly related to beggary and want either by father or mother and sometimes by both and to speak naturally it very seldom happens among men to fall out when all have enough invasions usually travelling from north to south that is to say from poverty to plenty  the most ancient and natural grounds of quarrels are lust and avarice which though we may allow to be brethren or collateral branches of pride are certainly the issues of want  for to speak in the phrase of writers upon politics we may observe in the republic of dogs which in its original seems to be an institution of the many that the whole state is ever in the profoundest peace after a full meal and that civil broils arise among them when it happens for one great bone to be seized on by some leading dog who either divides it among the few and then it falls to an oligarchy or keeps it to himself and then it runs up to a tyranny  the same reasoning also holds place among them in those dissensions we behold upon a turgescency in any of their females  for the right of possession lying in common it being impossible to establish a property in so delicate a case jealousies and suspicions do so abound that the whole commonwealth of that street is reduced to a manifest state of war of every citizen against every citizen till some one of more courage conduct or fortune than the rest seizes and enjoys the prize upon which naturally arises plenty of heartburning and envy and snarling against the happy dog  again if we look upon any of these republics engaged in a foreign war either of invasion or defence we shall find the same reasoning will serve as to the grounds and occasions of each and that poverty or want in some degree or other whether real or in opinion which makes no alteration in the case has a great share as well as pride on the part of the aggressor  now whoever will please to take this scheme and either reduce or adapt it to an intellectual state or commonwealth of learning will soon discover the first ground of disagreement between the two great parties at this time in arms and may form just conclusions upon the merits of either cause  but the issue or events of this war are not so easy to conjecture at for the present quarrel is so inflamed by the warm heads of either faction and the pretensions somewhere or other so exorbitant as not to admit the least overtures of accommodation  this quarrel first began as i have heard it affirmed by an old dweller in the neighbourhood about a small spot of ground lying and being upon one of the two tops of the hill parnassus the highest and largest of which had it seems been time out of mind in quiet possession of certain tenants called the ancients and the other was held by the moderns  but these disliking their present station sent certain ambassadors to the ancients complaining of a great nuisance how the height of that part of parnassus quite spoiled the prospect of theirs especially towards the east and therefore to avoid a war offered them the choice of this alternative either that the ancients would please to remove themselves and their effects down to the lower summit which the moderns would graciously surrender to them and advance into their place or else the said ancients will give leave to the moderns to come with shovels and mattocks and level the said hill as low as they shall think it convenient  to which the ancients made answer how little they expected such a message as this from a colony whom they had admitted out of their own free grace to so near a neighbourhood  that as to their own seat they were aborigines of it and therefore to talk with them of a removal or surrender was a language they did not understand  that if the height of the hill on their side shortened the prospect of the moderns it was a disadvantage they could not help but desired them to consider whether that injury if it be any were not largely recompensed by the shade and shelter it afforded them  that as to the levelling or digging down it was either folly or ignorance to propose it if they did or did not know how that side of the hill was an entire rock which would break their tools and hearts without any damage to itself  that they would therefore advise the moderns rather to raise their own side of the hill than dream of pulling down that of the ancients to the former of which they would not only give licence but also largely contribute  all this was rejected by the moderns with much indignation who still insisted upon one of the two expedients and so this difference broke out into a long and obstinate war maintained on the one part by resolution and by the courage of certain leaders and allies but on the other by the greatness of their number upon all defeats affording continual recruits in this quarrel whole rivulets of ink have been exhausted and the virulence of both parties enormously augmented  now it must be here understood that ink is the great missive weapon in all battles of the learned which conveyed through a sort of engine called a quill infinite numbers of these are darted at the enemy by the valiant on each side with equal skill and violence as if it were an engagement of porcupines  this malignant liquor was compounded by the engineer who invented it of two ingredients which are gall and copperas by its bitterness and venom to suit in some degree as well as to foment the genius of the combatants  and as the grecians after an engagement when they could not agree about the victory were wont to set up trophies on both sides the beaten party being content to be at the same expense to keep itself in countenance a laudable and ancient custom happily revived of late in the art of war so the learned after a sharp and bloody dispute do on both sides hang out their trophies too whichever comes by the worst  these trophies have largely inscribed on them the merits of the cause a full impartial account of such a battle and how the victory fell clearly to the party that set them up  they are known to the world under several names as disputes arguments rejoinders brief considerations answers replies remarks reflections objections confutations  for a very few days they are fixed up all in public places either by themselves or their representatives for passengers to gaze at whence the chiefest and largest are removed to certain magazines they call libraries there to remain in a quarter purposely assigned them and thenceforth begin to be called books of controversy  in these books is wonderfully instilled and preserved the spirit of each warrior while he is alive and after his death his soul transmigrates thither to inform them  this at least is the more common opinion but i believe it is with libraries as with other cemeteries where some philosophers affirm that a certain spirit which they call brutum hominis hovers over the monument till the body is corrupted and turns to dust or to worms but then vanishes or dissolves so we may say a restless spirit haunts over every book till dust or worms have seized upon itwhich to some may happen in a few days but to others laterand therefore books of controversy being of all others haunted by the most disorderly spirits have always been confined in a separate lodge from the rest and for fear of a mutual violence against each other it was thought prudent by our ancestors to bind them to the peace with strong iron chains  of which invention the original occasion was this when the works of scotus first came out they were carried to a certain library and had lodgings appointed them but this author was no sooner settled than he went to visit his master aristotle and there both concerted together to seize plato by main force and turn him out from his ancient station among the divines where he had peaceably dwelt near eight hundred years  the attempt succeeded and the two usurpers have reigned ever since in his stead but to maintain quiet for the future it was decreed that all polemics of the larger size should be hold fast with a chain  by this expedient the public peace of libraries might certainly have been preserved if a new species of controversial books had not arisen of late years instinct with a more malignant spirit from the war above mentioned between the learned about the higher summit of parnassus  when these books were first admitted into the public libraries i remember to have said upon occasion to several persons concerned how i was sure they would create broils wherever they came unless a world of care were taken and therefore i advised that the champions of each side should be coupled together or otherwise mixed that like the blending of contrary poisons their malignity might be employed among themselves and it seems i was neither an ill prophet nor an ill counsellor for it was nothing else but the neglect of this caution which gave occasion to the terrible fight that happened on friday last between the ancient and modern books in the kings library  now because the talk of this battle is so fresh in everybodys mouth and the expectation of the town so great to be informed in the particulars i being possessed of all qualifications requisite in an historian and retained by neither party have resolved to comply with the urgent importunity of my friends by writing down a full impartial account thereof  the guardian of the regal library a person of great valour but chiefly renowned for his humanity had been a fierce champion for the moderns and in an engagement upon parnassus had vowed with his own hands to knock down two of the ancient chiefs who guarded a small pass on the superior rock but endeavouring to climb up was cruelly obstructed by his own unhappy weight and tendency towards his centre a quality to which those of the modern party are extremely subject for being light headed they have in speculation a wonderful agility and conceive nothing too high for them to mount but in reducing to practice discover a mighty pressure about their posteriors and their heels  having thus failed in his design the disappointed champion bore a cruel rancour to the ancients which he resolved to gratify by showing all marks of his favour to the books of their adversaries and lodging them in the fairest apartments when at the same time whatever book had the boldness to own itself for an advocate of the ancients was buried alive in some obscure corner and threatened upon the least displeasure to be turned out of doors  besides it so happened that about this time there was a strange confusion of place among all the books in the library for which several reasons were assigned  some imputed it to a great heap of learned dust which a perverse wind blew off from a shelf of moderns into the keepers eyes  others affirmed he had a humour to pick the worms out of the schoolmen and swallow them fresh and fasting whereof some fell upon his spleen and some climbed up into his head to the great perturbation of both  and lastly others maintained that by walking much in the dark about the library he had quite lost the situation of it out of his head and therefore in replacing his books he was apt to mistake and clap descartes next to aristotle poor plato had got between hobbes and the seven wise masters and virgil was hemmed in with dryden on one side and wither on the other  meanwhile those books that were advocates for the moderns chose out one from among them to make a progress through the whole library examine the number and strength of their party and concert their affairs  this messenger performed all things very industriously and brought back with him a list of their forces in all fifty thousand consisting chiefly of lighthorse heavyarmed foot and mercenaries whereof the foot were in general but sorrily armed and worse clad their horses large but extremely out of case and heart however some few by trading among the ancients had furnished themselves tolerably enough  while things were in this ferment discord grew extremely high hot words passed on both sides and ill blood was plentifully bred  here a solitary ancient squeezed up among a whole shelf of moderns offered fairly to dispute the case and to prove by manifest reason that the priority was due to them from long possession and in regard of their prudence antiquity and above all their great merits toward the moderns  but these denied the premises and seemed very much to wonder how the ancients could pretend to insist upon their antiquity when it was so plain if they went to that that the moderns were much the more ancient of the two  as for any obligations they owed to the ancients they renounced them all  it is true said they we are informed some few of our party have been so mean as to borrow their subsistence from you but the rest infinitely the greater number and especially we french and english were so far from stooping to so base an example that there never passed till this very hour six words between us  for our horses were of our own breeding our arms of our own forging and our clothes of our own cutting out and sewing  plato was by chance up on the next shelf and observing those that spoke to be in the ragged plight mentioned a while ago their jades lean and foundered their weapons of rotten wood their armour rusty and nothing but rags underneath he laughed loud and in his pleasant way swore by  he believed them  now the moderns had not proceeded in their late negotiation with secrecy enough to escape the notice of the enemy  for those advocates who had begun the quarrel by setting first on foot the dispute of precedency talked so loud of coming to a battle that sir william temple happened to overhear them and gave immediate intelligence to the ancients who thereupon drew up their scattered troops together resolving to act upon the defensive upon which several of the moderns fled over to their party and among the rest temple himself  this temple having been educated and long conversed among the ancients was of all the moderns their greatest favourite and became their greatest champion  things were at this crisis when a material accident fell out  for upon the highest corner of a large window there dwelt a certain spider swollen up to the first magnitude by the destruction of infinite numbers of flies whose spoils lay scattered before the gates of his palace like human bones before the cave of some giant  the avenues to his castle were guarded with turnpikes and palisadoes all after the modern way of fortification  after you had passed several courts you came to the centre wherein you might behold the constable himself in his own lodgings which had windows fronting to each avenue and ports to sally out upon all occasions of prey or defence  in this mansion he had for some time dwelt in peace and plenty without danger to his person by swallows from above or to his palace by brooms from below when it was the pleasure of fortune to conduct thither a wandering bee to whose curiosity a broken pane in the glass had discovered itself and in he went where expatiating a while he at last happened to alight upon one of the outward walls of the spiders citadel which yielding to the unequal weight sunk down to the very foundation  thrice he endeavoured to force his passage and thrice the centre shook  the spider within feeling the terrible convulsion supposed at first that nature was approaching to her final dissolution or else that beelzebub with all his legions was come to revenge the death of many thousands of his subjects whom his enemy had slain and devoured  however he at length valiantly resolved to issue forth and meet his fate  meanwhile the bee had acquitted himself of his toils and posted securely at some distance was employed in cleansing his wings and disengaging them from the ragged remnants of the cobweb  by this time the spider was adventured out when beholding the chasms the ruins and dilapidations of his fortress he was very near at his wits end he stormed and swore like a madman and swelled till he was ready to burst  at length casting his eye upon the bee and wisely gathering causes from events for they know each other by sight a plague split you said he is it you with a vengeance that have made this litter here could not you look before you and be dd  do you think i have nothing else to do in the devils name but to mend and repair after you  good words friend said the bee having now pruned himself and being disposed to droll ill give you my hand and word to come near your kennel no more i was never in such a confounded pickle since i was born  sirrah replied the spider if it were not for breaking an old custom in our family never to stir abroad against an enemy i should come and teach you better manners  i pray have patience said the bee or youll spend your substance and for aught i see you may stand in need of it all towards the repair of your house  rogue rogue replied the spider yet methinks you should have more respect to a person whom all the world allows to be so much your betters  by my troth said the bee the comparison will amount to a very good jest and you will do me a favour to let me know the reasons that all the world is pleased to use in so hopeful a dispute  at this the spider having swelled himself into the size and posture of a disputant began his argument in the true spirit of controversy with resolution to be heartily scurrilous and angry to urge on his own reasons without the least regard to the answers or objections of his opposite and fully predetermined in his mind against all conviction  not to disparage myself said he by the comparison with such a rascal what art thou but a vagabond without house or home without stock or inheritance born to no possession of your own but a pair of wings and a dronepipe  your livelihood is a universal plunder upon nature a freebooter over fields and gardens and for the sake of stealing will rob a nettle as easily as a violet  whereas i am a domestic animal furnished with a native stock within myself  this large castle to show my improvements in the mathematics is all built with my own hands and the materials extracted altogether out of my own person  i am glad answered the bee to hear you grant at least that i am come honestly by my wings and my voice for then it seems i am obliged to heaven alone for my flights and my music and providence would never have bestowed on me two such gifts without designing them for the noblest ends  i visit indeed all the flowers and blossoms of the field and garden but whatever i collect thence enriches myself without the least injury to their beauty their smell or their taste  now for you and your skill in architecture and other mathematics i have little to say in that building of yours there might for aught i know have been labour and method enough but by woeful experience for us both it is too plain the materials are naught and i hope you will henceforth take warning and consider duration and matter as well as method and art  you boast indeed of being obliged to no other creature but of drawing and spinning out all from yourself that is to say if we may judge of the liquor in the vessel by what issues out you possess a good plentiful store of dirt and poison in your breast and though i would by no means lesson or disparage your genuine stock of either yet i doubt you are somewhat obliged for an increase of both to a little foreign assistance  your inherent portion of dirt does not fall of acquisitions by sweepings exhaled from below and one insect furnishes you with a share of poison to destroy another  so that in short the question comes all to this whether is the nobler being of the two that which by a lazy contemplation of four inches round by an overweening pride feeding and engendering on itself turns all into excrement and venom producing nothing at all but flybane and a cobweb or that which by a universal range with long search much study true judgment and distinction of things brings home honey and wax  this dispute was managed with such eagerness clamour and warmth that the two parties of books in arms below stood silent a while waiting in suspense what would be the issue which was not long undetermined for the bee grown impatient at so much loss of time fled straight away to a bed of roses without looking for a reply and left the spider like an orator collected in himself and just prepared to burst out  it happened upon this emergency that aesop broke silence first  he had been of late most barbarously treated by a strange effect of the regents humanity who had torn off his titlepage sorely defaced one half of his leaves and chained him fast among a shelf of moderns  where soon discovering how high the quarrel was likely to proceed he tried all his arts and turned himself to a thousand forms  at length in the borrowed shape of an ass the regent mistook him for a modern by which means he had time and opportunity to escape to the ancients just when the spider and the bee were entering into their contest to which he gave his attention with a world of pleasure and when it was ended swore in the loudest key that in all his life he had never known two cases so parallel and adapt to each other as that in the window and this upon the shelves  the disputants said he have admirably managed the dispute between them have taken in the full strength of all that is to be said on both sides and exhausted the substance of every argument pro and con  it is but to adjust the reasonings of both to the present quarrel then to compare and apply the labours and fruits of each as the bee has learnedly deduced them and we shall find the conclusion fall plain and close upon the moderns and us  for pray gentlemen was ever anything so modern as the spider in his air his turns and his paradoxes he argues in the behalf of you his brethren and himself with many boastings of his native stock and great genius that he spins and spits wholly from himself and scorns to own any obligation or assistance from without  then he displays to you his great skill in architecture and improvement in the mathematics  to all this the bee as an advocate retained by us the ancients thinks fit to answer that if one may judge of the great genius or inventions of the moderns by what they have produced you will hardly have countenance to bear you out in boasting of either  erect your schemes with as much method and skill as you please yet if the materials be nothing but dirt spun out of your own entrails the guts of modern brains the edifice will conclude at last in a cobweb the duration of which like that of other spiders webs may be imputed to their being forgotten or neglected or hid in a corner  for anything else of genuine that the moderns may pretend to i cannot recollect unless it be a large vein of wrangling and satire much of a nature and substance with the spiders poison which however they pretend to spit wholly out of themselves is improved by the same arts by feeding upon the insects and vermin of the age  as for us the ancients we are content with the bee to pretend to nothing of our own beyond our wings and our voice that is to say our flights and our language  for the rest whatever we have got has been by infinite labour and search and ranging through every corner of nature the difference is that instead of dirt and poison we have rather chosen to till our hives with honey and wax thus furnishing mankind with the two noblest of things which are sweetness and light  it is wonderful to conceive the tumult arisen among the books upon the close of this long descant of aesop both parties took the hint and heightened their animosities so on a sudden that they resolved it should come to a battle  immediately the two main bodies withdrew under their several ensigns to the farther parts of the library and there entered into cabals and consults upon the present emergency  the moderns were in very warm debates upon the choice of their leaders and nothing less than the fear impending from their enemies could have kept them from mutinies upon this occasion  the difference was greatest among the horse where every private trooper pretended to the chief command from tasso and milton to dryden and wither  the lighthorse were commanded by cowley and despreaux  there came the bowmen under their valiant leaders descartes gassendi and hobbes whose strength was such that they could shoot their arrows beyond the atmosphere never to fall down again but turn like that of evander into meteors or like the cannonball into stars  paracelsus brought a squadron of stinkpotflingers from the snowy mountains of rhaetia  there came a vast body of dragoons of different nations under the leading of harvey their great aga part armed with scythes the weapons of death part with lances and long knives all steeped in poison part shot bullets of a most malignant nature and used white powder which infallibly killed without report  there came several bodies of heavyarmed foot all mercenaries under the ensigns of guicciardini davila polydore vergil buchanan mariana camden and others  the engineers were commanded by regiomontanus and wilkins  the rest was a confused multitude led by scotus aquinas and bellarmine of mighty bulk and stature but without either arms courage or discipline in the last place came infinite swarms of calones a disorderly rout led by lestrange rogues and ragamuffins that follow the camp for nothing but the plunder all without coats to cover them  the army of the ancients was much fewer in number homer led the horse and pindar the lighthorse euclid was chief engineer plato and aristotle commanded the bowmen herodotus and livy the foot hippocrates the dragoons the allies led by vossius and temple brought up the rear  all things violently tending to a decisive battle fame who much frequented and had a large apartment formerly assigned her in the regal library fled up straight to jupiter to whom she delivered a faithful account of all that passed between the two parties below for among the gods she always tells truth  jove in great concern convokes a council in the milky way  the senate assembled he declares the occasion of convening them a bloody battle just impendent between two mighty armies of ancient and modern creatures called books wherein the celestial interest was but too deeply concerned  momus the patron of the moderns made an excellent speech in their favour which was answered by pallas the protectress of the ancients  the assembly was divided in their affections when jupiter commanded the book of fate to be laid before him  immediately were brought by mercury three large volumes in folio containing memoirs of all things past present and to come  the clasps were of silver double gilt the covers of celestial turkey leather and the paper such as here on earth might pass almost for vellum  jupiter having silently read the decree would communicate the import to none but presently shut up the book  without the doors of this assembly there attended a vast number of light nimble gods menial servants to jupiter those are his ministering instruments in all affairs below  they travel in a caravan more or less together and are fastened to each other like a link of galleyslaves by a light chain which passes from them to jupiters great toe and yet in receiving or delivering a message they may never approach above the lowest step of his throne where he and they whisper to each other through a large hollow trunk  these deities are called by mortal men accidents or events but the gods call them second causes  jupiter having delivered his message to a certain number of these divinities they flew immediately down to the pinnacle of the regal library and consulting a few minutes entered unseen and disposed the parties according to their orders  meanwhile momus fearing the worst and calling to mind an ancient prophecy which bore no very good face to his children the moderns bent his flight to the region of a malignant deity called criticism  she dwelt on the top of a snowy mountain in nova zembla there momus found her extended in her den upon the spoils of numberless volumes half devoured  at her right hand sat ignorance her father and husband blind with age at her left pride her mother dressing her up in the scraps of paper herself had torn  there was opinion her sister light of foot hoodwinked and headstrong yet giddy and perpetually turning  about her played her children noise and impudence dulness and vanity

only upon herself her diet was the overflowing of her own gall her spleen was so large as to stand prominent like a dug of the first rate nor wanted excrescences in form of teats at which a crew of ugly monsters were greedily sucking and what is wonderful to conceive the bulk of spleen increased faster than the sucking could diminish it  goddess said momus can you sit idly here while our devout worshippers the moderns are this minute entering into a cruel battle and perhaps now lying under the swords of their enemies who then hereafter will ever sacrifice or build altars to our divinities  haste therefore to the british isle and if possible prevent their destruction while i make factions among the gods and gain them over to our party  momus having thus delivered himself stayed not for an answer but left the goddess to her own resentment  up she rose in a rage and as it is the form on such occasions began a soliloquy it is i said she who give wisdom to infants and idiots by me children grow wiser than their parents by me beaux become politicians and schoolboys judges of philosophy by me sophisters debate and conclude upon the depths of knowledge and coffeehouse wits instinct by me can correct an authors style and display his minutest errors without understanding a syllable of his matter or his language by me striplings spend their judgment as they do their estate before it comes into their hands  it is i who have deposed wit and knowledge from their empire over poetry and advanced myself in their stead  and shall a few upstart ancients dare to oppose me  but come my aged parent and you my children dear and thou my beauteous sister let us ascend my chariot and haste to assist our devout moderns who are now sacrificing to us a hecatomb as i perceive by that grateful smell which from thence reaches my nostrils  the goddess and her train having mounted the chariot which was drawn by tame geese flew over infinite regions shedding her influence in due places till at length she arrived at her beloved island of britain but in hovering over its metropolis what blessings did she not let fall upon her seminaries of gresham and coventgarden  and now she reached the fatal plain of st jamess library at what time the two armies were upon the point to engage where entering with all her caravan unseen and landing upon a case of shelves now desert but once inhabited by a colony of virtuosos she stayed awhile to observe the posture of both armies  but here the tender cares of a mother began to fill her thoughts and move in her breast for at the head of a troup of modern bowmen she cast her eyes upon her son wotton to whom the fates had assigned a very short thread  wotton a young hero whom an unknown father of mortal race begot by stolen embraces with this goddess  he was the darling of his mother above all her children and she resolved to go and comfort him but first according to the good old custom of deities she cast about to change her shape for fear the divinity of her countenance might dazzle his mortal sight and overcharge the rest of his senses  she therefore gathered up her person into an octavo compass her body grow white and arid and split in pieces with dryness the thick turned into pasteboard and the thin into paper upon which her parents and children artfully strewed a black juice or decoction of gall and soot in form of letters her head and voice and spleen kept their primitive form and that which before was a cover of skin did still continue so  in this guise she marched on towards the moderns indistinguishable in shape and dress from the divine bentley wottons dearest friend  brave wotton said the goddess why do our troops stand idle here to spend their present vigour and opportunity of the day away let us haste to the generals and advise to give the onset immediately  having spoke thus she took the ugliest of her monsters full glutted from her spleen and flung it invisibly into his mouth which flying straight up into his head squeezed out his eyeballs gave him a distorted look and halfoverturned his brain  then she privately ordered two of her beloved children dulness and illmanners closely to attend his person in all encounters  having thus accoutred him she vanished in a mist and the hero perceived it was the goddess his mother  the destined hour of fate being now arrived the fight began whereof before i dare adventure to make a particular description i must after the example of other authors petition for a hundred tongues and mouths and hands and pens which would all be too little to perform so immense a work  say goddess that presidest over history who it was that first advanced in the field of battle  paracelsus at the head of his dragoons observing galen in the adverse wing

head but descartes it hit the steel point quickly found a defect in his headpiece it pierced the leather and the pasteboard and went in at his right eye  the torture of the pain whirled the valiant bowman round till death like a star of superior influence drew him into his own vortex ingens hiatus     hic in ms           when homer appeared at the head of the cavalry mounted on a furious horse with difficulty managed by the rider himself but which no other mortal durst approach he rode among the enemys ranks and bore down all before him  say goddess whom he slew first and whom he slew last  first gondibert advanced against him clad in heavy armour and mounted on a staid sober gelding not so famed for his speed as his docility in kneeling whenever his rider would mount or alight  he had made a vow to pallas that he would never leave the field till he had spoiled homer of his armour madman who had never once seen the wearer nor understood his strength  him homer overthrew horse and man to the ground there to be trampled and choked in the dirt  then with a long spear he slew denham a stout modern who from his fathers side derived his lineage from apollo but his mother was of mortal race  he fell and bit the earth  the celestial part apollo took and made it a star but the terrestrial lay wallowing upon the ground  then homer slew sam wesley with a kick of his horses heel he took perrault by mighty force out of his saddle then hurled him at fontenelle with the same blow dashing out both their brains  on the left wing of the horse virgil appeared in shining armour completely fitted to his body he was mounted on a dapplegrey steed the slowness of whose pace was an effect of the highest mettle and vigour  he cast his eye on the adverse wing with a desire to find an object worthy of his valour when behold upon a sorrel gelding of a monstrous size appeared a foe issuing from among the thickest of the enemys squadrons but his speed was less than his noise for his horse old and lean spent the dregs of his strength in a high trot which though it made slow advances yet caused a loud clashing of his armour terrible to hear  the two cavaliers had now approached within the throw of a lance when the stranger desired a parley and lifting up the visor of his helmet a face hardly appeared from within which after a pause was known for that of the renowned dryden  the brave ancient suddenly started as one possessed with surprise and disappointment together for the helmet was nine times too large for the head which appeared situate far in the hinder part even like the lady in a lobster or like a mouse under a canopy of state or like a shrivelled beau from within the penthouse of a modern periwig and the voice was suited to the visage sounding weak and remote  dryden in a long harangue soothed up the good ancient called him father and by a large deduction of genealogies made it plainly appear that they were nearly related  then he humbly proposed an exchange of armour as a lasting mark of hospitality between them  virgil consented for the goddess diffidence came unseen and cast a mist before his eyes though his was of gold and cost a hundred beeves the others but of rusty iron  however this glittering armour became the modern yet worsen than his own  then they agreed to exchange horses but when it came to the trial dryden was afraid and utterly unable to mount   alter hiatus     in ms lucan appeared upon a fiery horse of admirable shape but headstrong bearing the rider where he list over the field he made a mighty slaughter among the enemys horse which destruction to stop blackmore a famous modern but one of the mercenaries strenuously opposed himself and darted his javelin with a strong hand which falling short of its mark struck deep in the earth  then lucan threw a lance but aesculapius came unseen and turned off the point  brave modern said lucan i perceive some god protects you for never did my arm so deceive me before but what mortal can contend with a god  therefore let us fight no longer but present gifts to each other  lucan then bestowed on the modern a pair of spurs and blackmore gave lucan a bridle    pauca desunt        creech but the goddess dulness took a cloud formed into the shape of horace armed and mounted and placed in a flying posture before him glad was the cavalier to begin a combat with a

observed his generous heart burnt within him and he advanced against the fierce ancient imitating his address his pace and career as well as the vigour of his horse and his own skill would allow  when the two cavaliers had approached within the length of three javelins first cowley threw a lance which missed pindar and passing into the enemys ranks fell ineffectual to the ground  then pindar darted a javelin so large and weighty that scarce a dozen cavaliers as cavaliers are in our degenerate days could raise it from the ground yet he threw it with ease and it went by an unerring hand singing through the air nor could the modern have avoided present death if he had not luckily opposed the shield that had been given him by venus  and now both heroes drew their swords but the modern was so aghast and disordered that he knew not where he was his shield dropped from his hands thrice he fled and thrice he could not escape  at last he turned and lifting up his hand in the posture of a suppliant godlike pindar said he spare my life and possess my horse with these arms beside the ransom which my friends will give when they hear i am alive and your prisoner  dog said pindar let your ransom stay with your friends but your carcase shall be left for the fowls of the air and the beasts of the field  with that he raised his sword and with a mighty stroke cleft the wretched modern in twain the sword pursuing the blow and one half lay panting on the ground to be trod in pieces by the horses feet the other half was borne by the frighted steed through the field  this venus took washed it seven times in ambrosia then struck it thrice with a sprig of amaranth upon which the leather grow round and soft and the leaves turned into feathers and being gilded before continued gilded

moderns half inclining to a retreat there issued forth from a squadron of their heavyarmed foot a captain whose name was bentley the most deformed of all the moderns tall but without shape or comeliness large but without strength or proportion  his armour was patched up of a thousand incoherent pieces and the sound of it as he marched was loud and dry like that made by the fall of a sheet of lead which an etesian wind blows suddenly down from the roof of some steeple  his helmet was of old rusty iron but the vizor was brass which tainted by his breath corrupted into copperas nor wanted gall from the same fountain so that whenever provoked by anger or labour an atramentous quality of most malignant nature was seen to distil from his lips  in his right hand he grasped a flail and that he might never be unprovided of an offensive weapon a vessel full of ordure in his left  thus completely armed he advanced with a slow and heavy pace where the modern chiefs were holding a consult upon the sum of things who as he came onwards laughed to behold his crooked leg and humped shoulder which his boot and armour vainly endeavouring to hide were forced to comply with and expose  the generals made use of him for his talent of railing which kept within government proved frequently of great service to their cause but at other times did more mischief than good for at the least touch of offence and often without any at all he would like a wounded elephant convert it against his leaders  such at this juncture was the disposition of bentley grieved to see the enemy prevail and dissatisfied with everybodys conduct but his own  he humbly gave the modern generals to understand that he conceived with great submission they were all a pack of rogues and fools and confounded loggerheads and illiterate whelps and nonsensical scoundrels that if himself had been constituted general those presumptuous dogs the ancients would long before this have been beaten out of the field  you said he sit here idle but when i or any other valiant modern kill an enemy you are sure to seize the spoil  but i will not march one foot against the foe till you all swear to me that whomever i take or kill his arms i shall quietly possess  bentley having spoken thus scaliger bestowing him a sour look miscreant prater said he eloquent only in thine own eyes thou railest without wit or truth or discretion  the malignity of thy temper perverteth nature thy learning makes thee more barbarous thy study of humanity more inhuman thy converse among poets more grovelling miry and dull  all arts of civilising others render thee rude and untractable courts have taught thee ill manners and polite conversation has finished thee a pedant  besides a greater coward burdeneth not the army  but never despond i pass my word whatever spoil thou takest shall certainly be thy own though i hope that vile carcase will first become a prey to kites and worms  bentley durst not reply but half choked with spleen and rage withdrew in full resolution of performing some great achievement  with him for his aid and companion he took his beloved wotton resolving by policy or surprise to attempt some neglected quarter of the ancients army  they began their march over carcases of their slaughtered friends then to the right of their own forces then wheeled northward till they came to aldrovanduss tomb which they passed on the side of the declining sun and now they arrived with fear toward the enemys outguards looking about if haply they might spy the quarters of the wounded or some straggling sleepers unarmed and remote from the rest  as when two mongrel curs whom native greediness and domestic want provoke and join in partnership though fearful nightly to invade the folds of some rich grazier they with tails depressed and lolling tongues creep soft and slow  meanwhile the conscious moon now in her zenith on their guilty heads darts perpendicular rays nor dare they bark though much provoked at her refulgent visage whether seen in puddle by reflection or in sphere direct but one surveys the region round while the other scouts the plain if haply to discover at distance from the flock some carcase half devoured the refuse of gorged wolves or ominous ravens  so marched this lovely loving pair of friends nor with less fear and circumspection when at a distance they might perceive two shining suits of armour hanging upon an oak and the owners not far off in a profound sleep  the two friends drew lots and the pursuing of this adventure fell to bentley on he went and in his van confusion and amaze while horror and affright brought up the rear  as he came near behold two heroes of the ancient army phalaris and aesop lay fast asleep  bentley would fain have despatched them both and stealing close aimed his flail at phalariss breast but then the goddess affright interposing caught the modern in her icy arms and dragged him from the danger she foresaw both the dormant heroes happened to turn at the same instant though soundly sleeping and busy in a dream  for phalaris was just that minute dreaming how a most vile poetaster had lampooned him and how he had got him roaring in his bull  and aesop dreamed that as he and the ancient were lying on the ground a wild ass broke loose ran about trampling and kicking in their faces  bentley leaving the two heroes asleep seized on both their armours and withdrew in quest of his darling wotton  he in the meantime had wandered long in search of some enterprise till at length he arrived at a small rivulet that issued from a fountain hard by called in the language of mortal men helicon  here he stopped and parched with thirst resolved to allay it in this limpid stream thrice with profane hands he essayed to raise the water to his lips and thrice it slipped all through his fingers  then he stopped prone on his breast but ere his mouth had kissed the liquid crystal apollo came and in the channel held his shield betwixt the modern and the fountain so that he drew up nothing but mud  for although no fountain on earth can compare with the clearness of helicon yet there lies at bottom a thick sediment of slime and mud for so apollo begged of jupiter as a punishment to those who durst attempt to taste it with unhallowed lips and for a lesson to all not to draw too deep or far from the spring  at the fountainhead wotton discerned two heroes the one he could not distinguish but the other was soon known for temple general of the allies to the ancients  his back was turned and he was employed in drinking large draughts in his helmet from the fountain where he had withdrawn himself to rest from the toils of the war  wotton observing him with quaking knees and trembling hands spoke thus to himself o that i could kill this destroyer of our army what renown should i purchase among the chiefs but to issue out against him man against man shield against shield and lance against lance what modern of us dare for he fights like a god and pallas or apollo are ever at his elbow but o mother if what fame reports be true that i am the son of so great a goddess grant me to hit temple with this lance that the stroke may send him to hell and that i may return in safety and triumph laden with his spoils  the first part of this prayer the gods granted at the intercession of his mother and of momus but the rest by a perverse wind sent from fate was scattered in the air  then wotton grasped his lance and brandishing it thrice over his head darted it with all his might the goddess his mother at the same time adding strength to his arm away the lance went hizzing and reached even to the belt of the averted ancient upon which lightly grazing it fell to the ground  temple neither felt the weapon touch him nor heard it fall and wotton might have escaped to his army with the honour of having remitted his lance against so great a leader unrevenged but apollo enraged that a javelin flung by the assistance of so foul a goddess should pollute his fountain put on the shape of  and softly came to young boyle who then accompanied temple he pointed first to the lance then to the distant modern that flung it and commanded the young hero to take immediate revenge  boyle clad in a suit of armour which had been given him by all the gods immediately advanced against the trembling foe who now fled before him  as a young lion in the libyan plains or araby desert sent by his aged sire to hunt for prey or health or exercise he scours along wishing to meet some tiger from the mountains or a furious boar if chance a wild ass with brayings importune affronts his ear the generous beast though loathing to distain his claws with blood so vile yet much provoked at the offensive noise which echo foolish nymph like her illjudging sex repeats much louder and with more delight than philomelas song he vindicates the honour of the forest and hunts the noisy longeared animal  so wotton fled so boyle pursued  but wotton heavyarmed and slow of foot began to slack his course when his lover bentley appeared returning laden with the spoils of the two sleeping ancients  boyle observed him well and soon discovering the helmet and shield of phalaris his friend both which he had lately with his own hands new polished and gilt rage sparkled in his eyes and leaving his pursuit after wotton he furiously rushed on against this new approacher fain would he be revenged on both but both now fled different ways and as a woman in a little house that gets a painful livelihood by spinning if chance her geese be scattered oer the common she courses round the plain from side to side compelling here and there the stragglers to the flock they cackle loud and flutter oer the champaign so boyle pursued so fled this pair of friends finding at length their flight was vain they bravely joined and drew themselves in phalanx  first bentley threw a spear with all his force hoping to pierce the enemys breast but pallas came unseen and in the air took off the point and clapped on one of lead which after a dead bang against the enemys shield fell blunted to the ground  then boyle observing well his time took up a lance of wondrous length and sharpness and as this pair of friends compacted stood close side by side he wheeled him to the right and with unusual force darted the weapon  bentley saw his fate approach and flanking down his arms close to his ribs hoping to save his body in went the point passing through arm and side nor stopped or spent its force till it had also pierced the valiant wotton who going to sustain his dying friend shared his fate  as when a skilful cook has trussed a brace of woodcocks he with iron skewer pierces the tender sides of both their legs and wings close pinioned to the rib so was this pair of friends transfixed till down they fell joined in their lives joined in their deaths so closely joined that charon would mistake them both for one and waft them over styx for half his fare  farewell beloved loving pair few equals have you left behind and happy and immortal shall you be if all my wit and eloquence can make you  and now     desunt coetera     a meditation upon a broomstick   according to the style and manner of the hon robert boyles meditations  this single stick which you now behold ingloriously lying in that neglected corner i once knew in a flourishing state in a forest  it was full of sap full of leaves and full of boughs but now in vain does the busy art of man pretend to vie with nature by tying that withered bundle of twigs to its sapless trunk it is now at best but the reverse of what it was a tree turned upsidedown the branches on the earth and the root in the air it is now handled by every dirty wench condemned to do her drudgery and by a capricious kind of fate destined to make other things clean and be nasty itself at length worn to the stumps in the service of the maids it is either thrown out of doors or condemned to the last useof kindling a fire  when i behold this i sighed and said within myself surely mortal man is a broomstick  nature sent him into the world strong and lusty in a thriving condition wearing his own hair on his head the proper branches of this reasoning vegetable till the axe of intemperance has lopped off his green boughs and left him a withered trunk he then flies to art and puts on a periwig valuing himself upon an unnatural bundle of hairs all covered with powder that never grew on his head but now should this our broomstick pretend to enter the scene proud of those birchen spoils it never bore and all covered with dust through the sweepings of the finest ladys chamber we should be apt to ridicule and despise its vanity  partial judges that we are of our own excellencies and other mens defaults  but a broomstick perhaps you will say is an emblem of a tree standing on its head and pray what is a man but a topsyturvy creature his animal faculties perpetually mounted on his rational his head where his heels should be grovelling on the earth  and yet with all his faults he sets up to be a universal reformer and corrector of abuses a remover of grievances rakes into every sluts corner of nature bringing hidden corruptions to the light and raises a mighty dust where there was none before sharing deeply all the while in the very same pollutions he pretends to sweep away  his last days are spent in slavery to women and generally the least deserving till worn to the stumps like his brother besom he is either kicked out of doors or made use of to kindle flames for others to warm themselves by     predictions for the year 1708   wherein the month and day of the month are set down the persons named and the great actions and events of next year particularly related as will come to pass  written to prevent the people of england from being farther imposed on by vulgar almanackmakers  by isaac bickerstaff esq  i have long considered the gross abuse of astrology in this kingdom and upon debating the matter with myself i could not possibly lay the fault upon the art but upon those gross impostors who set up to be the artists  i know several learned men have contended that the whole is a cheat that it is absurd and ridiculous to imagine the stars can have any influence at all upon human actions thoughts or inclinations and whoever has not bent his studies that way may be excused for thinking so when he sees in how wretched a manner that noble art is treated by a few mean illiterate traders between us and the stars who import a yearly stock of nonsense lies folly and impertinence which they offer to the world as genuine from the planets though they descend from no greater a height than their own brains  i intend in a short time to publish a large and rational defence of this art and therefore shall say no more in its justification at present than that it hath been in all ages defended by many learned men and among the rest by socrates himself whom i look upon as undoubtedly the wisest of uninspired mortals to which if we add that those who have condemned this art though otherwise learned having been such as either did not apply their studies this way or at least did not succeed in their applications their testimony will not be of much weight to its disadvantage since they are liable to the common objection of condemning what they did not understand  nor am i at all offended or think it an injury to the art when i see the common dealers in it the students in astrology the philomaths and the rest of that tribe treated by wise men with the utmost scorn and contempt but rather wonder when i observe gentlemen in the country rich enough to serve the nation in parliament poring in partridges almanack to find out the events of the year at home and abroad not daring to propose a huntingmatch till gadbury or he have fixed the weather  i will allow either of the two i have mentioned or any other of the fraternity to be not only astrologers but conjurers too if i do not produce a hundred instances in all their almanacks to convince any reasonable man that they do not so much as understand common grammar and syntax that they are not able to spell any word out of the usual road nor even in their prefaces write common sense or intelligible english then for their observations and predictions they are such as will equally suit any age or country in the world  this month a certain great person will be threatened with death or sickness  this the newspapers will tell them for there we find at the end of the year that no month passes without the death of some person of note and it would be hard if it should be otherwise when there are at least two thousand persons of note in this kingdom many of them old and the almanackmaker has the liberty of choosing the sickliest season of the year where he may fix his prediction  again this month an eminent clergyman will be preferred of which there may be some hundreds half of them with one foot in the grave  then such a planet in such a house shows great machinations plots and conspiracies that may in time be brought to light after which if we hear of any discovery the astrologer gets the honour if not his prediction still stands good  and at last god preserve king william from all his open and secret enemies amen  when if the king should happen to have died the astrologer plainly foretold it otherwise it passes but for the pious ejaculation of a loyal subject though it unluckily happened in some of their almanacks that poor king william was prayed for many months after he was dead because it fell out that he died about the beginning of the year  to mention no more of their impertinent predictions what have we to do with their advertisements about pills and drink for disease or their mutual quarrels in verse and prose of whig and tory wherewith the stars have little to do  having long observed and lamented these and a hundred other abuses of this art too tedious to repeat i resolved to proceed in a new way which i doubt not will be to the general satisfaction of the kingdom  i can this year produce but a specimen of what i design for the future having employed most part of my time in adjusting and correcting the calculations i made some years past because i would offer nothing to the world of which i am not as fully satisfied as that i am now alive  for these two last years i have not failed in above one or two particulars and those of no very great moment  i exactly foretold the miscarriage at toulon with all its particulars and the loss of admiral shovel though i was mistaken as to the day placing that accident about thirtysix hours sooner than it happened but upon reviewing my schemes i quickly found the cause of that error  i likewise foretold the battle of almanza to the very day and hour with the lose on both sides and the consequences thereof  all which i showed to some friends many months before they happenedthat is i gave them papers sealed up to open at such a time after which they were at liberty to read them and there they found my predictions true in every article except one or two very minute  as for the few following predictions i now offer the world i forbore to publish them till i had perused the several almanacks for the year we are now entered on  i find them all in the usual strain and i beg the reader will compare their manner with mine  and here i make bold to tell the world that i lay the whole credit of my art upon the truth of these predictions and i will be content that partridge and the rest of his clan may hoot me for a cheat and impostor if i fail in any single particular of moment  i believe any man who reads this paper will look upon me to be at least a person of as much honesty and understanding as a common maker of almanacks  i do not lurk in the dark i am not wholly unknown in the world i have set my name at length to be a mark of infamy to mankind if they shall find i deceive them  in one thing i must desire to be forgiven that i talk more sparingly of home affairs  as it will be imprudence to discover secrets of state so it would be dangerous to my person but in smaller matters and that are not of public consequence i shall be very free and the truth of my conjectures will as much appear from those as the others  as for the most signal events abroad in france flanders italy and spain i shall make no scruple to predict them in plain terms  some of them are of importance and i hope i shall seldom mistake the day they will happen therefore i think good to inform the reader that i all along make use of the old style observed in england which i desire he will compare with that of the newspapers at the time they relate the actions i mention  i must add one word more  i know it hath been the opinion of several of the learned who think well enough of the true art of astrology that the stars do only incline and not force the actions or wills of men and therefore however i may proceed by right rules yet i cannot in prudence so confidently assure the events will follow exactly as i predict them  i hope i have maturely considered this objection which in some cases is of no little weight  for example a man may by the influence of an over ruling planet be disposed or inclined to lust rage or avarice and yet by the force of reason overcome that bad influence and this was the case of socrates  but as the great events of the world usually depend upon numbers of men it cannot be expected they should all unite to cross their inclinations from pursuing a general design wherein they unanimously agree  besides the influence of the stars reaches to many actions and events which are not any way in the power of reason as sickness death and what we commonly call accidents with many more needless to repeat  but now it is time to proceed to my predictions which i have begun to calculate from the time that the sun enters into aries  and this i take to be properly the beginning of the natural year  i pursue them to the time that he enters libra or somewhat more which is the busy period of the year  the remainder i have not yet adjusted upon account of several impediments needless here to mention  besides i must remind the reader again that this is but a specimen of what i design in succeeding years to treat more at large if i may have liberty and encouragement  my first prediction is but a trifle yet i will mention it to show how ignorant those sottish pretenders to astrology are in their own concerns it relates to partridge the almanackmaker  i have consulted the stars of his nativity by my own rules and find he will infallibly die upon the 29th of march next about eleven at night of a raging fever therefore i advise him to consider of it and settle his affairs in time  the month of april will be observable for the death of many great persons  on the 4th will die the cardinal de noailles archbishop of paris on the 11th the young prince of asturias son to the duke of anjou on the 14th a great peer of this realm will die at his country house on the 19th an old layman of great fame for learning and on the 23rd an eminent goldsmith in lombard street  i could mention others both at home and abroad if i did not consider it is of very little use or instruction to the reader or to the world  as to public affairs on the 7th of this month there will be an insurrection in dauphiny occasioned by the oppressions of the people which will not be quieted in some months  on the 15th will be a violent storm on the southeast coast of france which will destroy many of their ships and some in the very harbour  the 11th will be famous for the revolt of a whole province or kingdom excepting one city by which the affairs of a certain prince in the alliance will take a better face  may against common conjectures will be no very busy month in europe but very signal for the death of the dauphin which will happen on the 7th after a short fit of sickness and grievous torments with the strangury  he dies less lamented by the court than the kingdom  on the 9th a marshal of france will break his leg by a fall from his horse  i have not been able to discover whether he will then die or not  on the 11th will begin a most important siege which the eyes of all europe will be upon i cannot be more particular for in relating affairs that so nearly concern the confederates and consequently this kingdom i am forced to confine myself for several reasons very obvious to the reader  on the 15th news will arrive of a very surprising event than which nothing could be more unexpected  on the 19th three noble ladies of this kingdom will against all expectation prove with child to the great joy of their husbands  on the 23rd a famous buffoon of the playhouse will die a ridiculous death suitable to his vocation  june  this month will be distinguished at home by the utter dispersing of those ridiculous deluded enthusiasts commonly called the prophets occasioned chiefly by seeing the time come that many of their prophecies should be fulfilled and then finding themselves deceived by contrary events  it is indeed to be admired how any deceiver can be so weak to foretell things near at hand when a very few months must of necessity discover the impostor to all the world in this point less prudent than common almanackmakers who are so wise to wonder in generals and talk dubiously and leave to the reader the business of interpreting  on the 1st of this month a french general will be killed by a random shot of a cannonball  on the 6th a fire will break out in the suburbs of paris which will destroy above a thousand houses and seems to be the foreboding of what will happen to the surprise of all europe about the end of the following month  on the 10th a great battle will be fought which will begin at four of the clock in the afternoon and last till nine at night with great obstinacy but no very decisive event  i shall not name the place for the reasons aforesaid but the commanders on each left wing will be killed  i see bonfires and hear the noise of guns for a victory  on the 14th there will be a false report of the french kings death  on the 20th cardinal portocarero will die of a dysentery with great suspicion of poison but the report of his intention to revolt to king charles will prove false  july  the 6th of this month a certain general will by a glorious action recover the reputation he lost by former misfortunes  on the 12th a great commander will die a prisoner in the hands of his enemies  on the 14th a shameful discovery will be made of a french jesuit giving poison to a great foreign general and when he is put to the torture will make wonderful discoveries  in short this will prove a month of great action if i might have liberty to relate the particulars  at home the death of an old famous senator will happen on the 15th at his country house worn with age and diseases  but that which will make this month memorable to all posterity is the death of the french king louis the fourteenth after a weeks sickness at marli which will happen on the 29th about six oclock in the evening  it seems to be an effect of the gout in his stomach followed by a flux  and in three days after monsieur chamillard will follow his master dying suddenly of an apoplexy  in this month likewise an ambassador will die in london but i cannot assign the day  august  the affairs of france will seem to suffer no change for a while under the duke of burgundys administration but the genius that animated the whole machine being gone will be the cause of mighty turns and revolutions in the following year  the new king makes yet little change either in the army or the ministry but the libels against his grandfather that fly about his very court give him uneasiness  i see an express in mighty haste with joy and wonder in his looks arriving by break of day on the 26th of this month having travelled in three days a prodigious journey by land and sea  in the evening i hear bells and guns and see the blazing of a thousand bonfires  a young admiral of noble birth does likewise this month gain immortal honour by a great achievement  the affairs of poland are this month entirely settled augustus resigns his pretensions which he had again taken up for some time stanislaus is peaceably possessed of the throne and the king of sweden declares for the emperor  i cannot omit one particular accident here at home that near the end of this month much mischief will be done at bartholomew fair by the fall of a booth  september  this month begins with a very surprising fit of frosty weather which will last near twelve days  the pope having long languished last month the swellings in his legs breaking and the flesh mortifying will die on the 11th instant and in three weeks time after a mighty contest be succeeded by a cardinal of the imperial faction but native of tuscany who is now about sixtyone years old  the french army acts now wholly on the defensive strongly fortified in their trenches and the young french king sends overtures for a treaty of peace by the duke of mantua which because it is a matter of state that concerns us here at home i shall speak no farther of it  i shall add but one prediction more and that in mystical terms which shall be included in a verse out of virgil     alter erit jam tethys et altera quae vehat argo    delectos heroas  upon the 25th day of this month the fulfilling of this prediction will be manifest to everybody  this is the farthest i have proceeded in my calculations for the present year  i do not pretend that these are all the great events which will happen in this period but that those i have set down will infallibly come to pass  it will perhaps still be objected why i have not spoken more particularly of affairs at home or of the success of our armies abroad which i might and could very largely have done but those in power have wisely discouraged men from meddling in public concerns and i was resolved by no means to give the least offence  this i will venture to say that it will be a glorious campaign for the allies wherein the english forces both by sea and land will have their full share of honour that her majesty queen anne will continue in health and prosperity and that no ill accident will arrive to any in the chief ministry  as to the particular events i have mentioned the readers may judge by the fulfilling of them whether i am on the level with common astrologers who with an old paltry cant and a few pothooks for planets to amuse the vulgar have in my opinion too long been suffered to abuse the world  but an honest physician ought not to be despised because there are such things as mountebanks  i hope i have some share of reputation which i would not willingly forfeit for a frolic or humour and i believe no gentleman who reads this paper will look upon it to be of the same cast or mould with the common scribblers that are every day hawked about  my fortune has placed me above the little regard of scribbling for a few pence which i neither value nor want therefore let no wise man too hastily condemn this essay intended for a good design to cultivate and improve an ancient art long in disgrace by having fallen into mean and unskilful hands  a little time will determine whether i have deceived others or myself and i think it is no very unreasonable request that men would please to suspend their judgments till then  i was once of the opinion with those who despise all predictions from the stars till in the year 1686 a man of quality showed me written in his album that the most learned astronomer captain h assured him he would never believe anything of the stars influence if there were not a great revolution in england in the year 1688  since that time i began to have other thoughts and after eighteen years diligent study and application i think i have no reason to repent of my pains  i shall detain the reader no longer than to let him know that the account i design to give of next years events shall take in the principal affairs that happen in europe and if i be denied the liberty of offering it to my own country i shall appeal to the learned world by publishing it in latin and giving order to have it printed in holland     the accomplishment of the first of mr bickerstaffs predictions being an account of the death of mr partridge the almanackmaker upon the 29th instant   in a letter to a person of honour written in the year 1708  my lordin obedience to your lordships commands as well as to satisfy my own curiosity i have for some days past inquired constantly after partridge the almanackmaker of whom it was foretold in mr bickerstaffs predictions published about a month ago that he should die the 29th instant about eleven at night of a raging fever  i had some sort of knowledge of him when i was employed in the revenue because he used every year to present me with his almanack as he did other gentlemen upon the score of some little gratuity we gave him  i saw him accidentally once or twice about ten days before he died and observed he began very much to droop and languish though i hear his friends did not seem to apprehend him in any danger  about two or three days ago he grew ill was confined first to his chamber and in a few hours after to his bed where dr case and mrs kirleus were sent for to visit and to prescribe to him  upon this intelligence i sent thrice every day one servant or other to inquire after his health and yesterday about four in the afternoon word was brought me that he was past hopes upon which i prevailed with myself to go and see him partly out of commiseration and i confess partly out of curiosity  he knew me very well seemed surprised at my condescension and made me compliments upon it as well as he could in the condition he was  the people about him said he had been for some time delirious but when i saw him he had his understanding as well as ever i knew and spoke strong and hearty without any seeming uneasiness or constraint  after i had told him how sorry i was to see him in those melancholy circumstances and said some other civilities suitable to the occasion i desired him to tell me freely and ingenuously whether the predictions mr bickerstaff had published relating to his death had not too much affected and worked on his imagination  he confessed he had often had it in his head but never with much apprehension till about a fortnight before since which time it had the perpetual possession of his mind and thoughts and he did verily believe was the true natural cause of his present distemper for said he i am thoroughly persuaded and i think i have very good reasons that mr bickerstaff spoke altogether by guess and knew no more what will happen this year than i did myself  i told him his discourse surprised me and i would be glad he were in a state of health to be able to tell me what reason he had to be convinced of mr bickerstaffs ignorance  he replied i am a poor ignorant follow bred to a mean trade yet i have sense enough to know that all pretences of foretelling by astrology are deceits for this manifest reason because the wise and the learned who can only know whether there be any truth in this science do all unanimously agree to laugh at and despise it and none but the poor ignorant vulgar give it any credit and that only upon the word of such silly wretches as i and my fellows who can hardly write or read  i then asked him why he had not calculated his own nativity to see whether it agreed with bickerstaffs prediction at which he shook his head and said oh sir this is no time for jesting but for repenting those fooleries as i do now from the very bottom of my heart by what i can gather from you said i the observations and predictions you printed with your almanacks were mere impositions on the people  he replied if it were otherwise i should have the less to answer for  we have a common form for all those things as to foretelling the weather we never meddle with that but leave it to the printer who takes it out of any old almanack as he thinks fit the rest was my own invention to make my almanack sell having a wife to maintain and no other way to get my bread for mending old shoes is a poor livelihood and added he sighing i wish i may not have done more mischief by my physic than my astrology though i had some good receipts from my grandmother and my own compositions were such as i thought could at least do no hurt  i had some other discourse with him which now i cannot call to mind and i fear i have already tired your lordship  i shall only add one circumstance that on his deathbed he declared himself a nonconformist and had a fanatic preacher to be his spiritual guide  after half an hours conversation i took my leave being half stifled by the closeness of the room  i imagined he could not hold out long and therefore withdrew to a little coffeehouse hard by leaving a servant at the house with orders to come immediately and tell me as nearly as he could the minute when partridge should expire which was not above two hours after when looking upon my watch i found it to be above five minutes after seven by which it is clear that mr bickerstaff was mistaken almost four hours in his calculation  in the other circumstances he was exact enough  but whether he has not been the cause of this poor mans death as well as the predictor may be very reasonably disputed  however it must be confessed the matter is odd enough whether we should endeavour to account for it by chance or the effect of imagination  for my own part though i believe no man has less faith in these matters yet i shall wait with some impatience and not without some expectation the fulfilling of mr bickerstaffs second prediction that the cardinal do noailles is to die upon the 4th of april and if that should be verified as exactly as this of poor partridge i must own i should be wholly surprised and at a loss and should infallibly expect the accomplishment of all the rest     baucis and philemon   imitated from the eighth book of ovid  in ancient times as story tells the saints would often leave their cells and stroll about but hide their quality to try good peoples hospitality  it happened on a winter night as authors of the legend write two brother hermits saints by trade taking their tour in masquerade disguised in tattered habits went to a small village down in kent where in the strollers canting strain they begged from door to door in vain tried every tone might pity win but not a soul would let them in  our wandering saints in woeful state treated at this ungodly rate having through all the village passed to a small cottage came at last where dwelt a good honest old yeoman called in the neighbourhood philemon who kindly did these saints invite in his poor hut to pass the night and then the hospitable sire bid goody baucis mend the fire while he from out the chimney took a flitch of bacon off the hook and freely from the fattest side cut out large slices to be fried then stepped aside to fetch em drink filled a large jug up to the brink and saw it fairly twice go round yet what is wonderful they found twas still replenished to the top as if they neer had touched a drop the good old couple were amazed and often on each other gazed for both were frightened to the heart and just began to crywhat art then softly turned aside to view whether the lights were burning blue the gentle pilgrims soon aware ont told em their calling and their errant good folks you need not be afraid we are but saints the hermits said no hurt shall come to you or yours but for that pack of churlish boors not fit to live on christian ground they and their houses shall be drowned whilst you shall see your cottage rise and grow a church before your eyes  they scarce had spoke when fair and soft the roof began to mount aloft aloft rose every beam and rafter the heavy wall climbed slowly after  the chimney widened and grew higher became a steeple with a spire  the kettle to the top was hoist and there stood fastened to a joist but with the upside down to show its inclination for below in vain for a superior force applied at bottom stops its coarse doomed ever in suspense to dwell tis now no kettle but a bell  a wooden jack which had almost lost by disuse the art to roast a sudden alteration feels increased by new intestine wheels and what exalts the wonder more the number made the motion slower the flyer though t had leaden feet turned round so quick you scarce could see t but slackened by some secret power now hardly moves an inch an hour the jack and chimney near allied had never left each others side the chimney to a steeple grown the jack would not be left alone but up against the steeple reared became a clock and still adhered and still its love to household cares by a shrill voice at noon declares warning the cookmaid not to burn that roast meat which it cannot turn  the groaning chair began to crawl like a huge snail along the wall there stuck aloft in public view and with small change a pulpit grew  the porringers that in a row hung high and made a glittering show to a less noble substance changed were now but leathern buckets ranged  the ballads pasted on the wall of joan of france and english moll fair rosamond and robin hood the little children in the wood now seemed to look abundance better improved in picture size and letter and high in order placed describe the heraldry of every tribe  a bedstead of the antique mode compact of timber many a load such as our ancestors did use was metamorphosed into pews which still their ancient nature keep by lodging folks disposed to sleep  the cottage by such feats as these grown to a church by just degrees the hermits then desired their host to ask for what he fancied most philemon having paused a while returned em thanks in homely style then said my house is grown so fine methinks i still would call it mine im old and fain would live at ease make me the parson if you please  he spoke and presently he feels his graziers coat fall down his heels he sees yet hardly can believe about each arm a pudding sleeve his waistcoat to a cassock grew and both assumed a sable hue but being old continued just as threadbare and as full of dust his talk was now of tithes and dues he smoked his pipe and read the news knew how to preach old sermons next vamped in the preface and the text at christenings well could act his part and had the service all by heart wished women might have children fast and thought whose sow had farrowed last against dissenters would repine and stood up firm for right divine found his head filled with many a system but classic authorshe neer missed em  thus having furbished up a parson dame baucis next they played their farce on instead of homespun coifs were seen good pinners edgd with colberteen her petticoat transformed apace became black satin flounced with lace plain goody would no longer down twas madam in her grogram gown philemon was in great surprise and hardly could believe his eyes amazed to see her look so prim and she admired as much at him  thus happy in their change of life were several years this man and wife when on a day which proved their last discoursing oer old stories past they went by chance amidst their talk to the church yard to take a walk when baucis hastily cried out my dear i see your forehead sprout sprout quoth the man whats this you tell us i hope you dont believe me jealous but yet methinks i feel it true and really yours is budding too naynow i cannot stir my foot it feels as if twere taking root  description would but tire my muse in short they both were turned to yews  old goodman dobson of the green remembers he the trees has seen hell talk of them from noon till night and goes with folks to show the sight on sundays after evening prayer he gathers all the parish there points out the place of either yew here baucis there philemon grew till once a parson of our town to mend his barn cut baucis down at which tis hard to be believed how much the other tree was grieved grow scrubby died atop was stunted so the next parson stubbed and burnt it     the logicians refuted   logicians have but ill defined as rational the human kind reason they say belongs to man but let them prove it if they can wise aristotle and smiglesius by ratiocinations specious have strove to prove with great precision with definition and division homo est ratione praeditum but for my soul i cannot credit em and must in spite of them maintain that man and all his ways are vain and that this boasted lord of nature is both a weak and erring creature that instinct is a surer guide than reasonboasting mortals pride and that brute beasts are far before em deus est anima brutorum whoever knew an honest brute at law his neighbour prosecute bring action for assault

brain  he that would thus refine on thee    and turn thy stage into a school the jest of punch will ever be    and stand confessed the greater fool     cadenus and vanessa   written anno 1713  the shepherds and the nymphs were seen pleading before the cyprian queen the counsel for the fair began accusing the false creature man  the brief with weighty crimes was charged on which the pleader much enlarged that cupid now has lost his art or blunts the point of every dart his altar now no longer smokes his mothers aid no youth invokes this tempts freethinkers to refine and bring in doubt their powers divine now love is dwindled to intrigue and marriage grown a moneyleague which crimes aforesaid with her leave were as he humbly did conceive against our sovereign ladys peace against the statutes in that case against her dignity and crown then prayed an answer and sat down  the nymphs with scorn beheld their foes when the defendants counsel rose and what no lawyer ever lacked with impudence owned all the fact but what the gentlest heart would vex laid all the fault on tother sex that modern love is no such thing as what those ancient poets sing a fire celestial chaste refined conceived and kindled in the mind which having found an equal flame unites and both become the same in different breasts together burn together both to ashes turn but women now feel no such fire and only know the gross desire their passions move in lower spheres whereer caprice or folly steers a dog a parrot or an ape or some worse brute in human shape engross the fancies of the fair the few soft moments they can spare from visits to receive and pay from scandal politics and play from fans and flounces and brocades from equipage and parkparades from all the thousand female toys from every trifle that employs the out or inside of their heads between their toilets and their beds  in a dull stream which moving slow you hardly see the current flow if a small breeze obstructs the course it whirls about for want of force and in its narrow circle gathers nothing but chaff and straws and feathers the current of a female mind stops thus and turns with every wind thus whirling round together draws fools fops and rakes for chaff and straws hence we conclude no womens hearts are won by virtue wit and parts nor are the men of sense to blame for breasts incapable of flame the fault must on the nymphs be placed grown so corrupted in their taste  the pleader having spoke his best had witness ready to attest who fairly could on oath depose when questions on the fact arose that every article was true nor further those deponents knew therefore he humbly would insist the bill might be with costs dismissed  the cause appeared of so much weight that venus from the judgmentseat desired them not to talk so loud else she must interpose a cloud for if the heavenly folk should know these pleadings in the courts below that mortals here disdain to love she neer could show her face above for gods their betters are too wise to value that which men despise and then said she my son and i must stroll in air twixt earth and sky or else shut out from heaven and earth fly to the sea my place of birth there live with daggled mermaids pent and keep on fish perpetual lent  but since the case appeared so nice she thought it best to take advice the muses by their kings permission though foes to love attend the session and on the right hand took their places in order on the left the graces to whom she might her doubts propose on all emergencies that rose the muses oft were seen to frown the graces half ashamed look down and twas observed there were but few of either sex among the crew whom she or her assessors knew the goddess soon began to see things were not ripe for a decree and said she must consult her books the lovers fletas bractons cokes first to a dapper clerk she beckoned to turn to ovid book the second she then referred them to a place in virgil vide didos case as for tibulluss reports they never passed for law in courts for cowleys brief and pleas of waller still their authority is smaller  there was on both sides much to say shed hear the cause another day and so she did and then a third she heard itthere she kept her word but with rejoinders and replies long bills and answers stuffed with lies demur imparlance and essoign the parties neer could issue join for sixteen years the cause was spun and then stood where it first begun  now gentle clio sing or say what venus meant by this delay the goddess much perplexed in mind to see her empire thus declined when first this grand debate arose above her wisdom to compose conceived a project in her head to work her ends which if it sped would show the merits of the cause far better than consulting laws  in a glad hour lucinas aid produced on earth a wondrous maid on whom the queen of love was bent to try a new experiment she threw her lawbooks on the shelf and thus debated with herself  since men allege they neer can find those beauties in a female mind which raise a flame that will endure for ever uncorrupt and pure if tis with reason they complain this infant shall restore my reign ill search where every virtue dwells from courts inclusive down to cells what preachers talk or sages write these i will gather and unite and represent them to mankind collected in that infants mind  this said she plucks in heavens high bowers a sprig of amaranthine flowers in nectar thrice infuses bays three times refined in titans rays then calls the graces to her aid and sprinkles thrice the nowborn maid from whence the tender skin assumes a sweetness above all perfumes from whence a cleanliness remains incapable of outward stains from whence that decency of mind so lovely in a female kind where not one careless thought intrudes less modest than the speech of prudes where never blush was called in aid the spurious virtue in a maid a virtue but at secondhand they blush because they understand  the graces next would act their part and show but little of their art their work was half already done the child with native beauty shone the outward form no help required each breathing on her thrice inspired that gentle soft engaging air which in old times adorned the fair and said vanessa be the name by which thou shalt be known to fame vanessa by the gods enrolled her name on earthshall not be told  but still the work was not complete when venus thought on a deceit drawn by her doves away she flies and finds out pallas in the skies dear pallas i have been this morn to see a lovely infant born a boy in yonder isle below so like my own without his bow by beauty could your heart be won youd swear it is apollos son but it shall neer be said a child so hopeful has by me been spoiled i have enough besides to spare and give him wholly to your care  wisdoms above suspecting wiles the queen of learning gravely smiles down from olympus comes with joy mistakes vanessa for a boy then sows within her tender mind seeds long unknown to womankind for manly bosoms chiefly fit the seeds of knowledge judgment wit her soul was suddenly endued with justice truth and fortitude with honour which no breath can stain which malice must attack in vain with open heart and bounteous hand but pallas here was at a stand she know in our degenerate days bare virtue could not live on praise that meat must be with money bought she therefore upon second thought infused yet as it were by stealth some small regard for state and wealth of which as she grew up there stayed a tincture in the prudent maid she managed her estate with care yet liked three footmen to her chair but lest he should neglect his studies like a young heir the thrifty goddess for fear young master should be spoiled would use him like a younger child and after long computing found twould come to just five thousand pound  the queen of love was pleased and proud to we vanessa thus endowed she doubted not but such a dame through every breast would dart a flame that every rich and lordly swain with pride would drag about her chain that scholars would forsake their books to study bright vanessas looks as she advanced that womankind would by her model form their mind and all their conduct would be tried by her as an unerring guide offending daughters oft would hear vanessas praise rung in their ear miss betty when she does a fault lets fall her knife or spills the salt will thus be by her mother chid tis what vanessa never did thus by the nymphs and swains adored my power shall be again restored and happy lovers bless my reign so venus hoped but hoped in vain  for when in time the martial maid found out the trick that venus played she shakes her helm she knits her brows and fired with indignation vows tomorrow ere the setting sun shed all undo that she had done  but in the poets we may find a wholesome law time out of mind had been confirmed by fates decree that gods of whatsoer degree resume not what themselves have given or any brothergod in heaven which keeps the peace among the gods or they must always be at odds and pallas if she broke the laws must yield her foe the stronger cause a shame to one so much adored for wisdom at joves councilboard besides she feared the queen of love would meet with better friends above and though she must with grief reflect to see a mortal virgin deckd with graces hitherto unknown to female breasts except her own yet she would act as best became a goddess of unspotted fame she knew by augury divine venus would fail in her design she studied well the point and found her foes conclusions were not sound from premises erroneous brought and therefore the deductions nought and must have contrary effects to what her treacherous foe expects  in proper season pallas meets the queen of love whom thus she greets for gods we are by homer told can in celestial language scold perfidious goddess but in vain you formed this project in your brain a project for thy talents fit with much deceit and little wit thou hast as thou shalt quickly see deceived thyself instead of me for how can heavenly wisdom prove an instrument to earthly love knowst thou not yet that men commence thy votaries for want of sense nor shall vanessa be the theme to manage thy abortive scheme shell prove the greatest of thy foes and yet i scorn to interpose but using neither skill nor force leave all things to their natural course  the goddess thus pronounced her doom when lo vanessa in her bloom advanced like atalantas star but rarely seen and seen from far in a new world with caution stepped watched all the company she kept well knowing from the books she read what dangerous paths young virgins tread would seldom at the park appear nor saw the playhouse twice a year yet not incurious was inclined to know the converse of mankind  first issued from perfumers shops a crowd of fashionable fops they liked her how she liked the play then told the tattle of the day a duel fought last night at two about a ladyyou know who mentioned a new italian come either from muscovy or rome gave hints of who and whos together then fell to talking of the weather last night was so extremely fine the ladies walked till after nine then in soft voice and speech absurd with nonsense every second word with fustian from exploded plays they celebrate her beautys praise run oer their cant of stupid lies and tell the murders of her eyes  with silent scorn vanessa sat scarce listning to their idle chat further than sometimes by a frown when they grew pert to pull them down at last she spitefully was bent to try their wisdoms full extent and said she valued nothing less than titles figure shape and dress that merit should be chiefly placed in judgment knowledge wit and taste and these she offered to dispute alone distinguished man from brute that present times have no pretence to virtue in the noble sense by greeks and romans understood to perish for our countrys good she named the ancient heroes round explained for what they were renowned then spoke with censure or applause of foreign customs rites and laws through nature and through art she ranged and gracefully her subject changed in vain her hearers had no share in all she spoke except to stare their judgment was upon the whole that lady is the dullest soul then tipped their forehead in a jeer as who should sayshe wants it here she may be handsome young and rich but none will burn her for a witch  a party next of glittering dames from round the purlieus of st james came early out of pure goodwill to see the girl in deshabille their clamour lighting from their chairs grew louder all the way up stairs at entrance loudest where they found the room with volumes littered round vanessa held montaigne and read whilst mrs susan combed her head they called for tea and chocolate and fell into their usual chat discoursing with important face on ribbons fans and gloves and lace showed patterns just from india brought and gravely asked her what she thought whether the red or green were best and what they cost  vanessa guessed as came into her fancy first named half the rates and liked the worst to scandal nextwhat awkward thing was that last sunday in the ring im sorry mopsa breaks so fast i said her face would never last corinna with that youthful air is thirty and a bit to spare her fondness for a certain earl began when i was but a girl phyllis who but a month ago was married to the tunbridge beau i saw coquetting tother night in public with that odious knight  they rallied next vanessas dress that gown was made for old queen bess dear madam let me set your head dont you intend to put on red a petticoat without a hoop sure you are not ashamed to stoop with handsome garters at your knees no matter what a fellow sees  filled with disdain with rage inflamed both of herself and sex ashamed the nymph stood silent out of spite nor would vouchsafe to set them right away the fair detractors went and gave by turns their censures vent shes not so handsome in my eyes for wit i wonder where it lies shes fair and clean and thats the most but why proclaim her for a toast a baby face no life no airs but what she learnt at country fairs scarce knows what difference is between rich flanders lace and colberteen ill undertake my little nancy in flounces has a better fancy with all her wit i would not ask her judgment how to buy a mask we begged her but to patch her face she never hit one proper place which every girl at five years old can do as soon as she is told i own that outoffashion stuff becomes the creature well enough the girl might pass if we could get her to know the world a little better to know the world a modern phrase for visits ombre balls and plays  thus to the worlds perpetual shame the queen of beauty lost her aim too late with grief she understood pallas had done more harm than good for great examples are but vain where ignorance begets disdain both sexes armed with guilt and spite against vanessas power unite to copy her few nymphs aspired her virtues fewer swains admired so stars beyond a certain height give mortals neither heat nor light  yet some of either sex endowed with gifts superior to the crowd with virtue knowledge taste and wit she condescended to admit with pleasing arts she could reduce mens talents to their proper use and with address each genius hold to that wherein it most excelled thus making others wisdom known could please them and improve her own a modest youth said something new she placed it in the strongest view all humble worth she strove to raise would not be praised yet loved to praise the learned met with free approach although they came not in a coach some clergy too she would allow nor quarreled at their awkward bow but this was for cadenus sake a gownman of a different make whom pallas once vanessas tutor had fixed on for her coadjutor  but cupid full of mischief longs to vindicate his mothers wrongs on pallas all attempts are vain one way he knows to give her pain vows on vanessas heart to take due vengeance for her patrons sake those early seeds by venus sown in spite of pallas now were grown and cupid hoped they would improve by time and ripen into love the boy made use of all his craft in vain discharging many a shaft pointed at colonels lords and beaux cadenus warded off the blows for placing still some book betwixt the darts were in the cover fixed or often blunted and recoiled on plutarchs morals struck were spoiled  the queen of wisdom could foresee but not prevent the fates decree and human caution tries in vain to break that adamantine chain vanessa though by pallas taught by love invulnerable thought searching in books for wisdoms aid was in the very search betrayed  cupid though all his darts were lost yet still resolved to spare no cost he could not answer to his fame the triumphs of that stubborn dame a nymph so hard to be subdued who neither was coquette nor prude i find says he she wants a doctor both to adore her and instruct her ill give her what she most admires among those venerable sires cadenus is a subject fit grown old in politics and wit caressed by ministers of state of half mankind the dread and hate whateer vexations love attend she need no rivals apprehend her sex with universal voice must laugh at her capricious choice  cadenus many things had writ vanessa much esteemed his wit and called for his poetic works meantime the boy in secret lurks and while the book was in her hand the urchin from his private stand took aim and shot with all his strength a dart of such prodigious length it pierced the feeble volume through and deep transfixed her bosom too some lines more moving than the rest struck to the point that pierced her breast and borne directly to the heart with pains unknown increased her smart  vanessa not in years a score dreams of a gown of fortyfour imaginary charms can find in eyes with reading almost blind cadenus now no more appears declined in health advanced in years she fancies music in his tongue nor farther looks but thinks him young what mariner is not afraid to venture in a ship decayed what planter will attempt to yoke a sapling with a falling oak as years increase she brighter shines cadenus with each day declines and he must fall a prey to time while she continues in her prime  cadenus common forms apart in every scene had kept his heart had sighed and languished vowed and writ for pastime or to show his wit but time and books and state affairs had spoiled his fashionable airs he now could praise esteem approve but understood not what was love his conduct might have made him styled a father and the nymph his child that innocent delight he took to see the virgin mind her book was but the masters secret joy in school to hear the finest boy her knowledge with her fancy grew she hourly pressed for something new ideas came into her mind so fact his lessons lagged behind she reasoned without plodding long nor ever gave her judgment wrong but now a sudden change was wrought she minds no longer what he taught cadenus was amazed to find such marks of a distracted mind for though she seemed to listen more to all he spoke than eer before he found her thoughts would absent range yet guessed not whence could spring the change and first he modestly conjectures his pupil might be tired with lectures which helped to mortify his pride yet gave him not the heart to chide but in a mild dejected strain at last he ventured to complain said she should be no longer teased might have her freedom when she pleased was now convinced he acted wrong to hide her from the world so long and in dull studies to engage one of her tender sex and age that every nymph with envy owned how she might shine in the grandemonde and every shepherd was undone to see her cloistered like a nun this was a visionary scheme he waked and found it but a dream a project far above his skill for nature must be nature still if she was bolder than became a scholar to a courtly dame she might excuse a man of letters thus tutors often treat their betters and since his talk offensive grew he came to take his last adieu  vanessa filled with just disdain would still her dignity maintain instructed from her early years to scorn the art of female tears  had he employed his time so long to teach her what was right or wrong yet could such notions entertain that all his lectures were in vain she owned the wandring of her thoughts but he must answer for her faults she well remembered to her cost that all his lessons were not lost two maxims she could still produce and sad experience taught her use that virtue pleased by being shown knows nothing which it dare not own can make us without fear disclose our inmost secrets to our foes that common forms were not designed directors to a noble mind now said the nymph ill let you see my actions with your rules agree that i can vulgar forms despise and have no secrets to disguise i knew by what you said and writ how dangerous things were men of wit you cautioned me against their charms but never gave me equal arms your lessons found the weakest part aimed at the head but reached the heart  cadenus felt within him rise shame disappointment guilt surprise he know not how to reconcile such language with her usual style and yet her words were so expressed he could not hope she spoke in jest his thoughts had wholly been confined to form and cultivate her mind he hardly knew till he was told whether the nymph were young or old had met her in a public place without distinguishing her face much less could his declining age vanessas earliest thoughts engage and if her youth indifference met his person must contempt beget or grant her passion be sincere how shall his innocence be clear appearances were all so strong the world must think him in the wrong would say he made a treachrous use of wit to flatter and seduce the town would swear he had betrayed by magic spells the harmless maid and every beau would have his jokes that scholars were like other folks that when platonic flights were over the tutor turned a mortal lover so tender of the young and fair it showed a true paternal care five thousand guineas in her purse the doctor might have fancied worst hardly at length he silence broke and faltered every word he spoke interpreting her complaisance just as a man sans consequence she rallied well he always knew her manner now was something new and what she spoke was in an air as serious as a tragic player but those who aim at ridicule should fix upon some certain rule which fairly hints they are in jest else he must enter his protest for let a man be neer so wise he may be caught with sober lies a science which he never taught and to be free was dearly bought for take it in its proper light tis just what coxcombs call a bite  but not to dwell on things minute vanessa finished the dispute brought weighty arguments to prove that reason was her guide in love she thought he had himself described his doctrines when she fist imbibed what he had planted now was grown his virtues she might call her own as he approves as he dislikes love or contempt her fancy strikes selflove in nature rooted fast attends us first and leaves us last why she likes him admire not at her she loves herself and thats the matter how was her tutor wont to praise the geniuses of ancient days those authors he so oft had named for learning wit and wisdom famed was struck with love esteem and awe for persons whom he never saw suppose cadenus flourished then he must adore such godlike men if one short volume could comprise all that was witty learned and wise how would it be esteemed and read although the writer long were dead if such an author were alive how all would for his friendship strive and come in crowds to see his face and this she takes to be her case cadenus answers every end the book the author and the friend the utmost her desires will reach is but to learn what he can teach his converse is a system fit alone to fill up all her wit while evry passion of her mind in him is centred and confined  love can with speech inspire a mute and taught vanessa to dispute this topic never touched before displayed her eloquence the more her knowledge with such pains acquired by this new passion grew inspired through this she made all objects pass which gave a tincture oer the mass as rivers though they bend and twine still to the sea their course incline or as philosophers who find some favrite system to their mind in every point to make it fit will force all nature to submit  cadenus who could neer suspect his lessons would have such effect or be so artfully applied insensibly came on her side it was an unforeseen event things took a turn he never meant whoeer excels in what we prize appears a hero to our eyes each girl when pleased with what is taught will have the teacher in her thought when miss delights in her spinnet a fiddler may a fortune get a blockhead with melodious voice in boardingschools can have his choice and oft the dancingmasters art climbs from the toe to touch the heart in learning let a nymph delight the pedant gets a mistress byt cadenus to his grief and shame could scarce oppose vanessas flame but though her arguments were strong at least could hardly with them wrong howeer it came he could not tell but sure she never talked so well his pride began to interpose preferred before a crowd of beaux so bright a nymph to come unsought such wonder by his merit wrought tis merit must with her prevail he never know her judgment fail she noted all she ever read and had a most discerning head  tis an old maxim in the schools that vanitys the food of fools yet now and then your men of wit will condescend to take a bit  so when cadenus could not hide he chose to justify his pride construing the passion she had shown much to her praise more to his own nature in him had merit placed in her a most judicious taste love hitherto a transient guest neer held possession in his breast so long attending at the gate disdaind to enter in so late love why do we one passion call when tis a compound of them all where hot and cold where sharp and sweet in all their equipages meet where pleasures mixed with pains appear sorrow with joy and hope with fear wherein his dignity and age forbid cadenus to engage but friendship in its greatest height a constant rational delight on virtues basis fixed to last when loves allurements long are past which gently warms but cannot burn he gladly offers in return his want of passion will redeem with gratitude respect esteem with that devotion we bestow when goddesses appear below  while thus cadenus entertains vanessa in exalted strains the nymph in sober words intreats a truce with all sublime conceits for why such raptures flights and fancies to her who durst not read romances in lofty style to make replies which he had taught her to despise but when her tutor will affect devotion duty and respect he fairly abdicates his throne the government is now her own he has a forfeiture incurred she vows to take him at his word and hopes he will not take it strange if both should now their stations change the nymph will have her turn to be the tutor and the pupil he though she already can discern her scholar is not apt to learn or wants capacity to reach the science she designs to teach wherein his genius was below the skill of every common beau who though he cannot spell is wise enough to read a ladys eyes and will each accidental glance interpret for a kind advance  but what success vanessa met is to the world a secret yet whether the nymph to please her swain talks in a high romantic strain or whether he at last descends to like with less seraphic ends or to compound the busness whether they temper love and books together must never to mankind be told nor shall the conscious muse unfold  meantime the mournful queen of love led but a weary life above she ventures now to leave the skies grown by vanessas conduct wise for though by one perverse event pallas had crossed her first intent though her design was not obtained yet had she much experience gained and by the project vainly tried could better now the cause decide she gave due notice that both parties coram regina prox die martis should at their peril without fail come and appear and save their bail all met and silence thrice proclaimed one lawyer to each side was named the judge discovered in her face resentments for her late disgrace and full of anger shame and grief directed them to mind their brief nor spend their time to show their reading shed have a summary proceeding she gathered under every head the sum of what each lawyer said gave her own reasons last and then decreed the cause against the men  but in a weighty case like this to show she did not judge amiss which evil tongues might else report she made a speech in open court wherein she grievously complains how she was cheated by the swains on whose petition humbly showing that women were not worth the wooing and that unless the sex would mend the race of lovers soon must end she was at lord knows what expense to form a nymph of wit and sense a model for her sex designed who never could one lover find she saw her favour was misplaced the follows had a wretched taste she needs must tell them to their face they were a senseless stupid race and were she to begin again shed study to reform the men or add some grains of folly more to women than they had before to put them on an equal foot and this or nothing else would dot this might their mutual fancy strike since every being loves its like  but now repenting what was done she left all business to her son she puts the world in his possession and let him use it at discretion  the crier was ordered to dismiss the court so made his last o yes the goddess would no longer wait but rising from her chair of state left all below at six and seven harnessed her doves and flew to heaven     stellas birthday 1718   stella this day is thirtyfour we shant dispute a year or more however stella be not troubled although thy size and years are doubled since first i saw thee at sixteen the brightest virgin on the green so little is thy form declined made up so largely in thy mind  oh would it please the gods to split thy beauty size and years and wit no age could furnish out a pair of nymphs so graceful wise and fair with half the lustre of your eyes with half your wit your years and size and then before it grew too late how should i beg of gentle fate that either nymph might lack her swain to split my worship too in twain     stellas birthday 1720   all travellers at first incline whereer they see the fairest sign and if they find the chambers neat and like the liquor and the meat will call again and recommend the angel inn to every friend what though the painting grows decayed the house will never lose its trade nay though the treachrous tapster thomas hangs a new angel two doors from us as fine as daubers hands can make it in hopes that strangers may mistake it we think it both a shame and sin to quit the true old angel inn  now this is stellas case in fact an angels face a little cracked could poets or could painters fix how angels look at thirtysix this drew us in at first to find in such a form an angels mind and every virtue now supplies the fainting rays of stellas eyes see at her levee crowding swains whom stella freely entertains with breeding humour wit and sense and puts them but to small expense their mind so plentifully fills and makes such reasonable bills so little gets for what she gives we really wonder how she lives and had her stock been less no doubt she must have long ago run out  then who can think well quit the place when doll hangs out a newer face or stop and light at cloes head with scraps and leavings to be fed  then cloe still go on to prate of thirtysix and thirtyeight pursue your trade of scandal picking your hints that stella is no chicken your innuendoes when you tell us that stella loves to talk with fellows and let me warn you to believe a truth for which your soul should grieve that should you live to see the day when stellas locks must all be grey when age must print a furrowed trace on every feature of her face though you and all your senseless tribe could art or time or nature bribe to make you look like beautys queen and hold for ever at fifteen no bloom of youth can ever blind the cracks and wrinkles of your mind all men of sense will pass your door and crowd to stellas at fourscore     stellas birthday   a great bottle of wine long buried being that day dug up  1722  resolved my annual verse to pay by duty bound on stellas day furnished with paper pens and ink i gravely sat me down to think i bit my nails and scratched my head but found my wit and fancy fled or if with more than usual pain a thought came slowly from my brain it cost me lord knows how much time to shape it into sense and rhyme and what was yet a greater curse longthinking made my fancy worse  forsaken by th inspiring nine i waited at apollos shrine i told him what the world would sa if stella were unsung today how i should hide my head for shame when both the jacks and robin came how ford would frown how jim would leer how shr the rogue would sneer and swear it does not always follow that semeln anno ridet apollo i have assured them twenty times that phoebus helped me in my rhymes phoebus inspired me from above and he and i were hand and glove but finding me so dull and dry since theyll call it all poetic licence and when i brag of aid divine think eusdens right as good as mine  nor do i ask for stellas sake tis my own credit lies at stake and stella will be sung while i can only be a stander by  apollo having thought a little returned this answer to a tittle  tho you should live like old methusalem i furnish hints and you should use all em you yearly sing as she grows old youd leave her virtues half untold but to say truth such dulness reigns through the whole set of irish deans im daily stunned with such a medley dean w dean dl and dean s that let what dean soever come my orders are im not at home and if your voice had not been loud you must have passed among the crowd  but now your danger to prevent you must apply to mrs brent 2 for she as priestess knows the rites wherein the god of earth delights first nine ways looking let her stand with an old poker in her hand let her describe a circle round in saunders 3 cellar on the ground a spade let prudent archy 4 hold and with discretion dig the mould let stella look with watchful eye rebecea ford and grattons by  behold the bottle where it lies with neck elated towrds the skies the god of winds and god of fire did to its wondrous birth conspire and bacchus for the poets use poured in a strong inspiring juice see as you raise it from its tomb it drags behind a spacious womb and in the spacious womb contains a sovereign medcine for the brains  youll find it soon if fate consents if not a thousand mrs brents ten thousand archys armd with spades may dig in vain to plutos shades  from thence a plenteous draught infuse and boldly then invoke the muse but first let robert on his knees with caution drain it from the lees the muse will at your call appear with stellas praise to crown the year     stellas birthday 1724   as when a beauteous nymph decays we say shes past her dancing days so poets lose their feet by time and can no longer dance in rhyme your annual bard had rather chose to celebrate your birth in prose yet merry folks who want by chance a pair to make a country dance call the old housekeeper and get her to fill a place for want of better while sheridan is off the hooks and friend delany at his books that stella may avoid disgrace once more the dean supplies their place  beauty and wit too sad a truth have always been confined to youth the god of wit and beautys queen he twentyone and she fifteen no poet ever sweetly sung unless he were like phoebus young nor ever nymph inspired to rhyme unless like venus in her prime at fiftysix if this be true am i a poet fit for you or at the age of fortythree are you a subject fit for me adieu bright wit and radiant eyes you must be grave and i be wise our fate in vain we would oppose but ill be still your friend in prose esteem and friendship to express will not require poetic dress and if the muse deny her aid to have them sung they may be said  but stella say what evil tongue reports you are no longer young that time sits with his scythe to mow where erst sat cupid with his bow that half your locks are turned to grey ill neer believe a word they say tis true but let it not be known my eyes are somewhat dimish grown for nature always in the right to your decays adapts my sight and wrinkles undistinguished pass for im ashamed to use a glass and till i see them with these eyes whoever says you have them lies  no length of time can make you quit honour and virtue sense and wit thus you may still be young to me while i can better hear than see oh neer may fortune show her spite to make me deaf and mend my sight     stellas birthday march 13 1726   this day whateer the fates decree shall still be kept with joy by me this day then let us not be told that you are sick and i grown old nor think on our approaching ills and talk of spectacles and pills tomorrow will be time enough to hear such mortifying stuff yet since from reason may be brought a better and more pleasing thought which can in spite of all decays support a few remaining days from not the gravest of divines accept for once some serious lines  although we now can form no more long schemes of life as heretofore yet you while time is running fast can look with joy on what is past  were future happiness and pain a mere contrivance of the brain as atheists argue to entice and fit their proselytes for vice the only comfort they propose to have companions in their woes grant this the case yet sure tis hard that virtue styled its own reward and by all sages understood to be the chief of human good should acting die or leave behind some lasting pleasure in the mind which by remembrance will assuage grief sickness poverty and age and strongly shoot a radiant dart to shine through lifes declining part  say stella feel you no content reflecting on a life well spent your skilful hand employed to save despairing wretches from the grave and then supporting with your store those whom you dragged from death before so providence on mortals waits preserving what it first creates you generous boldness to defend an innocent and absent friend that courage which can make you just to merit humbled in the dust the detestation you express for vice in all its glittering dress that patience under to torturing pain where stubborn stoics would complain  must these like empty shadows pass or forms reflected from a glass or mere chimaeras in the mind that fly and leave no marks behind does not the body thrive and grow by food of twenty years ago and had it not been still supplied it must a thousand times have died then who with reason can maintain that no effects of food remain and is not virtue in mankind the nutriment that feeds the mind upheld by each good action past and still continued by the last then who with reason can pretend that all effects of virtue end  believe me stella when you show that true contempt for things below nor prize your life for other ends than merely to oblige your friends your former actions claim their part and join to fortify your heart  for virtue in her daily race like janus bears a double face look back with joy where she has gone and therefore goes with courage on she at your sickly couch will wait and guide you to a better state  o then whatever heavn intends take pity on your pitying friends nor let your ills affect your mind to fancy they can be unkind me surely me you ought to spare who gladly would your sufferings share or give my scrap of life to you and think it far beneath your due you to whose care so oft i owe that im alive to tell you so     to stella   visiting me in my sickness october 1727  pallas observing stellas wit was more than for her sex was fit and that her beauty soon or late might breed confusion in the state in high concern for human kind fixed honour in her infant mind  but not in wranglings to engage with such a stupid vicious age if honour i would here define it answers faith in things divine as natural life the body warms and scholars teach the soul informs so honour animates the whole and is the spirit of the soul  those numerous virtues which the tribe of tedious moralists describe and by such various titles call true honour comprehends them all let melancholy rule supreme choler preside or blood or phlegm it makes no difference in the case nor is complexion honours place  but lest we should for honour take the drunken quarrels of a rake or think it seated in a scar or on a proud triumphal car or in the payment of a debt we lose with sharpers at piquet or when a whore in her vocation keeps punctual to an assignation or that on which his lordship swears when vulgar knaves would lose their ears let stellas fair example preach a lesson she alone can teach  in points of honour to be tried all passions must be laid aside ask no advice but think alone suppose the question not your own how shall i act is not the case but how would brutus in my place in such a cause would cato bleed and how would socrates proceed  drive all objections from your mind else you relapse to human kind ambition avarice and lust and factious rage and breach of trust and flattery tipped with nauseous fleer and guilt and shame and servile fear envy and cruelty and pride will in your tainted heart preside  heroes and heroines of old by honour only were enrolled among their brethren in the skies to which though late shall stella rise ten thousand oaths upon record are not so sacred as her word the world shall in its atoms end ere stella can deceive a friend by honour seated in her breast she still determines what is best what indignation in her mind against enslavers of mankind base kings and ministers of state eternal objects of her hate  she thinks that nature neer designed courage to man alone confined can cowardice her sex adorn which most exposes ours to scorn she wonders where the charm appears in florimels affected fears for stella never learned the art at proper times to scream and start nor calls up all the house at night and swears she saw a thing in white doll never flies to cut her lace or throw cold water in her face because she heard a sudden drum or found an earwig in a plum  her hearers are amazed from whence proceeds that fund of wit and sense which though her modesty would shroud breaks like the sun behind a cloud while gracefulness its art conceals and yet through every motion steals  say stella was prometheus blind and forming you mistook your kind no twas for you alone he stole the fire that forms a manly soul then to complete it every way he moulded it with female clay to that you owe the nobler flame to this the beauty of your frame  how would ingratitude delight and how would censure glut her spite if i should stellas kindness hide in silence or forget with pride when on my sickly couch i lay impatient both of night and day lamenting in unmanly strains called every power to ease my pains then stella ran to my relief with cheerful face and inward grief and though by heavens severe decree she suffers hourly more than me no cruel master could require from slaves employed for daily hire what stella by her friendship warmed with vigour and delight performed my sinking spirits now supplies with cordials in her hands and eyes now with a soft and silent tread unheard she moves about my bed i see her taste each nauseous draught and so obligingly am caught i bless the hand from whence they came nor dare distort my face for shame  best pattern of true friends beware you pay too dearly for your care if while your tenderness secures my life it must endanger yours for such a fool was never found who pulled a palace to the ground only to have the ruins made materials for a house decayed  while dr swift was at sir william temples after he left the university of dublin he contracted a friendship with two of sir williams relations mrs johnson and mrs dingley which continued to their deaths  the former of these was the amiable stella so much celebrated in his works  in the year 1727 being in england he received the melancholy news of her last sickness mrs dingley having been dead before  he hastened into ireland where he visited her not only as a friend but a clergyman  no set form of prayer could express the sense of his heart on that occasion  he drew up the following here printed from his own handwriting  she died jan 28 1727     the first he wrote oct 17 1727   most merciful father accept our humblest prayers in behalf of this thy languishing servant forgive the sins the frailties and infirmities of her life past  accept the good deeds she hath done in such a manner that at whatever time thou shalt please to call her she may be received into everlasting habitations  give her grace to continue sincerely thankful to thee for the many favours thou hast bestowed upon her the ability and inclination and practice to do good and those virtues which have procured the esteem and love of her friends and a most unspotted name in the world  o god thou dispensest thy blessings and thy punishments as it becometh infinite justice and mercy and since it was thy pleasure to afflict her with a long constant weakly state of health make her truly sensible that it was for very wise ends and was largely made up to her in other blessings more valuable and less common continue to her o lord that firmness and constancy of mind wherewith thou hast most graciously endowed her together with that contempt of worldly things and vanities that she hath shown in the whole conduct of her life  o allpowerful being the least motion of whose will can create or destroy a world pity us the mournful friends of thy distressed servant who sink under the weight of her present condition and the fear of losing the most valuable of our friends restore her to us o lord if it be thy gracious will or inspire us with constancy and resignation to support ourselves under so heavy an affliction  restore her o lord for the sake of those poor who by losing her will be desolate and those sick who will not only want her bounty but her care and tending or else in thy mercy raise up some other in her place with equal disposition and better abilities  lessen o lord we beseech thee her bodily pains or give her a double strength of mind to support them and if thou wilt soon take her to thyself turn our thoughts rather upon that felicity which we hope she shall enjoy than upon that unspeakable loss we shall endure  let her memory be ever dear unto us and the example of her many virtues as far as human infirmity will admit our constant imitation  accept o lord these prayers poured from the very bottom of our hearts in thy mercy and for the merits of our blessed saviour  amen     the second prayer was written nov 6 1727   o merciful father who never afflictest thy children but for their own good and with justice over which thy mercy always prevaileth either to turn them to repentance or to punish them in the present life in order to reward them in a better take pity we beseech thee upon this thy poor afflicted servant languishing so long and so grievously under the weight of thy hand  give her strength o lord to support her weakness and patience to endure her pains without repining at thy correction forgive every rash and inconsiderate expression which her anguish may at any time force from her tongue while her heart continueth in an entire submission to thy will  suppress in her o lord all eager desires of life and lesson her fears of death by inspiring into her an humble yet assured hope of thy mercy  give her a sincere repentance for all her transgressions and omissions and a firm resolution to pass the remainder of her life in endeavouring to her utmost to observe all thy precepts  we beseech thee likewise to compose her thoughts and preserve to her the use of her memory and reason during the course of her sickness  give her a true conception of the vanity folly and insignificancy of all human things and strengthen her so as to beget in her a sincere love of thee in the midst of her sufferings  accept and impute all her good deeds and forgive her all those offences against thee which she hath sincerely repented of or through the frailty of memory hath forgot  and now o lord we turn to thee in behalf of ourselves and the rest of her sorrowful friends  let not our grief afflict her mind and thereby have an ill effect on her present distemper  forgive the sorrow and weakness of those among us who sink under the grief and terror of losing so dear and useful a friend  accept and pardon our most earnest prayers and wishes for her longer continuance in this evil world to do what thou art pleased to call thy service and is only her bounden duty that she may be still a comfort to us and to all others who will want the benefit of her conversation her advice her good offices or her charity  and since thou hast promised that where two or three are gathered together in thy name thou wilt be in the midst of them to grant their request o gracious lord grant to us who are here met in thy name that those requests which in the utmost sincerity and earnestness of our hearts we have now made in behalf of this thy distressed servant and of ourselves may effectually be answered through the merits of jesus christ our lord amen     the beasts confession 1732   when beasts could speak the learned

but carries loads and feeds on thistles our authors meaning i presume is a creature bipes et implumis wherein the moralist designed a compliment on humankind for here he owns that now and then beasts may degenerate into men     an argument to prove that the abolishing of christianity in england may as things now stand be attended with some inconveniences and perhaps not produce those many good effects proposed thereby   written in the year 1708  i am very sensible what a weakness and presumption it is to reason against the general humour and disposition of the world  i remember it was with great justice and a due regard to the freedom both of the public and the press forbidden upon several penalties to write or discourse or lay wagers against the  even before it was confirmed by parliament because that was looked upon as a design to oppose the current of the people which besides the folly of it is a manifest breach of the fundamental law that makes this majority of opinions the voice of god  in like manner and for the very same reasons it may perhaps be neither safe nor prudent to argue against the abolishing of christianity at a juncture when all parties seem so unanimously determined upon the point as we cannot but allow from their actions their discourses and their writings  however i know not how whether from the affectation of singularity or the perverseness of human nature but so it unhappily falls out that i cannot be entirely of this opinion nay though i were sure an order were issued for my immediate prosecution by the attorneygeneral i should still confess that in the present posture of our affairs at home or abroad i do not yet see the absolute necessity of extirpating the christian religion from among us  this perhaps may appear too great a paradox even for our wise and paxodoxical age to endure therefore i shall handle it with all tenderness and with the utmost deference to that great and profound majority which is of another sentiment  and yet the curious may please to observe how much the genius of a nation is liable to alter in half an age  i have heard it affirmed for certain by some very odd people that the contrary opinion was even in their memories as much in vogue as the other is now and that a project for the abolishing of christianity would then have appeared as singular and been thought as absurd as it would be at this time to write or discourse in its defence  therefore i freely own that all appearances are against me  the system of the gospel after the fate of other systems is generally antiquated and exploded and the mass or body of the common people among whom it seems to have had its latest credit are now grown as much ashamed of it as their betters opinions like fashions always descending from those of quality to the middle sort and thence to the vulgar where at length they are dropped and vanish  but here i would not be mistaken and must therefore be so bold as to borrow a distinction from the writers on the other side when they make a difference betwixt nominal and real trinitarians  i hope no reader imagines me so weak to stand up in the defence of real christianity such as used in primitive times if we may believe the authors of those ages to have an influence upon mens belief and actions  to offer at the restoring of that would indeed be a wild project it would be to dig up foundations to destroy at one blow all the wit and half the learning of the kingdom to break the entire frame and constitution of things to ruin trade extinguish arts and sciences with the professors of them in short to turn our courts exchanges and shops into deserts and would be full as absurd as the proposal of horace where he advises the romans all in a body to leave their city and seek a new seat in some remote part of the world by way of a cure for the corruption of their manners  therefore i think this caution was in itself altogether unnecessary which i have inserted only to prevent all possibility of cavilling since every candid reader will easily understand my discourse to be intended only in defence of nominal christianity the other having been for some time wholly laid aside by general consent as utterly inconsistent with all our present schemes of wealth and power  but why we should therefore cut off the name and title of christians although the general opinion and resolution be so violent for it i confess i cannot with submission apprehend the consequence necessary however since the undertakers propose such wonderful advantages to the nation by this project and advance many plausible objections against the system of christianity i shall briefly consider the strength of both fairly allow them their greatest weight and offer such answers as i think most reasonable  after which i will beg leave to show what inconveniences may possibly happen by such an innovation in the present posture of our affairs  first one great advantage proposed by the abolishing of christianity is that it would very much enlarge and establish liberty of conscience that great bulwark of our nation and of the protestant religion which is still too much limited by priestcraft notwithstanding all the good intentions of the legislature as we have lately found by a severe instance  for it is confidently reported that two young gentlemen of real hopes bright wit and profound judgment who upon a thorough examination of causes and effects and by the mere force of natural abilities without the least tincture of learning having made a discovery that there was no god and generously communicating their thoughts for the good of the public were some time ago by an unparalleled severity and upon i know not what obsolete law broke for blasphemy  and as it has been wisely observed if persecution once begins no man alive knows how far it may reach or where it will end  in answer to all which with deference to wiser judgments i think this rather shows the necessity of a nominal religion among us  great wits love to be free with the highest objects and if they cannot be allowed a god to revile or renounce they will speak evil of dignities abuse the government and reflect upon the ministry which i am sure few will deny to be of much more pernicious consequence according to the saying of tiberius deorum offensa diis curoe  as to the particular fact related i think it is not fair to argue from one instance perhaps another cannot be produced yet to the comfort of all those who may be apprehensive of persecution blasphemy we know is freely spoke a million of times in every coffeehouse and tavern or wherever else good company meet  it must be allowed indeed that to break an english freeborn officer only for blasphemy was to speak the gentlest of such an action a very high strain of absolute power  little can be said in excuse for the general perhaps he was afraid it might give offence to the allies among whom for aught we know it may be the custom of the country to believe a god  but if he argued as some have done upon a mistaken principle that an officer who is guilty of speaking blasphemy may some time or other proceed so far as to raise a mutiny the consequence is by no means to be admitted for surely the commander of an english army is like to be but ill obeyed whose soldiers fear and reverence him as little as they do a deity  it is further objected against the gospel system that it obliges men to the belief of things too difficult for freethinkers and such who have shook off the prejudices that usually cling to a confined education  to which i answer that men should be cautious how they raise objections which reflect upon the wisdom of the nation  is not everybody freely allowed to believe whatever he pleases and to publish his belief to the world whenever he thinks fit especially if it serves to strengthen the party which is in the right  would any indifferent foreigner who should read the trumpery lately written by asgil tindal toland coward and forty more imagine the gospel to be our rule of faith and to be confirmed by parliaments  does any man either believe or say he believes or desire to have it thought that he says he believes one syllable of the matter  and is any man worse received upon that score or does he find his want of nominal faith a disadvantage to him in the pursuit of any civil or military employment  what if there be an old dormant statute or two against him are they not now obsolete to a degree that empson and dudley themselves if they were now alive would find it impossible to put them in execution  it is likewise urged that there are by computation in this kingdom above ten thousand parsons whose revenues added to those of my lords the bishops would suffice to maintain at least two hundred young gentlemen of wit and pleasure and freethinking enemies to priestcraft narrow principles pedantry and prejudices who might be an ornament to the court and town and then again so a great number of able bodied divines might be a recruit to our fleet and armies  this indeed appears to be a consideration of some weight but then on the other side several things deserve to be considered likewise as first whether it may not be thought necessary that in certain tracts of country like what we call parishes there should be one man at least of abilities to read and write  then it seems a wrong computation that the revenues of the church throughout this island would be large enough to maintain two hundred young gentlemen or even half that number after the present refined way of living that is to allow each of them such a rent as in the modern form of speech would make them easy  but still there is in this project a greater mischief behind and we ought to beware of the womans folly who killed the hen that every morning laid her a golden egg  for pray what would become of the race of men in the next age if we had nothing to trust to beside the scrofulous consumptive production furnished by our men of wit and pleasure when having squandered away their vigour health and estates they are forced by some disagreeable marriage to piece up their broken fortunes and entail rottenness and politeness on their posterity  now here are ten thousand persons reduced by the wise regulations of henry viii to the necessity of a low diet and moderate exercise who are the only great restorers of our breed without which the nation would in an age or two become one great hospital  another advantage proposed by the abolishing of christianity is the clear gain of one day in seven which is now entirely lost and consequently the kingdom one seventh less considerable in trade business and pleasure besides the loss to the public of so many stately structures now in the hands of the clergy which might be converted into playhouses exchanges markethouses common dormitories and other public edifices  i hope i shall be forgiven a hard word if i call this a perfect cavil  i readily own there hath been an old custom time out of mind for people to assemble in the churches every sunday and that shops are still frequently shut in order as it is conceived to preserve the memory of that ancient practice but how this can prove a hindrance to business or pleasure is hard to imagine  what if the men of pleasure are forced one day in the week to game at home instead of the chocolatehouse  are not the taverns and coffeehouses open  can there be a more convenient season for taking a dose of physic  is not that the chief day for traders to sum up the accounts of the week and for lawyers to prepare their briefs  but i would fain know how it can be pretended that the churches are misapplied  where are more appointments and rendezvouses of gallantry  where more care to appear in the foremost box with greater advantage of dress  where more meetings for business  where more bargains driven of all sorts  and where so many conveniences or incitements to sleep  there is one advantage greater than any of the foregoing proposed by the abolishing of christianity that it will utterly extinguish parties among us by removing those factious distinctions of high and low church of whig and tory presbyterian and church of england which are now so many mutual clogs upon public proceedings and are apt to prefer the gratifying themselves or depressing their adversaries before the most important interest of the state  i confess if it were certain that so great an advantage would redound to the nation by this expedient i would submit and be silent but will any man say that if the words whoring drinking cheating lying stealing were by act of parliament ejected out of the english tongue and dictionaries we should all awake next morning chaste and temperate honest and just and lovers of truth  is this a fair consequence  or if the physicians would forbid us to pronounce the words pox gout rheumatism and stone would that expedient serve like so many talismen to destroy the diseases themselves  are party and faction rooted in mens hearts no deeper than phrases borrowed from religion or founded upon no firmer principles  and is our language so poor that we cannot find other terms to express them  are envy pride avarice and ambition such ill nomenclators that they cannot furnish appellations for their owners  will not heydukes and mamalukes mandarins and patshaws or any other words formed at pleasure serve to distinguish those who are in the ministry from others who would be in it if they could  what for instance is easier than to vary the form of speech and instead of the word church make it a question in politics whether the monument be in danger  because religion was nearest at hand to furnish a few convenient phrases is our invention so barren we can find no other  suppose for argument sake that the tories favoured margarita the whigs mrs tofts and the trimmers valentini would not margaritians toftians and valentinians be very tolerable marks of distinction  the prasini and veniti two most virulent factions in italy began if i remember right by a distinction of colours in ribbons which we might do with as good a grace about the dignity of the blue and the green and serve as properly to divide the court the parliament and the kingdom between them as any terms of art whatsoever borrowed from religion  and therefore i think there is little force in this objection against christianity or prospect of so great an advantage as is proposed in the abolishing of it  it is again objected as a very absurd ridiculous custom that a set of men should be suffered much less employed and hired to bawl one day in seven against the lawfulness of those methods most in use towards the pursuit of greatness riches and pleasure which are the constant practice of all men alive on the other six  but this objection is i think a little unworthy so refined an age as ours  let us argue this matter calmly  i appeal to the breast of any polite freethinker whether in the pursuit of gratifying a predominant passion he hath not always felt a wonderful incitement by reflecting it was a thing forbidden and therefore we see in order to cultivate this test the wisdom of the nation hath taken special care that the ladies should be furnished with prohibited silks and the men with prohibited wine  and indeed it were to be wished that some other prohibitions were promoted in order to improve the pleasures of the town which for want of such expedients begin already as i am told to flag and grow languid giving way daily to cruel inroads from the spleen  tis likewise proposed as a great advantage to the public that if we once discard the system of the gospel all religion will of course be banished for ever and consequently along with it those grievous prejudices of education which under the names of conscience honour justice and the like are so apt to disturb the peace of human minds and the notions whereof are so hard to be eradicated by right reason or freethinking sometimes during the whole course of our lives  here first i observe how difficult it is to get rid of a phrase which the world has once grown fond of though the occasion that first produced it be entirely taken away  for some years past if a man had but an ill favoured nose the deep thinkers of the age would some way or other contrive to impute the cause to the prejudice of his education  from this fountain were said to be derived all our foolish notions of justice piety love of our country all our opinions of god or a future state heaven hell and the like and there might formerly perhaps have been some pretence for this charge  but so effectual care hath been since taken to remove those prejudices by an entire change in the methods of education that with honour i mention it to our polite innovators the young gentlemen who are now on the scene seem to have not the least tincture left of those infusions or string of those weeds and by consequence the reason for abolishing nominal christianity upon that pretext is wholly ceased  for the rest it may perhaps admit a controversy whether the banishing all notions of religion whatsoever would be inconvenient for the vulgar not that i am in the least of opinion with those who hold religion to have been the invention of politicians to keep the lower part of the world in awe by the fear of invisible powers unless mankind were then very different from what it is now for i look upon the mass or body of our people here in england to be as freethinkers that is to say as staunch unbelievers as any of the highest rank  but i conceive some scattered notions about a superior power to be of singular use for the common people as furnishing excellent materials to keep children quiet when they grow peevish and providing topics of amusement in a tedious winter night  lastly it is proposed as a singular advantage that the abolishing of christianity will very much contribute to the uniting of protestants by enlarging the terms of communion so as to take in all sorts of dissenters who are now shut out of the pale upon account of a few ceremonies which all sides confess to be things indifferent  that this alone will effectually answer the great ends of a scheme for comprehension by opening a large noble gate at which all bodies may enter whereas the chaffering with dissenters and dodging about this or tother ceremony is but like opening a few wickets and leaving them at jar by which no more than one can get in at a time and that not without stooping and sideling and squeezing his body  to all this i answer that there is one darling inclination of mankind which usually affects to be a retainer to religion though she be neither its parent its godmother nor its friend  i mean the spirit of opposition that lived long before christianity and can easily subsist without it  let us for instance examine wherein the opposition of sectaries among us consists  we shall find christianity to have no share in it at all  does the gospel anywhere prescribe a starched squeezed countenance a stiff formal gait a singularity of manners and habit or any affected forms and modes of speech different from the reasonable part of mankind  yet if christianity did not lend its name to stand in the gap and to employ or divert these humours they must of necessity be spent in contraventions to the laws of the land and disturbance of the public peace  there is a portion of enthusiasm assigned to every nation which if it hath not proper objects to work on will burst out and set all into a flame  if the quiet of a state can be bought by only flinging men a few ceremonies to devour it is a purchase no wise man would refuse  let the mastiffs amuse themselves about a sheeps skin stuffed with hay provided it will keep them from worrying the flock  the institution of convents abroad seems in one point a strain of great wisdom there being few irregularities in human passions which may not have recourse to vent themselves in some of those orders which are so many retreats for the speculative the melancholy the proud the silent the politic and the morose to spend themselves and evaporate the noxious particles for each of whom we in this island are forced to provide a several sect of religion to keep them quiet and whenever christianity shall be abolished the legislature must find some other expedient to employ and entertain them  for what imports it how large a gate you open if there will be always left a number who place a pride and a merit in not coming in  having thus considered the most important objections against christianity and the chief advantages proposed by the abolishing thereof i shall now with equal deference and submission to wiser judgments as before proceed to mention a few inconveniences that may happen if the gospel should be repealed which perhaps the projectors may not have sufficiently considered  and first i am very sensible how much the gentlemen of wit and pleasure are apt to murmur and be choked at the sight of so many daggletailed parsons that happen to fall in their way and offend their eyes but at the same time these wise reformers do not consider what an advantage and felicity it is for great wits to be always provided with objects of scorn and contempt in order to exercise and improve their talents and divert their spleen from falling on each other or on themselves especially when all this may be done without the least imaginable danger to their persons  and to urge another argument of a parallel nature if christianity were once abolished how could the freethinkers the strong reasoners and the men of profound learning be able to find another subject so calculated in all points whereon to display their abilities  what wonderful productions of wit should we be deprived of from those whose genius by continual practice hath been wholly turned upon raillery and invectives against religion and would therefore never be able to shine or distinguish themselves upon any other subject  we are daily complaining of the great decline of wit among as and would we take away the greatest perhaps the only topic we have left  who would ever have suspected asgil for a wit or toland for a philosopher if the inexhaustible stock of christianity had not been at hand to provide them with materials  what other subject through all art or nature could have produced tindal for a profound author or furnished him with readers  it is the wise choice of the subject that alone adorns and distinguishes the writer  for had a hundred such pens as these been employed on the side of religion they would have immediately sunk into silence and oblivion  nor do i think it wholly groundless or my fears altogether imaginary that the abolishing of christianity may perhaps bring the church in danger or at least put the senate to the trouble of another securing vote  i desire i may not be mistaken i am far from presuming to affirm or think that the church is in danger at present or as things now stand but we know not how soon it may be so when the christian religion is repealed  as plausible as this project seems there may be a dangerous design lurk under it  nothing can be more notorious than that the atheists deists socinians antitrinitarians and other subdivisions of freethinkers are persons of little zeal for the present ecclesiastical establishment their declared opinion is for repealing the sacramental test they are very indifferent with regard to ceremonies nor do they hold the jus divinum of episcopacy therefore they may be intended as one politic step towards altering the constitution of the church established and setting up presbytery in the stead which i leave to be further considered by those at the helm  in the last place i think nothing can be more plain than that by this expedient we shall run into the evil we chiefly pretend to avoid and that the abolishment of the christian religion will be the readiest course we can take to introduce popery  and i am the more inclined to this opinion because we know it has been the constant practice of the jesuits to send over emissaries with instructions to personate themselves members of the several prevailing sects amongst us  so it is recorded that they have at sundry times appeared in the guise of presbyterians anabaptists independents and quakers according as any of these were most in credit so since the fashion hath been taken up of exploding religion the popish missionaries have not been wanting to mix with the freethinkers among whom toland the great oracle of the anti christians is an irish priest the son of an irish priest and the most learned and ingenious author of a book called the rights of the christian church was in a proper juncture reconciled to the romish faith whose true son as appears by a hundred passages in his treatise he still continues  perhaps i could add some others to the number but the fact is beyond dispute and the reasoning they proceed by is right for supposing christianity to be extinguished the people will never he at ease till they find out some other method of worship which will as infallibly produce superstition as this will end in popery  and therefore if notwithstanding all i have said it still be thought necessary to have a bill brought in for repealing christianity i would humbly offer an amendment that instead of the word christianity may be put religion in general which i conceive will much better answer all the good ends proposed by the projectors of it  for as long as we leave in being a god and his providence with all the necessary consequences which curious and inquisitive men will be apt to draw from such promises we do not strike at the root of the evil though we should ever so effectually annihilate the present scheme of the gospel for of what use is freedom of thought if it will not produce freedom of action which is the sole end how remote soever in appearance of all objections against christianity and therefore the freethinkers consider it as a sort of edifice wherein all the parts have such a mutual dependence on each other that if you happen to pull out one single nail the whole fabric must fall to the ground  this was happily expressed by him who had heard of a text brought for proof of the trinity which in an ancient manuscript was differently read he thereupon immediately took the hint and by a sudden deduction of a long sorites most logically concluded why if it be as you say i may safely drink on and defy the parson from which and many the like instances easy to be produced i think nothing can be more manifest than that the quarrel is not against any particular points of hard digestion in the christian system but against religion in general which by laying restraints on human nature is supposed the great enemy to the freedom of thought and action  upon the whole if it shall still be thought for the benefit of church and state that christianity be abolished i conceive however it may be more convenient to defer the execution to a time of peace and not venture in this conjuncture to disoblige our allies who as it falls out are all christians and many of them by the prejudices of their education so bigoted as to place a sort of pride in the appellation  if upon being rejected by them we are to trust to an alliance with the turk we shall find ourselves much deceived for as he is too remote and generally engaged in war with the persian emperor so his people would be more scandalised at our infidelity than our christian neighbours  for they are not only strict observers of religions worship but what is worse believe a god which is more than is required of us even while we preserve the name of christians  to conclude whatever some may think of the great advantages to trade by this favourite scheme i do very much apprehend that in six months time after the act is passed for the extirpation of the gospel the bank and east india stock may fall at least one per cent  and since that is fifty times more than ever the wisdom of our age thought fit to venture for the preservation of christianity there is no reason we should be at so great a loss merely for the sake of destroying it     hints towards an essay on conversation   i have observed few obvious subjects to have been so seldom or at least so slightly handled as this and indeed i know few so difficult to be treated as it ought nor yet upon which there seemeth so much to be said  most things pursued by men for the happiness of public or private life our wit or folly have so refined that they seldom subsist but in idea a true friend a good marriage a perfect form of government with some others require so many ingredients so good in their several kinds and so much niceness in mixing them that for some thousands of years men have despaired of reducing their schemes to perfection  but in conversation it is or might be otherwise for here we are only to avoid a multitude of errors which although a matter of some difficulty may be in every mans power for want of which it remaineth as mere an idea as the other  therefore it seemeth to me that the truest way to understand conversation is to know the faults and errors to which it is subject and from thence every man to form maxims to himself whereby it may be regulated because it requireth few talents to which most men are not born or at least may not acquire without any great genius or study  for nature bath left every man a capacity of being agreeable though not of shining in company and there are a hundred men sufficiently qualified for both who by a very few faults that they might correct in half an hour are not so much as tolerable  i was prompted to write my thoughts upon this subject by mere indignation to reflect that so useful and innocent a pleasure so fitted for every period and condition of life and so much in all mens power should be so much neglected and abused  and in this discourse it will be necessary to note those errors that are obvious as well as others which are seldomer observed since there are few so obvious or acknowledged into which most men some time or other are not apt to run  for instance nothing is more generally exploded than the folly of talking too much yet i rarely remember to have seen five people together where some one among them hath not been predominant in that kind to the great constraint and disgust of all the rest  but among such as deal in multitudes of words none are comparable to the sober deliberate talker who proceedeth with much thought and caution maketh his preface brancheth out into several digressions findeth a hint that putteth him in mind of another story which he promiseth to tell you when this is done cometh back regularly to his subject cannot readily call to mind some persons name holdeth his head complaineth of his memory the whole company all this while in suspense at length says he it is no matter and so goes on  and to crown the business it perhaps proveth at last a story the company hath heard fifty times before or at best some insipid adventure of the relater  another general fault in conversation is that of those who affect to talk of themselves  some without any ceremony will run over the history of their lives will relate the annals of their diseases with the several symptoms and circumstances of them will enumerate the hardships and injustice they have suffered in court in parliament in love or in law others are more dexterous and with great art will lie on the watch to hook in their own praise  they will call a witness to remember they always foretold what would happen in such a case but none would believe them they advised such a man from the beginning and told him the consequences just as they happened but he would have his own way  others make a vanity of telling their faults  they are the strangest men in the world they cannot dissemble they own it is a folly they have lost abundance of advantages by it but if you would give them the world they cannot help it there is something in their nature that abhors insincerity and constraint with many other unsufferable topics of the same altitude  of such mighty importance every man is to himself and ready to think he is so to others without once making this easy and obvious reflection that his affairs can have no more weight with other men than theirs have with him and how little that is he is sensible enough  where company hath met i often have observed two persons discover by some accident that they were bred together at the same school or university after which the rest are condemned to silence and to listen while these two are refreshing each others memory with the arch tricks and passages of themselves and their comrades  i know a great officer of the army who will sit for some time with a supercilious and impatient silence full of anger and contempt for those who are talking at length of a sudden demand audience decide the matter in a short dogmatical way then withdraw within himself again and vouchsafe to talk no more until his spirits circulate again to the same point  there are some faults in conversation which none are so subject to as the men of wit nor ever so much as when they are with each other  if they have opened their mouths without endeavouring to say a witty thing they think it is so many words lost  it is a torment to the hearers as much as to themselves to see them upon the rack for invention and in perpetual constraint with so little success  they must do something extraordinary in order to acquit themselves and answer their character else the standers by may be disappointed and be apt to think them only like the rest of mortals  i have known two men of wit industriously brought together in order to entertain the company where they have made a very ridiculous figure and provided all the mirth at their own expense  i know a man of wit who is never easy but where he can be allowed to dictate and preside he neither expecteth to be informed or entertained but to display his own talents  his business is to be good company and not good conversation and therefore he chooseth to frequent those who are content to listen and profess themselves his admirers  and indeed the worst conversation i ever remember to have heard in my life was that at wills coffeehouse where the wits as they were called used formerly to assemble that is to say five or six men who had written plays or at least prologues or had share in a miscellany came thither and entertained one another with their trifling composures in so important an air as if they had been the noblest efforts of human nature or that the fate of kingdoms depended on them and they were usually attended with a humble audience of young students from the inns of courts or the universities who at due distance listened to these oracles and returned home with great contempt for their law and philosophy their heads filled with trash under the name of politeness criticism and belles lettres  by these means the poets for many years past were all overrun with pedantry  for as i take it the word is not properly used because pedantry is the too front or unseasonable obtruding our own knowledge in common discourse and placing too great a value upon it by which definition men of the court or the army may be as guilty of pedantry as a philosopher or a divine and it is the same vice in women when they are over copious upon the subject of their petticoats or their fans or their china  for which reason although it be a piece of prudence as well as good manners to put men upon talking on subjects they are best versed in yet that is a liberty a wise man could hardly take because beside the imputation of pedantry it is what he would never improve by  this great town is usually provided with some player mimic or buffoon who hath a general reception at the good tables familiar and domestic with persons of the first quality and usually sent for at every meeting to divert the company against which i have no objection  you go there as to a farce or a puppetshow your business is only to laugh in season either out of inclination or civility while this merry companion is acting his part  it is a business he hath undertaken and we are to suppose he is paid for his days work  i only quarrel when in select and private meetings where men of wit and learning are invited to pass an evening this jester should be admitted to run over his circle of tricks and make the whole company unfit for any other conversation besides the indignity of confounding mens talents at so shameful a rate  raillery is the finest part of conversation but as it is our usual custom to counterfeit and adulterate whatever is too dear for us so we have done with this and turned it all into what is generally called repartee or being smart just as when an expensive fashion cometh up those who are not able to reach it content themselves with some paltry imitation  it now passeth for raillery to run a man down in discourse to put him out of countenance and make him ridiculous sometimes to expose the defects of his person or understanding on all which occasions he is obliged not to be angry to avoid the imputation of not being able to take a jest  it is admirable to observe one who is dexterous at this art singling out a weak adversary getting the laugh on his side and then carrying all before him  the french from whom we borrow the word have a quite different idea of the thing and so had we in the politer age of our fathers  raillery was to say something that at first appeared a reproach or reflection but by some turn of wit unexpected and surprising ended always in a compliment and to the advantage of the person it was addressed to  and surely one of the best rules in conversation is never to say a thing which any of the company can reasonably wish we had rather left unsaid nor can there anything be well more contrary to the ends for which people meet together than to part unsatisfied with each other or themselves  there are two faults in conversation which appear very different yet arise from the same root and are equally blamable i mean an impatience to interrupt others and the uneasiness of being interrupted ourselves the two chief ends of conversation are to entertain and improve those we are among or to receive those benefits ourselves which whoever will consider cannot easily run into either of those two errors because when any man speaketh in company it is to be supposed he doth it for his hearers sake and not his own so that common discretion will teach us not to force their attention if they are not willing to lend it nor on the other side to interrupt him who is in possession because that is in the grossest manner to give the preference to our own good sense  there are some people whose good manners will not suffer them to interrupt you but what is almost as bad will discover abundance of impatience and lie upon the watch until you have done because they have started something in their own thoughts which they long to be delivered of  meantime they are so far from regarding what passes that their imaginations are wholly turned upon what they have in reserve for fear it should slip out of their memory and thus they confine their invention which might otherwise range over a hundred things full as good and that might be much more naturally introduced  there is a sort of rude familiarity which some people by practising among their intimates have introduced into their general conversation and would have it pass for innocent freedom or humour which is a dangerous experiment in our northern climate where all the little decorum and politeness we have are purely forced by art and are so ready to lapse into barbarity  this among the romans was the raillery of slaves of which we have many instances in plautus  it seemeth to have been introduced among us by cromwell who by preferring the scum of the people made it a courtentertainment of which i have heard many particulars and considering all things were turned upside down it was reasonable and judicious although it was a piece of policy found out to ridicule a point of honour in the other extreme when the smallest word misplaced among gentlemen ended in a duel  there are some men excellent at telling a story and provided with a plentiful stock of them which they can draw out upon occasion in all companies and considering how low conversation runs now among us it is not altogether a contemptible talent however it is subject to two unavoidable defects frequent repetition and being soon exhausted so that whoever valueth this gift in himself hath need of a good memory and ought frequently to shift his company that he may not discover the weakness of his fund for those who are thus endowed have seldom any other revenue but live upon the main stock  great speakers in public are seldom agreeable in private conversation whether their faculty be natural or acquired by practice and often venturing  natural elocution although it may seem a paradox usually springeth from a barrenness of invention and of words by which men who have only one stock of notions upon every subject and one set of phrases to express them in they swim upon the superficies and offer themselves on every occasion therefore men of much learning and who know the compass of a language are generally the worst talkers on a sudden until much practice hath inured and emboldened them because they are confounded with plenty of matter variety of notions and of words which they cannot readily choose but are perplexed and entangled by too great a choice which is no disadvantage in private conversation where on the other side the talent of haranguing is of all others most insupportable  nothing hath spoiled men more for conversation than the character of being wits to support which they never fail of encouraging a number of followers and admirers who list themselves in their service wherein they find their accounts on both sides by pleasing their mutual vanity this hath given the former such an air of superiority and made the latter so pragmatical that neither of them are well to be endured  i say nothing here of the itch of dispute and contradiction telling of lies or of those who are troubled with the disease called the wandering of the thoughts that they are never present in mind at what passeth in discourse for whoever labours under any of these possessions is as unfit for conversation as madmen in bedlam  i think i have gone over most of the errors in conversation that have fallen under my notice or memory except some that are merely personal and others too gross to need exploding such as lewd or profane talk but i pretend only to treat the errors of conversation in general and not the several subjects of discourse which would be infinite  thus we see how human nature is most debased by the abuse of that faculty which is held the great distinction between men and brutes and how little advantage we make of that which might be the greatest the most lasting and the most innocent as well as useful pleasure of life in default of which we are forced to take up with those poor amusements of dress and visiting or the more pernicious ones of play drink and vicious amours whereby the nobility and gentry of both sexes are entirely corrupted both in body and mind and have lost all notions of love honour friendship and generosity which under the name of fopperies have been for some time laughed out of doors  this degeneracy of conversation with the pernicious consequences thereof upon our humours and dispositions hath been owing among other causes to the custom arisen for some time past of excluding women from any share in our society further than in parties at play or dancing or in the pursuit of an amour  i take the highest period of politeness in england and it is of the same date in france to have been the peaceable part of king charles is reign and from what we read of those times as well as from the accounts i have formerly met with from some who lived in that court the methods then used for raising and cultivating conversation were altogether different from ours several ladies whom we find celebrated by the poets of that age had assemblies at their houses where persons of the best understanding and of both sexes met to pass the evenings in discoursing upon whatever agreeable subjects were occasionally started and although we are apt to ridicule the sublime platonic notions they had or personated in love and friendship i conceive their refinements were grounded upon reason and that a little grain of the romance is no ill ingredient to preserve and exalt the dignity of human nature without which it is apt to degenerate into everything that is sordid vicious and low  if there were no other use in the conversation of ladies it is sufficient that it would lay a restraint upon those odious topics of immodesty and indecencies into which the rudeness of our northern genius is so apt to fall  and therefore it is observable in those sprightly gentlemen about the town who are so very dexterous at entertaining a vizard mask in the park or the playhouse that in the company of ladies of virtue and honour they are silent and disconcerted and out of their element  there are some people who think they sufficiently acquit themselves and entertain their company with relating of facts of no consequence nor at all out of the road of such common incidents as happen every day and this i have observed more frequently among the scots than any other nation who are very careful not to omit the minutest circumstances of time or place which kind of discourse if it were not a little relieved by the uncouth terms and phrases as well as accent and gesture peculiar to that country would be hardly tolerable  it is not a fault in company to talk much but to continue it long is certainly one for if the majority of those who are got together be naturally silent or cautious the conversation will flag unless it be often renewed by one among them who can start new subjects provided he doth not dwell upon them but leaveth room for answers and replies     thoughts on various subjects   we have just enough religion to make us hate but not enough to make us love one another  reflect on things past as wars negotiations factions etc  we enter so little into those interests that we wonder how men could possibly be so busy and concerned for things so transitory look on the present times we find the same humour yet wonder not at all  a wise man endeavours by considering all circumstances to make conjectures and form conclusions but the smallest accident intervening and in the course of affairs it is impossible to foresee all does often produce such turns and changes that at last he is just as much in doubt of events as the most ignorant and inexperienced person  positiveness is a good quality for preachers and orators because he that would obtrude his thoughts and reasons upon a multitude will convince others the more as he appears convinced himself  how is it possible to expect that mankind will take advice when they will not so much as take warning  i forget whether advice be among the lost things which aristo says are to be found in the moon that and time ought to have been there  no preacher is listened to but time which gives us the same train and turn of thought that older people have tried in vain to put into our heads before  when we desire or solicit anything our minds run wholly on the good side or circumstances of it when it is obtained our minds run wholly on the bad ones  in a glasshouse the workmen often fling in a small quantity of fresh coals which seems to disturb the fire but very much enlivens it  this seems to allude to a gentle stirring of the passions that the mind may not languish  religion seems to have grown an infant with age and requires miracles to nurse it as it had in its infancy  all fits of pleasure are balanced by an equal degree of pain or languor it is like spending this year part of the next years revenue  the latter part of a wise mans life is taken up in curing the follies prejudices and false opinions he had contracted in the former  would a writer know how to behave himself with relation to posterity let him consider in old books what he finds that he is glad to know and what omissions he most laments  whatever the poets pretend it is plain they give immortality to none but themselves it is homer and virgil we reverence and admire not achilles or aeneas  with historians it is quite the contrary our thoughts are taken up with the actions persons and events we read and we little regard the authors  when a true genius appears in the world you may know him by this sign that the dunces are all in confederacy against him  men who possess all the advantages of life are in a state where there are many accidents to disorder and discompose but few to please them  it is unwise to punish cowards with ignominy for if they had regarded that they would not have been cowards death is their proper punishment because they fear it most  the greatest inventions were produced in the times of ignorance as the use of the compass gunpowder and printing and by the dullest nation as the germans  one argument to prove that the common relations of ghosts and spectres are generally false may be drawn from the opinion held that spirits are never seen by more than one person at a time that is to say it seldom happens to above one person in a company to be possessed with any high degree of spleen or melancholy  i am apt to think that in the day of judgment there will be small allowance given to the wise for their want of morals nor to the ignorant for their want of faith because both are without excuse  this renders the advantages equal of ignorance and knowledge  but some scruples in the wise and some vices in the ignorant will perhaps be forgiven upon the strength of temptation to each  the value of several circumstances in story lessens very much by distance of time though some minute circumstances are very valuable and it requires great judgment in a writer to distinguish  it is grown a word of course for writers to say this critical age as divines say this sinful age  it is pleasant to observe how free the present age is in laying taxes on the next  future ages shall talk of this this shall be famous to all posterity  whereas their time and thoughts will be taken up about present things as ours are now  the chameleon who is said to feed upon nothing but air hath of all animals the nimblest tongue  when a man is made a spiritual peer he loses his surname when a temporal his christian name  it is in disputes as in armies where the weaker side sets up false lights and makes a great noise to make the enemy believe them more numerous and strong than they really are  some men under the notions of weeding out prejudices eradicate virtue honesty and religion  in all wellinstituted commonwealths care has been taken to limit mens possessions which is done for many reasons and among the rest for one which perhaps is not often considered that when bounds are set to mens desires after they have acquired as much as the laws will permit them their private interest is at an end and they have nothing to do but to take care of the public  there are but three ways for a man to revenge himself of the censure of the world to despise it to return the like or to endeavour to live so as to avoid it  the first of these is usually pretended the last is almost impossible the universal practice is for the second  i never heard a finer piece of satire against lawyers than that of astrologers when they pretend by rules of art to tell when a suit will end and whether to the advantage of the plaintiff or defendant thus making the matter depend entirely upon the influence of the stars without the least regard to the merits of the cause  the expression in apocrypha about tobit and his dog following him i have often heard ridiculed yet homer has the same words of telemachus more than once and virgil says something like it of evander  and i take the book of tobit to be partly poetical  i have known some men possessed of good qualities which were very serviceable to others but useless to themselves like a sundial on the front of a house to inform the neighbours and passengers but not the owner within  if a man would register all his opinions upon love politics religion learning etc beginning from his youth and so go on to old age what a bundle of inconsistencies and contradictions would appear at last  what they do in heaven we are ignorant of what they do not we are told expressly that they neither marry nor are given in marriage  it is a miserable thing to live in suspense it is the life of a spider  the stoical scheme of supplying our wants by lopping off our desires is like cutting off our feet when we want shoes  physicians ought not to give their judgment of religion for the same reason that butchers are not admitted to be jurors upon life and death  the reason why so few marriages are happy is because young ladies spend their time in making nets not in making cages  if a man will observe as he walks the streets i believe he will find the merriest countenances in mourning coaches  nothing more unqualifies a man to act with prudence than a misfortune that is attended with shame and guilt  the power of fortune is confessed only by the miserable for the happy impute all their success to prudence or merit  ambition often puts men upon doing the meanest offices so climbing is performed in the same posture with creeping  censure is the tax a man pays to the public for being eminent  although men are accused for not knowing their own weakness yet perhaps as few know their own strength  it is in men as in soils where sometimes there is a vein of gold which the owner knows not of  satire is reckoned the easiest of all wit but i take it to be otherwise in very bad times for it is as hard to satirise well a man of distinguished vices as to praise well a man of distinguished virtues  it is easy enough to do either to people of moderate characters  invention is the talent of youth and judgment of age so that our judgment grows harder to please when we have fewer things to offer it this goes through the whole commerce of life  when we are old our friends find it difficult to please us and are less concerned whether we be pleased or no  no wise man ever wished to be younger  an idle reason lessens the weight of the good ones you gave before  the motives of the best actions will not bear too strict an inquiry  it is allowed that the cause of most actions good or bad may he resolved into the love of ourselves but the selflove of some men inclines them to please others and the selflove of others is wholly employed in pleasing themselves  this makes the great distinction between virtue and vice  religion is the best motive of all actions yet religion is allowed to be the highest instance of selflove  old men view best at a distance with the eyes of their understanding as well as with those of nature  some people take more care to hide their wisdom than their folly  anthony henleys farmer dying of an asthma said well if i can get this breath once out ill take care it never got in again  the humour of exploding many things under the name of trifles fopperies and only imaginary goods is a very false proof either of wisdom or magnanimity and a great check to virtuous actions  for instance with regard to fame there is in most people a reluctance and unwillingness to be forgotten  we observe even among the vulgar how fond they are to have an inscription over their grave  it requires but little philosophy to discover and observe that there is no intrinsic value in all this however if it be founded in our nature as an incitement to virtue it ought not to be ridiculed  complaint is the largest tribute heaven receives and the sincerest part of our devotion  the common fluency of speech in many men and most women is owing to a scarcity of matter and a scarcity of words for whoever is a master of language and hath a mind full of ideas will be apt in speaking to hesitate upon the choice of both whereas common speakers have only one set of ideas and one set of words to clothe them in and these are always ready at the mouth  so people come faster out of a church when it is almost empty than when a crowd is at the door  few are qualified to shine in company but it is in most mens power to be agreeable  the reason therefore why conversation runs so low at present is not the defect of understanding but pride vanity illnature affectation singularity positiveness or some other vice the effect of a wrong education  to be vain is rather a mark of humility than pride  vain men delight in telling what honours have been done them what great company they have kept and the like by which they plainly confess that these honours were more than their due and such as their friends would not believe if they had not been told whereas a man truly proud thinks the greatest honours below his merit and consequently scorns to boast  i therefore deliver it as a maxim that whoever desires the character of a proud man ought to conceal his vanity  law in a free country is or ought to be the determination of the majority of those who have property in land  one argument used to the disadvantage of providence i take to be a very strong one in its defence  it is objected that storms and tempests unfruitful seasons serpents spiders flies and other noxious or troublesome animals with many more instances of the like kind discover an imperfection in nature because human life would be much easier without them but the design of providence may clearly be perceived in this proceeding  the motions of the sun and moonin short the whole system of the universe as far as philosophers have been able to discover and observe are in the utmost degree of regularity and perfection but wherever god hath left to man the power of interposing a remedy by thought or labour there he hath placed things in a state of imperfection on purpose to stir up human industry without which life would stagnate or indeed rather could not subsist at all curis accuunt mortalia corda  praise is the daughter of present power  how inconsistent is man with himself  i have known several persons of great fame for wisdom in public affairs and counsels governed by foolish servants  i have known great ministers distinguished for wit and learning who preferred none but dunces  i have known men of great valour cowards to their wives  i have known men of the greatest cunning perpetually cheated  i knew three great ministers who could exactly compute and settle the accounts of a kingdom but were wholly ignorant of their own economy  the preaching of divines helps to preserve wellinclined men in the course of virtue but seldom or never reclaims the vicious  princes usually make wiser choices than the servants whom they trust for the disposal of places i have known a prince more than once choose an able minister but i never observed that minister to use his credit in the disposal of an employment to a person whom he thought the fittest for it  one of the greatest in this age owned and excused the matter from the violence of parties and the unreasonableness of friends  small causes are sufficient to make a man uneasy when great ones are not in the way  for want of a block he will stumble at a straw  dignity high station or great riches are in some sort necessary to old men in order to keep the younger at a distance who are otherwise too apt to insult them upon the score of their age  every man desires to live long but no man would be old  love of flattery in most men proceeds from the mean opinion they have of themselves in women from the contrary  if books and laws continue to increase as they have done for fifty years past i am in some concern for future ages how any man will be learned or any man a lawyer  kings are commonly said to have long hands i wish they had as long ears  princes in their infancy childhood and youth are said to discover prodigious parts and wit to speak things that surprise and astonish strange so many hopeful princes and so many shameful kings  if they happen to die young they would have been prodigies of wisdom and virtue if they live they are often prodigies indeed but of another sort  politics as the word is commonly understood are nothing but corruptions and consequently of no use to a good king or a good ministry for which reason courts are so overrun with politics  a nice man is a man of nasty ideas  apollo was held the god of physic and sender of diseases  both were originally the same trade and still continue  old men and comets have been reverenced for the same reason their long beards and pretences to foretell events  a person was asked at court what he thought of an ambassador and his train who were all embroidery and lace full of bows cringes and gestures he said it was solomons importation gold and apes  most sorts of diversion in men children and other animals is an imitation of fighting  augustus meeting an ass with a lucky name foretold himself good fortune i meet many asses but none of them have lucky names  if a man makes me keep my distance the comfort is he keeps his at the same time  who can deny that all men are violent lovers of truth when we see them so positive in their errors which they will maintain out of their zeal to truth although they contradict themselves every day of their lives  that was excellently observed say i when i read a passage in an author where his opinion agrees with mine  when we differ there i pronounce him to be mistaken  very few men properly speaking live at present but are providing to live another time  laws penned with the utmost care and exactness and in the vulgar language are often perverted to wrong meanings then why should we wonder that the bible is so  although men are accused for not knowing their weakness yet perhaps as few know their own strength  a man seeing a wasp creeping into a vial filled with honey that was hung on a fruit tree said thus why thou sottish animal art thou mad to go into that vial where you see many hundred of your kind there dying in it before you  the reproach is just answered the wasp but not from you men who are so far from taking example by other peoples follies that you will not take warning by your own  if after falling several times into this vial and escaping by chance i should fall in again i should then but resemble you  an old miser kept a tame jackdaw that used to steal pieces of money and hide them in a hole which the cat observing asked why he would hoard up those round shining things that he could make no use of  why said the jackdaw my master has a whole chest full and makes no more use of them than i  men are content to be laughed at for their wit but not for their folly  if the men of wit and genius would resolve never to complain in their works of critics and detractors the next age would not know that they ever had any  after all the maxims and systems of trade and commerce a standerby would think the affairs of the world were most ridiculously contrived  there are few countries which if well cultivated would not support double the number of their inhabitants and yet fewer where onethird of the people are not extremely stinted even in the necessaries of life  i send out twenty barrels of corn which would maintain a family in bread for a year and i bring back in return a vessel of wine which half a dozen good follows would drink in less than a month at the expense
