began to receive letters from children telling me of their pleasure in reading the story and asking me to write something more about the scarecrow and the tin woodman at first i considered these little letters frank and earnest though they were in the light of pretty compliments but the letters continued to come during succeeding months and even years  finally i promised one little girl who made a long journey to see me and prefer her requestand she is a dorothy by the waythat when a thousand little girls had written me a thousand little letters asking for the scarecrow and the tin woodman i would write the book either little dorothy was a fairy in disguise and waved her magic wand or the success of the stage production of the wizard of oz made new friends for the story for the thousand letters reached their destination long sinceand many more followed them  and now although pleading guilty to long delay i have kept my promise in this book  l frank baum  chicago june 1904

manufactures a pumpkinhead   in the country of the gillikins which is at the north of the land of oz lived a youth called tip there was more to his name than that for old mombi often declared that his whole name was tippetarius but no one was expected to say such a long word when tip would do just as well  this boy remembered nothing of his parents for he had been brought when quite young to be reared by the old woman known as mombi whose reputation i am sorry to say was none of the best for the gillikin people had reason to suspect her of indulging in magical arts and therefore hesitated to associate with her  mombi was not exactly a witch because the good witch who ruled that part of the land of oz    8                    lineart drawing  had forbidden any other witch to exist in her dominions so tips guardian however much she might aspire to working magic realized it was unlawful to be more than a sorceress or at most a wizardess  tip was made to carry wood from the forest that the old woman might boil her pot he also worked in the cornfields hoeing and husking and he fed the pigs and milked the fourhorned cow that was mombis especial pride  but you must not suppose he worked all the time for he felt that would be bad for him when sent to the forest tip often climbed trees for birds eggs or amused himself chasing the fleet white rabbits or fishing in the brooks with bent pins then he would hastily gather his armful of wood and carry it home and when he was supposed to be working in the cornfields and the tall stalks hid him from mombis view tip would often dig in the gopher holes or if the mood seized him    9 lie upon his back between the rows of corn and take a nap so by taking care not to exhaust his strength he grew as strong and rugged as a boy may be  mombis curious magic often frightened her neighbors and they treated her shyly yet respectfully because of her weird powers but tip frankly hated her and took no pains to hide his feelings indeed he sometimes showed less respect for the old woman than he should have done considering she was his guardian  there were pumpkins in mombis cornfields lying golden red among the rows of green stalks and these had been planted and carefully tended that the fourhorned cow might eat of them in the winter time but one day after the corn had all been cut and stacked and tip was carrying the pumpkins to the stable he took a notion to make a jack lantern and try to give the old woman a fright with it  so he selected a fine big pumpkinone with a lustrous orangered colorand began carving it with the point of his knife he made two round eyes a threecornered nose and                 lineart drawing    10 a mouth shaped like a new moon the face when completed could not have been considered strictly beautiful but it wore a smile so big and broad and was so jolly in expression that even tip laughed as he looked admiringly at his work  the child had no playmates so he did not know that boys often dig out the inside of a pumpkinjack and in the space thus made put a lighted candle to render the face more startling but he conceived an idea of his own that promised to be quite as effective he decided to manufacture the form of a man who would wear this pumpkin head and to stand it in a place where old mombi would meet it face to face  and then said tip to himself with a laugh shell squeal louder than the brown pig does when i pull her tail and shiver with fright worse than i did last year when i had the ague  he had plenty of time to accomplish this task for mombi had gone to a villageto buy groceries she saidand it was a journey of at least two days  so he took his axe to the forest and selected some stout straight saplings which he cut down and trimmed of all their twigs and leaves from these he would make the arms and legs and feet of his man for the body he stripped a sheet of thick    11 bark from around a big tree and with much labor fashioned it into a cylinder of about the right size pinning the edges together with wooden pegs then whistling happily as he worked he carefully jointed the limbs and fastened them to the body with pegs whittled into shape with his knife  by the time this feat had been accomplished it began to grow dark and tip remembered he must milk the cow and feed the pigs so he picked up his wooden man and carried it back to the house with him  during the evening by the light of the fire in the kitchen tip carefully rounded all the edges of the joints and smoothed the rough places in a neat and workmanlike manner then he stood the figure up against the wall and admired it it seemed remarkably tall even for a fullgrown man but that was a good point in a small boys eyes and tip did not object at all to the size of his creation  next morning when he looked at his work again tip saw he had forgotten to give the dummy a neck by means of which he might fasten the pumpkinhead to the body so he went again to the forest which was not far away and chopped from a tree several pieces of wood with which to complete his work when he returned he fastened a crosspiece    12 to the upper end of the body making a hole through the center to hold upright the neck the bit of wood which formed this neck was also sharpened at the upper end and when all was ready tip put on the pumpkin head pressing it well down onto the neck and found that it fitted very well the head could be turned to one side or the other as he pleased and the hinges of the arms and legs allowed him to place the dummy in any position he desired  now that declared tip proudly is really a very fine man and it ought to frighten several screeches out of old mombi but it would be much more lifelike if it were properly dressed  to find clothing seemed no easy task but tip boldly ransacked the great chest in which mombi kept all her keepsakes and treasures and at the very bottom he discovered some purple trousers a red shirt and a pink vest which was dotted with white spots these he carried away to his man and succeeded although the garments did not fit very well in dressing the creature in a jaunty fashion some knit stockings belonging to mombi and a much worn pair of his own shoes completed the mans apparel and tip was so delighted that he danced up and down and laughed aloud in boyish ecstacy    13  i must give him a name he cried so good a man as this must surely have a name i believe he added after a moments thought i will name the fellow jack pumpkinhead                 lineart drawing    14               full page lineart drawing    15               the marvelous powder of life   after considering the matter carefully tip decided that the best place to locate jack would be at the bend in the road a little way from the house so he started to carry his man there but found him heavy and rather awkward to handle after dragging the creature a short distance tip stood him on his feet and by first bending the joints of one leg and then those of the other at the same time pushing from behind the boy managed to induce jack to walk to the bend in the road it was not accomplished without a few tumbles and tip really worked harder than he ever had in the fields or    16 forest but a love of mischief urged him on and it pleased him to test the cleverness of his workmanship  jacks all right and works fine he said to himself panting with the unusual exertion but just then he discovered the mans left arm had fallen off in the journey so he went back to find it and afterward by whittling a new and stouter pin for the shoulderjoint he repaired the injury so successfully that the arm was stronger than before tip also noticed that jacks pumpkin head had twisted around until it faced his back but this was easily remedied when at last the man was set up facing the turn in the path where old mombi was to appear he looked natural enough to be a fair imitation of a gillikin farmerand unnatural enough to startle anyone that came on him unawares  as it was yet too early in the day to expect the old woman to return home tip went down into the valley below the farmhouse and began to gather nuts from the trees that grew there  however old mombi returned earlier than usual she had met a crooked wizard who resided in a lonely cave in the mountains and had traded several important secrets of magic with him hav    17 ing in this way secured three new recipes four magical powders and a selection of herbs of wonderful power and potency she hobbled home as fast as she could in order to test her new sorceries  so intent was mombi on the treasures she had gained that when she turned the bend in the road and caught a glimpse of the man she merely nodded and said  good evening sir  but a moment after noting that the person did not move or reply she cast a shrewd glance into his face and discovered his pumpkin head elaborately carved by tips jackknife  heh ejaculated mombi giving a sort of grunt that rascally boy has been playing tricks again very good very good ill beat him black andblue for trying to scare me in this fashion  angrily she raised her stick to smash in the grinning pumpkin head of the dummy but a sudden thought made her pause the uplifted stick left motionless in the air  why here is a good chance to try my new powder said she eagerly and then i can tell whether that crooked wizard has fairly traded secrets or whether he has fooled me as wickedly as i fooled him    18  so she set down her basket and began fumbling in it for one of the precious powders she had obtained  while mombi was thus occupied tip strolled back with his pockets full of nuts and discovered the old woman standing beside his man and apparently not the least bit frightened by it  at first he was generally disappointed but the next moment he became curious to know what mombi was going to do so he hid behind a hedge where he could see without being seen and prepared to watch  after some search the woman drew from her basket an old pepperbox upon the faded label of which the wizard had written with a leadpencil  powder of life  ahhere it is she cried joyfully and now let us see if it is potent the stingy wizard didnt give me much of it but i guess theres enough for two or three doses  tip was much surprised when he overheard this speech then he saw old mombi raise her arm and sprinkle the powder from the box over the pumpkin head of his man jack she did this in the same way one would pepper a baked potato and the powder sifted down from jacks head and scattered    19               full page lineart drawing                 old mombi danced around him    20 over the red shirt and pink waistcoat and purple trousers tip had dressed him in and a portion even fell upon the patched and worn shoes  then putting the pepperbox back into the basket mombi lifted her left hand with its little finger pointed upward and said  weaugh  then she lifted her right hand with the thumb pointed upward and said  teaugh  then she lifted both hands with all the fingers and thumbs spread out and cried  peaugh  jack pumpkinhead stepped back a pace at this and said in a reproachful voice  dont yell like that do you think im deaf  old mombi danced around him frantic with delight  he lives she screamed he lives he lives  then she threw her stick into the air and caught it as it came down and she hugged herself with both arms and tried to do a step of a jig and all the time she repeated rapturously  he liveshe liveshe lives  now you may well suppose that tip observed all this with amazement    21  at first he was so frightened and horrified that he wanted to run away but his legs trembled and shook so badly that he couldnt then it struck him as a very funny thing for jack to come to life especially as the expression on his pumpkin face was so droll and comical it excited laughter on the instant so recovering from his first fear tip began to laugh and the merry peals reached old mombis ears and made her hobble quickly to the hedge where she seized tips collar and dragged him back to where she had left her basket and the pumpkinheaded man  you naughty sneaking wicked boy she exclaimed furiously ill teach you to spy out my secrets and to make fun of me  i wasnt making fun of you protested tip i was laughing at old pumpkinhead look at him isnt he a picture though  i hope you are not reflecting on my personal appearance said jack and it was so funny to hear his grave voice while his face continued to wear its jolly smile that tip again burst into a peal of laughter  even mombi was not without a curious interest in the man her magic had brought to life for after staring at him intently she presently asked    22               full page lineart drawing                 old mombi puts jack in the stable    23  what do you know  well that is hard to tell replied jack for although i feel that i know a tremendous lot i am not yet aware how much there is in the world to find out about it will take me a little time to discover whether i am very wise or very foolish  to be sure said mombi thoughtfully  but what are you going to do with him now he is alive asked tip wondering  i must think it over answered mombi but we must get home at once for it is growing dark help the pumpkinhead to walk  never mind me said jack i can walk as well as you can havent i got legs and feet and arent they jointed  are they asked the woman turning to tip  of course they are i made em myself returned the boy with pride  so they started for the house but when they reached the farm yard old mombi led the pumpkin man to the cow stable and shut him up in an empty stall fastening the door securely on the outside  ive got to attend to you first she said nodding her head at tip  hearing this the boy became uneasy for he    24 knew mombi had a bad and revengeful heart and would not hesitate to do any evil thing  they entered the house it was a round domeshaped structure as are nearly all the farm houses in the land of oz  mombi bade the boy light a candle while she put her basket in a cupboard and hung her cloak on a peg tip obeyed quickly for he was afraid of her  after the candle had been lighted mombi ordered him to build a fire in the hearth and while tip was thus engaged the old woman ate her supper when the flames began to crackle the boy came to her and asked a share of the bread and cheese but mombi refused him  im hungry said tip in a sulky tone  you wont be hungry long replied mombi with a grim look  the boy didnt like this speech for it sounded like a threat but he happened to remember he had nuts in his pocket so he cracked some of those and ate them while the woman rose shook the crumbs from her apron and hung above the fire a small black kettle  then she measured out equal parts of milk and vinegar and poured them into the kettle next she    25 produced several packets of herbs and powders and began adding a portion of each to the contents of the kettle occasionally she would draw near the candle and read from a yellow paper the recipe of the mess she was concocting  as tip watched her his uneasiness increased  what is that for he asked  for you returned mombi briefly  tip wriggled around upon his stool and stared awhile at the kettle which was beginning to bubble then he would glance at the stern and wrinkled features of the witch and wish he were any place but in that dim and smoky kitchen where even the shadows cast by the candle upon the wall were enough to give one the horrors so an hour passed away during which the silence was only broken by the bubbling of the pot and the hissing of the flames  finally tip spoke again  have i got to drink that stuff he asked nodding toward the pot  yes said mombi  whatll it do to me asked tip  if its properly made replied mombi it will change or transform you into a marble statue  tip groaned and wiped the perspiration from his forehead with his sleeve    26  i dont want to be a marble statue he protested  that doesnt matter i want you to be one said the old woman looking at him severely  what usell i be then asked tip there wont be any one to work for you  ill make the pumpkinhead work for me said mombi  again tip groaned  why dont you change me into a goat or a chicken he asked anxiously you cant do anything with a marble statue  oh yes i can returned mombi im going to plant a flower garden next spring and ill put you in the middle of it for an ornament i wonder i havent thought of that before youve been a bother to me for years  at this terrible speech tip felt the beads of perspiration starting all over his body but he sat still and shivered and looked anxiously at the kettle  perhaps it wont work he mutttered in a voice that sounded weak and discouraged  oh i think it will answered mombi cheerfully i seldom make a mistake  again there was a period of silence a silence so long and gloomy that when mombi finally lifted the kettle from the fire it was close to midnight    27               full page lineart drawing                 i dont want to be a marble statue    28  you cannot drink it until it has become quite cold announced the old witch for in spite of the law she had acknowledged practising witchcraft we must both go to bed now and at daybreak i will call you and at once complete your transformation into a marble statue  with this she hobbled into her room bearing the steaming kettle with her and tip heard her close and lock the door  the boy did not go to bed as he had been commanded to do but still sat glaring at the embers of the dying fire                 lineart drawing    29               the flight of the fugitives   tip reflected  its a hard thing to be a marble statue he thought rebelliously and im not going to stand it for years ive been a bother to her she says so shes going to get rid of me well theres an easier way than to become a statue no boy could have any fun forever standing in the middle of a flower garden ill run away thats what ill doand i may as well go before she makes me drink that nasty stuff in the kettle he waited until the snores of the old witch announced she was fast asleep and then he arose softly and went to the cupboard to find something to eat    30  no use starting on a journey without food he decided searching upon the narrow shelves  he found some crusts of bread but he had to look into mombis basket to find the cheese she had brought from the village while turning over the contents of the basket he came upon the pepperbox which contained the powder of life  i may as well take this with me he thought or mombill be using it to make more mischief with so he put the box in his pocket together with the bread and cheese  then he cautiously left the house and latched the door behind him outside both moon and stars shone brightly and the night seemed peaceful and inviting after the close and illsmelling kitchen  ill be glad to get away said tip softly for i never did like that old woman i wonder how i ever came to live with her  he was walking slowly toward the road when a thought made him pause  i dont like to leave jack pumpkinhead to the tender mercies of old mombi he muttered and jack belongs to me for i made him even if the old witch did bring him to life  he retraced his steps to the cowstable and opened the door of the stall where the pumpkin    31               full page lineart drawing                 tip led him along the path    32 headed man had been left  jack was standing in the middle of the stall and by the moonlight tip could see he was smiling just as jovially as ever  come on said the boy beckoning  where to asked jack  youll know as soon as i do answered tip smiling sympathetically into the pumpkin face  all weve got to do now is to tramp  very well returned jack and walked awkwardly out of the stable and into the moonlight  tip turned toward the road and the man followed him jack walked with a sort of limp and occasionally one of the joints of his legs would turn backward instead of frontwise almost causing him to tumble but the pumpkinhead was quick to notice this and began to take more pains to step carefully so that he met with few accidents  tip led him along the path without stopping an instant they could not go very fast but they walked steadily and by the time the moon sank away and the sun peeped over the hills they had travelled so great a distance that the boy had no reason to fear pursuit from the old witch moreover he had turned first into one path and then into another so that should anyone follow them it    33 would prove very difficult to guess which way they had gone or where to seek them  fairly satisfied that he had escapedfor a time at leastbeing turned into a marble statue the boy stopped his companion and seated himself upon a rock by the roadside  lets have some breakfast he said  jack pumpkinhead watched tip curiously but refused to join in the repast i dont seem to be made the same way you are he said  i know you are not returned tip for i made you  oh did you asked jack  certainly and put you together and carved your eyes and nose and ears and                 lineart drawing along the right side of the page    34  mouth said tip proudly and dressed you  jack looked at his body and limbs critically  it strikes me you made a very good job of it he remarked  just soso replied tip modestly for he began to see certain defects in the construction of his man if id known we were going to travel together i might have been a little more particular  why then said the pumpkinhead in a tone that expressed surprise you must be my creator my parent my father  or your inventor replied the boy with a laugh yes my son i really believe i am  then i owe you obedience continued the man and you owe mesupport  thats it exactly declared tip jumping up so let us be off  where are we going asked jack when they had resumed their journey  im not exactly sure said the boy but i believe we are headed south and that will bring us sooner or later to the emerald city  what city is that enquired the pumpkinhead  why its the center of the land of oz and the biggest town in all the country ive never been there myself but ive heard all about its    35 history it was built by a mighty and wonderful wizard named oz and everything there is of a green colorjust as everything in this country of the gillikins is of a purple color  is everything here purple asked jack  of course it is cant you see returned the boy  i believe i must be colorblind said the pumpkinhead after staring about him  well the grass is purple and the trees are purple and the houses and fences are purple explained tip even the mud in the roads is purple but in the emerald city everything is green that is purple here and in the country of the munchkins over at the east everything is blue and in the south country of the quadlings everything is red and in the west country of the winkies where the tin woodman rules everything is yellow  oh said jack then after a pause he asked did you say a tin woodman rules the winkies  yes he was one of those who helped dorothy to destroy the wicked witch of the west and the winkies were so grateful that they invited him to become their rulerjust as the people of the emerald city invited the scarecrow to rule them  dear me said jack im getting confused with all this history who is the scarecrow    36  another friend of dorothys replied tip  and who is dorothy  she was a girl that came here from kansas a place in the big outside world she got blown to the land of oz by a cyclone and while she was here the scarecrow and the tin woodman accompanied her on her travels  and where is she now inquired the pumpkinhead  glinda the good who rules the quadlings sent her home again said the boy  oh and what became of the scarecrow  i told you he rules the emerald city answered tip  i thought you said it was ruled by a wonderful wizard objected jack seeming more and more confused  well so i did now pay attention and ill explain it said tip speaking slowly and looking the smiling pumpkinhead squarely in the eye dorothy went to the emerald city to ask the wizard to send her back to kansas and the scarecrow and the tin woodman went with her but the wizard couldnt send her back because he wasnt so much of a wizard as he might have been and then they got angry at the wizard and threatened    37 to expose him so the wizard made a big balloon and escaped in it and no one has ever seen him since  now that is very interesting history said jack well pleased and i understand it perfectly all but the explanation  im glad you do responded tip after the wizard was gone the people of the emerald city made his majesty the scarecrow their king and i have heard that he became a very popular ruler  are we going to see this queer king asked jack with interest  i think we may as well replied the boy unless you have something better to do  oh no dear father said the pumpkinhead i am quite willing to go wherever you please                 lineart drawing    38               full page lineart drawing    39               tip makes an experiment in magic   the boy small and rather delicate in appearance seemed somewhat embarrassed at being called father by the tall awkward pumpkinheaded man but to deny the relationship would involve another long and tedious explanation so he changed the subject by asking abruptly  are you tired  of course not replied the other but he continued after a pause it is quite certain i shall  wear out my wooden joints if i keep on walking  tip reflected as they journeyed on that this was true he began to regret that he had not constructed the wooden limbs more carefully and substantially yet how could he ever have guessed    40 that the man he had made merely to scare old mombi with would be brought to life by means of a magical powder contained in an old pepperbox  so he ceased to reproach himself and began to think how he might yet remedy the deficiencies of jacks weak joints  while thus engaged they came to the edge of a wood and the boy sat down to rest upon an old sawhorse that some woodcutter had left there  why dont you sit down he asked the pumpkinhead  wont it strain my joints inquired the other  of course not itll rest them declared the boy  so jack tried to sit down but as soon as he bent his joints farther than usual they gave way altogether and he came clattering to the ground with such a crash that tip feared he was entirely ruined                 lineart drawing along right side of this page    41  he rushed to the man lifted him to his feet straightened his arms and legs and felt of his head to see if by chance it had become cracked but jack seemed to be in pretty good shape after all and tip said to him  i guess youd better remain standing hereafter it seems the safest way  very well dear father just as you say replied the smiling jack who had been in no wise confused by his tumble  tip sat down again presently the pumpkinhead asked  what is that thing you are sitting on  oh this is a horse replied the boy carelessly  what is a horse demanded jack  a horse why there are two kinds of horses returned tip slightly puzzled how to explain one kind of horse is alive and has four legs and a head and a tail and people ride upon its back  i understand said jack cheerfully thats the kind of horse you are now sitting on  no it isnt answered tip promptly  why not that one has four legs and a head and a tail tip looked at the sawhorse more carefully and found that the pumpkinhead was right the body    42 had been formed from a treetrunk and a branch had been left sticking up at one end that looked very much like a tail in the other end were two big knots that resembled eyes and a place had been chopped away that might easily be mistaken for the horses mouth as for the legs they were four straight limbs cut from trees and stuck fast into the body being spread wide apart so that the sawhorse would stand firmly when a log was laid across it to be sawed  this thing resembles a real horse more than i imagined said tip trying to explain but a real horse is alive and trots and prances and eats oats while this is nothing more than a dead horse made of wood and used to saw logs upon  if it were alive wouldnt it trot and prance and eat oats inquired the pumpkinhead  it would trot and prance perhaps but it wouldnt eat oats replied the boy laughing at the idea and of course it cant ever be alive because it is made of wood  so am i answered the man  tip looked at him in surprise  why so you are he exclaimed and the magic powder that brought you to life is here in my pocket    43               full page lineart drawing                 the magical powder of life    44  he brought out the pepper box and eyed it curiously  i wonder said he musingly if it would bring the sawhorse to life  if it would returned jack calmly for nothing seemed to surprise him i could ride on its back and that would save my joints from wearing out  ill try it cried the boy jumping up but i wonder if i can remember the words old mombi said and the way she held her hands up  he thought it over for a minute and as he had watched carefully from the hedge every motion of the old witch and listened to her words he believed he could repeat exactly what she had said and done  so he began by sprinkling some of the magic powder of life from the pepper box upon the body of the sawhorse then he lifted his left hand with the little finger pointing upward and said weaugh  what does that mean dear father asked jack curiously  i dont know answered tip then he lifted his right hand with the thumb pointing upward and said teaugh  whats that dear father inquired jack    45  it means you must keep quiet replied the boy provoked at being interrupted at so important a moment  how fast i am learning remarked the pumpkinhead with his eternal smile  tip now lifted both hands above his head with all the fingers and thumbs spread out and cried in a loud voice peaugh  immediately the sawhorse moved stretched its legs yawned with its choppedout mouth and shook a few grains of the powder off its back the rest of the powder seemed to have vanished into the body of the horse  good called jack while the boy looked on in astonishment you are a very clever sorcerer dear father                 lineart drawing    46               full page lineart drawing    47               the awakening of the sawhorse   the sawhorse finding himself alive seemed even more astonished than tip he rolled his knotty eyes from side to side taking a first wondering view of the world in which he had now so important an existence then he tried to look at himself but he had indeed no neck to turn so that in the endeavor to see his body he kept circling around and around without catching even a glimpse of it his legs were stiff and awkward for there were no kneejoints in them so that presently he bumped against jack pumpkinhead and sent that personage tumbling upon the moss that lined the roadside    48  tip became alarmed at this accident as well as at the persistence of the sawhorse in prancing around in a circle so he called out  whoa whoa there  the sawhorse paid no attention whatever to this command and the next instant brought one of his wooden legs down upon tips foot so forcibly that the boy danced away in pain to a safer distance from where he again yelled  whoa whoa i say  jack had now managed to raise himself to a sitting position and he looked at the sawhorse with much interest  i dont believe the animal can hear you he remarked  i shout loud enough dont i answered tip angrily  yes but the horse has no ears said the smiling pumpkinhead  sure enough exclaimed tip noting the fact for the first time how then am i going to stop him  but at that instant the sawhorse stopped himself having concluded it was impossible to see his own body he saw tip however and came close to the boy to observe him more fully    49  it was really comical to see the creature walk for it moved the legs on its right side together and those on its left side together as a pacing horse does and that made its body rock sidewise like a cradle  tip patted it upon the head and said good boy good boy in a coaxing tone and the sawhorse pranced away to examine with its bulging eyes the form of jack pumpkinhead  i must find a halter for him said tip and having made a search in his pocket he produced a roll of strong cord unwinding this he approached the sawhorse and tied the cord around its neck afterward fastening the other end to a large tree the sawhorse not understanding the action stepped backward and snapped the string easily but it made no attempt to run away  hes stronger than i thought said the boy and rather obstinate too  why dont you make him some ears asked jack then you can tell him what to do  thats a splendid idea said tip how did you happen to think of it  why i didnt think of it answered the pumpkinhead i didnt need to for its the simplest and easiest thing to do    50  so tip got out his knife and fashioned some ears out of the bark of a small tree  i mustnt make them too big he said as he whittled or our horse would become a donkey  how is that inquired jack from the roadside  why a horse has bigger ears than a man and a donkey has bigger ears than a horse explained tip  then if my ears were longer would i be a horse asked jack  my friend said tip gravely youll never be anything but a pumpkinhead no matter how big your ears are  oh returned jack nodding i think i understand  if you do youre a wonder remarked the boy  but theres no harm in thinking you understand i guess these ears are ready now will you hold the horse while i stick them on  certainly if youll help me up said jack  so tip raised him to his feet and the pumpkinhead went to the horse and held its head while the boy bored two holes in it with his knifeblade and inserted the ears  they make him look very handsome said jack admiringly    51  but those words spoken close to the sawhorse and being the first sounds he had ever heard so startled the animal that he made a bound forward and tumbled tip on one side and jack on the other then he continued to rush forward as if frightened by the clatter of his own footsteps  whoa shouted tip picking himself up whoa you idiot whoa the saw horse would probably have paid no attention to this but just then it stepped a leg into a gopherhole and stumbled headoverheels to the ground where it lay upon its back frantically waving its four legs in the air  tip ran up to it  youre a nice sort of a horse i must say he exclaimed why didnt you stop when i yelled whoa  does whoa mean to stop asked the sawhorse in a surprised voice as it rolled its eyes upward to look at the boy  of course it does answered tip  and a hole in the ground means to stop also doesnt it continued the horse  to be sure unless you step over it said tip  what a strange place this is the creature exclaimed as if amazed what am i doing here anyway    52               full page lineart drawing                 do keep those legs still    53  why ive brought you to life answered the boy but it wont hurt you any if you mind me and do as i tell you  then i will do as you tell me replied the sawhorse humbly but what happened to me a moment ago i dont seem to be just right someway  youre upside down explained tip but just keep those legs still a minute and ill set you right side up again  how many sides have i asked the creature wonderingly  several said tip briefly but do keep those legs still  the sawhorse now became quiet and held its legs rigid so that tip after several efforts was able to roll him over and set him upright  ah i seem all right now said the queer animal with a sigh  one of your ears is broken tip announced after a careful examination ill have to make a new one  then he led the sawhorse back to where jack was vainly struggling to regain his feet and after assisting the pumpkinhead to stand upright tip whittled out a new ear and fastened it to the horses head    54  now said he addressing his steed pay attention to what im going to tell you whoa means to stop getup means to walk forward trot means to go as fast as you can understand  i believe i do returned the horse  very good we are all going on a journey to the emerald city to see his majesty the scarecrow and jack pumpkinhead is going to ride on your back so he wont wear out his joints  i dont mind said the sawhorse anything that suits you suits me  then tip assisted jack to get upon the horse  hold on tight he cautioned or you may fall off and crack your pumpkin head  that would be horrible said jack with a shudder what shall i hold on to  why hold on to his ears replied tip after a moments hesitation  dont do that remonstrated the sawhorse for then i cant hear  that seemed reasonable so tip tried to think of something else  ill fix it said he at length he went into the wood and cut a short length of limb from a young stout tree one end of this he sharpened to a point and then he dug a hole in the back of    55               full page lineart drawing                 does it hurt asked the boy    56 the sawhorse just behind its head next he brought a piece of rock from the road and hammered the post firmly into the animals back  stop stop shouted the horse youre jarring me terribly  does it hurt asked the boy  not exactly hurt answered the animal but it makes me quite nervous to be jarred  well its all over now said tip encouragingly now jack be sure to hold fast to this post and then you cant fall off and get smashed  so jack held on tight and tip said to the horse  get up  the obedient creature at once walked forward rocking from side to side as he raised his feet from the ground  tip walked beside the sawhorse quite content with this addition to their party presently he began to whistle  what does that sound mean asked the horse  dont pay any attention to it said tip im just whistling and that only means im pretty well satisfied  id whistle myself if i could push my lips together remarked jack i fear dear father that in some respects i am sadly lacking    57  after journeying on for some distance the narrow path they were following turned into a broad roadway paved with yellow brick by the side of the road tip noticed a signpost that read               nine miles to the emerald city   but it was now growing dark so he decided to camp for the night by the roadside and to resume the journey next morning by daybreak he led the saw horse to a grassy mound upon which grew several bushy trees and carefully assisted the pumpkinhead to alight  i think ill lay you upon the ground overnight said the boy you will be safer that way  how about me asked the sawhorse  it wont hurt you to stand replied tip and as you cant sleep you may as well watch out and see that no one comes near to disturb us  then the boy stretched himself upon the grass beside the pumpkinhead and being greatly wearied by the journey was soon fast asleep                 lineart drawing    58               full page lineart drawing    59               jack pumpkinheads ride to the emerald city   at daybreak tip was awakened by the pumpkinhead he rubbed the sleep from his eyes bathed in a little brook and then ate a portion of his bread and cheese having thus prepared for a new day the boy said  let us start at once nine miles is quite a distance but we ought to reach the emerald city by noon if no accidents happen so the pumpkinhead was again perched upon the back of the sawhorse and the journey was resumed  tip noticed that the purple tint of the grass and trees had now faded to a dull lavender and before long this lavender appeared to take on a greenish tinge that gradually brightened as they drew nearer to the great city where the scarecrow ruled    60  the little party had traveled but a short two miles upon their way when the road of yellow brick was parted by a broad and swift river tip was puzzled how to cross over but after a time he discovered a man in a ferryboat approaching from the other side of the stream  when the man reached the bank tip asked  will you row us to the other side  yes if you have money returned the ferryman whose face looked cross and disagreeable  but i have no money said tip  none at all inquired the man  none at all answered the boy  then ill not break my back rowing you over said the ferryman decidedly  what a nice man remarked the pumpkinhead smilingly  the ferryman stared at him but made no reply tip was trying to think for it was a great disappointment to him to find his journey so suddenly brought to an end  i must certainly get to the emerald city he said to the boatman but how can i cross the river if you do not take me  the man laughed and it was not a nice laugh  that wooden horse will float said he and    61               lineart drawing  you can ride him across as for the pumpkinheaded loon who accompanies you let him sink or swim it wont matter greatly which  dont worry about me said jack smiling pleasantly upon the crabbed ferryman im sure i ought to float beautifully  tip thought the experiment was worth making and the sawhorse who did not know what danger meant offered no objections whatever so the boy led it down into the water and climbed upon its back jack also waded in up to his knees and    62 grasped the tail of the horse so that he might keep his pumpkin head above the water  now said tip instructing the sawhorse if you wiggle your legs you will probably swim and if you swim we shall probably reach the other side  the sawhorse at once began to wiggle its legs which acted as oars and moved the adventurers slowly across the river to the opposite side so successful was the trip that presently they were climbing wet and dripping up the grassy bank  tips trouserlegs and shoes were thoroughly soaked but the sawhorse had floated so perfectly that from his knees up the boy was entirely dry as for the pumpkinhead every stitch of his gorgeous clothing dripped water  the sun will soon dry us said tip and anyhow we are now safely across in spite of the ferryman and can continue our journey  i didnt mind swimming at all remarked the horse  nor did i added jack  they soon regained the road of yellow brick which proved to be a continuation of the road they had left on the other side and then tip once more mounted the pumpkinhead upon the back of the sawhorse    63  if you ride fast said he the wind will help to dry your clothing i will hold on to the horses tail and run after you in this way we all will become dry in a very short time  then the horse must step lively said jack  ill do my best returned the sawhorse cheerfully  tip grasped the end of the branch that served as tail to the sawhorse and called loudly getup  the horse started at a good pace and tip followed behind then he decided they could go faster so he shouted trot  now the sawhorse remembered that this word was the command to go as fast as he could so he began rocking along the road at a tremendous pace                 lineart drawing    64 and tip had hard workrunning faster than he ever had before in his lifeto keep his feet  soon he was out of breath and although he wanted to call whoa to the horse he found he could not get the word out of his throat then the end of the tail he was clutching being nothing more than a dead branch suddenly broke away and the next minute the boy was rolling in the dust of the road while the horse and its pumpkinheaded rider dashed on and quickly disappeared in the distance  by the time tip had picked himself up and cleared the dust from his throat so he could say whoa there was no further need of saying it for the horse was long since out of sight  so he did the only sensible thing he could do he sat down and took a good rest and afterward began walking along the road  some time i will surely overtake them he reflected for the road will end at the gates of the emerald city and they can go no further than that  meantime jack was holding fast to the post and the sawhorse was tearing along the road like a racer neither of them knew tip was left behind for the pumpkinhead did not look around and the sawhorse couldnt  as he rode jack noticed that the grass and trees    65 had become a bright emeraldgreen in color so he guessed they were nearing the emerald city even before the tall spires and domes came into sight  at length a high wall of green stone studded thick with emeralds loomed up before them and fearing the sawhorse would not know enough to stop and so might smash them both against this wall jack ventured to cry whoa as loud as he could  so suddenly did the horse obey that had it not been for his post jack would have been pitched off head foremost and his beautiful face ruined  that was a fast ride dear father he exclaimed and then hearing no reply he turned around and discovered for the first time that tip was not there  this apparent desertion puzzled the pumpkinhead and made him uneasy and while he was wondering what had become of the boy and what he ought to do next under such trying circumstances the gateway in the green wall opened and a man came out  this man was short and round with a fat face that seemed remarkably good natured he was clothed all in green and wore a high peaked green hat upon his head and green spectacles over his eyes bowing before the pumpkinhead he said  i am the guardian of the gates of the emerald    66 city may i inquire who you are and what is your business  my name is jack pumpkinhead returned the other smilingly but as to my business i havent the least idea in the world what it is  the guardian of the gates looked surprised and shook his head as if dissatisfied with the reply  what are you a man or a pumpkin he asked politely  both if you please answered jack  and this wooden horseis it alive questioned the guardian  the horse rolled one knotty eye upward and winked at jack then it gave a prance and brought one leg down on the guardians toes  ouch cried the man im sorry i asked that question but the answer is most convincing have you any errand sir in the emerald city  it seems to me that i have replied the pumpkinhead seriously but i cannot think what it is my father knows all about it but he is not here  this is a strange affair very strange declared the guardian but you seem harmless folks do not smile so delightfully when they mean mischief  as for that said jack i cannot help my smile for it is carved on my face with a jackknife    67  well come with me into my room resumed the guardian and i will see what can be done for you  so jack rode the sawhorse through the gateway into a little room built into the wall the guardian pulled a bellcord and presently a very tall soldierclothed in a green uniformentered from the opposite door this soldier carried a long green gun over his shoulder and had lovely green whiskers that fell quite to his knees the guardian at once addressed him saying  here is a strange gentleman who doesnt know why he has come to the emerald city or what he wants tell me what shall we do with him  the soldier with the green whiskers looked at jack with much care and curiosity finally he shook his head so positively that little waves rippled down his whiskers and then he said  i must take him to his majesty the scarecrow  but what will his majesty the scarecrow do with him asked the guardian of the gates  that is his majestys business returned the soldier i have troubles enough of my own all outside troubles must be turned over to his majesty so put the spectacles on this fellow and ill take him to the royal palace    68  so the guardian opened a big box of spectacles and tried to fit a pair to jacks great round eyes  i havent a pair in stock that will really cover those eyes up said the little man with a sigh and your head is so big that i shall be obliged to tie the spectacles on  but why need i wear spectacles asked jack  its the fashion here said the soldier and they will keep you from being blinded by the glitter and glare of the gorgeous emerald city  oh exclaimed jack tie them on by all means i dont wish to be blinded  nor i broke in the sawhorse so a pair of green spectacles was quickly fastened over the bulging knots that served it for eyes  then the soldier with the green whiskers led them through the inner gate and they at once found themselves in the main street of the magnificent emerald city  sparkling green gems ornamented the fronts of the beautiful houses and the towers and turrets were all faced with emeralds even the green marble pavement glittered with precious stones and it was indeed a grand and marvelous sight to one who beheld it for the first time  however the pumpkinhead and the sawhorse    69 knowing nothing of wealth and beauty paid little attention to the wonderful sights they saw through their green spectacles they calmly followed after the green soldier and scarcely noticed the crowds of green people who stared at them in surprise when a green dog ran out and barked at them the saw horse promptly kicked at it with its wooden leg and sent the little animal howling into one of the houses but nothing more serious than this happened to interrupt their progress to the royal palace  the pumpkinhead wanted to ride up the green marble steps and straight into the scarecrows presence but the soldier would not permit that so jack dismounted with much difficulty and a servant led the sawhorse around to the rear while the soldier with the green whiskers escorted the pumpkinhead into the palace by the front entrance  the stranger was left in a handsomely furnished waiting room while the soldier went to announce him it so happened that at this hour his majesty was at leisure and greatly bored for want of something to do so he ordered his visitor to be shown at once into his throne room  jack felt no fear or embarrassment at meeting the ruler of this magnificent city for he was entirely ignorant of all worldly customs but when he en    70 tered the room and saw for the first time his majesty the scarecrow seated upon his glittering throne he stopped short in amazement                      lineart drawing    71               his majesty the scarecrow   i suppose every reader of this book knows what a scarecrow is but jack pumpkinhead never having seen such a creation was more surprised at meeting the remarkable king of the emerald city than by any other one experience of his brief life  his majesty the scarecrow was dressed in a suit of faded blue clothes and his head was merely a small sack stuffed with straw upon which eyes ears a nose and a mouth had been rudely painted to represent a face the clothes were also stuffed with straw and that so unevenly or carelessly that his majestys legs and arms seemed more bumpy than was necessary upon his hands were gloves with long fingers and these were padded with cotton wisps of straw stuck out from the monarchs    72 coat and also from his neck and boottops upon his head he wore a heavy golden crown set thick with sparkling jewels and the weight of this crown caused his brow to sag in wrinkles giving a thoughtful expression to the painted face indeed the crown alone betokened majesty in all else the scarecrow king was but a simple scarecrowflimsy awkward and unsubstantial  but if the strange appearance of his majesty the scarecrow seemed startling to jack no less wonderful was the form of the pumpkinhead to the scarecrow the purple trousers and pink waistcoat and red shirt hung loosely over the wooden joints tip had manufactured and the carved face on the pumpkin grinned perpetually as if its wearer considered life the jolliest thing imaginable  at first indeed his majesty thought his queer visitor was laughing at him and was inclined to resent such a liberty but it was not without reason that the scarecrow had attained the reputation of being the wisest personage in the land of oz he made a more careful examination of his visitor and soon discovered that jacks features were carved into a smile and that he could not look grave if he wished to  the king was the first to speak after regarding    73               lineart drawing  jack for some minutes he said in a tone of wonder  where on earth did you come from and how do you happen to be alive  i beg your majestys pardon returned the pumpkinhead but i do not understand you    74  what dont you understand asked the scarecrow  why i dont understand your language you see i came from the country of the gillikins so that i am a foreigner  ah to be sure exclaimed the scarecrow i myself speak the language of the munchkins which is also the language of the emerald city but you i suppose speak the language of the pumpkinheads  exactly so your majesty replied the other bowing so it will be impossible for us to understand one another  that is unfortunate certainly said the scarecrow thoughtfully we must have an interpreter  what is an interpreter asked jack  a person who understands both my language and your own when i say anything the interpreter can tell you what i mean and when you say anything the interpreter can tell me what you mean for the interpreter can speak both languages as well as understand them  that is certainly clever said jack greatly pleased at finding so simple a way out of the difficulty  so the scarecrow commanded the soldier with the green whiskers to search among his people    75 until he found one who understood the language of the gillikins as well as the language of the emerald city and to bring that person to him at once  when the soldier had departed the scarecrow said  wont you take a chair while we are waiting  your majesty forgets that i cannot understand you replied the pumpkinhead if you wish me to sit down you must make a sign for me to do so the scarecrow came down from his throne and rolled an armchair to a position behind the pumpkinhead then he gave jack a sudden push that sent him sprawling upon the cushions in so awkward a fashion that he doubled up like a jackknife and had hard work to untangle himself  did you understand that sign asked his majesty politely  perfectly declared jack reaching up his arms to turn his head to the front the pumpkin having twisted around upon the stick that supported it  you seem hastily made remarked the scarecrow watching jacks efforts to straighten himself  not more so than your majesty was the frank reply  there is this difference between us said the scarecrow that whereas i will bend but not break you will break but not bend    76               full page lineart drawing                 he gave jack a sudden push    77  at this moment the soldier returned leading a young girl by the hand she seemed very sweet and modest having a pretty face and beautiful green eyes and hair a dainty green silk skirt reached to her knees showing silk stockings embroidered with peapods and green satin slippers with bunches of lettuce for decorations instead of bows or buckles upon her silken waist clover leaves were embroidered and she wore a jaunty little jacket trimmed with sparkling emeralds of a uniform size  why its little jellia jamb exclaimed the scarecrow as the green maiden bowed her pretty head before him do you understand the language of the gillikins my dear  yes your majesty she answered for i was born in the north country  then you shall be our interpreter said the scarecrow and explain to this pumpkinhead all that i say and also explain to me all that he says is this arrangement satisfactory he asked turning toward his guest  very satisfactory indeed was the reply  then ask him to begin with resumed the scarecrow turning to jellia what brought him to the emerald city  but instead of this the girl who had been staring at jack said to him    78  you are certainly a wonderful creature who made you  a boy named tip answered jack  what does he say inquired the scarecrow my ears must have deceived me what did he say  he says that your majestys brains seem to have come loose replied the girl demurely  the scarecrow moved uneasily upon his throne and felt of his head with his left hand  what a fine thing it is to understand two different languages he said with a perplexed sigh ask him my dear if he has any objection to being put in jail for insulting the ruler of the emerald city  i didnt insult you protested jack indignantly  tuttut cautioned the scarecrow wait until jellia translates my speech what have we got an interpreter for if you break out in this rash way  all right ill wait replied the pumpkinhead in a surly tonealthough his face smiled as genially as ever translate the speech young woman  his majesty inquires if you are hungry said jellia  oh not at all answered jack more pleasantly for it is impossible for me to eat  its the same way with me remarked the scarecrow what did he say jellia my dear    79  he asked if you were aware that one of your eyes is painted larger than the other said the girl mischievously  dont you believe her your majesty cried jack  oh i dont answered the scarecrow calmly then casting a sharp look at the girl he asked  are you quite certain you understand the languages of both the gillikins and the munchkins  quite certain your majesty said jellia jamb trying hard not to laugh in the face of royalty  then how is it that i seem to understand them myself inquired the scarecrow  because they are one and the same declared the girl now laughing merrily does not your majesty know that in all the land of oz but one language is spoken  is it indeed so cried the scarecrow much relieved to hear this then i might easily have been my own interpreter  it was all my fault your majesty said jack looking rather foolish i thought we must surely speak different languages since we came from different countries  this should be a warning to you never to think returned the scarecrow severely for    80 unless one can think wisely it is better to remain a dummywhich you most certainly are  i ami surely am agreed the pumpkinhead  it seems to me continued the scarecrow more mildly that your manufacturer spoiled some good pies to create an indifferent man  i assure your majesty that i did not ask to be created answered jack  ah it was the same in my case said the king pleasantly and so as we differ from all ordinary people let us become friends  with all my heart exclaimed jack  what have you a heart asked the scarecrow surprised  no that was only imaginativei might say a figure of speech said the other  well your most prominent figure seems to be a figure of wood so i must beg you to restrain an imagination which having no brains you have no right to exercise suggested the scarecrow warningly  to be sure said jack without in the least comprehending  his majesty then dismissed jellia jamb and the soldier with the green whiskers and when they were gone he took his new friend by the arm and led him into the courtyard to play a game of quoits    81               full page lineart drawing    82               full page lineart drawing    83               gen jinjurs army of revolt   tip was so anxious to rejoin his man jack and the sawhorse that he walked a full half the distance to the emerald city without stopping to rest then he discovered that he was hungry and the crackers and cheese he had provided for the journey had all been eaten  while wondering what he should do in this emergency he came upon a girl sitting by the roadside she wore a costume that struck the boy as being remarkably brilliant her silken waist being of emerald green and her skirt of four distinct colorsblue in front yellow at the left side red at the back and purple at the right side fastening    84 the waist in front were four buttonsthe top one blue the next yellow a third red and the last purple                  lineart drawing    the splendor of this dress was almost barbaric so tip was fully justified in staring at the gown for some moments before his eyes were attracted by the    85 pretty face above it yes the face was pretty enough he decided but it wore an expression of discontent coupled to a shade of defiance or audacity  while the boy stared the girl looked upon him calmly a lunch basket stood beside her and she held a dainty sandwich in one hand and a hardboiled egg in the other eating with an evident appetite that aroused tips sympathy  he was just about to ask a share of the luncheon when the girl stood up and brushed the crumbs from her lap  there said she it is time for me to go carry that basket for me and help yourself to its contents if you are hungry  tip seized the basket eagerly and began to eat following for a time the strange girl without bothering to ask questions she walked along before him with swift strides and there was about her an air of decision and importance that led him to suspect she was some great personage  finally when he had satisfied his hunger he ran up beside her and tried to keep pace with her swift footstepsa very difficult feat for she was much taller than he and evidently in a hurry  thank you very much for the sandwiches said tip as he trotted along may i ask your name    86  i am general jinjur was the brief reply  oh said the boy surprised what sort of a general  i command the army of revolt in this war answered the general with unnecessary sharpness  oh he again exclaimed i didnt know there was a war  you were not supposed to know it she returned for we have kept it a secret and considering that our army is composed entirely of girls she added with some pride it is surely a remarkable thing that our revolt is not yet discovered  it is indeed acknowledged tip but where is your army  about a mile from here said general jinjur the forces have assembled from all parts of the land of oz at my express command for this is the day we are to conquer his majesty the scarecrow and wrest from him the throne the army of revolt only awaits my coming to march upon the emerald city  well declared tip drawing a long breath this is certainly a surprising thing may i ask why you wish to conquer his majesty the scarecrow  because the emerald city has been ruled by men long enough for one reason said the girl    87 moreover the city glitters with beautiful gems which might far better be used for rings bracelets and necklaces and there is enough money in the kings treasury to buy every girl in our army a dozen new gowns so we intend to conquer the city and run the government to suit ourselves  jinjur spoke these words with an eagerness and decision that proved she was in earnest  but war is a terrible thing said tip thoughtfully  this war will be pleasant replied the girl cheerfully  many of you will be slain continued the boy in an awed voice  oh no said jinjur what man would oppose a girl or dare to harm her and there is not an ugly face in my entire army  tip laughed  perhaps you are right said he but the guardian of the gate is considered a faithful guardian and the kings army will not let the city be conquered without a struggle  the army is old and feeble replied general jinjur scornfully his strength has all been used to grow whiskers and his wife has such a temper that she has already pulled more than half of them    88 out by the roots when the wonderful wizard reigned the soldier with the green whiskers was a very good royal army for people feared the wizard but no one is afraid of the scarecrow so his royal army dont count for much in time of war  after this conversation they proceeded some distance in silence and before long reached a large clearing in the forest where fully four hundred young women were assembled these were laughing and talking together as gaily as if they had gathered for a picnic instead of a war of conquest  they were divided into four companies and tip noticed that all were dressed in costumes similar to that worn by general jinjur the only real difference was that while those girls from the munchkin country had the blue strip in front of their skirts those from the country of the quadlings had the red strip in front and those from the country of the winkies had the yellow strip in front and the gillikin girls wore the purple strip in front all had green waists representing the emerald city they intended to conquer and the top button on each waist indicated by its color which country the wearer came from the uniforms were jaunty and becoming and quite effective when massed together  tip thought this strange army bore no weapons    89 whatever but in this he was wrong for each girl had stuck through the knot of her back hair two long glittering knittingneedles  general jinjur immediately mounted the stump of a tree and addressed her army  friends fellowcitizens and girls she said we are about to begin our great revolt against the men of oz we march to conquer the emerald cityto dethrone the scarecrow kingto acquire thousands of gorgeous gemsto rifle the royal treasuryand to obtain power over our former oppressors  hurrah said those who had listened but tip thought most of the army was too much engaged in chattering to pay attention to the words of the general  the command to march was now given and the girls formed themselves into four bands or companies and set off with eager strides toward the emerald city                 lineart drawing on the right of this page    90               lineart drawing   the boy followed after them carrying several baskets and wraps and packages which various members of the army of revolt had placed in his care it was not long before they came to the green granite walls of the city and halted before the gateway    91  the guardian of the gate at once came out and looked at them curiously as if a circus had come to town he carried a bunch of keys swung round his neck by a golden chain his hands were thrust carelessly into his pockets and he seemed to have no idea at all that the city was threatened by rebels speaking pleasantly to the girls he said  good morning my dears what can i do for you                  lineart drawing    surrender instantly answered general jinjur standing before him and frowning as terribly as her pretty face would allow her to  surrender echoed the man astounded why its impossible its against the law i never heard of such a thing in my life    92  still you must surrender exclaimed the general fiercely we are revolting  you dont look it said the guardian gazing from one to another admiringly  but we are cried jinjur stamping her foot impatiently and we mean to conquer the emerald city  good gracious returned the surprised guardian of the gates what a nonsensical idea go home to your mothers my good girls and milk the cows and bake the bread dont you know its a dangerous thing to conquer a city  we are not afraid responded the general and she looked so determined that it made the guardian uneasy  so he rang the bell for the soldier with the green whiskers and the next minute was sorry he had done so for immediately he was surrounded by a crowd of girls who drew the knittingneedles from their hair and began jabbing them at the guardian with the sharp points dangerously near his fat cheeks and blinking eyes  the poor man howled loudly for mercy and made no resistance when jinjur drew the bunch of keys from around his neck  followed by her army the general now rushed    93               full page lineart drawing                 general jinjur and her army capture the city    94 to the gateway where she was confronted by the royal army of ozwhich was the other name for the soldier with the green whiskers  halt he cried and pointed his long gun full in the face of the leader  some of the girls screamed and ran back but general jinjur bravely stood her ground and said reproachfully  why how now would you shoot a poor defenceless girl  no replied the soldier for my gun isnt loaded  not loaded  no for fear of accidents and ive forgotten where i hid the powder and shot to load it with but if youll wait a short time ill try to hunt them up  dont trouble yourself said jinjur cheerfully then she turned to her army and cried  girls the gun isnt loaded  hooray shrieked the rebels delighted at this good news and they proceeded to rush upon the soldier with the green whiskers in such a crowd that it was a wonder they didnt stick the knittingneedles into one another  but the royal army of oz was too much afraid    95 of women to meet the onslaught he simply turned about and ran with all his might through the gate and toward the royal palace while general jinjur and her mob flocked into the unprotected city  in this way was the emerald city captured without a drop of blood being spilled the army of revolt had become an army of conquerors                  lineart drawing    96               full page lineart drawing    97               the scarecrow plans an escape   tip slipped away from the girls and followed swiftly after the soldier with the green whiskers the invading army entered the city more slowly for they stopped to dig emeralds out of the walls and pavingstones with the points of their knittingneedles so the soldier and the boy reached the palace before the news had spread that the city was conquered  the scarecrow and jack pumpkinhead were still playing at quoits in the courtyard when the game was interrupted by the abrupt entrance of the royal army of oz who came flying in without his hat or gun his clothes in sad disarray and his long beard floating a yard behind him as he ran    98  tally one for me said the scarecrow calmly whats wrong my man he added addressing the soldier  oh your majestyyour majesty the city is conquered gasped the royal army who was all out of breath  this is quite sudden said the scarecrow but please go and bar all the doors and windows of the palace while i show this pumpkinhead how to throw a quoit  the soldier hastened to do this while tip who had arrived at his heels remained in the courtyard to look at the scarecrow with wondering eyes  his majesty continued to throw the quoits as coolly as if no danger threatened his throne but the pumpkinhead having caught sight of tip ambled toward the boy as fast as his wooden legs would go  good afternoon noble parent he cried delightedly im glad to see you are here that terrible sawhorse ran away with me  i suspected it said tip did you get hurt are you cracked at all  no i arrived safely answered jack and his majesty has been very kind indeed to me  at this moment the soldier with the green whiskers returned and the scarecrow asked    99  by the way who has conquered me  a regiment of girls gathered from the four corners of the land of oz replied the soldier still pale with fear  but where was my standing army at the time inquired his majesty looking at the soldier gravely  your standing army was running answered the fellow honestly for no man could face the terrible weapons of the invaders  well said the scarecrow after a moments thought i dont mind much the loss of my throne for its a tiresome job to rule over the emerald city and this crown is so heavy that it makes my head ache but i hope the conquerors have no intention of injuring me just because i happen to be the king  i heard them say remarked tip with some hesitation that they intend to make a rag carpet of your outside and stuff their sofacushions with your inside  then i am really in danger declared his majesty positively and it will be wise for me to consider a means to escape  where can you go asked jack pumpkinhead  why to my friend the tin woodman who    100               lineart drawing   rules over the winkies and calls himself their emperor was the answer i am sure he will protect me  tip was looking out the window  the palace is surrounded by the enemy said    101 he it is too late to escape they would soon tear you to pieces  the scarecrow sighed  in an emergency he announced it is always a good thing to pause and reflect please excuse me while i pause and reflect  but we also are in danger said the pumpkinhead anxiously if any of these girls understand cooking my end is not far off  nonsense exclaimed the scarecrow theyre too busy to cook even if they know how  but should i remain here a prisoner for any length of time protested jack im liable to spoil  ah then you would not be fit to associate with returned the scarecrow the matter is more serious than i suspected  you said the pumpkinhead gloomily are liable to live for many years my life is necessarily short so i must take advantage of the few days that remain to me  there there dont worry answered the scarecrow soothingly if youll keep quiet long enough for me to think ill try to find some way for us all to escape  so the others waited in patient silence while the scarecrow walked to a corner and stood with his    102 face to the wall for a good five minutes at the end of that time he faced them with a more cheerful expression upon his painted face  where is the sawhorse you rode here he asked the pumpkinhead  why i said he was a jewel and so your man locked him up in the royal treasury said jack  it was the only place i could think of your majesty added the soldier fearing he had made a blunder  it pleases me very much said the scarecrow has the animal been fed  oh yes i gave him a heaping peck of sawdust  excellent cried the scarecrow bring the horse here at once  the soldier hastened away and presently they heard the clattering of the horses wooden legs upon the pavement as he was led into the courtyard  his majesty regarded the steed critically he doesnt seem especially graceful he remarked musingly but i suppose he can run  he can indeed said tip gazing upon the sawhorse admiringly  then bearing us upon his back he must make a dash through the ranks of the rebels and carry us to my friend the tin woodman announced the scarecrow    103  he cant carry four objected tip  no but he may be induced to carry three said his majesty i shall therefore leave my royal army behind for from the ease with which he was conquered i have little confidence in his powers  still he can run declared tip laughing  i expected this blow said the soldier sulkily but i can bear it i shall disguise myself by cutting off my lovely green whiskers and after all it is no more dangerous to face those reckless girls than to ride this fiery untamed wooden horse  perhaps you are right observed his majesty but for my part not being a soldier i am fond of danger now my boy you must mount first and please sit as close to the horses neck as possible  tip climbed quickly to his place and the soldier and the scarecrow managed to hoist the pumpkinhead to a seat just behind him there remained so little space for the king that he was liable to fall off as soon as the horse started  fetch a clothesline said the king to his army and tie us all together then if one falls off we will all fall off  and while the soldier was gone for the clothesline his majesty continued it is well for me to be careful for my very existence is in danger    104  i have to be as careful as you do said jack  not exactly replied the scarecrow for if anything happened to me that would be the end of me but if anything happened to you they could use you for seed  the soldier now returned with a long line and tied all three firmly together also lashing them to the body of the sawhorse so there seemed little danger of their tumbling off  now throw open the gates commanded the scarecrow and we will make a dash to liberty or to death  the courtyard in which they were standing was located in the center of the great palace which surrounded it on all sides but in one place a passage led to an outer gateway which the soldier had barred by order of his sovereign it was through this gateway his majesty proposed to escape and the royal army now led the sawhorse along the passage and unbarred the gate which swung backward with a loud crash  now said tip to the horse you must save us all run as fast as you can for the gate of the city and dont let anything stop you  all right answered the sawhorse gruffly and dashed away so suddenly that tip had to gasp    105               full page lineart drawing                 we will make a dash to liberty or to death    106 for breath and hold firmly to the post he had driven into the creatures neck  several of the girls who stood outside guarding the palace were knocked over by the sawhorses mad rush others ran screaming out of the way and only one or two jabbed their knittingneedles frantically at the escaping prisoners tip got one small prick in his left arm which smarted for an hour afterward but the needles had no effect upon the scarecrow or jack pumpkinhead who never even suspected they were being prodded  as for the sawhorse he made a wonderful record upsetting a fruit cart overturning several meek looking men and finally bowling over the new guardian of the gatea fussy little fat woman appointed by general jinjur  nor did the impetuous charger stop then once outside the walls of the emerald city he dashed along the road to the west with fast and violent leaps that shook the breath out of the boy and filled the scarecrow with wonder  jack had ridden at this mad rate once before so he devoted every effort to holding with both hands his pumpkin head upon its stick enduring meantime the dreadful jolting with the courage of a philosopher    107               full page lineart drawing                 the wooden steed gave one final leap    108  slow him up slow him up shouted the scarecrow my straw is all shaking down into my legs  but tip had no breath to speak so the sawhorse continued his wild career unchecked and with unabated speed  presently they came to the banks of a wide river and without a pause the wooden steed gave one final leap and launched them all in midair  a second later they were rolling splashing and bobbing about in the water the horse struggling frantically to find a rest for its feet and its riders being first plunged beneath the rapid current and then floating upon the surface like corks                  lineart drawing    109               the journey to the tin woodman   tip was well soaked and dripping water from every angle of his body but he managed to lean forward and shout in the ear of the sawhorse  keep still you fool keep still  the horse at once ceased struggling and floated calmly upon the surface its wooden body being as buoyant as a raft  what does that word fool mean enquired the horse  it is a term of reproach answered tip somewhat ashamed of the expression i only use it when i am angry  then it pleases me to be able to call you a fool in return said the horse for i did not make    110 the river nor put it in our way so only a term of reproach is fit for one who becomes angry with me for falling into the water  that is quite evident replied tip so i will acknowledge myself in the wrong then he called out to the pumpkinhead are you all right jack  there was no reply so the boy called to the king are you all right your majesty  the scarecrow groaned  im all wrong somehow he said in a weak voice how very wet this water is  tip was bound so tightly by the cord that he could not turn his head to look at his companions so he said to the sawhorse  paddle with your legs toward the shore  the horse obeyed and although their progress was slow they finally reached the opposite river bank at a place where it was low enough to enable the creature to scramble upon dry land  with some difficulty the boy managed to get his knife out of his pocket and cut the cords that bound the riders to one another and to the wooden horse he heard the scarecrow fall to the ground with a mushy sound and then he himself quickly dismounted and looked at his friend jack  the wooden body with its gorgeous clothing    111 still sat upright upon the horses back but the pumpkin head was gone and only the sharpened stick that served for a neck was visible as for the scarecrow the straw in his body had shaken down with the jolting and packed itself into his legs and the lower part of his bodywhich appeared very plump and round while his upper half seemed like an empty sack upon his head the scarecrow still wore the heavy crown which had been sewed on to prevent his losing it but the head was now so damp and limp that the weight of the gold and jewels sagged forward and crushed the painted face into a mass of wrinkles that made him look exactly like a japanese pug dog  tip would have laughedhad he not been so anxious about his man jack but the scarecrow however damaged was all there while the pumpkin head that was so necessary to jacks existence was missing so the boy seized a long pole that fortunately lay near at hand and anxiously turned again toward the river  far out upon the waters he sighted the golden hue of the pumpkin which gently bobbed up and down with the motion of the waves at that moment it was quite out of tips reach but after a time it floated nearer and still nearer until the boy    112               full page lineart drawing                 tip rescues jacks pumpkin head    113 was able to reach it with his pole and draw it to the shore then he brought it to the top of the bank carefully wiped the water from its pumpkin face with his handkerchief and ran with it to jack and replaced the head upon the mans neck  dear me were jacks first words what a dreadful experience i wonder if water is liable to spoil pumpkins  tip did not think a reply was necessary for he knew that the scarecrow also stood in need of his help so he carefully removed the straw from the kings body and legs and spread it out in the sun to dry the wet clothing he hung over the body of the sawhorse  if water spoils pumpkins observed jack with a deep sigh then my days are numbered  ive never noticed that water spoils pumpkins returned tip unless the water happens to be boiling if your head isnt cracked my friend you must be in fairly good condition  oh my head isnt cracked in the least declared jack more cheerfully  then dont worry retorted the boy care once killed a cat  then said jack seriously i am very glad indeed that i am not a cat    114  the sun was fast drying their clothing and tip stirred up his majestys straw so that the warm rays might absorb the moisture and make it as crisp and dry as ever when this had been accomplished he stuffed the scarecrow into symmetrical shape and smoothed out his face so that he wore his usual gay and charming expression  thank you very much said the monarch brightly as he walked about and found himself to be well balanced there are several distinct advantages in being a scarecrow for if one has friends near at hand to repair damages nothing very serious can happen to you  i wonder if hot sunshine is liable to crack pumpkins said jack with an anxious ring in his voice  not at allnot at all replied the scarecrow gaily all you need fear my boy is old age when your golden youth has decayed we shall quickly part companybut you neednt look forward to it well discover the fact ourselves and notify you but come let us resume our journey i am anxious to greet my friend the tin woodman  so they remounted the sawhorse tip holding to the post the pumpkinhead clinging to tip and the scarecrow with both arms around the wooden form of jack    115               full page lineart drawing                 tip stuffs the scarecrow with dry straw    116  go slowly for now there is no danger of pursuit said tip to his steed  all right responded the creature in a voice rather gruff  arent you a little hoarse asked the pumpkinhead politely  the sawhorse gave an angry prance and rolled one knotty eye backward toward tip  see here he growled cant you protect me from insult  to be sure answered tip soothingly i am sure jack meant no harm and it will not do for us to quarrel you know we must all remain good friends  ill have nothing more to do with that pumpkinhead declared the saw horse viciously he loses his head too easily to suit me  there seemed no fitting reply to this speech so for a time they rode along in silence  after a while the scarecrow remarked  this reminds me of old times it was upon this grassy knoll that i once saved dorothy from the stinging bees of the wicked witch of the west  do stinging bees injure pumpkins asked jack glancing around fearfully  they are all dead so it doesnt matter replied    117 the scarecrow and here is where nick chopper destroyed the wicked witchs grey wolves  who was nick chopper asked tip  that is the name of my friend the tin woodman answered his majesty and here is where the winged monkeys captured and bound us and flew away with little dorothy he continued after they had traveled a little way farther  do winged monkeys ever eat pumpkins asked jack with a shiver of fear  i do not know but you have little cause to worry for the winged monkeys are now the slaves of glinda the good who owns the golden cap that commands their services said the scarecrow reflectively  then the stuffed monarch became lost in thought recalling the days of past adventures and the sawhorse rocked and rolled over the flowerstrewn fields and carried its riders swiftly upon their way                            twilight fell bye and bye and then the dark shadows of night so tip stopped the horse and they all proceeded to dismount  im tired out said the boy yawning wearily and the grass is soft and cool let us lie down here and sleep until morning    118  i cant sleep said jack  i never do said the scarecrow  i do not even know what sleep is said the sawhorse  still we must have consideration for this poor boy who is made of flesh and blood and bone and gets tired suggested the scarecrow in his usual thoughtful manner i remember it was the same way with little dorothy we always had to sit through the night while she slept  im sorry said tip meekly but i cant help it and im dreadfully hungry too  here is a new danger remarked jack gloomily i hope you are not fond of eating pumpkins  not unless theyre stewed and made into pies answered the boy laughing so have no fears of me friend jack  what a coward that pumpkinhead is said the sawhorse scornfully  you might be a coward yourself if you knew you were liable to spoil retorted jack angrily  therethere interrupted the scarecrow dont let us quarrel we all have our weaknesses dear friends so we must strive to be considerate of one another and since this poor boy is hungry and has nothing whatever to eat let us all remain    119 quiet and allow him to sleep for it is said that in sleep a mortal may forget even hunger  thank you exclaimed tip gratefully your majesty is fully as good as you are wiseand that is saying a good deal  he then stretched himself upon the grass and using the stuffed form of the scarecrow for a pillow was presently fast asleep                  lineart drawing    120               full page lineart drawing    121               a nickelplated emperor   tip awoke soon after dawn but the scarecrow had already risen and plucked with his clumsy fingers a doublehandful of ripe berries from some bushes near by these the boy ate greedily finding them an ample breakfast and afterward the little party resumed its journey  after an hours ride they reached the summit of a hill from whence they espied the city of the winkies and noted the tall domes of the emperors palace rising from the clusters of more modest dwellings  the scarecrow became greatly animated at this sight and exclaimed  how delighted i shall be to see my old friend the tin woodman again i hope that he rules his people more successfully than i have ruled mine  is the tin woodman the emperor of the winkies asked the horse  yes indeed they invited him to rule over    122 them soon after the wicked witch was destroyed and as nick chopper has the best heart in all the world i am sure he has proved an excellent and able emperor  i thought that emperor was the title of a person who rules an empire said tip and the country of the winkies is only a kingdom  dont mention that to the tin woodman exclaimed the scarecrow earnestly you would hurt his feelings terribly he is a proud man as he has every reason to be and it pleases him to be termed emperor rather than king  im sure it makes no difference to me replied the boy  the sawhorse now ambled forward at a pace so fast that its riders had hard work to stick upon its back so there was little further conversation until they drew up beside the palace steps  an aged winkie dressed in a uniform of silver cloth came forward to assist them to alight said the scarecrow to his personage  show us at once to your master the emperor  the man looked from one to another of the party in an embarrassed way and finally answered  i fear i must ask you to wait for a time the emperor is not receiving this morning    123  how is that enquired the scarecrow anxiously i hope nothing has happened to him  oh no nothing serious returned the man but this is his majestys day for being polished and just now his august presence is thickly smeared with putzpomade  oh i see cried the scarecrow greatly reassured my friend was ever inclined to be a dandy and i suppose he is now more proud than ever of his personal appearance  he is indeed said the man with a polite bow our mighty emperor has lately caused himself to be nickelplated  good gracious the scarecrow exclaimed at hearing this if his wit bears the same polish how sparkling it must be but show us inim sure the emperor will receive us even in his present state  the emperors state is always magnificent said the man but i will venture to tell him of your arrival and will receive his commands concerning you  so the party followed the servant into a splendid anteroom and the saw horse ambled awkwardly after them having no knowledge that a horse might be expected to remain outside    124  the travelers were at first somewhat awed by their surroundings and even the scarecrow seemed impressed as he examined the rich hangings of silver cloth caught up into knots and fastened with tiny silver axes upon a handsome centertable stood a large silver oilcan richly engraved with scenes from the past adventures of the tin woodman dorothy the cowardly lion and the scarecrow the lines of the engraving being traced upon the silver in yellow gold on the walls hung several portraits that of the scarecrow seeming to be the most prominent and carefully executed while a the large painting of the famous wizard of oz in act of presenting the tin woodman with a heart covered almost one entire end of the room  while the visitors gazed at these things in silent admiration they suddenly heard a loud voice in the next room exclaim  well well well what a great surprise  and then the door burst open and nick chopper rushed into their midst and caught the scarecrow in a close and loving embrace that creased him into many folds and wrinkles  my dear old friend my noble comrade cried the tin woodman joyfully how delighted i am to meet you once again    125               full page lineart drawing                 caught the scarecrow in a close and loving embrace    126  and then he released the scarecrow and held him at arms length while he surveyed the beloved painted features  but alas the face of the scarecrow and many portions of his body bore great blotches of putzpomade for the tin woodman in his eagerness to welcome his friend had quite forgotten the condition of his toilet and had rubbed the thick coating of paste from his own body to that of his comrade  dear me said the scarecrow dolefully what a mess im in  never mind my friend returned the tin woodman ill send you to my imperial laundry and youll come out as good as new  wont i be mangled asked the scarecrow  no indeed was the reply but tell me how came your majesty here and who are your companions  the scarecrow with great politeness introduced tip and jack pumpkinhead and the latter personage seemed to interest the tin woodman greatly  you are not very substantial i must admit said the emperor but you are certainly unusual and therefore worthy to become a member of our select society  i thank your majesty said jack humbly    127               lineart drawing   i hope you are enjoying good health continued the woodman  at present yes replied the pumpkinhead with a sigh but i am in constant terror of the day when i shall spoil  nonsense said the emperorbut in a kindly sympathetic tone do not i beg of you dampen todays sun with the showers of tomorrow for before your head has time to spoil you can have it canned and in that way it may be preserved indefinitely  tip during this conversation was looking at the woodman with undisguised amazement and noticed that the celebrated emperor of the winkies was composed entirely of pieces of tin neatly soldered    128 and riveted together into the form of a man he rattled and clanked a little as he moved but in the main he seemed to be most cleverly constructed and his appearance was only marred by the thick coating of polishingpaste that covered him from head to foot  the boys intent gaze caused the tin woodman to remember that he was not in the most presentable condition so he begged his friends to excuse him while he retired to his private apartment and allowed his servants to polish him this was accomplished in a short time and when the emperor returned his nickelplated body shone so magnificently that the scarecrow heartily congratulated him on his improved appearance  that nickelplate was i confess a happy thought said nick and it was the more necessary because i had become somewhat scratched during my adventurous experiences you will observe this engraved star upon my left breast it not only indicates where my excellent heart lies but covers very neatly the patch made by the wonderful wizard when he placed that valued organ in my breast with his own skillful hands  is your heart then a handorgan asked the pumpkinhead curiously    129  by no means responded the emperor with dignity it is i am convinced a strictly orthodox heart although somewhat larger and warmer than most people possess  then he turned to the scarecrow and asked  are your subjects happy and contented my dear friend  i cannot say was the reply for the girls of oz have risen in revolt and driven me out of the emerald city  great goodness cried the tin woodman what a calamity they surely do not complain of your wise and gracious rule  no but they say it is a poor rule that dont work both ways answered the scarecrow and these females are also of the opinion that men have ruled the land long enough so they have captured my city robbed the treasury of all its jewels and are running things to suit themselves  dear me what an extraordinary idea cried the emperor who was both shocked and surprised  and i heard some of them say said tip that they intend to march here and capture the castle and city of the tin woodman  ah we must not give them time to do that said the emperor quickly we will go at once and    130               full page lineart drawing                 renovating his majesty the scarecrow    131 recapture the emerald city and place the scarecrow again upon his throne  i was sure you would help me remarked the scarecrow in a pleased voice how large an army can you assemble  we do not need an army replied the woodman we four with the aid of my gleaming axe are enough to strike terror into the hearts of the rebels  we five corrected the pumpkinhead  five repeated the tin woodman  yes the sawhorse is brave and fearless answered jack forgetting his recent quarrel with the quadruped  the tin woodman looked around him in a puzzled way for the sawhorse had until now remained quietly standing in a corner where the emperor had not noticed him tip immediately called the oddlooking creature to them and it approached so awkwardly that it nearly upset the beautiful centertable and the engraved oilcan  i begin to think remarked the tin woodman as he looked earnestly at the sawhorse that wonders will never cease how came this creature alive  i did it with a magic powder modestly asserted the boy and the saw horse has been very useful to us    132  he enabled us to escape the rebels added the scarecrow  then we must surely accept him as a comrade declared the emperor a live sawhorse is a distinct novelty and should prove an interesting study does he know anything  well i cannot claim any great experience in life the sawhorse answered for himself but i seem to learn very quickly and often it occurs to me that i know more than any of those around me  perhaps you do said the emperor for experience does not always mean wisdom but time is precious just now so let us quickly make preparations to start upon our journey  the emperor called his lord high chancellor and instructed him how to run the kingdom during his absence meanwhile the scarecrow was taken apart and the painted sack that served him for a head was carefully laundered and restuffed with the brains originally given him by the great wizard his clothes were also cleaned and pressed by the imperial tailors and his crown polished and again sewed upon his head for the tin woodman insisted he should not renounce this badge of royalty the scarecrow now presented a very respectable appearance and although in no way addicted to vanity he    133 was quite pleased with himself and strutted a trifle as he walked while this was being done tip mended the wooden limbs of jack pumpkinhead and made them stronger than before and the sawhorse was also inspected to see if he was in good working order  then bright and early the next morning they set out upon the return journey to the emerald city the tin woodman bearing upon his shoulder a gleaming axe and leading the way while the pumpkinhead rode upon the sawhorse and tip and the scarecrow walked upon either side to make sure that he didnt fall off or become damaged                  lineart drawing    134               full page lineart drawing    135               mr h m wogglebug t e   now general jinjurwho you will remember commanded the army of revoltwas rendered very uneasy by the escape of the scarecrow from the emerald city she feared and with good reason that if his majesty and the tin woodman joined forces it would mean danger to her and her entire army for the people of oz had not yet forgotten the deeds of these famous heroes who had passed successfully through so many startling adventures  so jinjur sent posthaste for old mombi the witch and promised her large rewards if she would come to the assistance of the rebel army  mombi was furious at the trick tip had played upon her as well as at his escape and the theft of the precious powder of life so she needed no urging    136 to induce her to travel to the emerald city to assist jinjur in defeating the scarecrow and the tin woodman who had made tip one of their friends  mombi had no sooner arrived at the royal palace than she discovered by means of her secret magic that the adventurers were starting upon their journey to the emerald city so she retired to a small room high up in a tower and locked herself in while she practised such arts as she could command to prevent the return of the scarecrow and his companions  that was why the tin woodman presently stopped and said  something very curious has happened i ought to know by heart and every step of this journey yet i fear we have already lost our way  that is quite impossible protested the scarecrow why do you think my dear friend that we have gone astray  why here before us is a great field of sunflowersand i never saw this field before in all my life  at these words they all looked around only to find that they were indeed surrounded by a field of tall stalks every stalk bearing at its top a gigantic sunflower and not only were these flowers almost    137 blinding in their vivid hues of red and gold but each one whirled around upon its stalk like a miniature windmill completely dazzling the vision of the beholders and so mystifying them that they knew not which way to turn  its witchcraft exclaimed tip  while they paused hesitating and wondering the tin woodman uttered a cry of impatience and advanced with swinging axe to cut down the stalks before him but now the sunflowers suddenly stopped their rapid whirling and the travelers plainly saw a girls face appear in the center of each flower these lovely faces looked upon the astonished band with mocking smiles and then burst into a chorus of merry laughter at the dismay their appearance caused  stop stop cried tip seizing the woodmans arm theyre alive theyre girls  at that moment the flowers began whirling again and the faces faded away and were lost in the rapid revolutions  the tin woodman dropped his axe and sat down upon the ground  it would be heartless to chop down those pretty creatures said he despondently and yet i do not know how else we can proceed upon our way  they looked to me strangely like the faces of    138 the army of revolt mused the scarecrow but i cannot conceive how the girls could have followed us here so quickly  i believe its magic said tip positively and that someone is playing a trick upon us ive known old mombi do things like that before probably its nothing more than an illusion and there are no sunflowers here at all  then let us shut our eyes and walk forward suggested the woodman  excuse me replied the scarecrow my eyes are not painted to shut because you happen to have tin eyelids you must not imagine we are all built in the same way  and the eyes of the sawhorse are knot eyes said jack leaning forward to examine them  nevertheless you must ride quickly forward commanded tip and we will follow after you and so try to escape my eyes are already so dazzled that i can scarcely see  so the pumpkinhead rode boldly forward and tip grasped the stub tail of the sawhorse and followed with closed eyes the scarecrow and the tin woodman brought up the rear and before they had gone many yards a joyful shout from jack announced that the way was clear before them    139  then all paused to look backward but not a trace of the field of sunflowers remained  more cheerfully now they proceeded upon their journey but old mombi had so changed the appearance of the landscape that they would surely have been lost had not the scarecrow wisely concluded to take their direction from the sun for no witchcraft could change the course of the sun and it was therefore a safe guide  however other difficulties lay before them the sawhorse stepped into a rabbit hole and fell to the ground the pumpkinhead was pitched high into the air and his history would probably have ended at that exact moment had not the tin woodman skillfully caught the pumpkin as it descended and saved it from injury  tip soon had it fitted to the neck again and replaced jack upon his feet but the sawhorse did not escape so easily for when his leg was pulled from the rabbit hole it was found to be broken short off and must be replaced or repaired before he could go a step farther  this is quite serious said the tin woodman if there were trees near by i might soon manufacture another leg for this animal but i cannot see even a shrub for miles around    140               full page lineart drawing                 the tin woodman skillfully caught the pumpkin    141  and there are neither fences nor houses in this part of the land of oz added the scarecrow disconsolately  then what shall we do enquired the boy  i suppose i must start my brains working replied his majesty the scarecrow for experience has taught me that i can do anything if i but take time to think it out  let us all think said tip and perhaps we shall find a way to repair the sawhorse  so they sat in a row upon the grass and began to think while the sawhorse occupied itself by gazing curiously upon its broken limb  does it hurt asked the tin woodman in a soft sympathetic voice  not in the least returned the sawhorse but my pride is injured to find that my anatomy is so brittle  for a time the little group remained in silent thought presently the tin woodman raised his head and looked over the fields  what sort of creature is that which approaches us he asked wonderingly  the others followed his gaze and discovered coming toward them the most extraordinary object they had ever beheld it advanced quickly and    142 noiselessly over the soft grass and in a few minutes stood before the adventurers and regarded them with an astonishment equal to their own  the scarecrow was calm under all circumstances  good morning he said politely  the stranger removed his hat with a flourish bowed very low and then responded                  lineart drawing    good morning one and all i hope you are as an aggregation enjoying excellent health permit me to present my card  with this courteous speech it extended a card toward the scarecrow who accepted it turned it over and over and handed it with a shake of his head to tip  the boy read aloud   mr h m wogglebug t e    143  dear me ejaculated the pumpkinhead staring somewhat intently  how very peculiar said the tin woodman  tips eyes were round and wondering and the sawhorse uttered a sigh and turned away its head  are you really a wogglebug enquired the scarecrow  most certainly my dear sir answered the stranger briskly is not my name upon the card  it is said the scarecrow but may i ask what h m stands for  h m means highly magnified returned the wogglebug proudly  oh i see the scarecrow viewed the stranger critically and are you in truth highly magnified  sir said the wogglebug i take you for a gentleman of judgment and discernment does it not occur to you that i am several thousand times greater than any wogglebug you ever saw before therefore it is plainly evident that i am highly magnified and there is no good reason why you should doubt the fact  pardon me returned the scarecrow my brains are slightly mixed since i was last laundered would it be improper for me to ask also what the te at the end of your name stands for    144  those letters express my degree answered the wogglebug with a condescending smile to be more explicit the initials mean that i am thoroughly educated  oh said the scarecrow much relieved  tip had not yet taken his eyes off this wonderful personage what he saw was a great round buglike body supported upon two slender legs which ended in delicate feetthe toes curling upward the body of the wogglebug was rather flat and judging from what could be seen of it was of a glistening dark brown color upon the back while the front was striped with alternate bands of light brown and white blending together at the edges its arms were fully as slender as its legs and upon a rather long neck was perched its headnot unlike the head of a man except that its nose ended in a curling antenna or feeler and its ears from the upper points bore antennae that decorated the sides of its head like two miniature curling pig tails it must be admitted that the round black eyes were rather bulging in appearance but the expression upon the wogglebugs face was by no means unpleasant  for dress the insect wore a darkblue swallowtail coat with a yellow silk lining and a flower in the buttonhole a vest of white duck that stretched    145 tightly across the wide body knickerbockers of fawncolored plush fastened at the knees with gilt buckles and perched upon its small head was jauntily set a tall silk hat  standing upright before our amazed friends the wogglebug appeared to be fully as tall as the tin woodman and surely no bug in all the land of oz had ever before attained so enormous a size  i confess said the scarecrow that your abrupt appearance has caused me surprise and no doubt has startled my companions i hope however that this circumstance will not distress you we shall probably get used to you in time  do not apologize i beg of you returned the wogglebug earnestly it affords me great pleasure to surprise people for surely i cannot be classed with ordinary insects and am entitled to both curiosity and admiration from those i meet  you are indeed agreed his majesty  if you will permit me to seat myself in your august company continued the stranger i will gladly relate my history so that you will be better able to comprehend my unusualmay i say remarkableappearance  you may say what you please answered the tin woodman briefly    146  so the wogglebug sat down upon the grass facing the little group of wanderers and told them the following story                 lineart drawing    147               a highly magnified history   it is but honest that i should acknowledge at the beginning of my recital that i was born an ordinary wogglebug began the creature in a frank and friendly tone knowing no better i used my arms as well as my legs for walking and crawled under the edges of stones or hid among the roots of grasses with no thought beyond finding a few insects smaller than myself to feed upon  the chill nights rendered me stiff and motionless for i wore no clothing but each morning the warm rays of the sun gave me new life and restored me to activity a horrible existence is this but you must remember it is the regular ordained existence of wogglebugs as well as of many other tiny creatures that inhabit the earth  but destiny had singled me out humble though i was for a grander fate one day i crawled near    148 to a country school house and my curiosity being excited by the monotonous hum of the students within i made bold to enter and creep along a crack between two boards until i reached the far end where in front of a hearth of glowing embers sat the master at his desk  no one noticed so small a creature as a wogglebug and when i found that the hearth was even warmer and more comfortable than the sunshine i resolved to establish my future home beside it so i found a charming nest between two bricks and hid myself therein for many many months  professor nowitall is doubtless the most famous scholar in the land of oz and after a few days i began to listen to the lectures and discourses he gave his pupils not one of them was more attentive than the humble unnoticed wogglebug and i acquired in this way a fund of knowledge that i will myself confess is simply marvelous that is why i place te thoroughly educated upon my cards for my greatest pride lies in the fact that the world cannot produce another wogglebug with a tenth part of my own culture and erudition  i do not blame you said the scarecrow education is a thing to be proud of im educated myself the mess of brains given me by the great    149 wizard is considered by my friends to be unexcelled  nevertheless interrupted the tin woodman a good heart is i believe much more desirable than education or brains  to me said the sawhorse a good leg is more desirable than either  could seeds be considered in the light of brains enquired the pumpkinhead abruptly  keep quiet commanded tip sternly  very well dear father answered the obedient jack  the wogglebug listened patientlyeven respectfullyto these remarks and then resumed his story  i must have lived fully three years in that secluded schoolhouse hearth said he drinking thirstily of the everflowing fount of limpid knowledge before me  quite poetical commented the scarecrow nodding his head approvingly  but one day continued the bug a marvelous circumstance occurred that altered my very existence and brought me to my present pinnacle of greatness the                 lineart drawing    150 professor discovered me in the act of crawling across the hearth and before i could escape he had caught me between his thumb and forefinger  my dear children said he i have captured a wogglebuga very rare and interesting specimen do any of you know what a wogglebug is  no yelled the scholars in chorus  then said the professor i will get out my famous magnifyingglass and throw the insect upon a screen in a highlymagnified condition that you may all study carefully its peculiar construction and become acquainted with its habits and manner of life  he then brought from a cupboard a most curious instrument and before i could realize what had happened i found myself thrown upon a screen in a highlymagnified stateeven as you now behold me  the students stood up on their stools and craned their heads forward to get a better view of me and two little girls jumped upon the sill of an open window where they could see more plainly  behold cried the professor in a loud voice this highlymagnified wogglebug one of the most curious insects in existence  being thoroughly educated and knowing what is required of a cultured gentleman at this juncture i stood upright and placing my hand upon my    151               full page lineart drawing                 thee students stood up on their stools    152 bosom made a very polite bow my action being unexpected must have startled them for one of the little girls perched upon the windowsill gave a scream and fell backward out the window drawing her companion with her as she disappeared  the professor uttered a cry of horror and rushed away through the door to see if the poor children were injured by the fall the scholars followed after him in a wild mob and i was left alone in the schoolroom still in a highlymagnified state and free to do as i pleased  it immediately occurred to me that this was a good opportunity to escape i was proud of my great size and realized that now i could safely travel anywhere in the world while my superior culture would make me a fit associate for the most learned person i might chance to meet  so while the professor picked the little girlswho were more frightened than hurtoff the ground and the pupils clustered around him closely grouped i calmly walked out of the schoolhouse turned a corner and escaped unnoticed to a grove of trees that stood near  wonderful exclaimed the pumpkinhead admiringly  it was indeed agreed the wogglebug i    153 have never ceased to congratulate myself for escaping while i was highly magnified for even my excess                  lineart drawing   ive knowledge would have proved of little use to me had i remained a tiny insignificant insect  i didnt know before said tip looking at the    154 wogglebug with a puzzled expression that insects wore clothes  nor do they in their natural state returned the stranger but in the course of my wanderings i had the good fortune to save the ninth life of a tailortailors having like cats nine lives as you probably know the fellow was exceedingly grateful for had he lost that ninth life it would have been the end of him so he begged permission to furnish me with the stylish costume i now wear it fits very nicely does it not and the wogglebug stood up and turned himself around slowly that all might examine his person  he must have been a good tailor said the scarecrow somewhat enviously  he was a goodhearted tailor at any rate observed nick chopper  but where were you going when you met us tip asked the wogglebug  nowhere in particular was the reply although it is my intention soon to visit the emerald city and arrange to give a course of lectures to select audiences on the advantages of magnification  we are bound for the emerald city now said the tin woodman so if it pleases you to do so you are welcome to travel in our company    155  the wogglebug bowed with profound grace  it will give me great pleasure said he to accept your kind invitation for nowhere in the land of oz could i hope to meet with so congenial a company  that is true acknowledged the pumpkinhead we are quite as congenial as flies and honey  butpardon me if i seem inquisitiveare you not all ratherahem rather unusual asked the wogglebug looking from one to another with unconcealed interest  not more so than yourself answered the scarecrow everything in life is unusual until you get accustomed to it  what rare philosophy exclaimed the wogglebug admiringly  yes my brains are working well today admitted the scarecrow an accent of pride in his voice  then if you are sufficiently rested and refreshed let us bend our steps toward the emerald city suggested the magnified one  we cant said tip the sawhorse has broken a leg so he cant bend his steps and there is no wood around to make him a new limb from and we cant leave the horse behind because the pumpkinhead is so stiff in his joints that he has to ride    156  how very unfortunate cried the wogglebug then he looked the party over carefully and said  if the pumpkinhead is to ride why not use one of his legs to make a leg for the horse that carries him i judge that both are made of wood  now that is what i call real cleverness said the scarecrow approvingly i wonder my brains  did not think of that long ago get to work my dear nick and fit the pumpkinheads leg to the sawhorse  jack was not especially pleased with this idea but he submitted to having his left leg amputated by the tin woodman and whittled down to fit the left leg of the sawhorse nor was the sawhorse especially pleased with the operation either for he growled a good deal about being butchered as he called it and afterward declared that the new leg was a disgrace to a respectable sawhorse  i beg you to be more careful in your speech said the pumpkinhead sharply remember if you please that it is my leg you are abusing  i cannot forget it retorted the sawhorse for it is quite as flimsy as the rest of your person  flimsy me flimsy cried jack in a rage how dare you call me flimsy  because you are built as absurdly as a jumping    157 jack sneered the horse rolling his knotty eyes in a vicious manner even your head wont stay straight and you never can tell whether you are looking backwards or forwards  friends i entreat you not to quarrel pleaded the tin woodman anxiously as a matter of fact we are none of us above criticism so let us bear with each others faults  an excellent suggestion said the wogglebug approvingly you must have an excellent heart my metallic friend  i have returned nick well pleased my heart is quite the best part of me but now let us start upon our journey  they perched the onelegged pumpkinhead upon the sawhorse and tied him to his seat with cords so that he could not possibly fall off  and then following the lead of the scarecrow they all advanced in the direction of the emerald city                  lineart drawing    158               full page lineart drawing    159               old mombi indulges in witchcraft   they soon discovered that the sawhorse limped for his new leg was a trifle too long so they were obliged to halt while the tin woodman chopped it down with his axe after which the wooden steed paced along more comfortably but the sawhorse was not entirely satisfied even yet  it was a shame that i broke my other leg it growled  on the contrary airily remarked the wogglebug who was walking alongside you should consider the accident most fortunate for a horse is never of much use until he has been broken  i beg your pardon said tip rather provoked for he felt a warm interest in both the sawhorse and his man jack but permit me to say that your joke is a poor one and as old as it is poor    160  still it is a joke declared the wogglebug firmly and a joke derived from a play upon words is considered among educated people to be eminently proper  what does that mean enquired the pumpkinhead stupidly  it means my dear friend explained the wogglebug that our language contains many words having a double meaning and that to pronounce a joke that allows both meanings of a certain word proves the joker a person of culture and refinement who has moreover a thorough command of the language  i dont believe that said tip plainly anybody can make a pun  not so rejoined the wogglebug stiffly it requires education of a high order are you educated young sir  not especially admitted tip  then you cannot judge the matter i myself am thoroughly educated and i say that puns display genius for instance were i to ride upon this saw horse he would not only be an animal he would become an equipage for he would then be a horseandbuggy  at this the scarecrow gave a gasp and the tin    161 woodman stopped short and looked reproachfully at the wogglebug at the same time the sawhorse loudly snorted his derision and even the pumpkinhead put up his hand to hide the smile which because it was carved upon his face he could not change to a frown  but the wogglebug strutted along as if he had made some brilliant remark and the scarecrow was obliged to say  i have heard my dear friend that a person can become overeducated and although i have a high respect for brains no matter how they may be arranged or classified i begin to suspect that yours are slightly tangled in any event i must beg you to restrain your superior education while in our society  we are not very particular added the tin woodman and we are exceedingly kind hearted but if your superior culture gets leaky again he did not complete the sentence but he twirled his gleaming axe so carelessly that the wogglebug looked frightened and shrank away to a safe distance  the others marched on in silence and the highly magnified one after a period of deep thought said in an humble voice  i will endeavor to restrain myself    162  that is all we can expect returned the scarecrow pleasantly and good nature being thus happily restored to the party they proceeded upon their way  when they again stopped to allow tip to restthe boy being the only one that seemed to tirethe tin woodman noticed many small round holes in the grassy meadow  this must be a village of the field mice he said to the scarecrow i wonder if my old friend the queen of the mice is in this neighborhood  if she is she may be of great service to us answered the scarecrow who was impressed by a sudden thought see if you can call her my dear nick  so the tin woodman blew a shrill note upon a silver whistle that hung around his neck and presently a tiny grey mouse popped from a nearby hole and advanced fearlessly toward them for the tin woodman had once saved her life and the queen of the field mice knew he was to be trusted  good day your majesty said nick politely addressing the mouse i trust you are enjoying good health  thank you i am quite well answered the queen demurely as she sat up and displayed the tiny golden crown upon her head can i do anything to assist my old friends    163  you can indeed replied the scarecrow eagerly let me i intreat you take a dozen of your subjects with me to the emerald city  will they be injured in any way asked the queen doubtfully  i think not replied the scarecrow i will carry them hidden in the straw which stuffs my body and when i give them the signal by unbuttoning my jacket they have only to rush out and scamper home again as fast as they can by doing this they will assist me to regain my throne which the army of revolt has taken from me  in that case said the queen i will not refuse your request whenever you are ready i will call twelve of my most intelligent subjects  i am ready now returned the scarecrow then he lay flat upon the ground and unbuttoned his jacket displaying the mass of straw with which he was stuffed  the queen uttered a little piping call and in an instant a dozen pretty field mice had emerged from their holes and stood before their ruler awaiting her orders  what the queen said to them none of our travelers could understand for it was in the mouse language but the field mice obeyed without hesitation    164 running one after the other to the scarecrow and hiding themselves in the straw of his breast  when all of the twelve mice had thus concealed themselves the scarecrow buttoned his jacket securely and then arose and thanked the queen for her kindness  one thing more you might do to serve us suggested the tin woodman and that is to run ahead and show us the way to the emerald city for some enemy is evidently trying to prevent us from reaching it  i will do that gladly returned the queen are you ready  the tin woodman looked at tip  im rested said the boy let us start  then they resumed their journey the little grey  queen of the field mice running swiftly ahead and then pausing until the travelers drew near when away she would dart again  without this unerring guide the scarecrow and his comrades might never have gained the emerald city for many were the obstacles thrown in their way by the arts of old mombi yet not one of the obstacles really existedall were cleverly contrived deceptions for when they came to the banks of a rushing river that threatened to bar their way the    165 little queen kept steadily on passing through the seeming flood in safety and our travelers followed her without encountering a single drop of water  again a high wall of granite towered high above their heads and opposed their advance but the grey field mouse walked straight through it and the others did the same the wall melting into mist as they passed it  afterward when they had stopped for a moment to allow tip to rest they saw forty roads branching off from their feet in forty different directions and soon these forty roads began whirling around like a mighty wheel first in one direction and then in the other completely bewildering their vision  but the queen called for them to follow her and darted off in a straight line and when they had gone a few paces the whirling pathways vanished and were seen no more  mombis last trick was the most fearful of all she sent a sheet of crackling flame rushing over the meadow to consume them and for the first time the scarecrow became afraid and turned to fly  if that fire reaches me i will be gone in no time said he trembling until his straw rattled its the most dangerous thing i ever encountered  im off too cried the sawhorse turning and    166 prancing with agitation for my wood is so dry it would burn like kindlings  is fire dangerous to pumpkins asked jack fearfully  youll be baked like a tartand so will i                  lineart drawing   answered the wogglebug getting down on all fours so he could run the faster  but the tin woodman having no fear of fire averted the stampede by a few sensible words  look at the field mouse he shouted the fire does not burn her in the least in fact it is no fire at all but only a deception    167  indeed to watch the little queen march calmly through the advancing flames restored courage to every member of the party and they followed her without being even scorched  this is surely a most extraordinary adventure said the wogglebug who was greatly amazed for it upsets all the natural laws that i heard professor nowitall teach in the schoolhouse  of course it does said the scarecrow wisely all magic is unnatural and for that reason is to be feared and avoided but i see before us the gates of the emerald city so i imagine we have now overcome all the magical obstacles that seemed to oppose us  indeed the walls of the city were plainly visible and the queen of the field mice who had guided them so faithfully came near to bid them good bye  we are very grateful to your majesty for your kind assistance said the tin woodman bowing before the pretty creature  i am always pleased to be of service to my friends answered the queen and in a flash she had darted away upon her journey home    168               full page lineart drawing    169               the prisoners of the queen   approaching the gateway of the emerald city the travelers found it guarded by two girls of the army of revolt who opposed their entrance by drawing the knittingneedles from their hair and threatening to prod the first that came near  but the tin woodman was not afraid  at the worst they can but scratch my beautiful nickelplate he said but there will be no worst for i think i can manage to frighten these absurd soldiers very easily follow me closely all of you  then swinging his axe in a great circle to right and left before him he advanced upon the gate and the others followed him without hesitation  the girls who had expected no resistance whatever were terrified by the sweep of the glittering axe and fled screaming into the city so that our    170 travelers passed the gates in safety and marched down the green marble pavement of the wide street toward the royal palace  at this rate we will soon have your majesty upon the throne again said the tin woodman laughing at his easy conquest of the guards  thank you friend nick returned the scarecrow gratefully nothing can resist your kind heart and your sharp axe  as they passed the rows of houses they saw through the open doors that men were sweeping and dusting and washing dishes while the women sat around in groups gossiping and laughing  what has happened the scarecrow asked a sadlooking man with a bushy beard who wore an apron and was wheeling a babycarriage along the sidewalk  why weve had a revolution your majesty as you ought to know very well replied the man and since you went away the women have been running things to suit themselves im glad you have decided to come back and restore order for doing housework and minding the children is wearing out the strength of every man in the emerald city  hm said the scarecrow thoughtfully if it    171 is such hard work as you say how did the women manage it so easily  i really do not know replied the man with a deep sigh perhaps the women are made of castiron  no movement was made as they passed along the street to oppose their progress several of the women stopped their gossip long enough to cast curious looks upon our friends but immediately they would turn away with a laugh or a sneer and resume their chatter and when they met with several girls belonging to the army of revolt those soldiers instead of being alarmed or appearing surprised merely stepped out of the way and allowed them to advance without protest  this action rendered the scarecrow uneasy  im afraid we are walking into a trap said he  nonsense returned nick chopper confidently the silly creatures are conquered already  but the scarecrow shook his head in a way that expressed doubt and tip said  its too easy altogether look out for trouble ahead  i will returned his majesty unopposed they reached the royal palace and marched up the marble steps which had once been    172               full page lineart drawing                 its too easy altogether    173 thickly crusted with emeralds but were now filled with tiny holes where the jewels had been ruthlessly torn from their settings by the army of revolt and so far not a rebel barred their way  through the arched hallways and into the magnificent throne room marched the tin woodman and his followers and here when the green silken curtains fell behind them they saw a curious sight  seated within the glittering throne was general jinjur with the scarecrows secondbest crown upon her head and the royal sceptre in her right hand a box of caramels from which she was eating rested in her lap and the girl seemed entirely at ease in her royal surroundings  the scarecrow stepped forward and confronted her while the tin woodman leaned upon his axe and the others formed a halfcircle back of his majestys person  how dare you sit in my throne demanded the scarecrow sternly eyeing the intruder dont you know you are guilty of treason and that there is a law against treason  the throne belongs to whoever is able to take it answered jinjur as she slowly ate another caramel i have taken it as you see so just now i am the queen and all who oppose me are guilty of    174 treason and must be punished by the law you have just mentioned  this view of the case puzzled the scarecrow  how is it friend nick he asked turning to the tin woodman  why when it comes to law i have nothing to say answered that personage for laws were never meant to be understood and it is foolish to make the attempt  then what shall we do asked the scarecrow in dismay  why dont you marry the queen and then you can both rule suggested the wogglebug  jinjur glared at the insect fiercely why dont you send her back to her mother where she belongs asked jack pumpkinhead  jinjur frowned  why dont you shut her up in a closet until she behaves herself and promises to be good enquired tip jinjurs lip curled scornfully  or give her a good shaking added the sawhorse  no said the tin woodman we must treat the poor girl with gentleness let us give her all the jewels she can carry and send her away happy and contented    175  at this queen jinjur laughed aloud and the next minute clapped her pretty hands together thrice as if for a signal  you are very absurd creatures said she but i am tired of your nonsense and have no time to bother with you longer  while the monarch and his friends listened in amazement to this impudent speech a startling thing happened the tin woodmans axe was snatched from his grasp by some person behind him and he found himself disarmed and helpless at the same instant a shout of laughter rang in the ears of the devoted band and turning to see whence this came they found themselves surrounded by the army of revolt the girls bearing in either hand their glistening knittingneedles the entire throne room seemed to be filled with the rebels and the scarecrow and his comrades realized that they were prisoners  you see how foolish it is to oppose a womans wit said jinjur gaily and this event only proves that i am more fit to rule the emerald city than a scarecrow i bear you no ill will i assure you but lest you should prove troublesome to me in the future i shall order you all to be destroyed that is all except the boy who belongs to old mombi and must be restored to her keeping the rest of    176 you are not human and therefore it will not be wicked to demolish you the sawhorse and the pumpkinheads body i will have chopped up for kindling wood and the pumpkin shall be made into tarts the scarecrow will do nicely to start a bonfire and the tin man can be cut into small pieces and fed to the goats as for this immense wogglebug  highly magnified if you please interrupted the insect  i think i will ask the cook to make greenturtle soup of you continued the queen reflectively  the wogglebug shuddered  or if that wont do we might use you for a hungarian goulash stewed and highly spiced she added cruelly  this programme of extermination was so terrible that the prisoners looked upon one another in a panic of fear the scarecrow alone did not give way to despair he stood quietly before the queen and his brow was wrinkled in deep thought as he strove to find some means to escape  while thus engaged he felt the straw within his breast move gently at once his expression changed from sadness to joy and raising his hand he quickly unbuttoned the front of his jacket  this action did not pass unnoticed by the crowd    177 of girls clustering about him but none of them suspected what he was doing until a tiny grey mouse leaped from his bosom to the floor and scampered                 lineart drawing  away between the feet of the army of revolt another mouse quickly followed then another and another in rapid succession and suddenly such a    178 scream of terror went up from the army that it might easily have filled the stoutest heart with consternation the flight that ensued turned to a stampede and the stampede to a panic  for while the startled mice rushed wildly about the room the scarecrow had only time to note a whirl of skirts and a twinkling of feet as the girls disappeared from the palacepushing and crowding one another in their mad efforts to escape  the queen at the first alarm stood up on the cushions of the throne and began to dance frantically upon her tiptoes then a mouse ran up the cushions and with a terrified leap poor jinjur shot clear over the head of the scarecrow and escaped through an archwaynever pausing in her wild career until she had reached the city gates  so in less time than i can explain the throne room was deserted by all save the scarecrow and his friends and the wogglebug heaved a deep sigh of relief as he exclaimed  thank goodness we are saved  for a time yes answered the tin woodman but the enemy will soon return i fear  let us bar all the entrances to the palace said the scarecrow then we shall have time to think what is best to be done    179  so all except jack pumpkinhead who was still tied fast to the sawhorse ran to the various entrances of the royal palace and closed the heavy doors bolting and locking them securely then knowing that the army of revolt could not batter down the barriers in several days the adventurers gathered once more in the throne room for a council of war                 lineart drawing    180               full page lineart drawing    181               the scarecrow takes time to think   it seems to me began the scarecrow when all were again assembled in the throne room that the girl jinjur is quite right in claiming to be queen and if she is right then i am wrong and we have no business to be occupying her palace  but you were the king until she came said the wogglebug strutting up and down with his hands in his pockets so it appears to me that she is the interloper instead of you  especially as we have just conquered her and put her to flight added the pumpkinhead as he raised his hands to turn his face toward the scarecrow  have we really conquered her asked the scarecrow quietly look out of the window and tell me what you see    182  tip ran to the window and looked out  the palace is surrounded by a double row of girl soldiers he announced  i thought so returned the scarecrow we are as truly their prisoners as we were before the mice frightened them from the palace  my friend is right said nick chopper who had been polishing his breast with a bit of chamoisleather jinjur is still the queen and we are her prisoners  but i hope she cannot get at us exclaimed the pumpkinhead with a shiver of fear she threatened to make tarts of me you know  dont worry said the tin woodman it cannot matter greatly if you stay shut up here you will spoil in time anyway a good tart is far more admirable than a decayed intellect  very true agreed the scarecrow  oh dear moaned jack what an unhappy lot is mine why dear father did you not make me out of tinor even out of strawso that i would keep indefinitely  shucks returned tip indignantly you ought to be glad that i made you at all then he added reflectively everything has to come to an end some time    183  but i beg to remind you broke in the wogglebug who had a distressed look in his bulging round eyes that this terrible queen jinjur suggested making a goulash of meme the only highly magnified and thoroughly educated wogglebug in the wide wide world  i think it was a brilliant idea remarked the scarecrow approvingly  dont you imagine he would make a better soup asked the tin woodman turning toward his friend  well perhaps acknowledged the scarecrow  the wogglebug groaned  i can see in my minds eye said he mournfully the goats eating small pieces of my dear comrade the tin woodman while my soup is being cooked on a bonfire built of the sawhorse and jack pumpkinheads body and queen jinjur watches me boil while she feeds the flames with my friend the scarecrow  this morbid picture cast a gloom over the entire party making them restless and anxious  it cant happen for some time said the tin woodman trying to speak cheerfully for we shall be able to keep jinjur out of the palace until she manages to break down the doors    184  and in the meantime i am liable to starve to death and so is the woggle bug announced tip  as for me said the wogglebug i think that i could live for some time on jack pumpkinhead not that i prefer pumpkins for food but i believe they are somewhat nutritious and jacks head is large and plump  how heartless exclaimed the tin woodman greatly shocked are we cannibals let me ask or are we faithful friends  i see very clearly that we cannot stay shut up in this palace said the scarecrow with decision so let us end this mournful talk and try to discover a means to escape  at this suggestion they all gathered eagerly around the throne wherein was seated the scarecrow and as tip sat down upon a stool there fell from his pocket a pepperbox which rolled upon the floor  what is this asked nick chopper picking up the box  be careful cried the boy thats my powder of life dont spill it for it is nearly gone  and what is the powder of life enquired the scarecrow as tip replaced the box carefully in his pocket  its some magical stuff old mombi got from a    185 crooked sorcerer explained the boy she brought jack to life with it and afterward i used it to bring the sawhorse to life i guess it will make anything live that is sprinkled with it but theres only about one dose left  then it is very precious said the tin woodman  indeed it is agreed the scarecrow it may prove our best means of escape from our difficulties i believe i will think for a few minutes so i will thank you friend tip to get out your knife and rip this heavy crown from my forehead  tip soon cut the stitches that had fastened the crown to the scarecrows head and the former monarch of the emerald city removed it with a sigh of relief and hung it on a peg beside the throne  that is my last memento of royalty said he and im glad to get rid of it the former king of this city                 lineart drawing    186 who was named pastoria lost the crown to the wonderful wizard who passed it on to me now the girl jinjur claims it and i sincerely hope it will not give her a headache  a kindly thought which i greatly admire said the tin woodman nodding approvingly  and now i will indulge in a quiet think continued the scarecrow lying back in the throne  the others remained as silent and still as possible so as not to disturb him for all had great confidence in the extraordinary brains of the scarecrow  and after what seemed a very long time indeed to the anxious watchers the thinker sat up looked upon his friends with his most whimsical expression and said  my brains work beautifully today im quite proud of them now listen if we attempt to escape through the doors of the palace we shall surely be captured and as we cant escape through the ground there is only one other thing to be done we must escape through the air  he paused to note the effect of these words but all his hearers seemed puzzled and unconvinced  the wonderful wizard escaped in a balloon he continued we dont know how to make a balloon of course but any sort of thing that can    187 fly through the air can carry us easily so i suggest that my friend the tin woodman who is a skillful mechanic shall build some sort of a machine with good strong wings to carry us and our friend tip can then bring the thing to life with his magical powder  bravo cried nick chopper  what splendid brains murmured jack  really quite clever said the educated wogglebug  i believe it can be done declared tip that is if the tin woodman is equal to making the thing  ill do my best said nick cheerily and as a matter of fact i do not often fail in what i attempt but the thing will have to be built on the roof of the palace so it can rise comfortably into the air                 lineart drawing    188  to be sure said the scarecrow  then let us search through the palace continued the tin woodman and carry all the material we can find to the roof where i will begin my work  first however said the pumpkinhead i beg you will release me from this horse and make me another leg to walk with for in my present condition i am of no use to myself or to anyone else  so the tin woodman knocked a mahogany centertable to pieces with his axe and fitted one of the legs which was beautifully carved on to the body of jack pumpkinhead who was very proud of the acquisition  it seems strange said he as he watched the tin woodman work that my left leg should be the most elegant and substantial part of me  that proves you are unusual returned the scarecrow and i am convinced that the only people worthy of consideration in this world are the unusual ones for the common folks are like the leaves of a tree and live and die unnoticed  spoken like a philosopher cried the wogglebug as he assisted the tin woodman to set jack upon his feet  how do you feel now asked tip watching    189 the pumpkinhead stump around to try his new leg  as good as new answered jack joyfully and quite ready to assist you all to escape  then let us get to work said the scarecrow in a businesslike tone  so glad to be doing anything that might lead to the end of their captivity the friends separated to wander over the palace in search of fitting material to use in the construction of their aerial machine                 lineart drawing    190               full page lineart drawing    191               the astonishing flight of the gump   when the adventurers reassembled upon the roof it was found that a remarkably queer assortment of articles had been selected by the various members of the party no one seemed to have a very clear idea of what was required but all had brought something  the wogglebug had taken from its position over the mantlepiece in the great hallway the head of a gump which was adorned with widespreading antlers and this with great care and greater difficulty the insect had carried up the stairs to the roof this gump resembled an elks head only the nose turned upward in a saucy manner and there were whiskers    192 upon its chin like those of a billygoat why the wogglebug selected this article he could not have explained except that it had aroused his curiosity  tip with the aid of the sawhorse had brought a large upholstered sofa to the roof it was an oldfashioned piece of furniture with high back and ends and it was so heavy that even by resting the greatest weight upon the back of the sawhorse the boy found himself out of breath when at last the clumsy sofa was dumped upon the roof  the pumpkinhead had brought a broom which was the first thing he saw the scarecrow arrived with a coil of clotheslines and ropes which he had taken from the courtyard and in his trip up the stairs he had become so entangled in the loose ends of the ropes that both he and his burden tumbled in a heap upon the roof and might have rolled off if tip had not rescued him  the tin woodman appeared last he also had been to the courtyard where he had cut four great spreading leaves from a huge palmtree that was the pride of all the inhabitants of the emerald city  my dear nick exclaimed the scarecrow seeing what his friend had done you have been guilty of the greatest crime any person can commit in the emerald city if i remember rightly the    193               full page lineart drawing                 all brought something to the roof    194 penalty for chopping leaves from the royal palmtree is to be killed seven times and afterward imprisoned for life  it cannot be helped now answered the tin woodman throwing down the big leaves upon the roof but it may be one more reason why it is necessary for us to escape and now let us see what you have found for me to work with  many were the doubtful looks cast upon the heap of miscellaneous material that now cluttered the roof and finally the scarecrow shook his head and remarked  well if friend nick can manufacture from this mess of rubbish a thing that will fly through the air and carry us to safety then i will acknowledge him to be a better mechanic than i suspected  but the tin woodman seemed at first by no means sure of his powers and only after polishing his forehead vigorously with the chamoisleather did he resolve to undertake the task  the first thing required for the machine said he is a body big enough to carry the entire party this sofa is the biggest thing we have and might be used for a body but should the machine ever tip sideways we would all slide off and fall to the ground    195  why not use two sofas asked tip theres another one just like this down stairs  that is a very sensible suggestion exclaimed the tin woodman you must fetch the other sofa at once  so tip and the sawhorse managed with much labor to get the second sofa to the roof and when the two were placed together edge to edge the backs and ends formed a protecting rampart all around the seats  excellent cried the scarecrow we can ride within this snug nest quite at our ease  the two sofas were now bound firmly together with ropes and clotheslines and then nick chopper fastened the gumps head to one end  that will show which is the front end of the thing said he greatly pleased with the idea and really if you examine it critically the gump looks very well as a figurehead these great palmleaves for which i have endangered my life seven times must serve us as wings  are they strong enough asked the boy  they are as strong as anything we can get answered the woodman and although they are not in proportion to the things body we are not in a position to be very particular    196  so he fastened the palmleaves to the sofas two on each side  said the wogglebug with considerable admiration  the thing is now complete and only needs to be brought to life  stop a moment exclaimed jack are you not going to use my broom  what for asked the scarecrow  why it can be fastened to the back end for a tail answered the pumpkinhead surely you would not call the thing complete without a tail  hm said the tin woodman i do not see the use of a tail we are not trying to copy a beast or a fish or a bird all we ask of the thing is to carry us through the air  perhaps after the thing is brought to life it can use a tail to steer with suggested the scarecrow for if it flies through the air it will not be unlike a bird and ive noticed that all birds have tails which they use for a rudder while flying  very well answered nick the broom shall be used for a tail and he fastened it firmly to the back end of the sofa body  tip took the pepperbox from his pocket  the thing looks very big said he anxiously    197 and i am not sure there is enough powder left to bring all of it to life but ill make it go as far as possible  put most on the wings said nick chopper for they must be made as strong as possible  and dont forget the head exclaimed the wogglebug  or the tail added jack pumpkinhead  do be quiet said tip nervously you must give me a chance to work the magic charm in the proper manner  very carefully he began sprinkling the thing with the precious powder each of the four wings was first lightly covered with a layer then the sofas were sprinkled and the broom given a slight coating  the head the head dont i beg of you forget the head cried the wogglebug excitedly  theres only a little of the powder left announced tip looking within the box and it seems to me it is more important to bring the legs of the sofas to life than the head  not so decided the scarecrow every thing must have a head to direct it and since this creature is to fly and not walk it is really unimportant whether its legs are alive or not  so tip abided by this decision and sprinkled the gumps head with the remainder of the powder    198  now said he keep silence while i work the charm  having heard old mombi pronounce the magic words and having also succeeded in bringing the sawhorse to life tip did not hesitate an instant in speaking the three cabalistic words each accompanied by the peculiar gesture of the hands  it was a grave and impressive ceremony  as he finished the incantation the thing shuddered throughout its huge bulk the gump gave the screeching cry that is familiar to those animals and then the four wings began flopping furiously  tip managed to grasp a chimney else he would have been blown off the roof by the terrible breeze raised by the wings the scarecrow being light in weight was caught up bodily and borne through the air until tip luckily seized him by one leg and held him fast the wogglebug lay flat upon the roof and so escaped harm                 lineart drawing    199 and the tin woodman whose weight of tin anchored him firmly threw both arms around jack pumpkinhead and managed to save him the sawhorse toppled over upon his back and lay with his legs waving helplessly above him  and now while all were struggling to recover themselves the thing rose slowly from the roof and mounted into the air  here come back cried tip in a frightened voice as he clung to the chimney with one hand and the scarecrow with the other come back at once i command you  it was now that the wisdom of the scarecrow in bringing the head of the thing to life instead of the legs was proved beyond a doubt for the gump already high in the air turned its head at tips command and gradually circled around until it could view the roof of the palace  come back shouted the boy again  and the gump obeyed slowly and gracefully waving its four wings in the air until the thing had settled once more upon the roof and become still    200               full page lineart drawing    201               in the jackdaws nest   this said the gump in a squeaky voice not at all proportioned to the size of its great body is the most novel experience i ever heard of the last thing i remember distinctly is walking through the forest and hearing a loud noise something probably killed me then and it certainly ought to have been the end of me yet here i am alive again with four monstrous wings and a body which i venture to say would make any respectable animal or fowl weep with shame to own what does it all mean am i a gump or am i a juggernaut the creature as it spoke wiggled its chin whiskers in a very comical manner  youre just a thing answered tip with a gumps head on it and we have made you and brought you to life so that you may carry us through the air wherever we wish to go    202  very good said the thing as i am not a gump i cannot have a gumps pride or independent spirit so i may as well become your servant as anything else my only satisfaction is that i do not seem to have a very strong constitution and am not likely to live long in a state of slavery  dont say that i beg of you cried the tin woodman whose excellent heart was strongly affected by this sad speech are you not feeling well today  oh as for that returned the gump it is my first day of existence so i cannot judge whether i am feeling well or ill and it waved its broom tail to and fro in a pensive manner  come come said the scarecrow kindly do try to be more cheerful and take life as you find it we shall be kind masters and will strive to render your existence as pleasant as possible are you willing to carry us through the air wherever we wish to go  certainly answered the gump i greatly prefer to navigate the air for should i travel on the earth and meet with one of my own species my embarrassment would be something awful  i can appreciate that said the tin woodman sympathetically  and yet continued the thing when i carefully    203 look you over my masters none of you seems to be constructed much more artistically than i am  appearances are deceitful said the wogglebug earnestly i am both highly magnified and thoroughly educated  indeed murmured the gump indifferently  and my brains are considered remarkably rare specimens added the scarecrow proudly  how strange remarked the gump  although i am of tin said the woodman i own a heart altogether the warmest and most admirable in the whole world  im delighted to hear it replied the gump with a slight cough  my smile said jack pumpkinhead is worthy your best attention it is always the same  semper idem explained the wogglebug pompously and the gump turned to stare at him  and i declared the sawhorse filling in an awkward pause am only remarkable because i cant help it  i am proud indeed to meet with such exceptional masters said the gump in a careless tone if i could but secure so complete an introduction to myself i would be more than satisfied  that will come in time remarked the scare    204 crow to know thyself is considered quite an accomplishment which it has taken us who are your elders months to perfect but now he added turning to the others let us get aboard and start upon our journey  where shall we go asked tip as he clambered to a seat on the sofas and assisted the pumpkinhead to follow him  in the south country rules a very delightful queen called glinda the good who i am sure will gladly receive us said the scarecrow getting into the thing clumsily let us go to her and ask her advice  that is cleverly thought of declared nick chopper giving the wogglebug a boost and then toppling the sawhorse into the rear end of the cushioned seats i know glinda the good and believe she will prove a friend indeed  are we all ready asked the boy  yes announced the tin woodman seating himself beside the scarecrow  then said tip addressing the gump be kind enough to fly with us to the southward and do not go higher than to escape the houses and trees for it makes me dizzy to be up so far  all right answered the gump briefly    205  it flopped its four huge wings and rose slowly into the air and then while our little band of adventurers clung to the backs and sides of the sofas for support the gump turned toward the south and soared swiftly and majestically away  the scenic effect from this altitude is marvelous commented the educated wogglebug as they rode along  never mind the scenery said the scarecrow hold on tight or you may get a tumble the thing seems to rock badly  it will be dark soon said tip observing that the sun was low on the horizon perhaps we should have waited until morning i wonder if the gump can fly in the night  ive been wondering that myself returned the gump quietly you see this is a new experience to me i used to have legs that carried me swiftly over the ground but now my legs feel as if they were asleep  they are said tip we didnt bring em to life  youre expected to fly explained the scarecrow not to walk  we can walk ourselves said the wogglebug  i begin to understand what is required of me remarked the gump so i will do my best to    206 please you and he flew on for a time in silence  presently jack pumpkinhead became uneasy  i wonder if riding through the air is liable to spoil pumpkins he said  not unless you carelessly drop your head over the side answered the wogglebug in that event your head would no longer be a pumpkin for it would become a squash  have i not asked you to restrain these unfeeling jokes demanded tip looking at the wogglebug with a severe expression  you have and ive restrained a good many of them replied the insect but there are opportunities for so many excellent puns in our language that to an educated person like myself the temptation to express them is almost irresistible  people with more or less education discovered those puns centuries ago said tip  are you sure asked the wogglebug with a startled look  of course i am answered the boy an educated wogglebug may be a new thing but a wogglebug education is as old as the hills judging from the display you make of it  the insect seemed much impressed by this remark and for a time maintained a meek silence    207  the scarecrow in shifting his seat saw upon the cushions the pepperbox which tip had cast aside and began to examine it  throw it overboard said the boy its quite empty now and theres no use keeping it  is it really empty asked the scarecrow looking curiously into the box  of course it is answered tip i shook out every grain of the powder  then the box has two bottoms announced the scarecrow for the bottom on the inside is fully an inch away from the bottom on the outside  let me see said the tin woodman taking the box from his friend yes he declared after looking it over the thing certainly has a false bottom now i wonder what that is for  cant you get it apart and find out enquired tip now quite interested in the mystery  why yes the lower bottom unscrews said the tin woodman my fingers are rather stiff please see if you can open it  he handed the pepperbox to tip who had no difficulty in unscrewing the bottom and in the cavity below were three silver pills with a carefully folded paper lying underneath them  this paper the boy proceeded to unfold taking    208 care not to spill the pills and found several lines clearly written in red ink  read it aloud said the scarecrow so tip read as follows            dr nikidiks celebrated wishing pills  directions for use swallow one pill count seventeen by twos then make a wish the wish will immediately be granted                caution keep in a dry and dark place   why this is a very valuable discovery cried the scarecrow  it is indeed replied tip gravely these pills may be of great use to us i wonder if old mombi knew they were in the bottom of the pepperbox i remember hearing her say that she got the powder of life from this same nikidik  he must be a powerful sorcerer exclaimed the tin woodman and since the powder proved a success we ought to have confidence in the pills  but how asked the scarecrow can anyone count seventeen by twos seventeen is an odd number  that is true replied tip greatly disappointed no one can possibly count seventeen by twos  then the pills are of no use to us wailed the pumpkinhead and this fact overwhelms me with    209 grief for i had intended wishing that my head would never spoil  nonsense said the scarecrow sharply if we could use the pills at all we would make far better wishes than that  i do not see how anything could be better protested poor jack if you were liable to spoil at any time you could understand my anxiety  for my part said the tin woodman i sympathize with you in every respect but since we cannot count seventeen by twos sympathy is all you are liable to get  by this time it had become quite dark and the voyagers found above them a cloudy sky through which the rays of the moon could not penetrate  the gump flew steadily on and for some reason the huge sofabody rocked more and more dizzily every hour  the wogglebug declared he was seasick and tip was also pale and somewhat distressed but the others clung to the backs of the sofas and did not seem to mind the motion as long as they were not tipped out  darker and darker grew the night and on and on sped the gump through the black heavens the    210 travelers could not even see one another and an oppressive silence settled down upon them  after a long time tip who had been thinking deeply spoke  how are we to know when we come to the pallace of glinda the good he asked  its a long way to glindas palace answered the woodman ive traveled it  but how are we to know how fast the gump is flying persisted the boy we cannot see a single thing down on the earth and before morning we may be far beyond the place we want to reach  that is all true enough the scarecrow replied a little uneasily but i do not see how we can stop just now for we might alight in a river or on the top of a steeple and that would be a great disaster  so they permitted the gump to fly on with regular flops of its great wings and waited patiently for morning  then tips fears were proven to be well founded for with the first streaks of gray dawn they looked over the sides of the sofas and discovered rolling plains dotted with queer villages where the houses instead of being dome shapedas they all are in the land of ozhad slanting roofs that rose to a peak    211 in the center odd looking animals were also moving about upon the open plains and the country was unfamiliar to both the tin woodman and the scarecrow who had formerly visited glinda the goods domain and knew it well  we are lost said the scarecrow dolefully the gump must have carried us entirely out of the land of oz and over the sandy deserts and into the terrible outside world that dorothy told us about  we must get back exclaimed the tin woodman earnestly we must get back as soon as possible  turn around cried tip to the gump turn as quickly as you can  if i do i shall upset answered the gump im not at all used to flying and the best plan would be for me to alight in some place and then i can turn around and take a fresh start  just then however there seemed to be no stoppingplace that would answer their purpose they flew over a village so big that the wogglebug declared it was a city and then they came to a range of high mountains with many deep gorges and steep cliffs showing plainly  now is our chance to stop said the boy finding    212 they were very close to the mountain tops then he turned to the gump and commanded stop at the first level place you see  very well answered the gump and settled down upon a table of rock that stood between two cliffs  but not being experienced in such matters the gump did not judge his speed correctly and instead of coming to a stop upon the flat rock he missed it by half the width of his body breaking off both his right wings against the sharp edge of the rock and then tumbling over and over down the cliff  our friends held on to the sofas as long as they could but when the gump caught on a projecting rock the thing stopped suddenlybottom side upand all were immediately dumped out  by good fortune they fell only a few feet for underneath them was a monster nest built by a colony of jackdaws in a hollow ledge of rock so none of themnot even the pumpkinheadwas injured by the fall for jack found his precious head resting on the soft breast of the scarecrow which made an excellent cushion and tip fell on a mass of leaves and papers which saved him from injury the wogglebug had bumped his round head against    213               full page lineart drawing                 all were immediately dumped out    214 the sawhorse but without causing him more than a moments inconvenience  the tin woodman was at first much alarmed but finding he had escaped without even a scratch upon his beautiful nickleplate he at once regained his accustomed cheerfulness and turned to address his comrades  our journey had ended rather suddenly said he and we cannot justly blame our friend the gump for our accident because he did the best he could under the circumstances but how we are ever to escape from this nest i must leave to someone with better brains than i possess  here he gazed at the scarecrow who crawled to the edge of the nest and looked over below them was a sheer precipice several hundred feet in depth above them was a smooth cliff unbroken save by the point of rock where the wrecked body of the gump still hung suspended from the end of one of the sofas there really seemed to be no means of escape and as they realized their helpless plight the little band of adventurers gave way to their bewilderment  this is a worse prison than the palace sadly remarked the wogglebug  i wish we had stayed there moaned jack    215 im afraid the mountain air isnt good for pumpkins  it wont be when the jackdaws come back growled the sawhorse which lay waving its legs in a vain endeavor to get upon its feet again jackdaws are especially fond of pumpkins  do you think the birds will come here asked jack much distressed  of course they will said tip for this is their nest and there must be hundreds of them he continued for see what a lot of things they have brought here  indeed the nest was half filled with a most curious collection of small articles for which the birds could have no use but which the thieving jackdaws had stolen during many years from the homes of men and as the nest was safely hidden where no human being could reach it this lost property would never be recovered  the wogglebug searching among the rubbishfor the jackdaws stole useless things as well as valuable onesturned up with his foot a beautiful diamond necklace this was so greatly admired by the tin woodman that the wogglebug presented it to him with a graceful speech after which the woodman hung it around his neck with much pride    216               full page lineart drawing                 turned up a beautiful diamond necklace    217 rejoicing exceedingly when the big diamonds glittered in the suns rays  but now they heard a great jabbering and flopping of wings and as the sound grew nearer to them tip exclaimed  the jackdaws are coming and if they find us here they will surely kill us in their anger  i was afraid of this moaned the pumpkinhead my time has come  and mine also said the wogglebug for jackdaws are the greatest enemies of my race  the others were not at all afraid but the scarecrow at once decided to save those of the party who were liable to be injured by the angry birds so he commanded tip to take off jacks head and lie down with it in the bottom of the nest and when this was done he ordered the wogglebug to lie beside tip nick chopper who knew from past experience just what to do then took the scarecrow to pieces all except his head and scattered the straw over tip and the wogglebug completely covering their bodies  hardly had this been accomplished when the flock of jackdaws reached them perceiving the intruders in their nest the birds flew down upon them with screams of rage    218               full page lineart drawing    219               dr nikidiks famous wishing pills   the tin woodman was usually a peaceful man but when occasion required he could fight as fiercely as a roman gladiator so when the jackdaws nearly knocked him down in their rush of wings and their sharp beaks and claws threatened to damage his brilliant plating the woodman picked up his axe and made it whirl swiftly around his head  but although many were beaten off in this way the birds were so numerous and so brave that they continued the attack as furiously as before some of them pecked at the eyes of the gump which hung over the nest in a helpless condition but the gumps eyes were of glass and could not be injured others of the jackdaws rushed at the sawhorse but that animal being still upon his back kicked out so viciously with his wooden legs that he beat off as many assailants as did the woodmans axe    220  finding themselves thus opposed the birds fell upon the scarecrows straw which lay at the center of the nest covering tip and the wogglebug and jacks pumpkin head and began tearing it away and flying off with it only to let it drop straw by straw into the great gulf beneath  the scarecrows head noting with dismay this wanton destruction of his interior cried to the tin woodman to save him and that good friend responded with renewed energy his axe fairly flashed among the jackdaws and fortunately the gump began wildly waving the two wings remaining on the left side of its body the flutter of these great wings filled the jackdaws with terror and when the gump by its exertions freed itself from the peg of rock on which it hung and sank flopping into the nest the alarm of the birds knew no bounds and they fled screaming over the mountains  when the last foe had disappeared tip crawled from under the sofas and assisted the wogglebug to follow him  we are saved shouted the boy delightedly  we are indeed responded the educated insect fairly hugging the stiff head of the gump in his joy and we owe it all to the flopping of the thing and the good axe of the woodman    221  if i am saved get me out of here called jack whose head was still beneath the sofas and tip managed to roll the pumpkin out and place it upon its neck again he also set the sawhorse upright and said to it  we owe you many thanks for the gallant fight you made  i really think we have escaped very nicely remarked the tin woodman in a tone of pride  not so exclaimed a hollow voice  at this they all turned in surprise to look at the scarecrows head which lay at the back of the nest  i am completely ruined declared the scarecrow as he noted their astonishment for where is the straw that stuffs my body  the awful question startled them all they gazed around the nest with horror for not a vestige of straw remained the    222 jackdaws had stolen it to the last wisp and flung it all into the chasm that yawned for hundreds of feet beneath the nest  my poor poor friend said the tin woodman taking up the scarecrows head and caressing it tenderly whoever could imagine you would come to this untimely end  i did it to save my friends returned the head and i am glad that i perished in so noble and unselfish a manner  but why are you all so despondent inquired the wogglebug the scarecrows clothing is still safe  yes answered the tin woodman but our friends clothes are useless without stuffing  why not stuff him with money asked tip  money they all cried in an amazed chorus  to be sure said the boy in the bottom of the nest are thousands of dollar billsand twodollar billsand fivedollar billsand tens and twenties and fifties there are enough of them to stuff a dozen scarecrows why not use the money  the tin woodman began to turn over the rubbish with the handle of his axe and sure enough what they had first thought only worthless papers were found to be all bills of various denominations    223 which the mischievous jackdaws had for years been engaged in stealing from the villages and cities they visited  there was an immense fortune lying in that inaccessible nest and tips suggestion was with the scarecrows consent quickly acted upon  they selected all the newest and cleanest bills and assorted them into various piles the scarecrows left leg and boot were stuffed with five dollar bills his right leg was stuffed with tendollar bills and his body so closely filled with fifties onehundreds and onethousands that he could scarcely button his jacket with comfort  you are now said the wogglebug impressively when the task had been completed the most valuable member of our party and as you                 lineart drawing    224 are among faithful friends there is little danger of your being spent  thank you returned the scarecrow gratefully i feel like a new man and although at first glance i might be mistaken for a safety deposit vault i beg you to remember that my brains are still composed of the same old material and these are the possessions that have always made me a person to be depended upon in an emergency  well the emergency is here observed tip and unless your brains help us out of it we shall be compelled to pass the remainder of our lives in this nest  how about these wishing pills enquired the scarecrow taking the box from his jacket pocket cant we use them to escape  not unless we can count seventeen by twos answered the tin woodman but our friend the wogglebug claims to be highly educated so he ought easily to figure out how that can be done  it isnt a question of education returned the insect its merely a question of mathematics ive seen the professor work lots of sums on the blackboard and he claimed anything could be done with xs and ys and as and such things by mixing them up with plenty of plusses and minuses and equals and so forth but he never said anything so far as    225 i can remember about counting up to the odd number of seventeen by the even numbers of twos  stop stop cried the pumpkinhead youre making my head ache  and mine added the scarecrow your mathematics seem to me very like a bottle of mixed pickles the more you fish for what you want the less chance you have of getting it i am certain that if the thing can be accomplished at all it is in a very simple manner  yes said tip old mombi couldnt use xs and minuses for she never went to school  why not start counting at a half of one asked the sawhorse abruptly then anyone can count up to seventeen by twos very easily  they looked at each other in surprise for the sawhorse was considered the most stupid of the entire party  you make me quite ashamed of myself said the scarecrow bowing low to the sawhorse  nevertheless the creature is right declared the wogglebug for twice onehalf is one and if you get to one it is easy to count from one up to seventeen by twos  i wonder i didnt think of that myself said the pumpkinhead    226  i dont returned the scarecrow youre no wiser than the rest of us are you but let us make a wish at once who will swallow the first pill  suppose you do it suggested tip  i cant said the scarecrow  why not youve a mouth havent you asked the boy  yes but my mouth is painted on and theres no swallow connected with it answered the scarecrow in fact he continued looking from one to another critically i believe the boy and the wogglebug are the only ones in our party that are able to swallow  observing the truth of this remark tip said  then i will undertake to make the first wish give me one of the silver pills  this the scarecrow tried to do but his padded gloves were too clumsy to clutch so small an object and he held the box toward the boy while tip selected one of the pills and swallowed it  count cried the scarecrow  onehalf one three five seven nine eleven counted tip thirteen fifteen seventeen  now wish said the tin woodman anxiously  but just then the boy began to suffer such fearful pains that he became alarmed    227  the pill has poisoned me he gasped oh ooooo ouch murder fire ooh and here he rolled upon the bottom of the nest in such contortions that he frightened them all  what can we do for you speak i beg entreated the tin woodman tears of sympathy running down his nickel cheeks  ii dont know answered tip oh i wish id never swallowed that pill  then at once the pain stopped and the boy rose to his feet again and found the scarecrow looking with amazement at the end of the pepperbox  whats happened asked the boy a little ashamed of his recent exhibition  why the three pills are in the box again said the scarecrow  of course they are the wogglebug declared didnt tip wish that hed never swallowed one of them well the wish came true and he didnt swallow one of them so of course they are all three in the box  that may be but the pill gave me a dreadful pain just the same said the boy  impossible declared the woggle                 lineart drawing    228 bug if you have never swallowed it the pill can not have given you a pain and as your wish being granted proves you did not swallow the pill it is also plain that you suffered no pain  then it was a splendid imitation of a pain retorted tip angrily suppose you try the next pill yourself weve wasted one wish already  oh no we havent protested the scarecrow here are still three pills in the box and each pill is good for a wish  now youre making my head ache said tip i cant understand the thing at all but i wont take another pill i promise you and with this remark he retired sulkily to the back of the nest  well said the wogglebug it remains for me to save us in my most highly magnified and thoroughly educated manner for i seem to be the only one able and willing to make a wish let me have one of the pills  he swallowed it without hesitation and they all stood admiring his courage while the insect counted seventeen by twos in the same way that tip had done and for some reasonperhaps because wogglebugs have stronger stomachs than boysthe silver pellet caused it no pain whatever  i wish the gumps broken wings mended and    229 as good as new said the wogglebug in a slow impressive voice  all turned to look at the thing and so quickly had the wish been granted that the gump lay before them in perfect repair and as well able to fly through the air as when it had first been brought to life on the roof of the palace                  lineart drawing    230               full page lineart drawing    231               the scarecrow appeals to glenda the good   hooray shouted the scarecrow gaily we can now leave this miserable jackdaws nest whenever we please  but it is nearly dark said the tin woodman and unless we wait until morning to make our flight we may get into more trouble i dont like these night trips for one never knows what will happen  so it was decided to wait until daylight and the adventurers amused themselves in the twilight by searching the jackdaws nest for treasures  the wogglebug found two handsome bracelets of wrought gold which fitted his slender arms very well the scarecrow took a fancy for rings of which there were many in the nest before long he    232 had fitted a ring to each finger of his padded gloves and not being content with that display he added one more to each thumb as he carefully chose those rings set with sparkling stones such as rubies amethysts and sapphires the scarecrows hands now presented a most brilliant appearance  this nest would be a picnic for queen jinjur said he musingly for as nearly as i can make out she and her girls conquered me merely to rob my city of its emeralds  the tin woodman was content with his diamond necklace and refused to accept any additional decorations but tip secured a fine gold watch which was attached to a heavy fob and placed it in his pocket with much pride he also pinned several jeweled brooches to jack pumpkinheads red waistcoat and attached a lorgnette by means of a fine chain to the neck of the sawhorse  its very pretty said the creature regarding the lorgnette approvingly but what is it for  none of them could answer that question however so the sawhorse decided it was some rare decoration and became very fond of it  that none of the party might be slighted they ended by placing several large seal rings upon the points of the gumps antlers although that odd    233 personage seemed by no means gratified by the attention  darkness soon fell upon them and tip and the wogglebug went to sleep while the others sat down to wait patiently for the day  next morning they had cause to congratulate themselves upon the useful condition of the gump for with daylight a great flock of jackdaws approached to engage in one more battle for the possession of the nest  but our adventurers did not wait for the assault they tumbled into the cushioned seats of the sofas as quickly as possible and tip gave the word to the gump to start  at once it rose into the air the great wings flopping strongly and with regular motions and in a few moments they were so far from the nest that the chattering jackdaws took possession without any attempt at pursuit  the thing flew due north going in the same direction from whence it had come at least that was the scarecrows opinion and the others agreed that the scarecrow was the best judge of direction after passing over several cities and villages the gump carried them high above a broad plain where houses became more and more scattered until they    234 disappeared altogether next came the wide sandy desert separating the rest of the world from the land of oz and before noon they saw the domeshaped houses that proved they were once more within the borders of their native land  but the houses and fences are blue said the tin woodman and that indicates we are in the land of the munchkins and therefore a long distance from glinda the good  what shall we do asked the boy turning to their guide  i dont know replied the scarecrow frankly if we were at the emerald city we could then move directly southward and so reach our destination but we dare not go to the emerald city and the gump is probably carrying us further in the wrong direction with every flop of its wings  then the wogglebug must swallow another pill said tip decidedly and wish us headed in the right direction  very well returned the highly magnified one im willing  but when the scarecrow searched in his pocket for the pepperbox containing the two silver wishing pills it was not to be found filled with anxiety the voyagers hunted throughout every inch of the    235 thing for the precious box but it had disappeared entirely  and still the gump flew onward carrying them they knew not where  i must have left the pepperbox in the jackdaws nest said the scarecrow at length  it is a great misfortune the tin woodman declared but we are no worse off than before we discovered the wishing pills  we are better off replied tip for the one pill we used has enabled us to escape from that horrible nest  yet the loss of the other two is serious and i deserve a good scolding for my carelessness the scarecrow rejoined penitently for in such an unusual party as this accidents are liable to happen any moment and even now we may be approaching a new danger  no one dared contradict this and a dismal silence ensued  the gump flew steadily on  suddenly tip uttered an exclamation of surprise we must have reached the south country he cried for below us everything is red  immediately they all leaned over the backs of the sofas to lookall except jack who was too careful    236 of his pumpkin head to risk its slipping off his neck sure enough the red houses and fences and trees indicated they were within the domain of glinda the good and presently as they glided rapidly on the tin woodman recognized the roads and buildings they passed and altered slightly the flight of                 lineart drawing    237 the gump so that they might reach the palace of the celebrated sorceress  good cried the scarecrow delightedly we do not need the lost wishing pills now for we have arrived at our destination  gradually the thing sank lower and nearer to the ground until at length it came to rest within the beautiful gardens of glinda settling upon a velvety green lawn close by a fountain which sent sprays of flashing gems instead of water high into the air whence they fell with a soft tinkling sound into the carved marble basin placed to receive them  everything was very gorgeous in glindas gardens and while our voyagers gazed about with admiring eyes a company of soldiers silently appeared and surrounded them but these soldiers of the great sorceress were entirely different from those of jinjurs army of revolt although they were likewise girls for glindas soldiers wore neat uniforms and bore swords and spears and they marched with a skill and precision that proved them well trained in the arts of war  the captain commanding this troopwhich was glindas private body guardrecognized the scarecrow and the tin woodman at once and greeted them with respectful salutations    238  good day said the scarecrow gallantly removing his hat while the woodman gave a soldierly salute we have come to request an audience with your fair ruler  glinda is now within her palace awaiting you returned the captain for she saw you coming long before you arrived  that is strange said tip wondering  not at all answered the scarecrow for glinda the good is a mighty sorceress and nothing that goes on in the land of oz escapes her notice i suppose she knows why we came as well as we do ourselves  then what was the use of our coming asked jack stupidly  to prove you are a pumpkinhead retorted the scarecrow but if the sorceress expects us we must not keep her waiting                 lineart drawing    239  so they all clambered out of the sofas and followed the captain toward the palaceeven the sawhorse taking his place in the queer procession  upon her throne of finely wrought gold sat glinda and she could scarcely repress a smile as her peculiar visitors entered and bowed before her both the scarecrow and the tin woodman she knew and liked but the awkward pumpkinhead and highly magnified wogglebug were creatures she had never seen before and they seemed even more curious than the others as for the sawhorse he looked to be nothing more than an animated chunk of wood and he bowed so stiffly that his head bumped against the floor causing a ripple of laughter among the soldiers in which glinda frankly joined  i beg to announce to your glorious highness began the scarecrow in a solemn voice that my emerald city has been overrun by a crowd of impudent girls with knittingneedles who have enslaved all the men robbed the streets and public buildings of all their emerald jewels and usurped my throne  i know it said glinda  they also threatened to destroy me as well as all the good friends and allies you see before you continued the scarecrow and had we not managed    240 to escape their clutches our days would long since have ended  i know it repeated glinda  therefore i have come to beg your assistance resumed the scarecrow for i believe you are always glad to succor the unfortunate and oppressed  that is true replied the sorceress slowly but the emerald city is now ruled by general jinjur who has caused herself to be proclaimed queen what right have i to oppose her  why she stole the throne from me said the scarecrow  and how came you to possess the throne asked glinda  i got it from the wizard of oz and by the choice of the people returned the scarecrow uneasy at such questioning  and where did the wizard get it she continued gravely  i am told he took it from pastoria the former king said the scarecrow becoming confused under the intent look of the sorceress  then declared glinda the throne of the emerald city belongs neither to you nor to jinjur but to this pastoria from whom the wizard usurped it  that is true acknowledged the scarecrow    241 humbly but pastoria is now dead and gone and some one must rule in his place  pastoria had a daughter who is the rightful heir to the throne of the emerald city did you know that questioned the sorceress  no replied the scarecrow but if the girl still lives i will not stand in her way it will satisfy me as well to have jinjur turned out as an impostor as to regain the throne myself in fact it isnt much fun to be king especially if one has good brains i have known for some time that i am fitted to occupy a far more exalted position but where is the girl who owns the throne and what is her name  her name is ozma answered glinda but where she is i have tried in vain to discover for the wizard of oz when he stole the throne from ozmas father hid the girl in some secret place and by means of a magical trick with which i am not familiar he also managed to prevent her being discoveredeven by so experienced a sorceress as myself  that is strange interrupted the wogglebug pompously i have been informed that the wonderful wizard of oz was nothing more than a humbug    242  nonsense exclaimed the scarecrow much provoked by this speech didnt he give me a wonderful set of brains  theres no humbug about my heart announced the tin woodman glaring indignantly at the wogglebug  perhaps i was misinformed stammered the insect shrinking back i never knew the wizard personally  well we did retorted the scarecrow and he was a very great wizard i assure you it is true he was guilty of some slight impostures but unless he was a great wizard howlet me askcould he have hidden this girl ozma so securely that no one can find her  ii give it up replied the wogglebug meekly  that is the most sensible speech youve made said the tin woodman  i must really make another effort to discover where this girl is hidden resumed the sorceress thoughtfully i have in my library a book in which is inscribed every action of the wizard while he was in our land of ozor at least every action that could be observed by my spies this book i will read carefully tonight and try to single out the acts that may guide us in discovering the lost ozma in    243 the meantime pray amuse yourselves in my palace and command my servants as if they were your own i will grant you another audience tomorrow  with this gracious speech glinda dismissed the adventurers and they wandered away through the beautiful gardens where they passed several hours enjoying all the delightful things with which the queen of the southland had surrounded her royal palace  on the following morning they again appeared before glinda who said to them  i have searched carefully through the records of the wizards actions and among them i can find but three that appear to have been suspicious he ate beans with a knife made three secret visits to old mombi and limped slightly on his left foot  ah that last is certainly suspicious exclaimed the pumpkinhead  not necessarily said the scarecrow he may have had corns now it seems to me his eating beans with a knife is more suspicious  perhaps it is a polite custom in omaha from which great country the wizard originally came suggested the tin woodman  it may be admitted the scarecrow    244  but why asked glinda did he make three secret visits to old mombi  ah why indeed echoed the wogglebug impressively  we know that the wizard taught the old woman many of his tricks of magic continued glinda and this he would not have done had she not assisted him in some way so we may suspect with good reason that mombi aided him to hide the girl ozma who was the real heir to the throne of the emerald city and a constant danger to the usurper for if the people knew that she lived they would quickly make her their queen and restore her to her rightful position  an able argument cried the scarecrow i have no doubt that mombi was mixed up in this wicked business but how does that knowledge help us  we must find mombi replied glinda and force her to tell where the girl is hidden  mombi is now with queen jinjur in the emerald city said tip it was she who threw so many obstacles in our pathway and made jinjur threaten to destroy my friends and give me back into the old witchs power  then decided glinda i will march with my    245 army to the emerald city and take mombi prisoner after that we can perhaps force her to tell the truth about ozma  she is a terrible old woman remarked tip with a shudder at the thought of mombis black kettle and obstinate too  i am quite obstinate myself returned the sorceress with a sweet smile so i do not fear mombi in the least today i will make all necessary preparations and we will march upon the emerald city at daybreak tomorrow                 lineart drawing    246               the tinwoodman plucks a rose   the army of glinda the good looked very grand and imposing when it assembled at daybreak before the palace gates the uniforms of the girl soldiers were pretty and of gay colors and their silvertipped spears were bright and glistening the long shafts being inlaid with motherofpearl all the officers wore sharp gleaming swords and shields edged with peacockfeathers and it really seemed that no foe could by any possibility defeat such a brilliant army  the sorceress rode in a beautiful palanquin which was like the body of a coach having doors and    247 windows with silken curtains but instead of wheels which a coach has the palanquin rested upon two long horizontal bars which were borne upon the shoulders of twelve servants  the scarecrow and his comrades decided to ride in the gump in order to keep up with the swift march of the army so as soon as glinda had started and her soldiers had marched away to the inspiring strains of music played by the royal band our friends climbed into the sofas and followed the gump flew along slowly at a point directly over the palanquin in which rode the sorceress  be careful said the                 lineart drawing    248 tin woodman to the scarecrow who was leaning far over the side to look at the army below you might fall  it wouldnt matter remarked the educated wogglebug he cant get broke so long as he is stuffed with money  didnt i ask you began tip in a reproachful voice  you did said the wogglebug promptly and i beg your pardon i will really try to restrain myself  youd better declared the boy that is if you wish to travel in our company  ah i couldnt bear to part with you now murmured the insect feelingly so tip let the subject drop  the army moved steadily on but night had fallen before they came to the walls of the emerald city by the dim light of the new moon however glindas forces silently surrounded the city and pitched their tents of scarlet silk upon the greensward the tent of the sorceress was larger than the others and was composed of pure white silk with scarlet banners flying above it a tent was also pitched for the scarecrows party and when these preparations had been made with military precision and quickness the army retired to rest    249  great was the amazement of queen jinjur next morning when her soldiers came running to inform her of the vast army surrounding them she at once climbed to a high tower of the royal palace and saw banners waving in every direction and the great white tent of glinda standing directly before the gates  we are surely lost cried jinjur in despair for how can our knittingneedles avail against the long spears and terrible swords of our foes  the best thing we can do said one of the girls is to surrender as quickly as possible before we get hurt  not so returned jinjur more bravely the enemy is still outside the walls so we must try to gain time by engaging them in parley go you with a flag of truce to glinda and ask her why she has dared to invade my dominions and what are her demands  so the girl passed through the gates bearing a white flag to show she was on a mission of peace and came to glindas tent tell your queen said the sorceress to the girl that she must deliver up to me old mombi to be my prisoner if this is done i will not molest her farther                 lineart drawing    250  now when this message was delivered to the queen it filled her with dismay for mombi was her chief counsellor and jinjur was terribly afraid of the old hag but she sent for mombi and told her what glinda had said  i see trouble ahead for all of us muttered the old witch after glancing into a magic mirror she carried in her pocket but we may even yet escape by deceiving this sorceress clever as she thinks herself  dont you think it will be safer for me to deliver you into her hands asked jinjur nervously  if you do it will cost you the throne of the emerald city answered the witch positively but if you will let me have my own way i can save us both very easily  then do as you please replied jinjur for it is so aristocratic to be a queen that i do not wish to be obliged to return home again to make beds and wash dishes for my mother  so mombi called jellia jamb to her and performed a certain magical rite with which she was familiar as a result of the enchantment jellia took on the form and features of mombi while the old witch grew to resemble the girl so closely that it seemed impossible anyone could guess the deception    251  now said old mombi to the queen let your soldiers deliver up this girl to glinda she will think she has the real mombi in her power and so will return immediately to her own country in the south  therefore jellia hobbling along like an aged                  lineart drawing   woman was led from the city gates and taken before glinda  here is the person you demanded said one of the guards and our queen now begs you will go away as you promised and leave us in peace  that i will surely do replied glinda much pleased if this is really the person she seems to be  it is certainly old mombi said the guard who believed she was speaking the truth and then jinjurs soldiers returned within the citys gates    252  the sorceress quickly summoned the scarecrow and his friends to her tent and began to question the supposed mombi about the lost girl ozma but jellia knew nothing at all of this affair and presently she grew so nervous under the questioning that she gave way and began to weep to glindas great astonishment  here is some foolish trickery said the sorceress her eyes flashing with anger this is not mombi at all but some other person who has been made to resemble her tell me she demanded turning to the trembling girl what is your name  this jellia dared not tell having been threatened with death by the witch if she confessed the fraud but glinda sweet and fair though she was understood magic better than any other person in the land of oz so by uttering a few potent words and making a peculiar gesture she quickly transformed the girl into her proper shape while at the same time old mombi far away in jinjurs palace suddenly resumed her own crooked form and evil features  why its jellia jamb cried the scarecrow recognizing in the girl one of his old friends  its our interpreter said the pumpkinhead smiling pleasantly  then jellia was forced to tell of the trick mombi    253                lineart drawing  had played and she also begged glindas protection which the sorceress readily granted but glinda was now really angry and sent word to jinjur that the fraud was discovered and she must deliver up the real mombi or suffer terrible consequences jinjur was prepared for this message for the witch well understood when her natural form was thrust upon her that glinda had discovered her trickery but the wicked old creature had already thought up a new deception and had made jinjur promise to carry it out so the queen said to glindas messenger  tell your mistress that i cannot find mombi anywhere but that glinda is welcome to enter the    254 city and search herself for the old woman she may also bring her friends with her if she likes but if she does not find mombi by sundown the sorceress must promise to go away peaceably and bother us no more  glinda agreed to these terms well knowing that mombi was somewhere within the city walls so jinjur caused the gates to be thrown open and glinda marched in at the head of a company of soldiers followed by the scarecrow and the tin woodman while jack pumpkinhead rode astride the sawhorse and the educated highly magnified wogglebug sauntered behind in a dignified manner tip walked by the side of the sorceress for glinda had conceived a great liking for the boy  of course old mombi had no intention of being found by glinda so while her enemies were marching up the street the witch transformed herself into a red rose growing upon a bush in the garden of the palace it was a clever idea and a trick glinda did not suspect so several precious hours were spent in a vain search for mombi  as sundown approached the sorceress realized she had been defeated by the superior cunning of the aged witch so she gave the command to her people to march out of the city and back to their tents  the scarecrow and his comrades happened to be    255 searching in the garden of the palace just then and they turned with disappointment to obey glindas command but before they left the garden the tin woodman who was fond of flowers chanced to espy a big red rose growing upon a bush so he plucked the flower and fastened it securely in the tin buttonhole of his tin bosom  as he did this he fancied he heard a low moan proceed from the rose but he paid no attention to the sound and mombi was thus carried out of the city and into glindas camp without anyone having a suspicion that they had succeeded in their quest                  lineart drawing    256               the transformation of old mombi   the witch was at first frightened at finding herself captured by the enemy but soon she decided that she was exactly as safe in the tin woodmans buttonhole as growing upon the bush for no one knew the rose and mombi to be one and now that she was without the gates of the city her chances of escaping altogether from glinda were much improved  but there is no hurry thought mombi i will wait awhile and enjoy the humiliation of this sorceress when she finds i have outwitted her so throughout the night the rose lay quietly on the woodmans bosom and in the morning when glinda summoned our friends to a consultation nick chopper carried his pretty flower with him to the white silk tent    257               lineart drawing   for some reason said glinda we have failed to find this cunning old mombi so i fear our expedition will prove a failure and for that i am sorry because without our assistance little ozma will never be rescued and restored to her rightful position as queen of the emerald city  do not let us give up so easily said the pumpkinhead let us do something else  something else must really be done replied glinda with a smile yet i cannot understand how i have been defeated so easily by an old witch who knows far less of magic than i do myself  while we are on the ground i believe it would be wise for us to conquer the emerald city for princess ozma and find the girl afterward said the scarecrow and while the girl remains hidden i will gladly rule in her place for i understand the business of ruling much better than jinjur does    258  but i have promised not to molest jinjur objected glinda  suppose you all return with me to my kingdomor empire rather said the tin woodman politely including the entire party in a royal wave of his arm it will give me great pleasure to entertain you in my castle where there is room enough and to spare and if any of you wish to be nickel plated my valet will do it free of all expense  while the woodman was speaking glindas eyes had been noting the rose in his buttonhole and now she imagined she saw the big red leaves of the flower tremble slightly this quickly aroused her suspicions and in a moment more the sorceress had decided that the seeming rose was nothing else than a transformation of old mombi at the same instant mombi knew she was discovered and must quickly plan an escape and as transformations were easy to her she immediately took the form of a shadow and glided along the wall of the tent toward the entrance thinking thus to disappear  but glinda had not only equal cunning but far more experience than the witch so the sorceress reached the opening of the tent before the shadow and with a wave of her hand closed the entrance so securely that mombi could not find a crack big    259 enough to creep through the scarecrow and his friends were greatly surprised at glindas actions for none of them had noted the shadow but the sorceress said to them  remain perfectly quiet all of you for the old witch is even now with us in this tent and i hope to capture her  these words so alarmed mombi that she quickly transformed herself from a shadow to a black ant in which shape she crawled along the ground seeking a crack or crevice in which to hide her tiny body  fortunately the ground where the tent had been pitched being just before the city gates was hard and smooth and while the ant still crawled about glinda discovered it and ran quickly forward to effect its capture but just as her hand was descending the witch now fairly frantic with fear made her last transformation and in the form of a huge griffin sprang through the wall of the tenttearing the silk asunder in her rushand in a moment had darted away with the speed of a whirlwind  glinda did not hesitate to follow she sprang upon the back of the sawhorse and cried  now you shall prove that you have a right to be alive runrunrun  the sawhorse ran like a flash he followed the    260 griffin his wooden legs moving so fast that they twinkled like the rays of a star before our friends could recover from their surprise both the griffin and the sawhorse had dashed out of sight  come let us follow cried the scarecrow  they ran to the place where the gump was lying and quickly tumbled aboard  fly commanded tip eagerly  where to asked the gump in its calm voice  i dont know returned tip who was very nervous at the delay but if you will mount into the air i think we can discover which way glinda has gone                 lineart drawing    261  very well returned the gump quietly and it spread its great wings and mounted high into the air  far away across the meadows they could now see two tiny specks speeding one after the other and they knew these specks must be the griffin and the sawhorse so tip called the gumps attention to them and bade the creature try to overtake the witch and the sorceress but swift as was the gumps flight the pursued and pursuer moved more swiftly yet and within a few moments were blotted out against the dim horizon  let us continue to follow them nevertheless said the scarecrow for the land of oz is of small extent and sooner or later they must both come to a halt  old mombi had thought herself very wise to choose the form of a griffin for its legs were exceedingly fleet and its strength more enduring than that of other animals but she had not reckoned on the untiring energy of the sawhorse whose wooden limbs could run for days without slacking their speed therefore after an hours hard running the griffins breath began to fail and it panted and gasped painfully and moved more slowly than before then it reached the edge of the desert and began racing across the deep sands but its tired feet sank far    262 into the sand and in a few minutes the griffin fell forward completely exhausted and lay still upon the desert waste  glinda came up a moment later riding the still vigorous sawhorse and having unwound a slender golden thread from her girdle the sorceress threw it over the head of the panting and helpless griffin and so destroyed the magical power of mombis transformation  for the animal with one fierce shudder disappeared from view while in its place was discovered the form of the old witch glaring savagely at the serene and beautiful face of the sorceress                 lineart drawing    263               full page lineart drawing    264               princess ozma of oz   you are my prisoner and it is useless for you to struggle any longer said glinda in her soft sweet voice lie still a moment and rest yourself and then i will carry you back to my tent  why do you seek me asked mombi still scarce able to speak plainly for lack of breath what have i done to you to be so persecuted  you have done nothing to me answered the gentle sorceress but i suspect you have been guilty of several wicked actions and if i find it is true that you have so abused your knowledge of magic i intend to punish you severely  i defy you croaked the old hag you dare not harm me  just then the gump flew up to them and alighted upon the desert sands beside glinda our friends    265 were delighted to find that mombi had finally been captured and after a hurried consultation it was decided they should all return to the camp in the gump so the sawhorse was tossed aboard and then glinda still holding an end of the golden thread that was around mombis neck forced her prisoner to climb into the sofas the others now followed and tip gave the word to the gump to return  the journey was made in safety mombi sitting in her place with a grim and sullen air for the old hag was absolutely helpless so long as the magical thread encircled her throat the army hailed glindas return with loud cheers and the party of friends soon gathered again in the royal tent which had been neatly repaired during their absence  now said the sorceress to mombi i want you to tell us why the wonderful wizard of oz paid you three visits and what became of the child ozma which so curiously disappeared  the witch looked at glinda defiantly but said not a word  answer me cried the sorceress  but still mombi remained silent  perhaps she doesnt know remarked jack  i beg you will keep quiet said tip you might spoil everything with your foolishness    266  very well dear father returned the pumpkinhead meekly  how glad i am to be a wogglebug murmured the highly magnified insect softly no one can expect wisdom to flow from a pumpkin  well said the scarecrow what shall we do to make mombi speak unless she tells us what we wish to know her capture will do us no good at all  suppose we try kindness suggested the tin woodman ive heard that anyone can be conquered with kindness no matter how ugly they may be  at this the witch turned to glare upon him so horribly that the tin woodman shrank back abashed  glinda had been carefully considering what to do and now she turned to mombi and said  you will gain nothing i assure you by thus defying us for i am determined to learn the truth about the girl ozma and unless you tell me all that you know i will certainly put you to death  oh no dont do that exclaimed the tin woodman it would be an awful thing to kill anyoneeven old mombi  but it is merely a threat returned glinda i shall not put mombi to death because she will prefer to tell me the truth  oh i see said the tin man much relieved    267  suppose i tell you all that you wish to know said mombi speaking so suddenly that she startled them all what will you do with me then  in that case replied glinda i shall merely ask you to drink a powerful draught which will cause you to forget all the magic you have ever learned  then i would become a helpless old woman  but you would be alive suggested the pumpkinhead consolingly  do try to keep silent said tip nervously  ill try responded jack but you will admit that its a good thing to be alive  especially if one happens to be thoroughly educated added the wogglebug nodding approval  you may make your choice glinda said to old mombi between death if you remain silent and the loss of your magical powers if you tell me the truth but i think you will prefer to live  mombi cast an uneasy glance at the sorceress and saw that she was in earnest and not to be trifled with so she replied slowly  i will answer your questions  that is what i expected said glinda pleasantly you have chosen wisely i assure you  she then motioned to one of her captains who brought her a beautiful golden casket from this    268 the sorceress drew an immense white pearl attached to a slender chain which she placed around her neck in such a way that the pearl rested upon her bosom directly over her heart  now said she i will ask my first question why did the wizard pay you three visits  because i would not come to him answered mombi  that is no answer said glinda sternly tell me the truth  well returned mombi with downcast eyes he visited me to learn the way i make teabiscuits  look up commanded the sorceress  mombi obeyed  what is the color of my pearl demanded glinda  whyit is black replied the old witch in a tone of wonder  then you have told me a falsehood cried glinda angrily only when the truth is spoken will my magic pearl remain a pure white in color  mombi now saw how useless it was to try to deceive the sorceress so she said meanwhile scowling at her defeat  the wizard brought to me the girl ozma who was then no more than a baby and begged me to conceal the child    269  that is what i thought declared glinda calmly what did he give you for thus serving him  he taught me all the magical tricks he knew some were good tricks and some were only frauds but i have remained faithful to my promise  what did you do with the girl asked glinda and at this question everyone bent forward and listened eagerly for the reply  i enchanted her answered mombi  in what way  i transformed her intointo  into what demanded glinda as the witch hesitated  into a boy said mombi in a low tone  a boy echoed every voice and then because they knew that this old woman had reared tip from childhood all eyes were turned to where the boy stood  yes said the old witch nodding her head that is the princess ozmathe child brought to me by the wizard who stole her fathers throne that is the rightful ruler of the emerald city and she pointed her long bony finger straight at the boy  i cried tip in amazement why im no princess ozmaim not a girl  glinda smiled and going to tip she took his small brown hand within her dainty white one    270               full page lineart drawing                 mombi pointed her long bony finger at the boy    271  you are not a girl just now said she gently because mombi transformed you into a boy but you were born a girl and also a princess so you must resume your proper form that you may become queen of the emerald city  oh let jinjur be the queen exclaimed tip ready to cry i want to stay a boy and travel with the scarecrow and the tin woodman and the woggle bug and jackyes and my friend the sawhorseand the gump i dont want to be a girl  never mind old chap said the tin woodman soothingly it dont hurt to be a girl im told and we will all remain your faithful friends just the same and to be honest with you ive always considered girls nicer than boys  theyre just as nice anyway added the scarecrow patting tip affectionately upon the head  and they are equally good students proclaimed the wogglebug i should like to become your tutor when you are transformed into a girl again  butsee here said jack pumpkinhead with a gasp if you become a girl you cant be my dear father any more  no answered tip laughing in spite of his anxiety and i shall not be sorry to escape the relationship then he added hesitatingly as he turned to    272               lineart drawing  glinda i might try it for awhilejust to see how it seems you know but if i dont like being a girl you must promise to change me into a boy again  really said the sorceress that is beyond my magic i never deal in transformations for they are not honest and no respectable sorceress likes to make things appear to be what they are not only unscrupulous witches use the art and therefore i must ask mombi to effect your release from her charm and restore you to your proper form it will be the last opportunity she will have to practice magic    273  now that the truth about princes ozma had been discovered mombi did not care what became of tip but she feared glindas anger and the boy generously promised to provide for mombi in her old age if he became the ruler of the emerald city so the witch consented to effect the transformation and preparations for the event were at once made  glinda ordered her own royal couch to be placed in the center of the tent it was piled high with cushions covered with rosecolored silk and from a golden railing above hung many folds of pink gossamer completely concealing the interior of the couch  the first act of the witch was to make the boy drink a potion which quickly sent him into a deep and dreamless sleep then the tin woodman and the wogglebug bore him gently to the couch placed him upon the soft cushions and drew the gossamer hangings to shut him from all earthly view  the witch squatted upon the ground and kindled a tiny fire of dried herbs which she drew from her bosom when the blaze shot up and burned clearly old mombi scattered a handful of magical powder over the fire which straightway gave off a rich violet vapor filling all the tent with its fragrance and forcing the sawhorse to sneezealthough he had been warned to keep quiet    274               full page lineart drawing                 mombi at her magical incantations    275  then while the others watched her curiously the hag chanted a rhythmical verse in words which no one understood and bent her lean body seven times back and forth over the fire and now the incantation seemed complete for the witch stood upright and cried the one word yeowa in a loud voice  the vapor floated away the atmosphere became clear again a whiff of fresh air filled the tent and the pink curtains of the couch trembled slightly as if stirred from within  glinda walked to the canopy and parted the silken hangings then she bent over the cushions reached out her hand and from the couch arose the form of a young girl fresh and beautiful as a may morning her eyes sparkled as two diamonds and her lips were tinted like a tourmaline all adown her back floated tresses of ruddy gold with a slender jeweled circlet confining them at the brow her robes of silken gauze floated around her like a cloud and dainty satin slippers shod her feet  at this exquisite vision tips old comrades stared in wonder for the space of a full minute and then every head bent low in honest admiration of the lovely princess ozma the girl herself cast one look into glindas bright face which glowed with pleasure and satisfaction and then turned upon the    276 others speaking the words with sweet diffidence she said  i hope none of you will care less for me than you did before im just the same tip you know onlyonly  only youre different said the pumpkinhead and everyone thought it was the wisest speech he had ever made                 lineart drawing    277               full page lineart drawing    278               the riches of content   when the wonderful tidings reached the ears of queen jinjurhow mombi the witch had been captured how she had confessed her crime to glinda and how the longlost princess ozma had been discovered in no less a personage than the boy tipshe wept real tears of grief and despair  to think she moaned that after having ruled as queen and lived in a palace i must go back to scrubbing floors and churning butter again it is too horrible to think of i will never consent  so when her soldiers who spent most of their time making fudge in the palace kitchens counseled jinjur to resist she listened to their foolish prattle and sent a sharp defiance to glinda the good and the princess ozma the result was a declaration of war and the very next day glinda marched upon the emerald city with pennants flying and bands playing    279 and a forest of shining spears sparkling brightly beneath the suns rays  but when it came to the walls this brave assembly made a sudden halt for jinjur had closed and barred every gateway and the walls of the emerald city were builded high and thick with many blocks of green marble finding her advance thus baffled glinda bent her brows in deep thought while the wogglebug said in his most positive tone  we must lay siege to the city and starve it into submission it is the only thing we can do  not so answered the scarecrow we still have the gump and the gump can still fly  the sorceress turned quickly at this speech and her face now wore a bright smile  you are right she exclaimed and certainly have reason to be proud of your brains let us go to the gump at once  so they passed through the ranks of the army until they came to the place near the scarecrows tent where the gump lay glinda and princess ozma mounted first and sat upon the sofas then the scarecrow and his friends climbed aboard and still there was room for a captain and three soldiers which glinda considered sufficient for a guard  now at a word from the princess the queer    280               lineart drawing  thing they had called the gump flopped its palmleaf wings and rose into the air carrying the party of adventurers high above the walls they hovered over the palace and soon perceived jinjur reclining in a hammock in the courtyard where she was comfortably reading a novel with a green cover and eating green chocolates confident that the walls would protect her from her enemies obeying a quick command the gump alighted safely in this very courtyard and before jinjur had time to do more than scream the captain and three soldiers    281 leaped out and made the former queen a prisoner locking strong chains upon both her wrists  that act really ended the war for the army of revolt submitted as soon as they knew jinjur to be a captive and the captain marched in safety through the streets and up to the gates of the city which she threw wide open then the bands played their most stirring music while glindas army marched into the city and heralds proclaimed the conquest of the audacious jinjur and the accession of the beautiful princess ozma to the throne of her royal ancestors  at once the men of the emerald city cast off their aprons and it is said that the women were so tired eating of their husbands cooking that they                 lineart drawing    282 all hailed the conquest of jinjur with joy certain it is that rushing one and all to the kitchens of their houses the good wives prepared so delicious a feast for the weary men that harmony was immediately restored in every family  ozmas first act was to oblige the army of revolt to return to her every emerald or other gem stolen from the public streets and buildings and so great was the number of precious stones picked from their settings by these vain girls that every one of the royal jewelers worked steadily for more than a month to replace them in their settings  meanwhile the army of revolt was disbanded and the girls sent home to their mothers on promise of good behavior jinjur was likewise released  ozma made the loveliest queen the emerald city had ever known and although she was so young and inexperienced she ruled her people with wisdom and justice for glinda gave her good advice on all occasions and the wogglebug who was appointed to the important post of public educator was quite helpful to ozma when her royal duties grew perplexing  the girl in her gratitude to the gump for its services offered the creature any reward it might name    283  then replied the gump please take me to pieces i did not wish to be brought to life and i am greatly ashamed of my conglomerate personality once i was a monarch of the forest as my antlers fully prove but now in my present upholstered condition of servitude i am compelled to fly through the airmy legs being of no use to me whatever therefore i beg to be dispersed  so ozma ordered the gump taken apart the antlered head was again hung over the mantlepiece in the hall and the sofas were untied and placed in the reception parlors the broom tail resumed its accustomed duties in the kitchen and finally the scarecrow replaced all the clotheslines and ropes on the pegs from which he had taken them on the eventful day when the thing was constructed  you might think that was the end of the gump and so it was as a flyingmachine but the head over the mantlepiece continued to talk whenever it took a notion to do so and it frequently startled with its abrupt questions the people who waited in the hall for an audience with the queen  the sawhorse being ozmas personal property was tenderly cared for and often she rode the queer creature along the streets of the emerald city she had its wooden legs shod with gold to keep them    284 from wearing out and the tinkle of these golden shoes upon the pavement always filled the queens subjects with awe as they thought upon this evidence of her magical powers  the wonderful wizard was never so wonderful as queen ozma the people said to one another in whispers for he claimed to do many things he could not do whereas our new queen does many things no one would ever expect her to accomplish  jack pumpkinhead remained with ozma to the end of his days and he did not spoil as soon as he had feared although he always remained as stupid as ever the wogglebug tried to teach him several arts and sciences but jack was so poor a student that any attempt to educate him was soon abandoned  after glindas army had marched back home and peace was restored to the emerald city the tin woodman announced his intention to return to his own kingdom of the winkies  it isnt a very big kingdom said he to ozma but for that very reason it is easier to rule and i have called myself an emperor because i am an absolute monarch and no one interferes in any way with my conduct of public or personal affairs when i get home i shall have a new coat of nickel plate for i have become somewhat marred and scratched lately    285 and then i shall be glad to have you pay me a visit  thank you replied ozma some day i may accept the invitation but what is to become of the scarecrow  i shall return with my friend the tin woodman said the stuffed one seriously we have decided never to be parted in the future  and i have made the scarecrow my royal treasurer explained the tin woodman for it has occurred to me that it is a good thing to have a royal treasurer who is made of money what do you think  i think said the little queen smiling that your friend must be the richest man in all the world  i am returned the scarecrow but not on account of my money for i consider brains far superior to money in every way you may have noticed that if one has money without brains he cannot use it to advantage but if one has brains without money they will enable him to live comfortably to the end of his days  at the same time declared the tin woodman you must acknowledge that a good heart is a thing that brains can not create and that money can not buy perhaps after all it is i who am the richest man in all the world    286  you are both rich my friends said ozma gently and your riches are the only riches worth havingthe riches of content                    the end
