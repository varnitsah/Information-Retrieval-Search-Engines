historical mysteries     i  the case of elizabeth canning      dont let your poor little       lizzie be blamed      thackeray   everyone has heard of the case of elizabeth canning writes mr john paget and till recently i agreed with him but five or six years ago the case of elizabeth canning repeated itself in a marvellous way and then but few persons of my acquaintance had ever heard of that mysterious girl  the recent case so strange a parallel to that of 1753 was this in cheshire lived a young woman whose business in life was that of a daily governess one sunday her family went to church in the morning but she set off to skate by herself on a lonely pond she was never seen of or heard of again till in the dusk of the following thursday her hat was found outside of the door of her fathers farmyard her friend discovered her further off in a most miserable condition weak emaciated and with her skull fractured her explanation was that a man had seized her on the ice or as she left it had dragged her across the fields and had shut her up in a house from which she escaped crawled to her fathers home and when she found herself unable to go further tossed her hat towards the farm door neither such a man as she described nor the house in which she had been imprisoned was ever found the girls character was excellent nothing pointed to her condition being the result dune orgie échevelée but the neighbours of course made insinuations and a lady of my acquaintance who visited the girls mother found herself almost alone in placing a charitable construction on the adventure  my theory was that the girl had fractured her skull by a fall on the ice had crawled to and lain in an unvisited outhouse of the farm and on that thursday night was wandering out in a distraught state not wandering in her story would be the result of her cerebral conditionconcussion of the brain  it was while people were discussing this affair a second edition of elizabeth cannings that one found out how forgotten was elizabeth  on january 1 1753 elizabeth was in her eighteenth year she was the daughter of a carpenter in aldermanbury her mother who had four younger children was a widow very poor and of the best character elizabeth was short of stature ruddy of complexion and owing to an accident in childhoodthe falling of a garret ceiling on her headwas subject to fits of unconsciousness on any alarm on learning this the mind flies to hysteria with its accompaniment of diabolical falseness for an explanation of her adventure but hysteria does not serve the turn the girl had been for years in service with a mr wintlebury a publican he gave her the highest character for honesty and reserve she did not attend to the customers at the bar she kept to herself she had no young man and she only left wintleburys for a better placeat a mr lyons a near neighbour of her mother lyon a carpenter corroborated as did all the neighbours on the points of modesty and honesty  on new years day 1753 elizabeth wore her holiday besta purple masquerade stuff gown a white handkerchief and apron a black quilted petticoat a green undercoat black shoes blue stockings a white shaving hat with green ribbons and a very ruddy colour she had her wages or christmasbox in her pocketa golden half guinea in a little box with three shillings and a few coppers including a farthing the pence she gave to three of her little brothers and sisters one boy however had huffed her and got no penny but she relented and when she went out bought for him a mincepie her visit of new years day was to her maternal aunt mrs colley living at saltpetre bank dock street behind the london dock she meant to return in time to buy with her mother a cloak but the colleys had a cold early dinner and kept her till about 9 pm for a hot supper  already at 9 pm mr lyon had sent to mrs cannings to make inquiries the girl was not wont to stay out so late on a holiday about 9 pm in fact the two colleys were escorting elizabeth as far as houndsditch  the rest is mystery  on elizabeths nonarrival mrs canning sent her lad a little after ten to the colleys who were in bed the night was passed in anxious search to no avail by six in the morning inquiries were vainly renewed weeks went by mrs canning aided by the neighbours advertised in the papers mentioning a report of shrieks heard from a coach in bishopsgate street in the small morning hours of january 2 the mother a churchwoman had prayers put up at several churches and at mr wesleys chapel she also consulted a cheap wise man whose aspect alarmed her but whose wisdom took the form of advising her to go on advertising it was later rumoured that he said the girl was in the hands of an old black woman and would return but mrs canning admitted nothing of all this sceptics with their usual acuteness maintained that the disappearance was meant to stimulate charity and that the mother knew where the daughter was or on the other hand the daughter had fled to give birth to a child in secret or for another reason incident to the young and gay as one of the counsel employed euphemistically put the case the medical evidence did not confirm these suggestions details are needless but these theories were certainly improbable the character of la pucelle was not more stainless than elizabeths  about 1015 pm on january 29 on the eve of the martyrdom of king charlesas the poor women dated itmrs canning was on her knees prayingso said her apprenticethat she might behold even if it were but an apparition of her daughter such was her daily prayer it was as in wordsworths affliction of margaret      i look for ghosts but none will force       their way to me tis falsely said     that ever there was intercourse       between the living and the dead  at that moment there was a sound at the door the prentice opened it and was aghast the mothers prayer seemed to be answered for there bleeding bowed double livid ragged with a cloth about her head and clad in a dirty dressingjacket and a filthy draggled petticoat was elizabeth canning she had neglected her little brother that huffed her on new years day but she had been thinking of him and now she gave her mother for him all that she hadthe farthing  you see that i am on elizabeths side that farthing touch and another with the piety honesty loyalty and even the superstition of her people have made me her partisan as was mr henry fielding the wellknown magistrate  some friends were sent for mrs myers miss polly lyon daughter of her master and others while busybodies flocked in among them one robert scarrat a toiler who had no personal knowledge of elizabeth a little wine was mulled the girl could not swallow it emaciated as she was her condition need not be described in detail but she was very near her death as the medical evidence and that of a midwife who consoled mrs canning on one point proves beyond possibility of cavil  the girl told her story but what did she tell mr austin dobson in the dictionary of national biography says that her tale gradually took shape under the questions of sympathising neighbours and certainly on some points she gave affirmative answers to leading questions asked by robert scarrat the difficulty is that the neighbours accounts of what elizabeth said in her woful condition were given when the girl was tried for perjury in aprilmay 1754 we must therefore make allowance for friendly bias and mythopoeic memory on january 31 1753 elizabeth made her statement before alderman chitty and the chief count against her is that what she told chitty did not tally with what the neighbours in may 1754 swore that she told them when she came home on january 29 1753 this point is overlooked by mr paget in his essay on the subject1  footnote 1 puzzles and paradoxes pp 317336 blackwoods 1874  on the other hand by 1754 the town was divided into two factions believers and disbelievers in elizabeth and chitty was then a disbeliever chitty took but a few notes on january 31 1753 i did not make it so distinct as i could wish not thinking it could be the subject of so much inquiry he admitted in 1754 moreover the notes which he then produced were not the notes which he made at the time but what i took since from that paper i took then january 31 1753 of hers and other persons that were brought before me this is not intelligible and is not satisfactory if elizabeth handed in a paper chitty should have produced it in 1754 if he took notes of the evidence why did he not produce the original notes  these notes made when and from what source is vague bear that elizabeths tale was this at a dead wall by bedlam in moorfields about ten pm on january 1 1753 two men stripped her of gown apron and hat robbed her of thirteen shillings and sixpence struck her stunned her and pushed her along bishopsgate street she lost consciousnessone of her fitsand recovered herself near enfield wash here she was taken to a house later said to be mother wellss where several persons were chitty unluckily does not say what sort of persons and on that point all turns she was asked to do as they did a woman forced her upstairs into a room and cut the lace of her stays told her there were bread and water in the room and that her throat would be cut if she came out the door was locked on her there was no lock the door was merely bolted she lived on fragments of a quartern loaf and water in a pitcher with the mincepie bought for her naughty little brother she escaped about four in the afternoon of january 29 in the room were an old stool or two an old picture over the chimney two windows an old table and so on she forced a pane in a window and got out on a small shed of boards or penthouse and so slid to the ground she did not say the alderman added that there was any hay in the room of bread there were four or five or five or six pieces she never mentioned the name of wells some one else did that at a venture she said she could tell nothing of the womans name the alderman issued a warrant against this mrs wells apparently on newspaper suggestion  the chief points against elizabeth were that when wellss place was examined there was no penthouse to aid an escape and no old picture but under a wretched kind of bed supporting the thing was a picture on wood of a crown madam wells had at one time used this loyal emblem as a sign she keeping a very illfamed house of call but in december 1745 when certain highland and lowland gentlemen were accompanying bonny prince charlie towards the metropolis mrs wells removed into a room the picture of the crown as being apt to cause political emotions this sign may have been the old picture as to hay there was hay in the room later searched but penthouse there was none  that is the worst point in the aldermans notes of whatever value these enigmatic documents may be held  one nash butler to the goldsmiths company was present at the examination before chitty on january 31 1753 he averred in may 1754 what chitty did not that elizabeth spoke of the place of her imprisonment as a little square darkish room with a few old pictures here the one old picture of the notes is better evidence if the notes are evidence than nashs memory but i find that he was harping on a few old pictures as early as march 1753 elizabeth said she hurt her ear in getting out of the window and in fact it was freshly cut and bleeding when she arrived at home  all this of nash is so far the better evidence as next day february 1 1753 when a most tumultuous popular investigation of the supposed house of captivity was made he says that he and others finding the dungeon not to be square small and darkish but a long narrow slit of a loft half full of hay expressed disbelief yet it was proved that he went on suggesting to lyon elizabeths master that people should give money to elizabeth and wished him success the proof was a letter of his dated february 10 1753 also nash and two likeminded friends hearing elizabeth perjure herself as they thought at the trial of mrs wells whom elizabeth never mentioned to chitty did not give evidence against heron the most absurdly flimsy excuses one man was so horrified that in place of denouncing the perjury he fled incontinent another went to a dinner and nash to goldsmiths hall to his duties as butler such was then the vigour of their scepticism  on the other hand at the trial in 1754 the neighbours reported elizabeths tale as told on the night when she came home more dead than alive mrs myers had known elizabeth for eleven years a very sober honest girl as any in england mrs myers found her livid her fingers stood crooked mrs canning mrs woodward and polly lyon were then present and mrs myers knelt beside elizabeth to hear her story it was as chitty gave it till the point where she was carried into a house the several persons there she said were an elderly woman and two young ones her stays were cut by the old woman she was then thrust upstairs into a room wherein was hay a pitcher of water and bread in pieces bread may have been brought in water too while she slept a point never noted in the trials she heard the name of mother wills or wells mentioned  now scarrat in 1754 said that he being present on january 29 1753 and hearing of the house offered to bet a guinea to a farthing that it was mother wellss but mrs myers believed that elizabeth had mentioned hearing that name earlier and mrs myers must have heard scarrat if he suggested it before elizabeth named it the point is uncertain  mrs woodward was in mrs cannings room a quarter of an hour after elizabeths arrival the girl said she was almost starved to death in a house on the hertfordshire road which she knew by seeing the hertford coach with which she was familiar go by the woman who cut her stays was a tall black swarthy woman scarrat said that was not mrs wells which was fair on scarrats part elizabeth described the two young women as being one fair the other dark so scarrat swore wintlebury her old master and several others corroborated  if these accounts by mrs myers mrs woodward scarrat wintlebury and others are trustworthy then elizabeth cannings narrative is true for she found the two girls the tall swarthy woman the hay and the broken waterpitcher and almost everything else that she had mentioned on january 29 at mother wellss house when it was visited on february 1 but we must remember that most accounts of what elizabeth said on january 29 and on january 31 are fifteen months after date and are biassed on both sides  to mother wellss the girl was taken on february 1 in what a company the coach or cab was crammed full some friends walked several curious citizens rode and when elizabeth arrived at the house nash the butler and other busybodies had made a descent on it the officer with the warrant was already there lyon aldridge and hague were with nash in a cab and were met by others riding hard who had seized the people found at mrs wellss there was a rabble of persons on foot and on horse about the door  on entering the doorway the parlour was to your left the house staircase in front of you on your right the kitchen at the further end thereof was a door and when that was opened a flight of stairs led to a long slit of a loft which nash later declared did not answer to elizabeths description especially as there was hay and before chitty elizabeth had mentioned none there was a filthy kind of bed on which now slept a labourer and his wife fortune and judith natus nash kept talking about the hay and one adamson rode to meet elizabeth and came back saying that she said there was hay by adamsons account he only asked her what kind of place was it and she said a wild kind of place with hay in it as in the neighbours version of her first narrative mrs myers who was in the coach corroborated adamson  the point of the sceptics was that till adamson rode back to her on her way to wellss house she had never mentioned hay they argued that adamson had asked her was there hay in the room and that she taking the hint had said yes by may 1754 adamson and mrs myers who was in the cab with elizabeth would believe that adamson had asked what kind of place is it and that elizabeth then spoke without suggestion of the hay the point would be crucial but nobody in 1754 appears to have remembered that on february 21 three weeks after the event at the trial of mother wells adamson had given exactly the same evidence as in may 1754 i returned to meet her and asked her about the room she described the room with some hay in it  an odd sort of an empty room  arriving at mother wellss elizabeth very faint was borne in and set on a dresser in the kitchen why did she not at once say my room was up the stairs beyond the door at the further end of the room i know not unless she was dazed as she well might be next she with a mob of the curious was carried into the parlour where were all the inmates of the house she paid no attention to mrs wells but at once picked out a tall old woman huddled over the fire smoking a pipe she did this by the sceptical nashs evidence instantly and without hesitation the old woman rose she was tall and swarthy a gipsy and according to all witnesses inconceivably hideous her underlip was the size of a small childs arm and she was marked with some disease pray look at this face she said i think god never made such another she was named mary squires she added that on january 1 she was in dorsetat abbotsbury said her son george who was present  in 1754 thirtysix people testified to mary squiress presence in dorset or to meeting her on her way to london while twentyseven at enfield alone swore as positively that they had seen her and her daughter at or near mrs wellss and had conversed with her between december 18 1752 and the middle of january some of the enfield witnesses were of a more prosperous and educated class than the witnesses for the gipsy many on both sides had been eager to swear indeed many had made affidavits as early as march 1753  this business of the crossswearing is absolutely inexplicable on both sides the same entire certainty was exhibited as a rule yet the woman was unmistakable as she justly remarked the gipsy at all events had her alibi ready at once her denial was as prompt and unhesitating as elizabeths accusation but if guilty she had enjoyed plenty of time since the girls escape to think out her line of defence if guilty it was wiser to allege an alibi than to decamp when elizabeth made off for she could not hope to escape pursuit george squires her son so prompt with his at abbotsbury on january 1 could not tell in may 1754 where he had passed the christmas day before that new years day and christmas is a notable day elizabeth also recognised in lucy squires the gipsys daughter and in virtue hall the two girls dark and fair who were present when her stays were cut  after the recognition elizabeth was carried through the house and according to nash in the loft up the stairs from the kitchen she said in answer to his question this is the room for here is the hay i lay upon but i think there is more of it she also identified the pitcher with the broken mouth which she certainly mentioned to chitty as that which held her allowance of water a chest or nest of drawers she declared that she did not remember an attempt was made to suggest that one of her party brought the pitcher in with him to confirm her account this attempt failed but that she had mentioned the pitcher was admitted mrs myers in may 1754 quoted elizabeths words as to there being more hay exactly in the terms of nash mrs myers was present in the loft and added that elizabeth took her foot and put the hay away and showed the gentlemen two holes and said they were in the room when she was in it before  on february 7 elizabeth swore to her narrative formally made out by her solicitor before the author of tom jones and mr fielding by threats of prosecution if she kept on shuffling induced virtue hall to corroborate after she had vexed his kind heart by endless prevarications but as virtue hall was later got at by the other side and recanted we leave her evidence on one side  on february 2126 mary squires was tried at the old bailey and condemned to death virtue hall corroborating elizabeth mrs wells was branded on the hand three dorset witnesses to the gipsys alibi were not credited and fortune and judith natus did not appear in court though subpoenaed in 1754 they accounted for this by their fear of the mob the three sceptics nash hague and aldridge held their peace the lord mayor sir crispin gascoyne who was on the bench at the trial of squires and wells was dissatisfied he secured many affidavits which seem unimpeachable for the gipsys alibi and so did the other side for her presence at enfield he also got at virtue hall or rather a sceptical dr hill got at her and handed her over to gascoyne she as we saw recanted george squires the gipsys son with an attorney worked up the evidence for the gipsys alibi she received a free pardon and on april 29 1754 there began the trial of elizabeth canning for wilful and corrupt perjury  mr davy opening for the crown charitably suggested that elizabeth had absconded to preserve her character and had told a romantic story to raise money and having by this time subdued all remains of virtue she preferred the offer of money though she must wade through innocent bloodthat of the gipsyto attain it  these hypotheses are absurd her character certainly needed no saving  mr davy then remarked on the gross improbabilities of the story of elizabeth they are glaring but as fielding said so are the improbabilities of the facts somebody had stripped and starved and imprisoned the girl that is absolutely certain she was brought within an inch of her life she did not suffer all these things to excite compassion that is out of the question had she plunged into gaiety on new years night the consequences would be other than instant starvation they might have been guilty splendour she had been most abominably misused and it was to the last degree improbable that any mortal should so misuse an honest quiet lass but the grossly improbable had certainly occurred it was next to impossible that in 1856 a respectablelooking man should offer to take a little boy for a drive and that six weeks later the naked body of the boy who had been starved to death should be found in a ditch near acton but the facts occurred2 to squires and wells a rosy girl might prove more valuable than a little boy to anybody  footnote 2 paget p 332  that elizabeth could live for a month on a loaf did not surprise mrs canning when things were very hard with her said mrs canning the child had lived on half a roll a day this is that other touch which with the story of the farthing helps to make me a partisan of elizabeth  mr davy said that on january 31 before chitty elizabeth did not pretend to certainty about mrs wells she never did at any time she neither knew nor affected to know anything about mrs wells she had only seen a tall swarthy woman a dark girl and a fair girl whom she recognised in the gipsy her daughter and virtue hall mr davy preferred nashs evidence to that of all the neighbours and even to chittys notes when nash and chitty varied mr davy said that nash withdrew his assistance after the visit to the house it was proved we saw by his letter of february 10 that he did not withdraw his assistance which like that of mr tracy tupman took the form of hoping that other people would subscribe money  certain varieties of statement as to the time when elizabeth finished the water proved fatal and the penthouse of chittys notes was played for all that it was worth it was alleged as matter of fact that adamson brought the broken pitcher into the housethis by mr willes later solicitorgeneral now for three months before february 1 adamson had not seen elizabeth canning nor had he heard her description of the room he was riding and could not carry a gallon pitcher in his coat pocket he could not carry it in john gilpins fashion and whatever else was denied it was admitted that from the first elizabeth mentioned the pitcher the statement of mr willes that adamson brought in the pitcher was one that no barrister should have made  the natus pair were now brought in to say that they slept in the loft during the time that elizabeth said she was there as a reason for not giving evidence at the gipsys trial they alleged fear of the mob as we saw  the witnesses for the gipsys alibi were called mrs hopkins of south parrot dorset was not very confident that she had seen the gipsy at her inn on december 29 1752 she if mary squires she was told mrs hopkins that they sold hardware in fact they sold soft ware smuggled nankin and other stuffs alice farnham recognised the gipsies whom she had seen after new christmas new style they said they would come to see me after the old christmas holidayswhich is unlikely  lucy squires the daughter was clean well dressed and teste mr davy she was pretty she was not called  george squires was next examined he had been well tutored as to what he did after december 29 but could not tell where he was on christmas day four days earlier his memory only existed from the hour when he arrived at mrs hopkinss inn at south parrot december 29 1752 his own counsel must have been amazed but in crossexamination mr morton showed that for all time up to december 29 1752 georges memory was an utter blank on january 1 george dined he said at abbotsbury with one clarke a sweetheart of his sister they had two boiled fowls but clarke said they had only a part of a fowl between them there was such a discrepancy of evidence here as to time on the part of one of the gipsys witnesses that mr davy told him he was drunk yet he persisted that he kissed lucy squires at an hour when lucy to suit the case could not have been present  there was documentary evidencea letter of lucy to clarke from basingstoke it was dated january 18 1753 but the figure after 175 was torn off the postmark that was the only injury to the letter had there not been a battalion of as hard swearers to the presence of the gipsies at enfield in decemberjanuary 17521753 as there was to their absence from enfield and to their presence in dorset the gipsy party would have proved their case as matters stand we must remember that the dorset evidence had been organised by a solicitor that the route was one which the squires party habitually used that by the confession of mr davy the prosecuting counsel the squires family stood in with the smuggling interest compact and unscrupulous they were gipsies dealing in smuggled goods said mr davy again while george squires had been taught his lesson like a parrot the prosecution dared not call his sister pretty lucy as a witness they said that george was stupid but that lucy was much more dull the more stupid was george the less unlikely was he to kidnap elizabeth canning as prize of war after robbing her but she did not swear to him  as to the presence of the gipsies at mrs wellss at enfield as early as january 19 mrs howard swore her husband lived on his own property and her house with a well which she allowed the villagers to use was opposite mrs wellss mrs howard had seen the gipsy girl at the well and been curtsied to by her at a distance of three or four yards she had heard earlier from her servants of the arrival of the gipsies and had looked wishfully or earnestly at them she was not so positive as to mary squires whom she had seen at a greater distance  william headland swore to seeing mary squires on january 9 he fixed the date by a marketday also on the 12th he saw her in mrs wellss house he picked up a bloodstained piece of thin lead under the window from which elizabeth escaped and took it to his mother who corroborated samuel story who knew mary squires from of old saw her on december 22 in white webs lane so called from the old house noted as a meetingplace of the gunpowder plot conspirators story was a retired clockmaker mr smith a tenant of the duke of portland saw mary squires in his cowhouse on december 15 1752 she wanted leave to camp there as she had done in other years the gipsies then lost a pony several witnesses swore to this and one swore to conversations with mary squires about the pony she gave her name and said that it was on the clog by which the beast was tethered  loomworth dane swore to mary squires whom he had observed so closely as to note a great hole in the heel of her stocking the date was old christmas day 1752 dane was landlord of the bell at enfield and a maker of horsecollars sarah star whose house was next to mrs wellss saw mary squires in her own house on january 18 or 19 mary wanted to buy pork and hung about for threequarters of an hour offering to tell fortunes mrs star got rid of her by a present of some pigs flesh she fixed the date by a document which she had given to miles a solicitor it was not in court james pratt swore to talk with mary squires before christmas as to her lost pony she had then a man with her he was asked to look round the court to see if the man was present whereon george squires ducked his head and was rebuked by the prosecuting counsel mr davy who said it does not look well it was hardly the demeanour of conscious innocence but pratt would not swear to him mary squires told pratt that she would consult a cunningman about the lost pony and mr nares foolishly asked why a cunning woman should consult a cunning man one black fellow will often tell you that he can and does something magical whilst all the time he is perfectly aware that he cannot and yet firmly believes that some other man can really do it so write messrs spencer and gillen in their excellent book on the native tribes of central australia p 130 and so it was with the gipsy who though a wise woman believed in a wise man  this witness pratt said with great emphasis upon my oath that is the woman i am positive in my conscience and i am sure that it was no other woman this is the woman i saw at that blessed time moreover she gave him her name as the name on the clog of the lost pony the affair of the pony was just what would impress a man like pratt and on the gipsies own version they had no pony with them in their march from dorset  all this occurred before pratt left his house which was on december 22 three days before new christmas he then left enfield for cheshunt and his evidence carries conviction  in some other cases witnesses were very stupidcould not tell in what month christmas fell one witness an old woman made an error confusing january 16 with january 23 a document on which she relied gave the later date  if witnesses on either side were a year out in their reckoning the discrepancies would be accountable but pratt for example could not forget when he left enfield for cheshunt and farmer smith and mrs howard could be under no such confusion of memory it may be prejudice but i rather prefer the enfield evidence in some ways as did mr paget in others the dorset evidence seems better  elizabeth had sworn to having asked a man to point out the way to london after she escaped into the lane beside mrs wellss house a man thomas bennet swore that on january 29 1753 he met a miserable poor wretch about halfpast four near the tenmile stone in a lane she asked her way to london she said she was affrighted by the tanners dog the tanners house was about two hundred yards nearer london and the prosecution made much of this as if a dog with plenty of leisure and a feud against tramps could not move two hundred yards or much more if he were taking a walk abroad to combat the object of his dislike bennet knew that the dog was the tanners probably he saw the dog when he met the wayfarer and it does not follow that the wayfarer herself called it the tanners dog bennet fixed the date with precision four days later hearing of the trouble at mrs wellss bennet said i will be hanged if i did not meet the young woman near this place and told her the way to london mr davy could only combat bennet by laying stress on the wayfarers talking of the tanners dog but the dog at the moment of the meeting was probably well in view bennet knew him and bennet was not asked did the woman call the dog the tanners dog or do you say this of your own knowledge moreover the tannery was well in view and the hound may have conspicuously started from that base of operations mr davys reply was a quibble  his closing speech merely took up the old line elizabeth was absent to conceal a misfortune her cunning mother was her accomplice there was no proof of elizabeths unchastity nay she had an excellent character but there is a time gentlemen when people begin to be wicked if engaged for the other side mr davy would have placed his nemo repente fuit turpissimusno person of unblemished character wades straight into innocent blood to use his own phrase  the recorder summed up against elizabeth he steadily assumed that nash was always right and the neighbours always wrong as to the girls original story he said nothing of bennet the tanners dog had done for bennet he said that if the enfield witnesses were right the dorset witnesses were wilfully perjured he did not add that if the dorset witnesses were right the enfield testifiers were perjured  the jury brought in a verdict of guilty of perjury but not wilful and corrupt this was an acquittal but the recorder refusing the verdict they did what they were desired to do and sentence was passed two jurors made affidavit that they never intended a conviction the whole point had turned in the minds of the jury on a discrepancy as to when elizabeth finished the water in the broken pitcheron wednesday january 27 or on friday january 29 both accounts could not be true here then was perjury thought the jury but not wilful and corrupt not purposeful but the jury had learned that the court was impatient they had already brought elizabeth in guilty of perjury by which they meant guilty of a casual discrepancy not unnatural in a person hovering between life and death they thought that they could not go back on their guilty and so they went all the way to corrupt and wilful perjurymurder by false oathand consistently added an earnest recommendation to mercy  by a majority of one out of seventeen judges elizabeth was banished for seven years to new england she was accused in the press of being an enthusiast but the rev william reyner who attended her in prison publicly proclaimed her a good churchwoman and a good girl june 7 1754 elizabeth june 24 stuck to her guns in a manifestoshe had not once knowingly deviated from the truth  mr davy had promised the jury that when elizabeth was once condemned all would come outthe whole secret but though the most careful attempts were made to discover her whereabouts from january 1 to january 29 1753 nothing was ever found outa fact most easily explained by the hypothesis that she was where she said she was at mother wellss  as to elizabeths later fortunes accounts differ but she quite certainly married in connecticut a mr treat a respectable yeoman said to have been opulent she died in connecticut in june 1773 leaving a family  in my opinion elizabeth canning was a victim of the common sense of the eighteenth century she told a very strange tale and commonsense holds that what is strange cannot be true yet something strange had undeniably occurred it was very strange if elizabeth on the night of january 1 retired to become a mother of which there was no appearance while of an amour even gossip could not furnish a hint it was very strange if having thus retired she was robbed starved stripped and brought to deaths door bleeding and broken down it was very strange that no vestige of evidence as to her real place of concealment could ever be discovered it was amazingly strange that a girl previously and afterwards of golden character should in a moment aim by perjury at innocent blood but the eighteenth century as represented by mr davy mr willes the barrister who fabled in court and the recorder found none of these things one half so strange as elizabeth cannings story mr henry fielding who had some knowledge of human nature was of the same opinion as the present candid inquirer in this case writes the author of tom jones one of the most simple girls i ever saw if she be a wicked one hath been too hard for me i am firmly persuaded that elizabeth canning is a poor honest simple innocent girl  moi aussi buti would not have condemned the gipsy                                       in this case the most perplexing thing of all is to be found in the conflicting unpublished affidavits sworn in march 1753 when memories as to the whereabouts of the gipsies were fresh they form a great mass of papers in state papers domestic at the record office i owe to mr courtney kenny my knowledge of the two unpublished letters of fielding to the duke of newcastle which follow  my lord dukei received an order from my lord chancellor immediately after the breaking up of the council to lay before your grace all the affidavits i had taken since the gipsy trial which related to that affair i then told the messenger that i had taken none as indeed the fact is the affidavits of which i gave my lord chancellor an abstract having been all sworn before justices of the peace in the neighbourhood of endfield and remain i believe in the possession of an attorney in the city  however in consequence of the commands with which your grace was pleased to honour me yesterday i sent my clerk immediately to the attorney to acquaint him with the commands which i doubt not he will instantly obey this i did from my great duty to your grace for i have long had no concern in this affair nor have i seen any of the parties lately unless once when i was desired to send for the girl canning to my house that a great number of noblemen and gentlemen might see her and ask her what questions they pleased i am with the highest duty  my lord  your graces most obedient and most humble servant  henry fielding  ealing april 14 1753  his grace the duke of newcastle  endorsed ealing april 14th 1753 mr fielding r 16th  my lord dukei am extremely concerned to see by a letter which i have just received from mr jones by command of your grace that the persons concerned for the prosecution have not yet attended your grace with the affidavits in cannings affair i do assure you upon my honour that i sent to them the moment i first received your graces commands and having after three messages prevailed with them to come to me i desired them to fetch the affidavits that i might send them to your grace being not able to wait on you in person this they said they could not do but would go to mr hume campbell their council and prevail with him to attend your grace with all their affidavits many of which i found were sworn after the day mentioned in the order of council i told them i apprehended the latter could not be admitted but insisted in the strongest terms on their laying the others immediately before your grace and they at last promised me they would nor have i ever seen them since  i have now again ordered my clerk to go to them to inform them of the last commands i have received but as i have no compulsory power over them i cannot answer for their behaviour which indeed i have long disliked and have therefore long ago declined giving them any advice nor would i unless in obedience to your grace have anything to say to a set of the most obstinate fools i ever saw and who seem to me rather to act from a spleen against my lord mayor than from any motive of protecting innocence tho that was certainly their motive at first3 in truth if i am not deceived i suspect that they desire that the gipsey should be pardoned and then to convince the world that she was guilty in order to cast the greater reflection on him who was principally instrumental in obtaining such pardon i conclude with assuring your grace that i have acted in this affair as i shall on all occasions with the most dutiful regard to your commands and that if my life had been at stake as many know i could have done no more i am with the highest respect  my lord duke  yr graces most obedient and most humble servant  henry fielding  ealing april 27 1753 his grace the duke of newcastle  endorsed ealing april 27th 1753 mr fielding  footnote 3 my italics did fielding abandon his belief in elizabeth     ii  the murder of escovedo   many a man says de quincey can trace his ruin to a murder of which perhaps he thought little enough at the time this remark applies with peculiar force to philip ii of spain to his secretary antonio perez to the steward of perez to his page and to a number of professional ruffians all of these from the king to his own scullion were concerned in the slaying of juan de escovedo secretary of philips famous natural brother don john of austria all of them in different degrees had bitter reason to regret a deed which at the moment seemed a commonplace political incident  the puzzle in the case of escovedo does not concern the manner of his taking off or the identity of his murderers these things are perfectly well known the names of the guilty from the king to the bravo are ascertained the mystery clouds the motives for the deed why was escovedo done to death did the king have him assassinated for purely political reasons really inadequate but magnified by the suspicious royal fancy or were the secretary of philip ii and the monarch of spain rivals in the affections of a oneeyed widow of rank and did the secretary perez induce philip to give orders for escovedos death because escovedo threatened to reveal to the king their guilty intrigue sir william stirlingmaxwell and monsieur mignet accepted with shades of difference this explanation mr froude on the other hand held that philip acted for political reasons and with the full approval of his very illinformed conscience there was no lady as a motive in the case in mr froudes opinion a third solution is possible philip perhaps wished to murder escovedo for political reasons and without reference to the tender passion but philip was slow and irresolute while perez who dreaded escovedos interference with his love affair urged his royal master on to the crime which he was shirking we may never know the exact truth but at least we can study a state of morals and manners at madrid compared with which the blundering tragedies of holyrood in queen marys time seem mere childs play the lambs of bothwell are lambs playful and gentle when set beside the instruments of philip ii  the murdered man escovedo and the first murderer as shakespeare says antonio perez had both been trained in the service of ruy gomez philips famous minister gomez had a wife aña de mendoza who being born in 1546 was aged thirtytwo not thirtyeight as m mignet says in 1578 when escovedo was killed but 1546 may be a misprint for 1540 she was blind in one eye in 1578 but probably both her eyes were brilliant in 1567 when she really seems to have been philips mistress or was generally believed so to be eleven years later at the date of the murder there is no obvious reason to suppose that philip was constant to her charms her husband created prince deboli had died in 1573 or as mr froude says in 1567 the princess was now a widow and really if she chose to distinguish her husbands old secretary at this date the kings secretary antonio perez there seems no reason to suppose that philip would have troubled himself about the matter that he still loved aña with a constancy far from royal that she loved perez that perez and she feared that escovedo would denounce them to the king is m mignets theory of the efficient cause of escovedos murder yet m mignet holds and rightly that philip had made up his mind as far as he ever did make up his mind to kill escovedo long before that diplomatist became an inconvenient spy on the supposed lovers  to raise matters to the tragic height of the phædra of euripides perez was said to be the natural son of his late employer gomez the husband of his alleged mistress probably perez was nothing of the sort he was the bastard of a man of his own name and his alleged mistress the widow of gomez may even have circulated the other story to prove that her relations with perez though intimate were innocent they are a pretty set of people  as for escovedo he and perez had been friends from their youth upwards while perez passed from the service of gomez to that of philip in 1572 escovedo was appointed secretary to the nobly adventurous don john of austria the court believed that he was intended to play the part of spy on don john but he fell under the charm of that gallant heart and readily accepted if he did not inspire the most daring projects of the victor of lepanto the sword of christendom this was very inconvenient for the leadenfooted philip who never took time by the forelock but always brooded over schemes and let opportunity pass don john on the other hand was all for forcing the game and when he was sent to temporise and conciliate in the low countries and withdraw the spanish army of occupation his idea was to send the spanish forces out of the netherlands by sea when once they were on blue water he would make a descent on england rescue the captive mary stuart marry her he was incapable of fear restore the catholic religion and wear the english crown a good plot approved of by the pope but a plot which did not suit the genius of philip he placed his leaden foot upon the scheme and on various other gallant projects conceived in the best manner of alexandre dumas now escovedo to whom don john was devotedly attached was the soul of all these chivalrous designs and for that reason philip regarded him as a highly dangerous person escovedo was at madrid when don john first went to the low countries 1576 he kept urging philip to accept don johns fiery proposals though antonio perez entreated him to be cautious at this date 1576 perez was really the friend of escovedo but escovedo would not be advised he wrote an impatient memorial to the king denouncing his stitchless policy descosido his dilatory shambling idealess proceedings so at least sir william stirlingmaxwell asserts in his don john of austria the word used by escovedo was descosido unstitched but mr froude says that philip used the expression later in reference to another letter of escovedos which he also called a bloody letter january 1578 here mr froude can hardly be right for philips letter containing that vulgar expression is of july 1577  in any case in 1576 philip was induced by the intercession of perez to overlook the fault and escovedo whose presence don john demanded was actually sent to him in december 1576 from this date both don john and escovedo wrote familiarly to their friend perez while perez lured them on and showed their letters to the king just as charles i commissioned the duke of hamilton to spy on the covenanted nobles and pretend to sympathise with them and talk in their godly style so philip gave perez orders to entrap don john and escovedo perez said i want no theology but my own to justify me and philip wrote in reply my theology takes the same view of the matter as your own  at this time 1577 perez though a gambler and a profligate who took presents from all hands must have meant nothing worse on m mignets theory than to serve philip as he loved to be served and keep him well informed of don johns designs escovedo was not yet according to m mignet an obstacle to the amours of perez and the kings mistress the princess deboli sir william stirlingmaxwell on the other hand holds that the object of perez already was to ruin don john for what reason sir william owns that he cannot discover indeed perez had no such object unless don john confided to him projects treasonous or dangerous to the government of his own master the king  now did don john or escovedo entrust perez with designs not merely chivalrous and impracticable but actually traitorous certainly don john did nothing of the kind escovedo left him and went without being called for to spain arriving in july 1577 during his absence don john defeated the dutch protestants in the battle of gemblours on january 31 1578 he then wrote a letter full of chivalrous loyalty to escovedo and perez at madrid he would make philip master indeed of the low countries he asked escovedo and perez to inspire the king with resolution to do that was impossible but philip could never have desired to murder escovedo merely because he asked help for don john yet no sooner did escovedo announce his return to spain in july 1577 than philip in a letter to perez said we must hasten to despatch him before he kills us there seems to be no doubt that the letter in which this phrase occurs is authentic though we have it only in a copy but is the phrase correctly translated the words priesa á despacherle antes que nos mate certainly may be rendered we must be quick and despatch him escovedo before he kills us but mr froude much more lenient to philip than to mary stuart proposes to render the phrase we must despatch escovedo quickly ie send him about his business before he worries us to death mr froude thus denies that in 1577 philip already meant to kill escovedo it is unlucky for mr froudes theory and for philips character if the king used the phrase twice in march 1578 he wrote to perez about escovedo act quickly antes que nos matebefore he kills us so perez averred at least but is his date correct this time perez did act and escovedo was butchered if perez tells truth in 1577 philip meant what he said despatch him before he kills us  why did philip thus dread escovedo we have merely the published statements of perez in his account of the affair after giving the general causes of philips distrust of don john and the ideas which a deeply suspicious monarch may very well have entertained considering the adventurous character of his brother perez adds a special charge against escovedo he vowed says perez that after conquering england he and don john would attack spain escovedo asked for the captaincy of a castle on a rock commanding the harbour of santander he was alcalde of that town he and don john would use this fortress as aramis and fouquet in the novel of dumas meant to use belle isle against their sovereign as a matter of fact escovedo had asked for the command of mogro the fortress commanding santander in the spring of 1577 and perez told philip that the place should be strengthened for the protection of the harbour but not entrusted to escovedo don johns loyalty could never have contemplated the use of the place as a keep to be held in an attack on his king but if perez had in 1577 no grudge against escovedo as being perilous to his alleged amour with the princess deboli then the murderous plan of philip must have sprung from the intense suspiciousness of his own nature not from the promptings of perez  escovedo reached spain in july 1577 he was not killed till march 31 1578 though attempts on his life were made some weeks earlier m mignet argues that till the early spring of 1578 philip held his hand because perez lulled his fears that escovedo then began to threaten to disclose the love affair of perez to his royal rival and that perez in his own private interest now changed his tune and in place of mollifying philip urged him to the crime but philip was so dilatory that he could not even commit a murder with decent promptitude escovedo was not dangerous even to his mind while he was apart from don john but as weeks passed don john kept insisting by letter on the return of escovedo and for that reason possibly philip screwed his courage to the literally sticking point and escovedo was stuck major martin hume however argues that by this time circumstances had changed and philip had now no motive for murder  the impression of m mignet and of sir william stirlingmaxwell the biographer of don john is quite different they hold that the princess deboli in 1578 was philips mistress that she deceived him with perez that escovedo threatened to tell all and that perez therefore hurried on his murder had this been the state of affairs would escovedo have constantly accepted the invitations of perez to dinner the men would necessarily have been on the worst of terms if escovedo was threatening perez but escovedo in fact kept on dining with perez again the policy of perez would have been to send escovedo where he wanted to go to flanders well out of the way back to don john it seems probable enough though not certain that in 1567 the princess and philip were lovers but it is most unlikely and it is not proved that philip was still devoted to the lady in 1578 some of the princesss family the mendozas now wanted to kill perez as a dishonour to their blood at the trial of perez later much evidence was given to show that he loved the princess or was suspected of doing so but it is not shown that this was a matter about which philip had any reason to concern himself thus it is not inconceivable that escovedo disliked the relations between perez and the princess but nothing tends to show that he could have made himself dangerous by revealing them to the king moreover if he spoke his mind to perez on the matter the two would not have remained as apparently they did on terms of the most friendly intercourse a squire of perez described a scene in which escovedo threatened to denounce the princess but how did the squire become a witness of the scene in which the princess defied escovedo in terms of singular coarseness  at all events when philip consulted the marquis of los velez on the propriety of killing escovedo rather than sending him back to don john the reasons which convinced the marquis were mere political suspicions  it was at that time a question of conscience whether a king might have a subject assassinated if the royal motives though sufficient were not such as could be revealed with safety in a court of justice on these principles queen mary had a right to take darnley off for excellent political causes which could not safely be made public for international reasons mary however unlike philip did not consult her confessor who believed her to be innocent of her husbands death the confessor of philip told him that the king had a perfect right to despatch escovedo and philip gave his orders to perez he repeated says perez in 1578 his words used in 1577 make haste before he kills us  as to this point of conscience the right of a king to commit murder on a subject for reasons of state protestant opinion seems to have been lenient when the ruthvens were killed at perth on august 5 1600 in an affair the most mysterious of all mysteries the rev robert bruce a stern presbyterian refused to believe that james vi had not planned their slaughter but your majesty might have secret reasons said bruce to the king who naturally and truly maintained his own innocence this looks as if mr bruce like the confessor of philip held that a king had a right to murder a subject for secret reasons of state the inquisition vigorously repudiated the doctrine when maintained by a spanish preacher but knox approved of king henrys darnleys murder of riccio my sympathies on this point are with the inquisition  perez having been commissioned to organise the crime handed on the job to martinez his steward martinez asked a ruffianly page enriquez if i knew anybody in my country murcia who would stick a knife into a person enriquez said i will speak about it to a muleteer of my acquaintance as in fact i did and the muleteer undertook the business but later hearing that a man of importance was to be knifed enriquez told perez that a muleteer was not noble enough the job must be entrusted to persons of more consideration  enriquez in 1585 confessed for a good reason perez had absurdly mismanaged the business all sorts of people were employed and after the murder they fled and began to die punctually in an alarming manner naturally enriquez thought that perez was acting like the mures of auchendrane who despatched a series of witnesses and accomplices in their murder of kennedy as they always needed a new accomplice to kill the previous accomplice then another to slay the slayer and so on the mures if unchecked would have depopulated scotland enriquez surmised that his turn to die would soon come so he confessed and was corroborated by diego martinez thus the facts came out and this ought to be a lesson to murderers  as the muleteer hung fire perez determined to poison escovedo but he did not in the least know how to set about it science was hardly in her infancy if you wanted to poison a man in scotland you had to rely on a vulgar witch or send a man to france at great expense to buy the stuff and the messenger was detected and tortured the court of spain was not more scientific  martinez sent enriquez to murcia to gather certain poisonous herbs and these were distilled by a venal apothecary the poison was then tried on a barndoor fowl which was not one penny the worse but martinez somehow procured a certain water that was good to be given as a drink perez asked escovedo to dinner enriquez waited at table and in each cup of wine that escovedo drank he rather homoeopathically put a nutshellful of the water escovedo was no more poisoned than the cock of the earlier experiment it was ascertained that the beverage produced no effect whatever  a few days later escovedo again dined with the hospitable perez on this occasion they gave him some white powder in a dish of cream and also gave him the poisoned water in his wine thinking it a pity to waste that beverage this time escovedo was unwell and again when enriquez induced a scullion in the royal kitchen to put more of the powder in a basin of broth in escovedos own house for this the poor kitchenmaid who cooked the broth was hanged in the public square of madrid sin culpa  pious philip was demoralising his subjects at a terrible rate but you cannot make an omelet without breaking eggs philip slew that girl of his kitchen as surely as if he had taken a gun and shot her but probably the royal confessor said that all was as it should be  in spite of the resources of spanish science escovedo persisted in living and perez determined that he must be shot or stabbed enriquez went off to his own country to find a friend who was an assassin and to get a stiletto with a very fine blade much better than a pistol to kill a man with enriquez keeping a good thing in the family enlisted his brother and martinez from aragon brought two proper kind of men juan de nera and insausti who with the kings scullion undertook the job perez went to alcala for holy week just as the good regent murray left edinburgh on the morning of darnleys murder after sermon have a halibi was the motto of both gentlemen  the underlings dogged escovedo in the evening of easter monday enriquez did not come across him but insausti did his business with one thrust in a workmanlike way the scullion hurried to alcala and told the news to perez who was highly delighted  we leave this good and faithful servant and turn to don john when he far away heard the news he was under no delusions about love affairs as the cause of the crime he wrote to his wretched brother the king in grief greater than i can describe the king he said had lost the best of servants a man without the aims and craft which are now in vogue i may with just reason consider myself to have been the cause of his death the blow was really dealt at don john he expressed the most touching anxiety for the wife and children of escovedo who died poor because unlike perez he had clean hands he besought philip by the love of our lord to use every possible diligence to know whence the blow came and to punish it with the rigour which it deserves he himself will pay the most pressing debts of the dead from beaumont april 20 1578  probably the royal caitiff was astonished by this letter on september 20 don john wrote his last letter to his brother desiring more than life some decision on your majestys part give me orders for the conduct of affairs philip scrawled in the margin i will not answer but don john had ended his letter our lives are at stake and all we ask is to lose them with honour these are like the last words of the last letter of the great montrose to charles ii with the more alacrity and vigour i go to search my death like montrose don john carried with him fidelity and honour to the grave he died after a cruel illness on october 1 brantôme says that he was poisoned by order of the king at the instigation of perez the side of his breast was yellow and black as if burned and crumbled at the touch these things were always said when a great personage died in his bed they are probably untrue but a king who could conscientiously murder his brothers friend could as conscientiously and for the same reasons murder his brother  the princess deboli rewarded and sheltered one of the murderers of escovedo they were all gratified with chains of gold silver cups abundance of golden écus and commissions in the army all were sent out of the country and some began to die strangely which as we saw frightened enriquez into his confession 1585  at once perez was suspected he paid a visit of condolence to young escovedo he spoke of a love affair of escovedos in flanders an injured husband must be the guilty man but suspicion darkened perez complained to the king that he was dogged watched crossexamined by the alcalde and his son the escovedo family had a friend in vasquez another royal secretary knowing nothing of the kings guilt and jealous of perez he kept assuring the king that perez was guilty that there was an amour detected by escovedo that escovedo perished for a womans sake that philip must investigate the case and end the scandal the woman of course was the princess deboli philip cared nothing for her now at least mr froude says that don gaspar moro in his work on the princess has disproved conclusively the imagined liaison between the princess and philip ii on the other hand philip was darkly concerned in litigations about property against the princess these affairs vasquez conducted while perez naturally was on the side of the widow of his benefactor on these points more than a hundred letters of vasquez exist meanwhile he left and the escovedo family left no stone unturned to prove that perez murdered escovedo because escovedo thwarted his amour with the princess  philip had promised again and again to stand by perez but the affair was coming to light and if it must come out it suited philip that vasquez should track perez on the wrong trail the trail of the amour not follow the right scent which led straight to the throne and the wretch who sat on it but neither course could be quite pleasant to the king  perez offered to stand his trial knowing that evidence against him could not be found his accomplices were far away he would be acquitted as bothwell was acquitted of darnleys death philip could not face the situation he bade perez consult the president of the council de pazos a bishop and tell him all while de pazos should mollify young escovedo the bishop a casuist actually assured young escovedo that perez and the princess are as innocent as myself the bishop did not agree with the inquisition he could say that perez was innocent because he only obeyed the kings murderous orders young escovedo retreated vasquez persevered and the princess deboli writing to the king called vasquez a moorish dog philip had both perez and the princess arrested for vasquez was not to be put down his business in connection with the litigations was to pursue the princess and philip could not tell vasquez that he was on the wrong trail the lady was sent to her estates this satisfied vasquez and perez and he were bound over to keep the peace but suspicion hung about perez and philip preferred that it should be so the secretary was accused of peculation he had taken bribes on all hands and he was sentenced to heavy fines and imprisonment january 1585 now enriquez confessed and a kind of secret inquiry of which the records survive dragged its slow course along perez was under arrest in a house near a church he dropped out of a window and rushed into the church the civil power burst open the gates violated sanctuary and found our friend crouching all draped with festoons of cobwebs in the timber work under the roof the church censured the magistrates but they had got perez and philip defied the ecclesiastical courts perez a prisoner tried to escape by the aid of one of escovedos murderers who was staunch but failed while his wife was ill treated to make him give up all the compromising letters of the king he did give up two sealed trunks full of papers but his ally and steward martinez had first it is said selected and secreted the royal notes which proved the guilt of philip  apparently the king thought himself safe now and actually did not take the trouble to see whether his compromising letters were in the sealed trunks or not at least if he did know that they were absent and that perez could produce proof of his guilt it is hard to see why with endless doubts and hesitations he allowed the secret process for murder against perez to drag on after a long interruption into 1590 vasquez examined and reexamined perez but there was still only one witness against him the scoundrel enriquez one was not enough  a new step was taken the royal confessor assured perez that he would be safe if he told the whole truth and declared openly that he had acted by the royal orders perez refused philip commanded again jan 4 1590 perez must now reveal the kings motive for decreeing the murder if philip was setting a trap for perez that trap only caught him if he could not produce the kings compromising letters which in fact he still possessed mr froude asserts that philip had heard from his confessor and he from the wife of perez that the letters were still secreted and could be produced if so perez would be safe and the kings character would be lost what was philips aim and motive would he declare the letters to be forgeries no other mortal of that day wrote such an unmistakable hand as his it was the worst in the world he must have had some loophole or he would never have pressed perez to bear witness to his own crime a loophole he had and perez knew it for otherwise he would have obeyed orders told the whole story and been set free he did not mr froude supposes that he did not think the royal authority would satisfy the judges but they could not condemn perez a mere accessory to philip without condemning the king and how could the judges do that perez i think would have taken his chance of the judges severity as against their king rather than disobey the kings command to confess all and so have to face torture he did face the torture which proves perhaps that he knew philip could somehow escape from the damning evidence of his own letters philips loophole major martin hume thinks was this if perez revealed the kings reasons for ordering the murder they would appear as obsolete at the date of the deed pedro alone would be culpable in any case he faced torture  like most people in his circumstances he miscalculated his own power of bearing agony he had not the endurance of the younger auchendrane murderer of mitchell the choice covenanting assassin of the gallant jacobite nevile payne tortured nearly to death by the minions of the dutch usurper william of orange all of these bore the torment and kept their secrets but eight turns of the rope opened the mouth of perez whose obstinacy had merely put him to great inconvenience yet he did not produce philips letters in corroboration he said that they had been taken from him however next day diego martinez who had hitherto denied all saw that the game was up and admitted the truth of all that enriquez had confessed in 1585  about a month after the torture perez escaped his wife was allowed to visit him in prison she had been the best the bravest the most devoted of women if she had reason for jealousy of the princess which is by no means certain she had forgiven all she had moved heaven and earth to save her husband in the dominican church at high mass she had thrown herself upon the kings confessor demanding before that awful presence on the altar that the priest should refuse to absolve the king unless he set perez free  admitted to her husbands prison she played the trick that saved lord ogilvy from the dungeon of the covenanters that saved argyle nithsdale and james mòr macgregor perez walked out of gaol in the dress of his wife we may suppose that the guards were bribed there is always collusion in these cases one of the murderers had horses round the corner and perez who cannot have been badly injured by the rack rode thirty leagues and crossed the frontier of aragon  we have not to follow his later adventures the refusal of the aragonese to give him up to castile their rescue of him from the inquisition cost them their constitution and about seventy of them were burned as heretics but perez got clear away he visited france where henry iv befriended him he visited england where bacon was his host in 1594  he published his relaciones and told the world the story of philips conscience that story must not be relied on of course and the autograph letters of philip as to the murder of escovedo are lost but the copies of them at the hague are regarded as authentic and the convincing passages are underlined in red ink  supposing it possible that philip after all secured the whole of the autograph correspondence and that perez only succeeded in preserving the copies now at the hague we should understand why perez would not confess the kings crime he had only copies of his proofs to show and copies were valueless as evidence but it is certain that perez really had the letters  bloody perez as bacons mother called him died at paris in november 1611 outliving the wretched master whom he had served so faithfully queen elizabeth tried to induce amyas paulet to murder mary stuart paulet as a man of honour refused he knew too that elizabeth would abandon him to the vengeance of the scots perez ought to have known that philip would desert him his folly was rewarded by prison torture and confiscation which were not more than the man deserved who betrayed and murdered the servant of don john of austria       notethis essay was written when i was unaware that major      martin hume had treated the problem in transactions of the      royal historical society 1894 pp 71107 and in      españoles é ingleses 1903 the latter work doubtless      represents major humes final views he has found among the      additional mss of the british museum 28269 a quantity of      the contemporary letters of perez which supplement the      copies at the hague of other letters destroyed after the      death of perez from these mss and other original sources      unknown to mr froude and to monsieur mignet see the      second edition of his antonio perez paris 1846 major      humes theory is that for political reasons philip gave      orders that escovedo should be assassinated this was in      late october or early november 1577 the order was not then      carried out the reason of the delay i do not clearly      understand the months passed and escovedos death ceased      in altered circumstances to be politically desirable but      he became a serious nuisance to perez and his mistress the      princess deboli philip had never countermanded the murder      but perez according to major hume falsely alleges that the      king was still bent on the murder and that other statesmen      were consulted and approved of it shortly before the      actual deed4 perez gives this impression by a crafty      manipulation of dates in his narrative when he had escovedo      slain he was fighting for his own hand but philip who had      never countermanded the murder was indifferent till in      1582 when he was with alva in portugal the king now      learned that perez had behaved abominably had poisoned his      mind against his brother don juan had communicated state      secrets to the princess deboli and had killed escovedo      not in obedience to the royal order but using that order as      the shield of his private vengeance hence philips      severities to perez hence his final command that perez      should disclose the royal motives for the destruction of      escovedo they would be found to have become obsolete at the      date when the crime was committed and on perez would fall      the blame  footnote 4 see p 38 supra       such is major humes theory if i correctly apprehend it      the hypothesis leaves the moral character of philip as black      as ever he ordered an assassination which he never even      countermanded his confessor might applaud him but he knew      that the doctors of the inquisition like the common      sentiment of mankind rejected the theory that kings had the      right to condemn and execute by the dagger men who had      been put to no public trial     iii  the campden mystery   i  the ordinary historical mystery is at least so far clear that one or other of two solutions must be right if we only knew which perkin warbeck was the rightful king or he was an impostor giacopo stuardo at naples 1669 was the eldest son of charles ii or he was a humbug the man in the iron mask was certainly either mattioli or eustache dauger james vi conspired against gowrie or gowrie conspired against james vi and so on there is reason and human nature at the back of these puzzles but at the back of the campden mystery there is not a glimmer of reason or of sane human nature except on one hypothesis which i shall offer the occurrences are to all appearance motiveless as the events in a feverish dream the whole matter is dark and mysterious which we must therefore leave unto him who alone knoweth all things in his due time to reveal and to bring to light  so says the author of a true and perfect account of the examination confession trial and execution of joan perry and her two sons john and richard perry for the supposed murder of will harrison gent being one of the most remarkable occurrences which hath happened in the memory of man sent in a letter by sir thomas overbury of burton in the county of gloucester knt and one of his majestys justices of the peace to thomas shirly doctor of physick in london also mr harrisons own account c london printed for john atkinson near the chapter house in st pauls churchyard no date but apparently of 1676  such is the vast and breathless title of a pamphlet which by undeserved good luck i have just purchased the writer sir thomas overbury the nephew and heir says mr john paget of the unhappy victim of the infamous countess of somerset who had the elder overbury poisoned in the tower was the justice of the peace who acted as juge dinstruction in the case of harrisons disappearance5  footnote 5 paget paradoxes and puzzles p 342 blackwoods 1874  to come to the story in 1660 william harrison gent was steward or factor to the viscountess campden in chipping campden gloucestershire a singlestreeted town among the cotswold hills the lady did not live in campden house whose owner burned it in the great rebellion to spite the rebels as castle tirrim was burned by its jacobite lord in the 15 harrison inhabited a portion of the building which had escaped destruction he had been for fifty years a servant of the hickeses and campdens his age was seventy which deepens the mystery he was married and had offspring including edward his eldest son  on a market day in 1659 mr harrisons house was broken into at high noon while he and his whole family were at the lecture in church a puritan form of edification a ladder had been placed against the wall the bars of a window on the second story had been wrenched away with a ploughshare which was left in the room and 140l of lady campdens money were stolen the robber was never discovereda curious fact in a small and lonely village the times however were disturbed and a wandering cavalier or roundhead soldier may have cracked the crib not many weeks later harrisons servant perry was heard crying for help in the garden he showed a sheeppick with a hacked handle and declared that he had been set upon by two men in white with naked swords and had defended himself with his rustic tool it is curious that mr john paget a writer of great acuteness and for many years police magistrate at hammersmith says nothing of the robbery of 1659 and of perrys crazy conduct in the garden6 perrys behaviour there and his hysterical invention of the two armed men in white give the key to his character the two men in white were never traced of course but later we meet three men not less flagitious and even more mysterious they appear to have been three men in buckram  footnote 6 see his paradoxes and puzzles pp 337370 and for good reading see the book passim  at all events in quiet campden adventures obviously occurred to the unadventurous they culminated in the following year on august 16 1660 harrison left his house in the morning  and walked the two miles to charringworth to collect his ladys rents the autumn day closed in and between eight and nine oclock old mrs harrison sent the servant john perry to meet his master on the way home lights were also left burning in harrisons window that night neither master nor man returned and it is odd that the younger harrison edward did not seek for his father till very early next morning he had the convenience for nocturnal search of a moon which rose late in the morning edward went out and met perry returning alone he had not found his master the pair walked to ebrington a village half way between campden and charringworth and learned that harrison had called on the previous evening as he moved home through ebrington at the house of one daniel the hour is not given but harrison certainly disappeared when just beyond ebrington within less than a mile from campden edward and perry next heard that a poor woman had picked up on the highway beyond ebrington near some whins or furze a hat band and comb which were harrisons they were found within about half a mile of his own house the band was bloody the hat and comb were hacked and cut please observe the precise words of sir thomas overbury the justice who took the preliminary examinations the hat and comb being hacked and cut and the band bloody but nothing more could there be found therefore the hat and comb were not on harrisons head when they were hacked and cut otherwise they must have been bloodstained the band worn about the throat was bloody but there was no trace of blood on the road this passage contains the key to the puzzle  on hearing of the discovery of these objects all the people rushed to hunt for harrisons corpse which they did not find  an old man like harrison was not likely to stay at charringworth very late but it seems that whatever occurred on the highway happened after twilight  suspicion fell on john perry who was haled before the narrator sir thomas overbury jp perry said that after starting for charringworth to seek his master on the previous evening about 845 pm he met by the way william reed of campden and explained to him that as he was timid in the dark he would go back and take edward harrisons horse and return perry did as he had said and reed left him at mr harrisons court gate perry dallied there till one pierce came past and with pierce he did not say why he went a bows shot into the fields and so back once more to harrisons gate he now lay for an hour in a hen house he rose at midnight and againthe moon having now risen and dispelled his fearshe started for charringworth he lost his way in a mist slept by the roadside proceeded in the dawn to charringworth and found that harrison had been there on the previous day then he came back and met edward harrison on his way to seek his father at charringworth  perrys story is like a tale told by an idiot but reed pierce and two men at charringworth corroborated as far as their knowledge went certainly perry had been in company with reed and pierce say between nine and ten on the previous night now if evil had befallen harrison it must have been before ten at night he would not stay so late if sober at charringworth was he usually sober the cool way in which his wife and son took his absence suggests that he was a latewandering old boy they may have expected perry to find him in his cups and tuck him up comfortably at charringworth or at ebrington  till august 24 perry was detained in prison or odd to say at the inn he told various tales a tinker or a servant had murdered his master and hidden him in a beanrick where on search being made non est inventus harrison and the rents he had collected were vanished in the azure perry now declared that he would tell all to overbury and to no other man to him perry averred that his mother and brother joan and richard perry had murdered harrison it was his brother who by john perrys advice and connivance had robbed the house in the previous year while john had a halibi being at church the brother said john buried the money in the garden it was sought for but was not found his story of the two men in white who had previously attacked him in the garden was a lie he said i may add that it was not the lie of a sane man perry was conspicuously crazy  he went on with his fables his mother and brother he declared had often asked him to tell them when his master went to collect rents he had done so after harrison started for charringworth on the morning of august 16 john perry next gave an account of his expedition with his brother in the evening of the fatal day an account which was incompatible with his previous tale of his doings and with the authentic evidence of reed and pierce their honest version destroyed perrys new falsehood he declared that richard perry and he had dogged harrison as he came home at night into lady campdens grounds harrison had used a key to the private gate richard followed him into the grounds john perry after a brief stroll joined him there and found his mother how did she come thither and richard standing over the prostrate harrison whom richard incontinently strangled they seized harrisons money and meant to put his body in the great sink by wallingtons mill john perry left them and knew not whether the body was actually thrown into the sink in fact non est inventus in the sink any more than in the beanrick john next introduced his meeting with pierce but quite forgot that he had also met reed and did not account for that part of his first story which reed and pierce had both corroborated the hat comb and band john said that he himself had carried away from harrisons body had cut them with his knife and thrown them into the highway whence the blood on the band came he neglected to say  on the strength of this impossible farrago of insane falsehoods joan and richard perry were arrested and brought before overbury not only the sink but the campden fishpools and the ruinous parts of the house were vainly searched in quest of harrisons body on august 25 the three perrys were examined by overbury and richard and the mother denied all that john laid to their charge john persisted in his story and richard admitted that he and john had spoken together on the morning of the day when harrison vanished but nothing passed between them to that purpose  as the three were being brought back from overburys house to campden an unfortunate thing happened john was going foremost when richard a good way behind dropped a ball of inkle from his pocket one of his guards picked it up and richard said that it was only his wifes hairlace at one end however was a slipknot the finder took it to john who being a good way in front had not seen his brother drop it on being shown the string john shook his head and said that to his sorrow he knew it for that was the string his brother strangled his master with to this circumstance john swore at the ensuing trial  the assizes were held in september and the perrys were indicted both for the robbery in 1659 and the murder in 1660 they pleaded guilty to the first charge as some one in court whispered to them to do for the crime was covered by the act of pardon and oblivion passed by charles ii at his happy restoration if they were innocent of the robbery as probably they were they acted foolishly in pleading guilty we hear of no evidence against them for the robbery except johns confession which was evidence perhaps against john but was none against them they thus damaged their case for if they were really guilty of the robbery from harrisons house they were the most likely people in the neighbourhood to have robbed him again and murdered him very probably they tied the rope round their own necks by taking advantage of the good kings indemnity they later withdrew their confession and probably were innocent of the theft in 1659 transcribers note original has 1559  on the charge of murder they were not tried in september sir christopher turner would not proceed because the body of harrison was not found there was no corpus delicti no evidence that harrison was really dead meanwhile john perry as if to demonstrate his lunacy declared that his mother and brother had tried to poison him in prison at the spring assizes in 1661 sir b hyde less legal than sir christopher turner did try the perrys on the charge of murder how he could do this does not appear for the account of the trial is not in the record house and i am unable at present to trace it in the arminian magazine john wesley publishes a story of a man who was hanged for murdering another man whom he afterwards met in one of the spanish colonies of south america i shall not here interrupt the tale of the perrys by explaining how a hanged man met a murdered man but the anecdote proves that to inflict capital punishment for murder without proof that murder has been committed is not only an illegal but an injudicious proceeding probably it was assumed that harrison if alive would have given signs of life in the course of nine or ten months  at the trial in spring all three perrys pleaded not guilty johns confession being proved against him he told them he was then mad and knew not what he said there must have been some evidence against richard he declared that his brother had accused others besides him being asked to prove this he answered that most of those that had given evidence against him knew it but named none so evidence had been given perhaps to the effect that richard had been flush of money but by whom and to what effect we do not know  the perrys were probably not of the best repute the mother joan was supposed to be a witch this charge was seldom brought against popular wellliving people how intense was the fear of witches at that date we know from the stories and accounts of trials in glanvils sadducismus triumphatus the neighbours probably held that joan perry would as a witch be nane the waur o a hanging she was put to death first under the belief that any hypnotic or other unholy influence of hers which prevented her sons from confessing would be destroyed by her death we are not aware that posthypnotic suggestion is removed by the death of the suggester the experiment has not been tried the experiment failed in joans case poor richard who was hanged next could not induce the dogged and surly john to clear his character by a dying declaration such declarations were then held irrefragable evidence at least in scotland except when as in the case of george sprot hanged for the gowrie conspiracy it did not suit the presbyterians to believe the dying man when john was being turned off he said that he knew nothing of his masters death nor what was become of him but they might hereafter possibly hear did john know something it would not surprise me if he had an inkling of the real state of the case   ii  they did hear but what they heard and what i have now to tell was perfectly incredible when some years two apparently had passed will harrison gent like the three silly ewes in the folkrhyme came hirpling hame where had the old man been he explained in a letter to sir thomas overbury but his tale is as hard to believe as that of john perry  he states that he left his house in the afternoon not the morning of thursday august 16 1660 he went to charringworth to collect rents but lady campdens tenants were all out harvesting august seems an odd month for rentcollecting when one thinks of it they came home late which delayed harrison till the close of the evening he only received 23 l which john perry said at his first examination in 1660 had been paid by one edward plaisterer and plaisterer corroborated harrison then walked homeward in the dusk probably and near ebrington where the road was narrow and bordered by whins there met me one horseman who said art thou there afraid of being ridden over harrison struck the horse on the nose and the rider with a sword struck at him and stabbed him in the side it was at this point of the road where the whins grew that the cut hat and bloody band were found but a thrust in the side would not make a neckband bloody two other horsemen here came up one of them wounded harrison in the thigh they did not now take his 23l but placed him behind one of them on horseback handcuffed him and threw a great cloak over him  now is it likely that highwaymen would carry handcuffs which closed says harrison with a spring and a snap the story is pure fiction and bad at that suppose that kidnapping not robbery was the motive which would account for the handcuffs what had any mortal to gain by kidnapping for the purpose of selling him into slavery a gent of seventy years of age  in the night they took harrisons money and tumbled me down a stonepit in an hour they dragged him out again and he naturally asked what they wanted with him as they had his money already one of these miscreants wounded harrison again andstuffed his pockets full of a great quantity of money if they had a great quantity of money what did they want with 23l we hear of no other robberies in the neighbourhood of which misdeeds the money might have been the profits and why must harrison carry the money it has been suggested that to win popular favour they represented themselves as smugglers and harrison with the money as their gallant purser wounded in some heroic adventure  they next rode till late on august 17 and then put harrison down bleeding and sorely bruised with the carriage of the money at a lonely house here they gave their victim broth and brandy on saturday they rode all day to a house where they slept and on sunday they brought harrison to deal and laid him down on the ground this was about three in the afternoon had they wanted to make for the sea they would naturally have gone to the west coast while one fellow watched harrison two met a man and i heard them mention seven pounds the man to whom seven pounds were mentioned wrenshaw was his name as harrison afterwards heardwhere said that he thought harrison would die before he could be put on board a ship que diable allaitil faire dans cette galère harrison was however put on board a casual vessel and remained in the ship for six weeks      where was the land to which the ship would go     far far ahead is all the sailors know  harrison does not say into what foam of perilous seas in faery lands forlorn the ship went wandering for six mortal weeks like lord bateman      he sailéd east and he sailéd west     until he came to famed turkee     where he was taken and put in prison     till of his life he was wearee  then the master of the ship came and told me and the rest who were in the same condition that he discovered three turkish ships the rest who were in the same condition we are to understand that a whole cargo of harrisons was kidnapped and consigned captive to a vessel launched on ocean on the off chance that the captain might meet three turkish rovers who would snap them up at this rate of carrying on there must have been disappearances as strange as harrisons from dozens of english parishes in august 1660 had a crew of kidnappers been taking captives for purposes of private fiscal policy they would have shipped them to the virginian plantations where turkish galleys did not venture and they would not have kidnapped men of seventy moreover kidnappers would not damage their captives by stabbing them in the side and thigh when no resistance was made as was done to harrison  the rest who were in the same condition were dumped down near smyrna where the valuable harrison was sold to a grave physician this turk he was eightyseven years of age and preferred crowland in lincolnshire before all other places in england no inquiries are known to have been made about a turkish medical man who once practised at crowland in lincolnshire though if he ever did he was likely to be remembered in the district this turk he employed harrison in the still room and as a hand in the cotton fields where he once knocked his slave down with his fistpretty well for a turk of eightyseven he also gave harrison whom he usually employed in the chemical department of his business a silver bowl double gilt to drink in and named him bollhis way of pronouncing bowlno doubt he had acquired a lincolnshire accent  this turk fell ill on a thursday and died on saturday when harrison tramped to the nearest port bowl and all two men in a hamburg ship refused to give him a passage but a third for the price of his silvergilt bowl let him come aboard harrison was landed without even his bowl at lisbon where he instantly met a man from wisbech in lincolnshire this good samaritan gave harrison wine strong waters eight stivers and his passage to dover whence he came back to campden much to the amazement of mankind we do not hear the names of the ship and skipper that brought harrison from lisbon to dover wrenshaw the man to whom seven pounds were mentioned is the only person named in this delirious tissue of nonsense  the editor of our pamphlet says many question the truth of this account mr harrison gives of himself and his transportation believing he was never out of england i do not wonder at their scepticism harrison had all his days been a man of sober life and conversation we are told and the odd thing is that he left behind him a considerable sum of his ladys money in his house he did not see any of the perrys on the night of his disappearance the editor admits that harrison as an article of merchandise was not worth his freight to deal still less to smyrna his son in his absence became lady campdens steward and behaved but ill in that situation some suspected that this son arranged the kidnapping of harrison but if so why did he secure the hanging of john perry in chains on broadway hill where he might daily see him  that might be a blind but young harrison could not expect john perry to assist him by accusing himself and his brother and mother which was the most unlookedfor event in the world nor could he know that his father would come home from charringworth on august 16 1660 in the dark and so arrange for three horsemen in possession of a heavy weight of specie to stab and carry off the aged sire young harrison had not a great fardel of money to give them and if they were already so rich what had they to gain by taking harrison to deal and putting him with others in the same condition on board a casual ship they could have left him in the stonepit he knew not who they were and the longer they rode by daylight with a hatless handcuffed and sorely wounded prisoner his pockets overburdened with gold the more risk of detection they ran a company of three men ride in broad daylight through england from gloucestershire to deal behind one of them sits a wounded and hatless and handcuffed captive his pockets bulging with money nobody suspects anything no one calls the attention of a magistrate to this extraordinary démarche it is too absurd  the story told by harrison is conspicuously and childishly false at every baiting place at every inn these weird riders must have been challenged if harrison told truth he must have named the ship and skipper that brought him to dover  dismissing harrisons myth we ask what could account for his disappearance he certainly walked on the evening of august 16 to within about half a mile of his house he would not have done that had he been bent on a senile amour involving his absence from home and had that scheme of pleasure been in his mind he would have provided himself with money again a fit of ambulatory somnambulism and the emergence of a split or secondary personality with forgetfulness of his real name and address is not likely to have seized on him at that very moment and place if it did as there were no railways he could not rush off in a crowd and pass unnoticed through the country  once more the theory of ambulatory somnambulism does not account for his hacked hat and bloody band found near the whins on the road beyond ebrington nor does his own story account for them he was stabbed in the side and thigh he says this would not cut his hat or ensanguine his band on the other hand he would leave pools and tracks of blood on the roadthe high way but nothing more could there be found no pools or traces of blood on the road it follows that the hacked hat and bloody band were a designed false trail not left there by john perry as he falsely swore but by some other persons  the inference is that for some reason harrisons presence at campden was inconvenient to somebody he had lived through most troubled times and had come into a changed state of affairs with new masters he knew some secret of the troubled times he was a witness better out of the way he may conceivably have held a secret that bore on the case of one of the regicides or that affected private interests for he was the trusted servant of a great family he was therefore spirited away a trail certainly falsethe cut hat and bloody bandwas laid by an amazing coincidence his servant john perry went more or less madhe was not sane on the evening of thursday august 16 and accused himself his brother and mother harrison was probably never very far from campden during the two or three years of his disappearance it was obviously made worth his while to tell his absurd story on his return and to accept the situation no other hypothesis colligates the facts what harrison knew why his absence was essential we cannot hope to discover but he never was a captive in famed turkee mr paget writes it is impossible to assign a sufficient motive for kidnapping the old man  much profit was not likely to arise from the sale of the old man as a slave obviously there was no profit especially as the old man was delivered in a wounded and imperfect condition but a motive for keeping harrison out of the way is only hard to seek because we do not know the private history of his neighbours roundheads among them may have had excellent reasons under the restoration for sequestering harrison till the revenges of the restoration were accomplished on this view the mystery almost ceases to be mysterious for such mad selfaccusations as that of john perry are not uncommon7  footnote 7 not only have i failed to trace the records of the assize at which the perrys were tried but the newspapers of 1660 seem to contain no account of the trial as they do in the case of the drummer of tedworth 1663 and miss em thompson who kindly undertook the search has not even found a ballad or broadside on the campden wonder in the british museum the pamphlet of 1676 has frequently been republished in whole or in part as in state trials vol xiv in appendix to the case of captain green which see infra p 193 et seq     iv  the case of allan breck   who killed the red fox what was the secret that the celts would not communicate to mr rl stevenson when he was writing kidnapped like william of deloraine i know but may not tell at least i know all that the celt knows the greatgrandfather and grandfather of a friend of mine were with james stewart of the glens the victim of hanoverian injustice in a potato field near the road from ballachulish ferry to appin when they heard a horse galloping at a breakneck pace whoever the rider is said poor james he is not riding his own horse the galloper shouted glenure has been shot  well said james to his companion whoever did it i am the man that will hang for it  hanged he was the pit in which his gibbet stood is on the crest of a circular knowe or hummock on the east side of the ballachulish hotel overlooking the ferry across the narrows where the tide runs like a great swift river  i have had the secret from two sources the secret which i may not tell one informant received it from his brother who when he came to mans estate was taken apart by his uncle you are old enough to know now said that kinsman and i tell you that it may not be forgotten the gist of the secret is merely what one might gather from the report of the trial that though allan breck was concerned in the murder of campbell of glenure he was not alone in it  the truth is according to tradition that as glenure rode on the fatal day from fort william to his home in appin the way was lined with marksmen of the camerons of lochaber lurking with their guns among the brushwood and behind the rocks but their hearts failed them no trigger was drawn and when glenure landed on the appin side of the ballachulish ferry he said i am safe now that i am out of my mothers country his mother having been of clan cameron but he had to reckon with the man with the gun who was lurking in the wood of letter more the great hanging coppice about threequarters of a mile on the appin side of ballachulish ferry the gun was not one of the two dilapidated pieces shown at the trial of james of the glens nor i am told was it the fasnacloich gun the real homicidal gun was found some years ago in a hollow tree people remember these things well in appin and glencoe though the affair is a hundred and fifty years old and though there are daily steamers bringing the newspapers there is even a railway not remarkable for speed while tourists english french and american are for ever passing to view glencoe and to write their names in the hotel book after luncheon then flying to other scenes there has even been a strike of long duration at the ballachulish quarries and labour leaders have perorated to the celts but gaelic is still spoken second sight is nearly as common as short sight you may really hear the fairy music if you bend your ear on a still day to the grass of the fairy knowe only two generations back a fairy boy lived in a now ruinous house noted in the story of the massacre of glencoe beside the brawling river and a woman stolen by the fairies returned for an hour to her husband who became very unpopular as he neglected the means for her rescue i think he failed to throw a dirk over her shoulder every now and then mysterious lights may be seen even by the sassenach speeding down the road to callart on the opposite side of the narrow sealoch ascending the hill and running down into the salt water the causes of these lights and of the lights on the burial isle of st mun in the middle of the sea strait remain a mystery thus the country is still a country of prehistoric beliefs and of fairly accurate traditions for example at the trial of james stewart for the murder of glenure one maccoll gave damaging evidence the maccolls being a sept subordinate to the macians or macdonalds of glencoe who by the way had no hand in the murder till recently these maccolls were still disliked for the part played by the witness and were named king georges maccolls  illustration map  but we must come to the case of allan breck to understand it some knowledge of topography is necessary leaving oban by steamer you keep on the inside of the long narrow island of lismore and reach the narrow sea inlet of loch creran on your right the steamer does not enter it but taking a launch or a boat you go down loch creran on your left is the peninsula of appin its famous green hills occupy the space bounded by loch creran on the south and glencoe on the north landing near the head of loch creran a walk of two miles takes you to the old house of fasnacloich where allan breck was wont to stay till two or three years ago it belonged to the stewarts of fasnacloich cadets of the chief the laird of appin all appin was a stewart country and loyal to the king over the water their kinsman about a mile from fasnacloich further inland is the rather gloomy house of glenure the property of campbell of glenure the red fox who was shot on the road under letter more walking across the peninsula to appin house you pass acharn in duror the farm of james stewart of the glens himself an illegitimate kinsman of the laird of appin to the best of my memory the cottage is still standing and has a new roof of corrugated iron it is an ordinary highland cottage and allan when he stayed with james his kinsman and guardian slept in the barn appin house is a large plain country house close to the sea further northeast the house of ardshiel standing high above the sea is visible from the steamer going to fort william at ardshiel rob roy fought a sword and target duel with the laird and ardshiel led the stewarts in the rising of 1745 appin the chief held aloof the next place of importance is ballachulish house also an old house of stewart of ballachulish it is on the right hand of the road from ballachulish pier to glencoe beneath a steep wooded hill down which runs the burn where allan breck was fishing on the morning of the day of glenures murder done at a point on the road threequarters of a mile to the southwest of ballachulish house where allan had slept on the previous night from the house the road passes on the south side of the salt loch leven not queen marys loch leven here is ballachulish ferry crossing to lochaber following the road you come opposite the house of carnoch then possessed by macdonalds the house has been pulled down there is a good recent ghost story about that business and the road now enters glencoe on high hills well to the left of the road and above loch leven are corrynakeigh and coalisnacoan the ferry of the dogs overtopping the narrows of loch leven just opposite the house of carnoch on the cameron side of loch leven is the house of callart mrs cameron lucys here and at carnoch as at fasnacloich acharn and ballachulish allan breck was much at home among his cousins  from loch leven north to fort william with its english garrison all is a cameron country campbell of glenure was an outpost of whiggery and campbells in a land of loyal stewarts camerons and macdonalds or macians of glencoe of the camerons the gentle lochiel had died in france his son a boy was abroad the interests of the clan were represented by cameron of fassifern lochiels uncle living a few miles west by north of fort william fassifern a welleducated man and a burgess of glasgow had not been out with prince charles but for reasons into which i would rather not enter was not well trusted by government ardshiel also was in exile and his tenants under james stewart of the glens loyally paid rent to him as well as to the commissioners of his forfeited estates the country was seething with feuds among the camerons themselves due to the plundering by  of  of the treasure left by prince charles in the hands of cluny the state of affairs was such that the english commander in fort william declared that if known it would shock even lochaber consciences a great ox hath trodden on my tongue as to this business despite the robbery of prince charless gold deep poverty prevailed  in february 1749 campbell of glenure had been appointed factor for government over the forfeited estates of ardshiel previously managed by james stewart of the glens of lochiel and of callart in the summer of 1751 glenure evicted james from a farm and in april 1752 took measures for evicting other farmers on ardshiel estates such measures were almost unheard of in the country and had years before caused some agrarian outrages among gordons and camerons these were appeased by the king over the water james viii and iii james stewart in april 1752 went to edinburgh and obtained a legal sist or suspension of the evictions against glenure which was withdrawn on glenures application who came home from edinburgh and intended to turn the tenants out on may 15 1752 they were assailed merely as of jacobite name and tendencies meanwhile allan breckwho had deserted the hanoverian army after prestonpans had joined prince charles fought at culloden escaped to france and entered the french armywas lodging about appin among his cousins perhaps doing a little recruiting for king louis he was a tall thin man marked with smallpox  cruising about the country also was another jacobite soldier the sergent more a cameron later betrayed by  of  who robbed the princes hoard of gold but the sergeant more had nothing to do as has been fancied with the murder of glenure the state of the country was ticklish prince charles expected to invade with swedish forces under the famous marshal keith by the connivance of frederick the great and he had sent lochgarry with dr archibald cameron and others to feel the pulse of the western clans as government knew all about these intrigues from pickle the spy they were evicting jacobite tenants from ardshiels lands and meant to do the same by agency of campbell of glenure in lochaber lochiels country  on monday may 11 campbell who intended to do the evictions on may 15 left glenure for fort william on business the distance is computed at sixteen miles by the old hill road allan breck on the 11th was staying at fasnacloich near glenure where the fishing is very good when glenure moved north to fort william allan went to james stewarts cottage of acharn glenures move was talked of and that evening allan changed his own blue coat scarlet vest and black velvet breeches for a dark short coat with silver buttons a blue bonnet and trousers the highlanders had been diskilted all belonging to james stewart he usually did make these changes when residing with friends in these clothes next day tuesday may 12 allan with young fasnacloich walked to carnoch the house of macdonald of glencoe situated just where the water of coe or cona enters loch leven the dowager of the house was natural sister of james of the glens and full sister of the exiled stewart of ardshiel from carnoch allan on the same day crossed the seastrait to callart opposite where mrs cameron was another halfsister to james of the glens on wednesday allan recrossed called at carnoch and went to stay at ballachulish house on thursday when glenure would certainly return home by ballachulish ferry allan about midday was seen to go fishing up ballachulish burn where he caught no trout and i do not wonder at it  the theory of the prosecution was that from the high ground to the left of the burn he watched the ferry having one or two guns though how he got them unobserved to the place is the difficulty he could not have walked the roads from acharn unobserved with a gun for the highlanders had been disarmed at this point he must have had the assistance and the gun of the other man allan came down from the hill asked the ferryman if glenure had crossed and returned to his point of observation about five oclock in the afternoon glenure with a nephew of his mungo campbell a writer or solicitor crossed the ferry and was greeted and accompanied for threequarters of a mile on his homeward way by old stewart of ballachulish who turned back and went to his house a sheriffs officer walked ahead of glenure who like mungo was mounted behind both mounted was campbells servant john mackenzie the old road was and is a rough track through thick coppice there came a shot and glenure pierced by two balls fell and died  john mackenzie glenures servant now rode onwards at a great gallop to find campbell of ballieveolan and on his way came to acharn and met james stewart with the two ancestors of my friend as already described he gave the news to james who wrung his hands and expressed great concern at what had happened as what might bring innocent people to trouble in fact he had once or oftener when drinking expressed a desire to have a shot at glenure and so had allan but james was a worthy sensible man when sober and must have known that while he could not frighten the commissioners of forfeited estates by shooting their agent he was certain to be suspected if their agent was shot as a matter of fact as we shall see he had taken active steps to secure the presence of a fort william solicitor at the evictions on friday may 15 to put in a legal protest but he thought it unadvisable to walk three or four miles and look after glenures corpse the highlanders to this day have a strong dread or dislike of corpses that night james bade his people hide his arms four swords a long spanish gun and a shorter gun neither of which weapons in fact did the trick nor could be depended on not to miss fire  where meanwhile was allan in the dusk above ballachulish house he was seen by kate macinnes a maid of the house they talked of the murder and she told donald stewart a very young man soninlaw of ballachulish where allan was out on the hillside donald stewart averred that on hearing from kate that allan wanted to see him kate denied that she said this he went to the hill accused allan of the crime and was told in reply that allan was innocent though as a deserter from the hanoverian army and likely to be suspected he must flee the country other talk passed to which we shall return at three in the morning of friday may 15 allan knocked at the window of carnoch house glencoes passed the news was asked no questions refused a drink and made for the sheiling or summer hut high on the hill side of coalisnacoan whence you look down on the narrows of loch leven  there we leave allan for the moment merely remarking that he had no money no means of making his escape as he is supposed by the prosecution to have planned the slaying of glenure with james stewart on may 11 it seems plain that james would then have given him money to use in his escape or if he had no money by him would have sent at once to fort william or elsewhere to raise it he did not do this and neither at carnoch callart nor ballachulish house did allan receive any money  but on may 12 when allan went to carnoch and callart james sent a servant to a very old mr stewart father of charles stewart notary public the father was a notary also and james who wanted a man of law to be at the evictions on may 15 and thought that charles stewart was absent in moidart conceived that the old gentleman would serve the turn but his messenger missed the venerable sportsman who had gone afishing learning later that charles had returned from moidart james at 8 am on may 14 the day of the murder sent a servant to charles at fort william bidding him come to the evictions on may 15 as everything must go wrong without a person that can act and that i can trust in a postscript he added as i have no time to write to william stewart let him send down immediately 8l to pay for four milk cows i bought for his wife at ardshiel his messenger had also orders to ask william stewart for the money  nothing could seem more harmless but the prosecution might have argued that this letter was as to the coming of the notary a blind and that the real object was under the plea of sending for the notary to send the messenger for william stewarts 8l destined to aid allan in his escape8 there was no proof or even suggestion that on may 12 james had asked old mr stewart to send money for allans use or had asked william stewart as having none by him he would have donethat is if james had concerted the murder with allan if on may 14 james was trying to raise money to help a man who as he knew would need it after committing a murder on that day he showed strange want of foresight he might not get the money or might not be able to send it to allan in fact that day james did not get the money the prosecution argued that the money was sent for on may 14 to help allan breck and did not even try to show that james had sent for money on may 12 when it would have arrived in good time indeed james did not on may 12 send any message to william stewart at fort william from whom not from charles or the old gentleman he tried to raise the cash on may 14 a friendly or a just jury would have noted that if james planned a murder on the night of may 11 and had no money his very first move on may 12 would be to try to raise money for the assassins escape no mortal would put off that step till the morning of the crime indeed it is amazing that allan if he meant to do the deed did not first try to obtain cash for his escape the relations of glenure suspected at the time that allan was not the assassin that he fled merely to draw suspicion away from the real criminal as he does in kidnapped and they even wished to advertise a pardon for him if he would come in and give evidence these facts occur in a copious unpublished correspondence of the day between glenures brothers and kinsmen mr stevenson had never heard of these letters9 thus up to the day of the murder allan may not have contemplated it he may have been induced unprepared to act as accessory to the other man  footnote 8 really the prosecution did not make this point an oversight  footnote 9 they are in the possession of mr walter blaikie who kindly lent them to me  the point where according to the prosecution the evidence pinched james of the glens was his attempt to raise money on may 14 what could he want with so large a sum as 8l so suddenly as he had no bill to meet well as a number of his friends were to be thrown out of their farms with their cattle next day james might need money for their relief and it seems certain that he had made no effort to raise money at the moment when he inevitably must have done so if guilty that is on may 12 immediately after concerting as was alleged the plot with allan breck failing to get money from william stewart at fort william on may 14 james did on may 15 procure a small sum from him or his wife and did send what he could scrape together to allan breck at coalisnacoan this did not necessarily imply guilt on jamess part allan whether guilty or not was in danger as a suspected man and a deserter james was his fathers friend had been his guardian and so in honour was bound to help him  but how did he know where allan was to be found if both were guilty they would have arranged on may 11 a place where allan might lurk if they did arrange that both were guilty but donald stewart who went as we have said and saw allan on the hillside on the night of the murder added to his evidence that allan had then told him to tell james of the glens where he might be found that is at coalisnacoan these tidings donald gave to james on the morning of may 15 james then sent a pedlar allans cousin back to william stewart got 3l added in the evening of the 16th more money of his own and sent it to allan there was a slight discrepancy between the story of the maid kate macinnes and that of donald stewart as to what exactly passed between them concerning allan on the night of the murder and whether allan did or did not give her a definite message to donald the prosecution insisted on this discrepancy which really as jamess advocate told the jury rather went to prove their want of collusion in the manufacture of testimony had their memories been absolutely coincident we might suspect collusionthat they had been coached in their parts but a discrepancy of absolutely no importance rather suggests independent and honest testimony if this be so allan and james had arranged no trystingplace on may 11 as they must have done if allan was to murder glenure and james was to send him money for his escape  but there was a discrepancy of evidence as to the hour when the pedlar sent by james to fort william on may 15 arrived there was he despatched after the hour when donald stewart swore that he gave allans message to james of the glens or earlier with no knowledge on jamess part of the message carried by donald we really cannot expect certainty of memory after five months as to hours of the clock also james did not prove that he sent a message to allan at coalisnacoan bidding him draw on william stewart for money yet on friday may 15 james did by the pedlar bid william stewart give allan credit and on saturday may 16 allan did make a pen from a birds feather and ink with powder and water and write a letter for money on the strength of jamess credit to william stewart this is certainly a difficulty for james since he suggested john breck maccoll a tenant of appins at coalisnacoan for the intermediary between allan and william stewart and allan actually did employ this man to carry his letter but allan knew this tenant well as did james and there was nobody else at that desolate spot coalisnacoan whom allan could employ so lonely is the country that a few years ago a gentleman of my acquaintance climbing a rocky cliff found the bones of a man gnawed by foxes and eagles a man who never had been missed or inquired after remains of pencils and leather shoe strings among the bones proved that the man had been a pedlar like james stewarts messenger who had fallen over the precipice in trying to cross from coalisnacoan to the road through glencoe but he never was missed nor is the date of his death known to this day  the evidence of the lonely tenant at coalisnacoan as to his interviews with allan is familiar to readers of kidnapped the tenant had heard of the murder before he saw allan two poor women who came up from glencoe told the story saying that two men were seen going from the spot where glenure was killed and that allan breck was one of them thus early does the mysterious figure of the other man haunt the evidence the tenants testimony was not regarded as trustworthy by the stewart party it tended to prove that allan expected a change of clothes and money to be sent to him and he also wrote the letter with a woodpigeons quill and powder and water to william stewart asking for money but allan might do all this relying on his own message sent by donald stewart on the night of the murder to james of the glens and knowing as he must have done that william stewart was jamess agent in his large financial operations  on the whole then the evidence even where it pinches james most is by no means conclusive proof that on may 11 he had planned the murder with allan if so he must have begun to try to raise money before the very day of the murder james and his son were arrested on may 16 and taken to fort william scores of other persons were arrested and the campbells to avenge glenure made the most minute examinations of hundreds of people meanwhile allan having got 5l and his french clothes by the agency of his cousin the pedlar decamped from coalisnacoan in the night and marched across country to the house of an uncle in rannoch thence he escaped to france where he was seen in paris by an informant of sir walter scotts in the dawn of the french revolution a tall thin quiet old man wearing the cross of st louis and looking on at a revolutionary procession  the activities of the campbells are narrated in their numerous unpublished letters we learn from a nephew of glenures that he had been several days ago forewarned by whom we cannot guess tradition tells as i have said that he feared danger only in lochiels country lochaber and thought himself safe in appin the warning then probably came from a cameron in lochaber not from a stewart in appin in coincidence with this is a dark anonymous blackmailing letter to fassifern as if he had urged the writer to do the deed  you will remember what you proposed on the night that culchena was buried betwixt the hill and culchena i cannot deny but that i had breathing a whisper and not only that but proposal of the same to myself to do therefore you must excuse me when it comes to the push for telling the thing that happened betwixt you and me that night if you do not take this to heart you may let it go as you will june 6 1752  fassifern who had no hand in the murder let it go and probably handed the blackmailers letter over to the campbells later   of  the blackest villain in the country offered to the government to accuse fassifern of the murder the writer of the anonymous letter to fassifern is styled blarmachfildich or blarmackfildoch in the correspondence i think he was a mr millar employed by fassifern to agitate against glenure  in the beginning of july a man suspected of being allan was arrested at annan on the border by a sergeant of the royal welsh fusiliers he really seems to have changed clothes with allan at least he wore gay french clothes like allans but he was not that hero young ballachulish at this time knew that allan was already across the sea various guesses occur as to who the other man was for example a son of james of the glens was suspected so there was another man  the precognitions or private examinations of witnesses before the trial extended to more than seven hundred persons it was matter of complaint by the stewart party that james drummonds name appeared in the list of witnesses this is mr stevensons james more really macgregor the son of rob roy and father of catriona later mrs david balfour of shaws in kidnapped and catriona james mores character is reflected upon and i believe he cannot be called worse than he deserves says one of the campbells he alleges however that in april before the murder james of the glens visited james more then a prisoner in edinburgh castle caressed him and had a private conversation with him the abject james more averred that in this conversation james of the glens proposed that james mores brother robin oig should kill glenure for money james more was not examined at the trial of james of the glens perhaps because he had already escaped thanks to catriona and collusion but his evidence appears to have reached the jury almost all of them campbells who sat at inveraray the duke of argyll on the bench and made no difficulty about finding james of the glens guilty to be sure james if guilty was guilty as an accessory to allan and that allan was guilty was not proved he was not even before the court it was not proved that the bullets which slew glenure fitted the bore of jamess small gun with which allan was alleged to have perpetrated the murder but it was proved that the lock of that gun had only one faultit missed fire four times out of five and when the gun did not miss fire it did not carry straightmissed a blackcock sitting that gun was not the gun used in the murder  the jury had the case for james of the glens most clearly and convincingly placed before them in the speech of mr brown for the accused he made indeed the very points on which i have insisted for example that if james concerted a murder with allan on may 11 he would not begin to hunt for money for allans escape so late as may 14 the day of the murder again he proved that without any information from james allan would naturally send for money to william stewart jamess usual source of supply while at coalisnacoan there was no man to go as messenger except the tenant john breck maccoll a few women composed his family and as john maccoll had been the servant of james of the glens he was well known already to allan in brief there was literally no proof of concert and had the case been heard in edinburgh not in the heart of the campbell country by a jury of campbells a verdict of not guilty would have been given probably the jury would not even have fallen back upon not proven but moved by clan hatred and political hatred the jury on september 24 found a verdict against james of the glens who in a touching brief speech solemnly asserted his innocence before god and chiefly regretted that after ages should think me guilty of such a horrid and barbarous murder  he was duly hanged and left hanging on the little knoll above the sea ferry close to the ballachulish hotel  and the other man  tradition avers that on the day of the execution he wished to give himself up to justice though his kinsmen told him that he could not save james and would merely share his fate but nevertheless he struggled so violently that his people mastered and bound him with ropes and laid him in a room still existing finally it is said that strange noises and knockings are still heard in that place a mysterious survival of strong human passions attested in other cases as on the supposed site of the murder of james i of scotland in perth  do i believe in this identification of the other man i have marked every trace of him in the documents published or unpublished and i remain in doubt but if allan had an accessory in the crime who was seen at the place an accomplice who for example supplied the gun perhaps fired the shot while allan fled to distract suspicion that accessory was probably the person named by legend though he was certainly under suspicion so were scores of other people the crime does not seem to me to have been the result of a conspiracy in appin but the act of one hotheaded man or of two hotheaded men i hope i have kept the celtic secret and i defy anyone to discover the other man by aid of this narrative  that james would have been quite safe with an edinburgh jury was proved by the almost contemporary case of the murder of the english sergeant davies he was shot on the hillside and the evidence against the assassins was quite strong enough to convict them but some of the highland witnesses averred that the phantasm of the sergeant had appeared to them and given information against the criminals and though there was testimony independent of the ghosts his interference threw ridicule over the affair moreover the edinburgh jury was in sympathy with mr lockhart the jacobite advocate who defended the accused though undeniably guilty they were acquitted much more would james of the glens have obtained a favourable verdict he was practically murdered under forms of law and what was thought of the duke of argylls conduct on the bench is familiar to readers of kidnapped i have never seen a copy of the pamphlet put forth after the hanging by the stewart party and only know it through a reply in the campbell mss  the tragedy remains as fresh in the memories of the people of appin and lochaber as if it were an affair of yesterday the reason is that the crime of cowardly assassination was very rare indeed among the highlanders their traditions were favourable to driving creaghs of cattle and to clan raids and onfalls but in the wildest regions the traveller was far more safe than on hounslow or bagshot heaths and shooting from behind a wall was regarded as dastardly     v  the cardinals necklace   oh nature and thackeray which of you imitated the other one inevitably thinks of the old question thus travestied when one reads in the fifth edition revised and augmented of monsieur funckbrentanos laffaire du collier10 the familiar story of jeanne de valois of cardinal rohan and of the fatal diamond necklace jeanne de valois might have sat though she probably did not for becky sharp her early poverty her pride in the blood of valois recall beckys youth and her boasts about the blood of the montmorencys jeanne had her respectable friends as becky had the sedleys like becky she imprudently married a heavy unscrupulous young officer her expedients for living on nothing a year were exactly those of mrs rawdon crawley her personal charms her fluent tongue her good nature even were those of that accomplished lady finally she has her marquis of steyne in the wealthy luxurious cardinal de rohan she robs him to a tune beyond the dreams of becky and incidentally she drags to the dust the royal head of the fairest and most unhappy of queens even now there seem to be people who believe that marie antoinette was guilty that she cajoled the cardinal and robbed him of the diamonds fateful as the jewels of eriphyle  footnote 10 hachette paris 1903 the author has made valuable additions and corrections  that theory is annihilated by m funckbrentano but the story is so strangely complicated the astuteness and the credulity of the cardinal are so oddly contrasted a momentary folly of the queen is so astonishing and fatal the general mismanagement of the court is so crazy that had we lived in paris at the moment perhaps we could hardly have believed the queen to be innocent even persons greatly prejudiced in her favour might well have been deceived and the people loveth to think the worst and is hardly to be moved from that opinion as was said of the scottish public at the date of the gowrie conspiracy  an infidelity of henri ii of france to his wedded wife catherine de médicis and the misplaced affection of louis xv for madame du barry were the remote but real causes that helped to ruin the house of france without the amour of henri ii there would have been no jeanne de valois without the hope that louis xv would stick at nothing to please madame du barry the diamond necklace would never have been woven  henri ii loved about 1550 a lady named nicole de savigny and by her had a son henri de saintremy whom he legitimated saintremy was the great great great greatgrandfather of jeanne de valois the flower of minxes her father a ruined man dwelt in a corner of the family château a predacious poaching athletic broken scion of royalty who drank and brawled with the peasants and married his mistress a servantgirl jeanne was born at the château of fontette near barsuraube on april 22 1756 and she and her brother and little sister starved in their mouldering tower kept alive by the charity of the neighbours and of the curé who begged clothes for these descendants of kings but their scutcheon wasand jeanne never forgot the factargent three fleurs de lys or on a fesse azure the noblesse of the family was later scrutinised by the famous dhozier and pronounced authentic jeanne with bare feet and straws in her hair is said to have herded the cows a discontented indolent child often beaten by her peasant mother when her father had eaten up his last acre he and the family tramped to paris in 1760 as jeanne was then but four years old i doubt if she ever drove the cattle home as m funckbrentano finds recorded in the mss of the advocate target who defended jeannes victim cardinal rohan  the valois crew lived in a village near paris jeannes mother turned jeannes father out of doors took a soldier in his place and sent the child to beg daily in the streets pity a poor orphan of the blood of valois she piped alms in gods name for two orphans of the blood of valois when she brought home little she was cruelly flogged so she says and occasionally she deviated into the truth a kind lady the marquise de boulainvilliers investigated her story found it true and took up the valois orphans the wicked mother went back to barsuraube which jeanne was to dazzle with her opulence after she got possession of the diamonds  by the age of twentyone 1777 jeanne was a pretty enchanting girl with a heart full of greed and envy two years later she and her sister fled from the convent where her protectress had placed them a merry society convent it was a madame de surmont now gave them shelter at barsuraube and jeanne married very disreputably her heavy admirer la motte calling himself count and to all appearance a stupid young officer of the gendarmerie the pair lived as such people do and again made prey of madame de boulainvilliers in 1781 at strasbourg the lady was here the guest of the sumptuous vain credulous but honourable cardinal rohan by this time a man of fifty and the fanatical adorer of cagliostro with his philosophers stone his crystal gazers his seeresses his egyptian mysteries and his powers of healing diseases and creating diamonds out of nothing  cagliostro doubtless lowered the cardinals moral and mental tone but it does not appear that he had any connection with the great final swindle in his supernormal gifts and graces the cardinal did steadfastly believe ten years earlier rohan had blessed marie antoinette on her entry into france and had been ambassador at the court of maria theresa the empress a sportsman who once fired off 1300 cartridges in a day can this be true a splendid festive churchman who bewitched vienna and even the emperor and count kaunitz by his lavish entertainments rohan made himself positively loathedfor his corrupting luxury and his wicked witby the austere empress she procured rohans recall and so worked on her daughter marie antoinette the young queen of france that the prelate though grand almoner was socially boycotted by the court his letters of piteous appeal to the queen were not even opened and his ambitions to sway politics like a tencin or a fleury were ruined  so here are rohan cagliostro and jeanne all brought acquainted the cardinal and this is one of the oddest features in the affair was to come to believe that jeanne was the queens most intimate friend and could and would make his fortune with her while at the same time he was actually relieving her by little tips of from two to five louis this he was doing even after confiding in jeanne he handed to her the diamond necklace for the queen and as he believed had himself a solitary midnight interview with her majesty if jeanne was so great with the queen as rohan supposed how could jeanne also be in need of small charities rohan was a man of the world his incredible credulity seems a fact so impossible to accept that it was not accepted by public opinion the queen people could not but argue must have taken his enormous gifts and then robbed and denounced him with the case before our eyes of madame humbert who swindled scores of hardheaded financiers by the flimsiest fables we can no longer deem the credulity of the cardinal incredible even though he displayed on occasion a sharpness almost as miraculous as his stupidity  rohan conferred a few small favours on jeanne her audacity was as great as that of madame humbert and late in 1781 she established herself both at paris and in versailles the one card in her hand was the blood of the valois and for long she could not play it to any purpose her claims were too old and musty if a lady of the name of stewart were to appear today able to prove that she was of royal blood as being descended from francis earl of bothwell who used to kidnap james vi was forfeited and died in exile about 1620 she could not reasonably expect to be peculiarly cherished and comforted by our royal family now jeannes claims were no better and no nearer in 1781 than those of our supposed stewart adventuress in 1904 but jeanne was sanguine something must be done by hook or by crook for the blood of the valois she must fasten on her great relations the royal family by 1783 jeanne was pawning her furniture and dining at the expense of her young admirers or of her servants for somehow they were attached to a mistress who did not pay their wages she bought goods on her credit as a countess and sold them on the same day she fainted in the crowd at versailles and madame elizabeth sent her a few louis and had her tiny pension doubled jeanne fainted again under the eyes of the queen who never noticed her  her plan was to persuade small suitors that she could get them what they wanted by her backstairs influence with her royal cousin she had a lover retaux de villette who was an expert forger and by april 1784 relying on his skill she began to hint to rohan that she could win for him the queens forgiveness her majesty had seen her faint and had been full of kindness nothing should be refused to the interesting daughter of the valois letters from the queen to jeanne forged by villette on paper stamped with blue fleurs de lys were laid before the eyes of the infatuated prelate villette later confessed to his forgeries all confessed but as all recanted their confessions this did not impress the public the letters proved that the queen was relenting as regarded rohan cagliostro confirmed the fact at a séance in rohans house he introduced a niece of jeannes husband a girl of fifteen who played the part of crystal gazer and saw in the crystal whatever cagliostro told her to see all was favourable to the wishes of rohan who was as easy of belief as any spiritualist being entirely dominated by the neapolitan cagliostro none the less knew nothing of the great final coup despite his clairvoyance  so far in the summer of 1784 the great diamond fraud had not risen into jeannes consciousness her aim was merely to convince the cardinal that she could win for him the queens favour and then to work upon his gratitude it was in july 1784 that jeannes husband made the acquaintance of marie laguay a pretty and goodhumoured but quite unfortunate young womanthe height of honesty and dissolutenesswho might be met in the public gardens chaperoned solely by a nice little boy jeanne de valois was not of a jealous temperament mademoiselle laguay was the friend of her husband the tawdry count for jeanne that was enough she invited the young lady to her house and by her royal fantasy created her baronne gay doliva valoi an easy anagram  she presently assured the baronne that the queen desired her collaboration in a practical joke her majesty would pay 600l for the freak this is the baronnes own version her innocence she averred readily believed that marie antoinette desired her assistance  you are only asked to give some evening a note and a rose to a great lord in an alley of the gardens of versailles my husband will bring you hither tomorrow evening  jeanne later confessed that the baronne really was stupid enough to be quite satisfied that the whole affair was a jest  judged by their portraits doliva who was to personate the queen in an interview with the cardinal was not at all like marie antoinette her short round buxom face bears no resemblance to the long and noble outlines of the features of the queen but both women were fair and of figures not dissimilar on august 11 1784 jeanne dressed up doliva in the chemise or gaulle the very simple white blouse which marie antoinette wears in the contemporary portrait by madame vigéelebrun a portrait exhibited at the salon of 1783 the ladies with la motte then dined at the best restaurant in versailles and went out into the park the sky was heavy without moon or starlight and they walked into the sombre mass of the grove of venus so styled from a statue of the goddess which was never actually placed there nothing could be darker than the thicket below the sullen sky  a shadow of a man appeared vous voilà said the count and the shadow departed it was villette the forger of the queens letters the lover and accomplice of jeanne de valois  then the gravel of a path crackled under the feet of three men one approached heavily cloaked doliva was left alone a rose fell from her hand she had a letter in her pocket which she forgot to give to the cloaked man who knelt and kissed the skirt of her dress she murmured something the cloaked cardinal heard or thought he heard her say you may hope that the past is forgotten  another shadow flitted past whispering quick quick come on here are madame and madame dartois  they dispersed later the cardinal recognised the whispering shadow that fled by in villette the forger how could he recognise a fugitive shade vaguely beheld in a dark wood on a sultry and starless night if he mistook the girl doliva for the queen what is his recognition of the shadow worth  the conspirators had a jolly supper and one beugnot a friend of jeanne not conscious of the plot escorted the baronne doliva back to her rooms in paris  the trick the transparent trick was played and jeanne could extract from the cardinal what money she wanted in the name of the queen that gave him a rose in the grove of venus letters from the queen were administered at intervals by jeanne and the prelate never dreamed of comparing them with the authentic handwriting of marie antoinette  we naturally ask ourselves was rohan in love with the daughter of the valois does his passion account for his blindness most authors have believed what jeanne later proclaimed that she was the cardinals mistress this the divine steadily denied there was no shadow of proof that they were even on familiar terms except a number of erotic letters which jeanne showed to a friend beugnot saying that they were from the cardinal and then burned the cardinal believed all things in short and verified nothing in obedience to his dominating ideathe recovery of the queens good graces  meanwhile jeanne drew on him for large sums which the queen she said needed for acts of charity it was proved that jeanne instantly invested the money in her own name bought a large house with another loan and filled it with splendid furniture she was as extravagant as she was greedy alieni appetens sui profusa  the cardinal was in alsace at his bishopric when in novemberdecember 1784 jeanne was brought acquainted with the jewellers böhmer and bassenge who could not find a customer for their enormous and very hideous necklace of diamonds left on their hands by the death of louis xv the european courts were poor marie antoinette had again and again refused to purchase a bauble like a comforter made of precious stones or to accept it from the king we have more need of a ship of war she said and would not buy though the jeweller fell on his knees and threatened to drown himself there were then no american millionaires and the thickest and ugliest of necklaces was eating its head off for the stones had been bought with borrowed money  in the jewellers jeanne found new victims they too believed in her credit with the queen they too asked no questions and held that she could find them a purchaser jeanne imposed on them thus while the cardinal was still in alsace he arrived at paris in january 1785 he learned from jeanne that the queen wished him to deal for her with the jewellers she would pay the price 60000l by quarterly instalments  the cardinal could believe that the queen who as he supposed had given him a darkling interview would entrust him with such a commission for an article which she had notoriously refused but there is a sane spot in every mans mind and on examining the necklace january 24 1785 he said that it was in very poor taste however as the queen wanted to wear it at a ceremony on february 2 he arranged the terms and became responsible for the money his guarantee was a document produced by jeanne and signed marie antoinette de france as cagliostro pointed out to rohan later too late the queen could not possibly use this signature neither the prelate nor the tradesmen saw the manifest absurdity rohan carried the necklace to jeanne who gave it to the alleged messenger of the queen rohan only saw the silhouette of this man in a dusky room through a glass door but he later declared that in him he recognised the fleeting shade who whispered the warning to fly in the dark grove of venus it was villette the forger  naturally people asked if you could not tell the queen from mlle doliva when you kissed her robe in the grove how could you recognise through a dim glass door the man of whom you had only caught a glimpse as a fleeting shadow if you are so clever why it was the queen whom you met in the wood you cannot have been mistaken in her  these obvious arguments told against the queen as well as against the cardinal  the queen did not wear the jewels at the feast for which she had wanted them strange to say she never wore them at all to the surprise of the vendors and of the cardinal the necklace was in fact hastily cut to pieces with a blunt heavy knife in jeannes house her husband crossed to england and sold many stones and bartered more for all sorts of trinkets to grey of new bond street and jeffreys of piccadilly villette had already been arrested with his pockets full of diamonds but the luck of the house of valois and the astuteness of jeanne procured his release so the diamonds were in part dumped down in england many were kept by the la mottes and jeanne paid some pressing debts in diamonds  the happy la mottes with six carriages a stud of horses silver plate of great value and diamonds glittering on many portions of their raiment now went off to astonish their old friends at barsuraube the inventories of their possessions read like pages out of the arabian nights all went merrily till at a great ecclesiastical feast among her friends the aristocracy on august 17 1785 jeanne learned that the cardinal had been arrested at versailles in full pontificals when about to celebrate the mass she rushed from table fled to versailles and burned her papers she would not fly to england she hoped to brazen out the affair  the arrest of the cardinal was caused thus on july 12 1785 the jeweller böhmer went to versailles with a letter of thanks to the queen dictated by rohan the date for the payment of the first instalment had arrived nothing had been paid a reduction in price had been suggested and accepted böhmer gave the letter of thanks to the queen but the controllergeneral entered and böhmer withdrew without waiting for a reply the queen presently read the letter of thanks could not understand it and sent for the jeweller who had gone home marie antoinette thought he was probably mad certainly a bore and burned his note before the eyes of madame campan  tell the man when you next see him that i do not want diamonds and shall never buy any more  fatal folly had the queen insisted on seeing böhmer all would have been cleared up and her innocence established böhmers note spoke of the recent arrangements of the jewellers joy that the greatest of queens possesses the handsomest of necklacesand marie antoinette asked no questions  jeanne now august 3 did a great stroke she told bassenge that the queens guarantee to the cardinal was a forgery she calculated that the cardinal to escape the scandal would shield her would sacrifice himself and pay the 60000l  but the jewellers dared not carry the news to the cardinal they went to madame campan who said that they had been gulled the queen had never received the jewels still they did not tell the cardinal jeanne now sent villette out of the way to geneva and on august 4 bassenge asked the cardinal whether he was sure that the man who was to carry the jewels to the queen had been honest a pleasant question the cardinal kept up his courage all was well he could not be mistaken jeanne with cunning audacity did not fly she went to her splendid home at barsuraube  villette was already out of reach doliva with her latest lover was packed off to brussels there was no proof against jeanne her own flight would have been proof the cardinal could not denounce her he had insulted the queen by supposing that she gave him a lonely midnight tryst a matter of high treason the cardinal could not speak he consulted cagliostro the guarantee is forged said the sage the queen could not sign marie antoinette de france throw yourself at the kings feet and confess all the wretched rohan now compared the queens forged notes to him with authentic letters of hers in the possession of his family the forgery was conspicuous but he did not follow the advice of cagliostro on august 12 the queen extracted the whole facts as far as known to them from the jewellers on august 15 the day of the assumption when the cardinal was to celebrate the king asked him my cousin what is this tale of a diamond necklace bought by you in the name of the queen  the unhappy man unable to speak coherently was allowed to write the story in fifteen lines  how could you believe asked the queen with angry eyes that i who have not spoken to you for eight years entrusted you with this commission  how indeed could he believe it  he offered to pay for the jewels the thing might still have been hushed up the king is blamed first for publicly arresting rohan as he did an enormous scandal next for handing over the case for public trial to the parlement the hereditary foes of the court fréteau de saintjust one of the bar cried what a triumph for liberal ideas a cardinal a thief the queen implicated mud on the crosier and the sceptre  he had his fill of liberal ideas for he was guillotined on june 14 1794  kings and queens are human beings they like a fair and open trial mary stuart prayed for it in vain from the estates of scotland and from elizabeth charles i asked for public trial in vain from the estates of scotland at the time of the unsolved puzzle of the incident louis xvi and marie antoinette had the publicity they wanted to their undoing the parlement was to acquit rohan of the theft of the necklace a charge which jeanne tried to support by a subplot of romantic complexity and that acquittal was just but nothing was said of the fatal insult which he had dealt to the queen villette who had forged the royal name was merely exiled left free to publish fatal calumnies abroad though high treason as times went was about the measure of his crime gay doliva whose personation of the queen also verged on treason was merely acquitted with a recommendation not to do it again pretty a young mother and profoundly dissolute she was the darling of liberal and sensible hearts  jeanne de valois indeed was whipped and branded but jeanne in public opinion was the scapegoat of a cruel princess and all the mud was thrown on the face of the guiltless queen the friends of rohan were all the clergy all the many nobles of his illustrious house all the courtly foes of the queen they began by the basest calumnies the ruin that the people achieved all the friends of liberal ideas who soon like fréteau de saintjust had more of liberalism than they liked  these were the results which the king obtained by offering to the cardinal his choice between the royal verdict and that of the public court of justice rohan said that if the king would pronounce him innocent he would prefer to abide by the royal decision he was innocent of all but being a presumptuous fool the king might even now have recognised the fact mud would have been thrown but not all the poached filth of the streets of paris on the other hand had louis withheld the case from public trial we might still be doubtful of the queens innocence napoleon acknowledged it the queen was innocent and to make her innocence the more public she wished the parlement to be the judge the result was that she was taken to be guilty napoleon thought that the king should have taken the case into his own hand this might have been wisdom for the day but not for securing the verdict of posterity the pyramidal documents of the process still in existence demonstrate the guilt of the la mottes and their accomplices at every step and prove the stainless character of the queen  la motte could not be caught he had fled to edinburgh where he lived with an aged italian teacher of languages this worthy man offered to sell him for 10000l and a pretty plot was arranged by the french ambassador to drug la motte put him on board a collier at south shields and carry him to france but the old italian lost heart and after getting 1000l out of the french government in advance deemed it more prudent to share the money with the count perhaps the count invented the whole stratagem it was worthy of the husband and pupil of jeanne de valois that poor ladys cause was lost when villette and gay doliva were brought back across the frontier confessed and corroborated each others stories yet she made a wonderfully good fight changing her whole defence into another as plausible and futile before the very eyes of the court and doing her best to ruin rohan as a thief and cagliostro as the forger of the queens guarantee the bold neapolitan was acquitted but compelled to leave the country and attempt england where the phlegmatic islanders trusted him no more than they trusted madame humbert we expended our main capital of credulity on titus oates and bedloe and the warmingpan lieour imaginative innocence being most accessible in the region of religion the french are more open to the appeal of romance and to dissolute honesty in the person of miss gay doliva to injured innocence as represented by jeanne de valois that class of rogues suits a gay people while we are well mated with such a seductive divine as dr oates     vi  the mystery of kaspar hauser the child of europe   the story of kaspar hauser a boy apparently idiotic who appeared as if from the clouds in nuremberg 1828 divided germany into hostile parties and caused legal proceedings as late as 1883 whence this lad came and what his previous adventures had been has never been ascertained his death by a daggerwound in 1833whether inflicted by his own hand or that of anotherdeepened the mystery according to one view the boy was only a waif and an impostor who had strayed from some peasant home where nobody desired his return according to the other theory he was the crown prince of baden stolen as an infant in the interests of a junior branch of the house reduced to imbecility by systematic illtreatment turned loose on the world at the age of sixteen and finally murdered lest his secret origin might be discovered  i state first the theory of the second party in the dispute which believed that kaspar was some great one i employ language as romantic as my vocabulary affords                                       darkness in karlsruhe tis the high noon of night october 15 1812 hark to the tread of the twelve hours as they pass on the palace clock and join their comrades that have been the vast corridors are still in the shadows lurk two burly minions of ambitious crime burkard and sauerbeck is that a white moving shadow which approaches through the gloom there arises a shriek a heavy body falls tis a lacquey who has seen and recognised the white lady of the grand ducal house that walks before the deaths of princes burkard and sauerbeck spurn the inanimate body of the menial witness the white figure bearing in her arms a sleeping child glides to the tapestried wall and vanishes through it into the chamber of the crown prince a babe of fourteen days she returns carrying another unconscious infant form she places it in the hands of the ruffian sauerbeck she disappears the miscreant speeds with the child through a postern into the park you hear the trample of four horses and the roll of the carriage on the road next day there is silence in the palace broken but by the shrieks of a bereaved though royal or at least grand ducal mother her babe lies a corpse the crown prince has died in the night the path to the throne lies open to the offspring of the countess von hochberg morganatic wife of the reigning prince karl friedrich and mother of the children of ludwig wilhelm august his youngest son  sixteen years fleet by years rich in royal crimes tis four of a golden whit monday afternoon in old nuremberg may 26 1828 the town lies empty dusty silent her merry people are rejoicing in the green wood and among the suburban beergardens one man alone a shoemaker stands by the door of his house in the unschlitt plas around him lie the vacant streets of the sleeping city his eyes rest on the form risen as it were out of the earth or fallen from the skies of a boy strangely clad speechless incapable either of standing erect or of moving his limbs that boy is the royal infant placed of yore by the white shadow in the hands of the cloaked ruffian thus does the crown prince of baden return from the darkness to the daylight he names himself kaspar hauser he is to die by the dagger of a cruel courtier or of a hireling english earl  thus briefly and i trust impressively have i sketched the history of kaspar hauser the child of europe as it was presented by various foreign pamphleteers and in 1892 by miss elizabeth e evans11 but as for the authentic records on which the partisans of kaspar hauser based their version they are anonymous unauthenticated discredited by the results of a libel action in 1883 and in short are worthless and impudent rubbish  footnote 11 the story of kaspar hauser from authentic records swan sonnenschein  co london 1892  on all sides indeed the evidence as to kaspar hauser is in bewildering confusion in 1832 four years after his appearance a book about him was published by paul john anselm von feuerbach the man was mortal had been a professor and though a legal reformer and a learned jurist was a nervous invalid when he wrote and he soon after died of paralysis or poison according to kasparites he was approaching a period of life in which british judges write books to prove that bacon was shakespeare and his arguments were like theirs his kaspar hauser is composed in a violently injudicial style to seek the giant perpetrator of such a crime as the injustice to kaspar it would be necessary  to be in possession of joshuas rams horns or at least of oberons horn in order for some time at least to suspend the activity of the powerful enchanted colossi that guard the golden gates of certain castles that is of the palace at karlsruhe such early nuremberg records of kaspars first exploits as existed were ignored by feuerbach who told lord stanhope that any reader of these would conceive kaspar to be an impostor they ought to be burned the records which were read and in part published by the younger meyer son of one of kaspars tutors and by president karl schmausz have disappeared and in 1883 schmausz could only attest the general accuracy of meyers excerpts from the towns manuscripts  taking feuerbachs romantic narrative of 1832 we find him averring that about 430 pm on whit monday may 26 1828 a citizen unnamed was loitering at his door in the unschlitt plas nuremberg intending to sally out by the new gate when he saw a young peasant standing in an attitude suggestive of intoxication and apparently suffering from locomotor ataxia unable to govern fully the movements of his legs the citizen went to the boy who showed him a letter directed to the captain of a cavalry regiment the gallant captain lived near the new gate 654 paces from the citizens house and thither the young peasant walked with the citizen so he could govern fully the movements of his legs at the house the captain being out the boy said i would be a horseman as my father was also dont know later he was taken to the prison up a steep hill and the ascent to his room was one of over ninety steps thus he could certainly walk and when he spoke of himself he said i like other people later he took to speaking of himself as kaspar in the manner of small children and some hysterical patients under hypnotism but this was an afterthought for kaspars line came to be that he had only learned a few words like a parrot words which he used to express all senses indifferently his eyesight when he first appeared seems to have been normal at the prison he wrote his own name as kaspar hauser and covered a sheet of paper with writing later he could see best in the dark  so says feuerbach in 1832 what he does not say is whence he got his information as to kaspars earliest exploits now our earliest evidence on oath before a magistrate is dated november 4 1829 george weichmann shoemaker feuerbachs anonymous citizen then swore that on may 26 1828 he saw kaspar not making paralysed efforts to walk but trudging down a hilly street shouting hi or any loud cry and presently asking with tolerable distinctness new gate street he took the boy that way and the boy gave him the letter for the captain weichmann said that they had better ask for him at the new gate guard house and the boy said guard house guard house new gate no doubt just built he said he came from ratisbon and was in nuremberg for the first time but clearly did not understand what weichmann meant when he inquired as to the chances of war breaking out in may 1834 weichmann repeated his evidence as to kaspars power of talking and walking and was corroborated by one jacob beck not heard of in 1829 on december 20 1829 merk the captains servant spoke to kaspars fatigue he reeled as he walked and would answer no questions in 1834 merk expanded and said we had a long chat kaspar averred that he could read and write and had crossed the frontier daily on his way to school he did not know where he came from certainly merk in 1834 remembered much more than in 1829 whether he suppressed facts in 1829 or in 1834 invented fables we do not know the cavalry captain november 2 1829 remembered several intelligent remarks made by kaspar his dress was new and clean denied by feuerbach he was tired and footsore the evidence of the police taken in 1834 was remote in time but went to prove that kaspars eyesight and power of writing were normal feuerbach absolutely discredits all the sworn evidence of 1829 without giving his own sources the early evidence shows that kaspar could both walk and talk and see normally by artificial and natural light all of which is absolutely inconsistent with kaspars later account of himself  the personal property of kaspar was a horn rosary and several catholic tracts with prayers to the guardian angel and so forth feuerbach holds that these were furnished by devout villainsa very sound protestant was feuerbachand that kaspar was ignorant of the being of a deity at least of a protestant deity the letter carried by the boy said that the writer first took charge of him as an infant in 1812 and had never let him take a single step out of my house i have already taught him to read and write and he writes my handwriting exactly as i do in the same hand was a letter in latin characters purporting to come from kaspars mother a poor girl as the author of the german letter was a poor daylabourer humbug as i take kaspar to have been i am not sure that he wrote these pieces if not somebody else was in the affair somebody who wanted to get rid of kaspar as that youth was an useless false convulsionary and hysterical patient no one was likely to want to keep him if he could do better no specified reward was offered at the time for information about kaspar no portrait of him was then published and circulated the burgomaster binder had a portrait and a facsimile of kaspars signature engraved but feuerbach would not allow them to be circulated heaven knows why  how kaspar fell as it were from the clouds and unseen into the middle of nuremberg even on a holiday when almost every one was out of town is certainly a puzzle the earliest witnesses took him for a journeyman tailor lad he was about sixteen and perhaps nobody paid any attention to a dusty travelling tradesman or groom out of place feuerbach who did not see kaspar till july says that his feet were covered with blisters the gaoler says that they were merely swollen by the tightness of his boots  once in prison kaspar who asked to be taken home adopted the rôle of a semiunconscious animal playing with toy horses blind though he saw yet not long after he wrote a minute account of all that he had then observed he could only eat bread and water meat made him shudder and lord stanhope says that this peculiarity did occur in the cases of some peasant soldiers he had no sense of hearing which means perhaps that he did not think of pretending to be amazed by the sound of church bells till he had been in prison for some days till then he had been deaf to their noise this is feuerbachs story but we shall see that it is contradicted by kaspar himself in writing thus the alleged facts may be explained without recourse even to a theory of intermittent deafness kaspar was no more deaf than blind he was all there and though ten days after his arrival he denied that he had ever seen weichmann in ten days more his memory for faces was deemed extraordinary and he minutely described all that on may 26 and later he had observed kaspar was taught to write by the gaolers little boy though he could write when he camein the same hand as the author of his mysterious letter though he had but half a dozen words on may 26 according to feuerbach by july 7 he had furnished binder with his historypretty quick work later in 1828 he was able to write that history himself in 1829 he completed a work of autobiography  kaspar wrote that till the age of sixteen he was kept in a prison perhaps six or seven feet long four broad and five high there were two small windows with closed black wooden shutters he lay on straw lived on bread and water and played with toy horses and blue and red ribbons that he could see colours in total darkness is a proof of his inconsistent fables or of his hyperæsthesiaabnormal acuteness of the senses the man who kept him was not less hyperæsthetic for he taught kaspar to write in the dark he never heard any noise but avers that in prison he was alarmed by the town clock striking on the first morning though feuerbach says that he did not hear the bells for several days  such is kaspars written account 1829 the published account of july 1828 derived from the expressions of a halfdumb animal as feuerbach puts it is much more prolix and minute in detail the animal said that he had sat on the ground and never seen daylight till he came to nuremberg he used to be hocussed with water of an evil taste and wake in a clean shirt the man once hit him and hurt him for making too much noise the man taught him his letters and the arabic numerals later he gave him instructions in the art of standing next he took him out and taught him about nine words he was made by the man to walk he knew not how far or how long the man leading him nobody saw this extraordinary pair on the march feuerbach who maintains that kaspars feet were covered with cruel blisters from walking also supposes that perhaps for the greater part of the way he was carried in a carriage or waggon whence then the cruel blisters caused by walking there is medical evidence that his legs were distorted by confinement but the medical postmortem evidence says that this was not the case he told binder that his windows were shuttered he told hiltel the gaoler that from his windows he saw a pile of wood and above it the top of a tree  obviously kaspars legends about himself whether spoken in june 1828 or written in february 1829 are absurdly false he was for three weeks in the tower and was daily visited by the curious yet in these three weeks the halfconscious animal learned to read tolerably well to count to write figures that he could do when he arrived feuerbach says he made progress in writing a good hand and learned a simple tune on the harpsichord pretty well for a halfunconscious animal  in july 1828 after being adopted by the excited town of nuremberg he was sent to be educated by and live with a schoolmaster named daumer and was studied by feuerbach they found in kaspar a splendid example of the sensitive and a noble proof of the powers of animal magnetism in germany at this time much was talked and written about somnambulism the hypnotic state and about a kind of animal magnetism which in accordance with mesmers theory was supposed to pass between stars metals magnets and human beings the effects produced on the patient by the hypnotist now ascribed to suggestion were attributed to a magnetic efflux and reichenbachs subjects saw strange currents flowing from metals and magnets his experiments have never perhaps been successfully repeated though hysterical persons have pretended to feel the traditional effects even when nonmagnetic objects were pointed at them now kaspar was really a sensitive or feigned to be one with hysterical cunning anything unusual would throw him into convulsions or reduce him to unconsciousness he was addicted to the tears of sensibility years later meyer read to him an account of the noachian deluge and he wept bitterly meyer thought this rather too much the deluge being so remote an event and after that though meyer read pathetic things in his best manner kaspar remained unmoved he wrote a long account of his remarkable magnetic sensations during and before the first thunderstorm after his arrival at nuremberg yet before his appearance there he must have heard plenty of thunderstorms though he pretended that this was his first the sight of the moon produced in him emotions of horror he had visions like the rev ansel bourne later to be described of a beautiful male figure in a white garment who gave him a garland he was taken to a somnambulist and felt magnetic pulls and pushes and a strong current of air indeed the tutor daumer shared these sensations obviously by virtue of suggestion they are out of fashion the doctrine of animal magnetism being as good as exploded and nobody feels pulled or pushed or blown upon when he consults mrs piper or any other medium  from a letter of feuerbach of september 20 1828 we learn that kaspar without being an albino can see as well in utter darkness as in daylight perhaps the man who taught kaspar to write in the dark was an albino kaspar never saw his face kaspars powers of vision abated as he took to beef but he remained hyperæsthetic and could see better in a bad light than daumer or feuerbach some dowsers we know can detect subterranean water by the sensations of their hands without using a twig or divining rod and others can spot gold hidden under the carpet with the twig kaspar merely with the bare hand detected without touching it a needle under a table cloth he gradually lost these gifts and the theory seems to have been that they were the result of his imprisonment in the dark and a proof of it the one thing certain is that kaspar had the sensitive or mediumistic temperament which usuallythough not alwaysis accompanied by hysteria while hysteria means cunning and fraud whether conscious or not so conscious meanwhile the boy was in the hands of men credulous curious and in the case of daumer capable of odd sensations induced by suggestion from such a boy in such company the truth could not be expected above all if like some other persons of his class he was subject to dissociation and obliviousness as to his own past  rather curiously we find in feuerbachs own published collection of trials the case of a boy sörgel who had paroxysms of second consciousness  of which he was ignorant upon returning to his ordinary state of consciousness we have also the famous case of the atheistic carpenter ansel bourne who was struck deaf dumb and blind and miraculously healed in a dissenting chapel to the great comfort of a large and warm congregation mr bourne then became a preacher but later forgot who he was strolled to a distant part of the states called himself browne set up a notions store and one day awoke among his notions to the consciousness that he was bourne not browne a preacher not a dealer in cheap futilities bourne was examined under hypnotism by professor william james and others12  footnote 12 proceedings of the society for psychical research vol vii pp 221257  many such instances of ambulatory automatism are given in my view kaspar was to put it mildly an ambulatory automatist who had strayed away like the rev mr bourne from some place where nobody desired his return rather his lifelong absence was an object of hope the longer kaspar lived the more frequently was he detected in every sort of imposture that could make him notorious or enable him to shirk work  kaspar had for months been the pet mystery of nuremberg people were sure that like the mysterious prisoner of pignerol les exiles and the isle saintemarguerite 16691703 kaspar was some great one kept out of his own now the prisoner of pignerol was really a valet and kaspar was a peasant some thought him a son of napoleon others averred as we saw that he was the infant son of the grand duke karl of baden born in 1812 who had not died within a fortnight of his birth but been spirited away by a lady disguised as the spectral white lady of baden an aristocratic banshie the subtle conspirators had bred the grand duke kaspar in a dark den the theory ran hoping that he would prove by virtue of such education an acceptable recruit for the bavarian cavalry and that no questions would be asked unluckily questions were now being asked for a boy who could only occasionally see and hear was not though he could smell a cemetery at a distance of five hundred yards an useful man on a patrol at least the military authorities thought not had they known that kaspar could see in the dark they might have kept him as a guide in night attacks but they did not know the promising young hussar he rode well but clumsily was thus left in the hands of civilians the grand ducal secret might be discovered so an assassin was sent to take off the young prince  the wonder was not unnaturally expressed that kaspar had not smelled out the villain especially as he was probably the educational albino who taught him to write in the dark on hearing of this later kaspar told lord stanhope that he had smelled the man however he did not mention this at the time to make a long story short on october 17 1829 kaspar did not come to midday eating but was found weltering in his gore in the cellar of daumers house being offered refreshment in a cup he bit out a piece of the porcelain and swallowed it he had an inconsiderable wound on the forehead to that extent the assassin had effected his purpose feuerbach thinks that the murderer had made a shot at kaspars throat with a razor that kaspar ducked cleverly and got it on the brow and that the assassin believed his crime to be consummated and fled after uttering words in which kaspar recognised the voice of his tutor the possible albino no albino or other suspicious character was observed herr daumer before this cruel outrage had remarked in kaspar a highly regrettable tendency to dissimulation and untruthfulness and just before the attack had told the pupil that he was a humbug lord stanhope quoted a paper of daumers in the universal gazette of february 6 1834 allgemeine zeitung in which he says that lying and deceit were become to kaspar a second nature when did they begin to become a second nature in any case daumer clove to the romantic theory of kaspars origin kaspar left daumers house and stayed with various good people being accompanied by a policeman in his walks he was sent to school and feuerbach bitterly complains that he was compelled to study the latin grammar and finally even cæsars commentaries like other boys kaspar protested that he did not see the use of latin and indeed many of our modern authors too obviously share kaspars indifference to the dead languages he laughed in 1831 says feuerbach at the popish superstition of his early attendants we only hear of one and about his theological predilections we learn nothing and he also laughed at ghosts in his new homes kaspar lied terribly was angry when detected and wounded himselfhe said accidentallywith a pistol after being reproached for shirking the commentaries of julius cæsar and for mendacity he was very vain very agreeable as long as no one found fault with him very lazy and very sentimental  in may 1831 lord stanhope who since the attack on kaspar in 1829 had been curious about him came to nuremberg and took up the hero with fantastic fondness though he recognised kaspars mythopoeic tendencies he believed him to be the victim of some nefarious criminals and offered a reward of 500 florins anonymously for information it never was claimed  already had arisen a new theory that kaspar was the son of an hungarian magnate later lord stanhope averred on oath that inquiries made in hungary proved kaspar to be an impostor in 1830 a man named müller who had been a protestant preacher and was now a catholic priest denounced a preacher named wirth and a miss dalbonn a governess as kidnappers of kaspar from the family of a countess living near pesth müller was exposed his motives were revealed and the newspapers told the story kaspar was therefore tried with hungarian words and seemed to recognise some especially posonbya pressburg he thought that some one had said that his father was at pressburg and thither lord stanhope sent him with lieutenant hickel this was in 1831 but kaspar recognised nothing his companions however found that he pretended to be asleep in the carriage to hear what was said about him they ceased to speak of him and kaspar ceased to slumber a later expedition into hungary by hickel in february 1832 on the strength of more hungarian excitement on kaspars part discovered that there was nothing to discover and shook the credulity of lord stanhope he could not believe kaspars narrative but still hoped that he had been terrorised into falsehood he could not believe both that the albino had never spoken to kaspar in his prison and also that the man always taught me to do what i was told to lord stanhope kaspar averred that the man with whom he had always lived said nothing to him till he was on his journey yet during his imprisonment the man had taught him he declared the phrases which by his account were all the words that he knew when he arrived at nuremberg  for these and other obvious reasons lord stanhope though he had relieved nuremberg of kaspar november 1831 and made ample provision for him was deeply sceptical about his narrative the town of nuremberg had already tried to shift the load of kaspar on to the shoulders of the bavarian government lord stanhope did not adopt him but undertook to pay for his maintenance and left him in january 1832 under the charge of a dr meyer at anspach he had a curator and a guardian and escaped from the commentaries of julius cæsar into the genial society of feuerbach that jurist died in may 1833 poisoned say the kasparites a new guardian was appointed and kaspar lived with dr meyer finding him incurably untruthful the doctor ceased to provoke him by comments on his inaccuracies and kaspar got a small clerkly place with this he was much dissatisfied for he like feuerbach had expected lord stanhope to take him to england feuerbach in the dedication to lord stanhope of his book 1832 writes beyond the sea in fair old england you have prepared for him a secure retreat until the rising sun of truth shall have dispersed the darkness which still hangs over his mysterious fate if lord stanhope ever made this promise his growing scepticism about kaspar prevented him from fulfilling it on december 9 1833 meyer was much provoked by kaspars inveterate falseness and said that he did not know how to face lord stanhope who was expected to visit anspach at christmas for some weeks kaspar had been sulky and there had been questions about a journal which he was supposed to keep but would not show he was now especially resentful on two earlier occasions after a scene with his tutor kaspar had been injured once by the assassin who cut his forehead once by a pistol accident on december 14 he rushed into dr meyers room pointed to his side and led meyer to a place distant about five hundred yards from his house so agitated was he that meyer would go no further especially as kaspar would answer no questions on their return kaspar said went court gardenmanhad a knifegave a bagstrucki ran as i couldbag must lie there kaspar was found to have a narrow wound two inches and a half under the centre of the left breast clearly caused by a very sharp doubleedged weapon in three or four days he died the heart had been injured he was able to depose but not on oath that on the morning of the 14th a man in a blouse who had addressed him some days earlier brought him a verbal message from the court gardener asking him to come and view some clay from a newly bored well where in fact no work was being done at this time he found no one at the well and went to the monument of the rather forgotten poet uz here a man came forward gave him a bag stabbed him and fled of the man he gave discrepant descriptions he became incoherent and died  there was snow lying when kaspar was stabbed but there were no footmarks near the well and elsewhere only one mans track was in the hofgarten was that track kaspars we are not told no knife was found kaspar was lefthanded and dr horlacher declared that the blow must have been dealt by a lefthanded man lord stanhope suggested that kaspar himself had inflicted the wound by pressure and that after he had squeezed the point of the knife through his wadded coat it had penetrated much deeper than he had intended a very probable hypothesis  as for the bag which the assassin gave him it was found and dr meyer said that it was very like a bag which he had seen in kaspars possession it contained a note folded said madame meyer as kaspar folded his own notes the writing was in pencil in spiegelschrift that is it had to be read in a mirror kaspar on his deathbed kept muttering incoherences about what is written with lead no one can read the note contained vague phrases about coming from the bavarian frontier  after kaspars death the question of murder or suicide agitated germany and gave birth to a long succession of pamphlets a wild woman countess albersdorf née lady graham says miss evans who later calls her lady caroline albersdorf saw visions dreamed dreams and published nonsense other pamphlets came out directed against the house of baden in 1870 an anonymous french pamphleteer offered the baden romance as from the papers of a major von hennenhofer the villain in chief of the white lady plot lord stanhope was named as the ringleader in the attacks on kaspar both at nuremberg and anspach in 1883 all the fables were revived in a pamphlet produced at ratisbon a mere hash of the libels of 1834 1839 1840 and 1870 dr meyer was especially attacked his sons defended his reputation by an action for libel on the dead an action which german law permits there was no defence and the publisher was fined and ordered to destroy all the copies in 1892 the libels were repeated by baron alexander von artin two documents of a palpably fraudulent character were added the rest was the old stuff the reader may find it in miss evanss kaspar hauser 1892 for example daumer knew a great deal he even in 1833 received an anonymous letter from anspach containing the following statement lord daniel alban durteal advocate of the royal court in london said to me i am firmly convinced that kaspar hauser was murdered it was all done by bribery stanhope has no money and lives by this affair daumer and miss evans appear to have seen nothing odd in relying on an anonymous letter about lord daniel alban durteal  lord stanhope says miss evans was known to have subsisted principally upon the sale of his german hymnbook and other devotional works for which he was a colporteur weary of piety lord stanhope became a hired assassin perhaps this nonsense still has its believers seduced by lady caroline albersdorf née lady graham by lord daniel alban durteal and by the spirit of kaspar himself who summoned by daniel dunglas home at a séance with the empress eugénie apparently announced himself as prince of baden no authority for this interesting ghost of one who disbelieved in ghosts is given  it is quite possible that kaspar hauser no more knew who he was than the valet of 16691703 knew why he was a prisoner no more than mr browne when a dealer in notions knew that he was mr bourne a dissenting preacher nothing is certain except that kaspar was an hysterical humbug whom people of sense suspected from the first and whom believers in animal magnetism and homoeopathy accepted as some great one educated by his royal enemies in total darknessto fit him for the military profession  it is difficult of course to account for the impossibility of finding whence kaspar had come to nuremberg but in 1887 it proved just as impossible to discover whither the rev ansel bourne had gone mr bournes lot was cast not in the sleepy royalist bavaria of 1828 but in the midst of the admired hustle of the great western republic he was one of the most remarkable men in the country not a yokel of sixteen he was last seen at his nephews store 121 broad street providence ri on january 17 on january 20 the hue and cry arose in the able and energetic press of his state mr bourne as a travelling evangelist was widely known but after a fortnight unaccounted for he arrived as aj browne at norristown pa sold notions there and held forth with acceptance at religious meetings on march 14 he awoke still undiscovered and wondered where he was he remembered nothing since january 17 so he wired to providence ri for information he had a whole fortnight to account for between his departure from providence ri and his arrival at norristown pa nobody could help him he had apparently walked invisible like kaspar on his way to nuremberg he was hypnotised by professor william james and brought into his browne condition but could give practically no verifiable account of brownes behaviour in that missing fortnight he said that he went from providence to pawtucket and was for some days at philadelphia pa where he really seems to have been as to the rest back of that it was mixed up we do not hear that kaspar was ever hypnotised and questioned but probably he also would have been mixed up like mr bourne  the fable about a prince of baden had not a single shred of evidence in its favour it is true that the grand duchess was too ill to be permitted to see her dead baby in 1812 but the babys father grandmother and aunt with the ten court physicians the nurses and others must have seen it in death and it is too absurd to suppose on no authority that they were all parties to the white ladys plot we might as well believe as miss evans seems to do on the authority of an unnamed paris newspaper that a latin letter complaining of imprisonment was picked up in the rhine signed s haues spraucio that the words ought to be read hares sprauka and that they are an anagram of kaspar hauser this occurred in 1816 when kaspar being about four years of age could not write latin no one in the secret could have hoped that the royal infant and captive would be recognised under the name of spraucio or even of sprauka abject credulity love of mystery love of scandal and political passions produced the ludicrous mass of fables to which as late as 1893 the duchess of cleveland thought it advisable to reply in england it is quite safe to accuse a dead man of murder or of what you please as far as the duchess understood the law of libel so she had no legal remedy     vii  the gowrie conspiracy   the singular events called the gowrie conspiracy or the slaying of the ruthvens fell out on evidence which nobody disputes in the following manner on august 5 1600 the king james vi was leaving the stables at the house of falkland to hunt a buck when the master of ruthven rode up and had an interview with the monarch this occurred about seven oclock in the morning the master was a youth of nineteen he was residing with his brother the earl of gowrie aged twentytwo at the family town house in perth some twelve or fourteen miles from falkland the interview being ended the king followed the hounds and the chase long and sore ended in a kill at about eleven oclock near falkland thence the king and the master with some fifteen of the royal retinue including the duke of lennox and the earl of mar rode without any delay to perth others of the kings company followed the whole number may have been at most twentyfive  on their arrival at perth it appeared that they had not been expected the earl had dined at noon the royal dinner was delayed till two oclock and after the scanty meal the king and the master went upstairs alone while the earl of gowrie took lennox and others into his garden bordering on the tay at the back of the house while they loitered there eating cherries a retainer of gowrie thomas cranstoun brother of sir john of that ilk brought a report that the king had already mounted and ridden off through the inch of perth gowrie called for horses but cranstoun told him that his horses were at scone across the tay two miles off the gentlemen then went to the street door of the house where the porter said that the king had not ridden away gowrie gave him the lie reentered the house went upstairs and returning assured lennox that james had certainly departed all this is proved on oath by lennox mar lindores and many other witnesses  while the company stood in doubt outside the gate a turret window above them opened and the king looked forth much agitated shouting treason and crying for help to mar with lennox and most of the others mar ran to the rescue up the main staircase of the house where they were stopped by a locked door which they could not break open gowrie had not gone with his guests to aid the king he was standing in the street asking what is the matter i know nothing when two of the kings household thomas and james erskine tried to seize him the treason being perpetrated under gowries own roof his friends drove the erskines off and some of the murrays of tullibardine who were attending a wedding in perth surrounded him gowrie retreated drew a pair of twin swords and accompanied by cranstoun and others made his way into the quadrangle of his house at the foot of a small dark staircase they saw the body of a man lyingwounded or dead cranstoun now rushed up the dark stairs followed by gowrie two ruthvens hew moncrieff patrick eviot and perhaps others at the head of the narrow spiral stair they found in a room called the gallery chamber sir thomas erskine a lame dr herries a young gentleman of the royal household named john ramsay and wilson a servant with drawn swords a fight began cranstoun was wounded he and his friends fled leaving gowrie who had been run through the body by ramsay all this while the other door of the long gallery chamber was ringing under the hammerstrokes of lennox and his company and the town bell was summoning the citizens erskine and ramsay now locked the door opening on the narrow stair at which the retainers of gowrie struck with axes the kings party by means of a hammer handed by their friends through a hole in the other door of the gallery forced the lock and admitted lennox mar and the rest of the kings retinue they let james out of a small turret opening from the gallery chamber and after some dealings with the angry mob and the magistrates of perth they conveyed the king to falkland after nightfall  the whole results were the death of gowrie and of his brother the master his body it was that lay at the foot of the narrow staircase and a few wounds to ramsay dr herries and some of gowries retainers  the death of the master of ruthven was explained thuswhen james cried treason young ramsay from the stable door had heard his voice but not his words he had sped into the quadrangle charged up the narrow stairs found a door behind which was the sound of a struggle dang in the door and saw the king wrestling with the master behind them stood a man the centre of the mystery of whom he took no notice he drew his whinger slashed the master in the face and throat and pushed him downstairs ramsay then called from the window to sir thomas erskine who with herries and wilson ran to his assistance slew the wounded master and shut up james who had no weapon in the turret then came the struggle in which gowrie died no more was seen of the mysterious man in the turret except by a townsman who later withdrew his evidence  such was the whole affair as witnessed by the kings men the retainers of gowrie and some citizens of perth not a vestige of plot or plan by gowrie and his party was discoverable his friends maintained that he had meant on that day to leave perth for lothian that is for his castle at dirleton near north berwick whither he had sent most of his men and provisions james had summoned the master to meet him at falkland they said and gowrie had never expected the return of the master with the king  jamess own version was given in a public letter of the night of the events which we only know through the report of nicholson the english resident at holyrood august 6 and nicholson only repeated what elphinstone the secretary told him of the contents of the letter written to the kings dictation at falkland by david moysie a notary at the end of august james printed and circulated a full narrative practically identical with nicholsons report of elphinstones report of the contents of the falkland letter of august 5  the kings narrative is universally accepted on all hands till we come to the point where he converses with alexander ruthven at falkland before the buckhunt began there was such an interview lasting for about a quarter of an hour but james alone knew its nature he says that after an unusually low obeisance ruthven told the following talewalking alone on the previous evening in the fields near perth he had met a baselike fellow unknown to him with a cloak cast about his mouth a common precaution to avoid recognition asked who he was and what his errand in so solitary a part being far from all ways the fellow was taken aback ruthven seized him and under his arm found a great wide pot all full of coined gold in great pieces ruthven keeping the secret to himself took the man to perth and locked him in a privy derned housethat is a room at 4 am he himself left perth to tell the king urging him to take order in the matter at once as not even lord gowrie knew of it when james said that it was no business of his the gold not being treasure trove ruthven called him over scrupulous adding that his brother gowrie and other great men might interfere james then suspecting that the gold might be foreign brought in by jesuits for the use of catholic intriguers asked what the coins and their bearer were like ruthven replied that the bearer seemed to be a scots fellow hitherto unknown to him and that the gold was apparently of foreign mintage hereon james felt sure that the gold was foreign and the bearer a disguised scots priest he therefore proposed to send back with ruthven a retainer of his own with a warrant to gowrie then provost of perth and the bailies to take over the man and the money ruthven replied that if they did the money would be ill reckoned and begged the king to ride over at once be the first seer and reward him at his own honourable discretion  the oddity of the tale and the strangeness of ruthvens manner amazed james who replied that he would give an answer when the hunt was over ruthven said the man might make a noise and discover the whole affair causing the treasure to be meddled with he himself would be missed by gowrie whereas if james came at once gowrie and the townsfolk would be at the sermon james made no answer but followed the hounds still he brooded over the story sent for ruthven and said that the hunt once ended he would accompany him to perth  here james adds that though he himself knew not that any man was with ruthven he had two companions one of whom andrew henderson he now despatched to gowrie bidding him prepare dinner for the king this is not part of jamess direct evidence he was unknowing and unsuspecting that any man living had come with ruthven  throughout the chase ruthven was ever near the king always urging him to hasten the end of the hunting the buck was slain close to the stables and ruthven would not allow james to wait for a second horse that was sent after him so the king did not even tarry to brittle the buck and merely told the duke of lennox mar and others that he was riding to perth to speak with gowrie and would return before evening some of the court went to falkland for fresh horses other followed slowly with weary steeds they followed undesired by him because a report rose that the king had some purpose to apprehend the oppressive master of oliphant ruthven implored james not to bring lennox and mar but only three or four servants to which the king answered half angrily  this odd conduct roused suspicion in james he had been well acquainted with ruthven who was suing for the place of a gentleman of the bedchamber or cubicular the farthest that the kings suspicion could reach to was that it might be that the earl his brother had handled him so hardly that the young gentleman being of a high spirit had taken such displeasure as he was beside himself hence his curious agitated and moody behaviour james as they rode consulted lennox whose first wife had been a sister of gowrie lennox had never seen anything of mental unsettlement in young ruthven but james bade the duke accompany him into that house room where the gold and the bearer of it lay lennox thought the story of the gold unlikely ruthven seeing them in talk urged that james should be secret and bring nobody with him to the first inspection of the treasure the king thus rode forward between trust and distrust about two miles from perth ruthven sent on his other companion andrew ruthven to gowrie when within a mile of perth ruthven himself rode forward in advance gowrie was at dinner having taken no notice of the two earlier messengers  gowrie with fifty or sixty men met james at the end of the inch the royal retinue was then of fifteen persons with swords alone and no daggers or whingers dinner did not appear till an hour had gone by say 2 pm james whispered to ruthven that he had better see the treasure at once ruthven bade him wait and not arouse gowries suspicions by whispering rounding james therefore directed his conversation to gowrie getting from him but half words and imperfect sentences when dinner came gowrie stood pensively by the kings table often whispering to the servants and ofttimes went in and out as he also did before dinner the suite stood about as was custom till james had nearly dined when gowrie took them to their dinner separately in the hall he sat not down with them as the common manner is but again stood silent beside the king who bantered him in a homely manner  james having sat long enough ruthven whispered that he wished to be rid of his brother so james sent gowrie into the hall to offer a kind of gracecup to the suite as was usualthis by ruthvens desire james then rose to follow ruthven asking him to bring sir thomas erskine with him ruthven requested james to command publicly that none should follow at once promising that he should make any one or two follow that he pleased to call for  the king then expecting attendants who never came because ruthven never summoned them walked alone with ruthven across the end of the hall up a staircase and through three or four chambers ruthven ever locking behind him every door as he passed we do not know whether james observed the locking of the doors or inferred it from the later discovery that one door was locked then ruthven showed a more smiling countenance than he had all the day before ever saying that he had him sure and safe enough kept at last they reached a little study a turret chamber where james found not a bondman but a freeman with a dagger at his girdle and a very abased countenance ruthven locked the turret door put his hat on his head drew the mans dagger pointed it at the kings breast avowing now that the king behoved to be in his will and used as he list threatening murder if james cried out or opened the window he also reminded the king of the death of the late gowrie his father executed for treason in 1584 meanwhile the other man stood trembling and quaking james made a long harangue on many points promising pardon and silence if ruthven at once let him go ruthven then uncovered and promised that jamess life should be safe if he kept quiet the rest gowrie would explain then bidding the other man ward the king he went out locking the door behind him he had first made james swear not to open the window in his brief absence james learned from the armed man that he had but recently been locked up in the turret he knew not why james bade him open the window on his right hand the man did as he was commanded  here the kings narrative reverts to matter not within his own observation the events which occurred downstairs during his own absence his narrative is amply confirmed on oath by many nobles and gentlemen he says here we repeat what we began by stating that during his own absence as his train was rising from dinner one of the earls servants cranstoun came hastily in assuring the earl that the king had got to horse and was away through the inch isle of perth the earl reported this to the nobles and all rushed to the gate the porter assured them that the king had not departed gowrie gave the porter the lie but turning to lennox and mar said that he would get sure information he then ran back across the court and upstairs and returned running with the news that the king was gone long since by the back gate and unless they hasted would not be overtaken  the nobles going towards the stables for their horses necessarily passed under the window of the turret on the first floor where james was imprisoned ruthven by this time had returned thither casting his hands abroad in a desperate manner as a man lost then saying that there was no help for it the king must die he tried to bind the royal hands with his garter in the struggle james drew ruthven towards the window already open at this nick of time when the kings friends were standing in the street below gowrie with them james holding out the right side of his head and his right elbow shouted for help gowrie stood ever asking what it meant but lennox mar and others as we saw instantly ran in and up the chief staircase to find the king meanwhile james in his agony pushed ruthven out of the turret the said mr alexanders head under his arms and himself on his knees towards the chamber door which opened on the dark staircase james was trying to get hold of ruthvens sword and draw it the other fellow doing nothing but standing behind the kings back and trembling all the time at this moment a young gentleman of the royal household john ramsay entered from the dark back staircase and struck ruthven with his dagger the other fellow withdrew james then pushed ruthven down the back stairs where he was slain by sir thomas erskine and dr herries who were coming up by that way the rest with the death of gowrie followed a tumult of the townsmen lasting for two or three hours delayed the return of james to falkland  such is the kings published narrative it tallies closely with the letter written by nicholson the english agent to cecil on august 6  james had thus his version from which he never varied ready on the evening of the fatal day august 5 from his narrative only one inference can be drawn gowrie and his brother had tried to lure james almost unattended to their house in the turret they had an armed man who would assist the master to seize the king events frustrated the conspiracy james was well attended the armed man turned coward and gowrie proclaimed the kings departure falsely to make his suite follow back to falkland and so leave the king in the hands of his captors the plot once arranged could not be abandoned because the plotters had no prisoner with a pot of gold to produce so their intended treason would have been manifest  how far is jamess tale corroborated at the posthumous trial of the ruthvens in november witnesses like lennox swore to his quarter of an hour of talk with ruthven at falkland before the hunt the early arrival of andrew henderson at gowries house about halfpast ten is proved by two gentlemen named hay and one named moncrieff who were then with gowrie on business to which he at once refused to attend further in the case of the hays hendersons presence with ruthven at falkland is also confirmed by a manuscript vindication of the ruthvens issued at the time none of the kings party saw him and their refusal to swear that they did see him shows their honesty the point being essential thus the circumstance that gowrie ordered no dinner for the king despite hendersons early arrival with news of his coming shows that gowrie meant to affect being taken by surprise again the flight of henderson on the very night of august 5 proves that he was implicated why else should a man fly who had not been seen by anyone except a perth witness who withdrew his evidence in connection with the fatal events no other man fled except some of gowries retainers who took open part in the fighting  jamess opinion that ruthven was deranged in consequence of harsh treatment by his brother gowrie is explained by a dispute between the brothers about the possession of the church lands of scone which gowrie held and ruthven desired the king siding with ruthven this is quite casually mentioned in a contemporary manuscript13 again lennox on oath averred that as they rode to perth james told him the story of the lure the pot of gold lennox was a man of honour and he had married gowries sister  footnote 13 the true discourse of the late treason state papers scotland elizabeth vol lvi no 50  ruthven on his return to gowries house told a retainer craigingelt that he had been on an errand not far off and accounted for the kings arrival by saying that he was brought by the royal saddler to exact payment of a debt to the man now james had just given gowrie a years immunity from pursuit of creditors and there is no trace of the saddlers presence clearly ruthven lied to craigingelt he had been at falkland not on an errand not far off  that cranstoun gowries man brought the news or rumour of the kings departure was admitted by himself that gowrie went into the house to verify the fact insisted that it was true gave the lie to the porter who denied it and tried to make the kings party take horse and follow was proved by lennox lindores ray a magistrate of perth the porter himself and others on oath  that the king was locked in by a door which could not be burst open is matter of undisputed certainty  all these are facts that winna ding and downa be disputed they were disputed however when henderson gowries factor or steward and a town councillor of perth came out of hiding between august 11 and august 20 told his story and confessed to having been the man in the turret he said that on the night of august 4 gowrie bade him ride very early next day with the master of ruthven to falkland and return with any message that ruthven might send he did returnwhen the hays and moncrieff saw himwith news that the king was coming an hour later gowrie bade him put on a shirt of mail and plate sleeves as he meant to arrest a highlander in the shoegait later the king arriving henderson was sent to ruthven in the gallery and told to do whatever he was bidden ruthven then locked him up in the turret giving no explanation presently the king was brought into the turret and henderson pretends that to a faint extent he hampered the violence of ruthven during the struggle between ramsay and ruthven he slunk downstairs went home and fled that night  it was denied that henderson had been at falkland at all nobody swore to his presence there yet it is admitted by the contemporary apologist who accuses the king of having organised the whole conspiracy against the ruthvens it was said that nobody saw henderson slink away out of the narrow stair though the quadrangle was crowded one robertson however a notary of perth gave evidence september 23 that he did see henderson creep out of the narrow staircase and step over the masters dead body robertson spoke to him but he made no reply if robertson perjured himself on september 23 he withdrew his evidence or rather he omitted it at the trial in november his life would not have been worth living in perthwhere the people were partisans of the ruthvensif he had adhered to his first statement in the absence of other testimony many fables were circulated as to hendersons absence from perth all through the day and on the other hand as to his presence in the kitchen during the crisis he was last seen for certain in the house just before the kings dinner and then by his account was locked up in the turret by the master probably robertsons first story was true other witnesses to shield their neighbours denied having seen retainers of gowries who most assuredly were present at the brawls in the quadrangle it was never explained why henderson fled at once if he was not the man in the turret i therefore conceive that as he certainly was at falkland and certainly returned early his story is true in the main  given all this only one of two theories is possible the affair was not accidental james did not fall into a panic and bellow treason out of the window merely because he found himself alone in a turretand why in a secluded turretwith the master to that theory the locked door of the gallery is a conclusive reply somebody locked it for some reason therefore either the ruthvens plotted against the king or the king plotted against the ruthvens both parties had good grounds for hatred as we shall showthat is gowrie and james had motives for quarrel but with the young master whose cause as regards the lands of scone the king espoused he had no reason for anger if james was guilty how did he manage his intrigue  with motives for hating gowrie let us say the king lays his plot he chooses for it a day when he knows that the murrays of tullibardine will be in perth at the wedding of one of the clan they will defend the king from the townsfolk clients of their provost gowrie james next invites ruthven to falkland this was asserted by ruthvens defenders he arrives at the strangely early hour of 630 am james has already invented the story of the pot of gold to be confided to lennox as proof that ruthven is bringing him to perththat he has not invited ruthven  next by secretly spreading a rumour that he means to apprehend the master of oliphant james secures a large train of retainers let us say twentyfive men without firearms while he escapes the suspicion that would be aroused if he ordered them to accompany him james has determined to sacrifice ruthven with whom he had no quarrel whatever merely as bait to draw gowrie into a trap  having put lennox off with a false reason for his accompanying ruthven alone in the house of gowrie james privately arranges that ruthven shall quietly summon him or erskine to follow upstairs meaning to goad ruthven into a treasonable attitude just as they appear on the scene he calculates that lennox erskine or both will then stab ruthven without asking questions and that gowrie will rush up to avenge his brother and be slain  but here his majestys deeply considered plot on a superficial view breaks down since ruthven for reasons best known to himself summons neither lennox nor erskine james observing this circumstance rapidly and cleverly remodels his plot and does not begin to provoke the brawl till being heaven knows why in the turret he hears his train talking outside in the street he had shrewdly provided for their presence there by ordering a servant of his own to spread the false rumour of his departure which cranstoun innocently brought why did the king do this as his original idea involved no need of such a stratagem he had also somehow persuaded gowrie to credit the rumour in the face of the porters denial of its possibility and to persist in it after making no very serious attempt to ascertain its truth to succeed in making gowrie do this in place of thoroughly searching the house is certainly the kings most striking and inexplicable success  the king has thus two strings to his nefarious bow the first was that ruthven by his orders would bring erskine and lennox and just as they appeared james would goad ruthven into a treasonable attitude whereon lennox and erskine would dirk him the second plan if this failed as it did because ruthven did not obey orders was to deceive gowrie into bringing the retinue under the turret window so that the king could open the window and cry treason as soon as he heard their voices and footsteps below this plan succeeds james yells out of the window not wanting many spectators he has somehow locked the door leading into the gallery while giving ramsay a hint to wait outside of the house within hearing and to come up by the back staircase which was built in a conspicuous tower  the rest is easy gowrie may bring up as many men as he pleases but ramsay has had orders to horrify him by saying that the king is slain this was alleged and then to run him through as he gives ground or drops his points this after a decent form of resistance in which three of the kings four men are wounded  master of the human heart like lord bateman james knows that ruthven will not merely leave him when goaded by insult and that gowrie hearing of his brothers death will not simply stand in the street and summon the citizens  to secure a witness to the truth of his false version of the matter james must have begun by artfully bribing henderson gowries steward either simply to run away and then come in later with corroboration or actually to be present in the turret and then escape or perhaps the king told his manintheturret tale merely in the air and then henderson having run away in causeless panic later sees money in it and appears with a string of falsehoods chance loves art says aristotle and chance might well befriend an artist so capable and conscientious as his majesty to be sure mr hill burton says the theory that the whole was a plot of the court to ruin the powerful house of gowrie must at once after a calm weighing of the evidence be dismissed as beyond the range of sane conclusions those who formed it had to put one of the very last men in the world to accept of such a destiny into the position of an unarmed man who without any preparation was to render himself into the hands of his armed adversaries and cause a succession of surprises and acts of violence which by his own courage and dexterity he would rule to a determined and preconcerted plan14  footnote 14 burton history of scotland v 336  if there was a royal plot without a plan then james merely intended to raise a brawl and go it blind this however is almost beyond the kings habitual and romantic recklessness we must prefer the theory of a subtly concerted and ably conducted plan constructed with alternatives so that if one string breaks another will hold fast that plan to the best of my poor powers i have explained  to drop the figure of irony all this hypothesis is starkly incredible james was not a recklessly adventurous character to go weaponless with ruthven who wore a sword and provoke him into insolence if he had been ever so brave the plot is of a complexity quite impossible no sane man still less a timid man could conceive and execute a plot at the mercy of countless circumstances not to be foreseen suppose the master slain and gowrie a free man in the street he had only to sound the tocsin summon his devoted townsmen surround the house and ask respectfully for explanations  take on the other hand the theory of gowries guilt here the motives for evil will on either side may be briefly stated since the murder of riccio 1566 the ruthvens had been the foes of the crown gowries grandfather and father were leaders in the attack on mary and riccio gowries father insulted queen mary while caged in loch leven castle by amorous advancesso she declares in 1582 gowries father captured james and held him in degrading captivity he escaped and was reconciled to his gaoler who in 1584 again conspired and was executed while the ruthven lands were forfeited by a new revolution 15851586 the ruthvens were reinstated in july 1593 gowries mother by an artful ambuscade enabled the earl of bothwell again to kidnap the king in 1594 our gowrie then a lad joined bothwell in open rebellion he was pardoned and in august 1594 went abroad travelled as far as rome studied at padua and summoned by the party of the kirk came to england in march 1600 here he was petted by elizabeth then on almost warlike terms with james for thirty years every treason of the ruthvens had been backed by elizabeth and cecil ceaselessly and continuously had abetted many attempts to kidnap james these plots were rife as late as april 1600 the object always was to secure the dominance of the kirk over the king and gowrie as the natural noble leader of the kirk was recalled to scotland in 1600 by the rev mr bruce the chief of the political preachers whom james had mastered in 159697 gowrie arriving instantly headed the opposition and on june 21 1600 successfully resisted the kings request for supplies rendered necessary by his hostile relations with england gowrie then left the court and about july 20 went to hunt in atholl his mother who had once already lured james into a snare residing at his perth house on august 1 gowrie warned his mother of his return and she went to their strong castle of dirleton near north berwick and the sea while gowrie came to his perth house on august 3 it being understood that he was to ride to dirleton on august 5 thither he had sent on most of his men and provisions on august 5 we know he went on a longer journey  we have shown that a plot by james is incredible there is no evidence to prove a plot by gowrie beyond the whole nature of the events and the strange conduct of himself and his brother but if plot he did he merely carried out in the interests of his english friends the traditional policy of his grandfather his father his mother and his ally bothwell at this time an exile in spain maturing a conspiracy in which he claimed gowrie as one of his confederates while the king was a free man gowrie could not hope to raise the discontented barons and emancipate the preachersyet more bitterly discontentedwho had summoned him home let the king vanish and the coast was clear the kirks party the english party would triumph  the inference is that the king was to be made to disappear and that gowrie undertook to do it two witnessesmr cowper minister of perth and mr rhynd gowries old tutoraverred that he was wont to speak of the need of extreme secrecy in the execution of a high and dangerous purpose such a purpose as the trapping of the king by a secret and sudden onfall was the mere commonplace of scottish politics cecils papers at this period and later are full of such schemes submitted by scottish adventurers that men so very young as the two ruthvens should plan such a device romantic and perilous is no matter for marvel  the plot itself must be judged by its original idea namely to lure james to perth with only two or three servants at an early hour in the day matters fell out otherwise but had the king entered gowrie house early and scantly attended he might have been conveyed across fife disguised in the train of gowrie as he went to dirleton thence he might be conveyed by sea to fastcastle the impregnable eyrie of gowries and bothwells old ally the reckless intriguer logan of restalrig the famous letters which scott tytler and hill burton regarded as proof of that plot i have shown by comparison of handwritings to be all forged but one of them claimed by the forger as his model for the rest is i think a feigned copy of a genuine original in that letter of logan to gowrie he is made to speak of their scheme as analogous to one contrived against a nobleman of padua where gowrie had studied this remark in a postscript can hardly have been invented by the forger sprot a low country attorney a creature of logans all the other letters are mere variations on the tune set by this piece  a plot of this kind is at least not impossible like the quite incredible conspiracy attributed to james the scheme was only one of scores of the same sort constantly devised at that time the thing next to impossible is that henderson was left as he declared in the turret by ruthven without being tutored in his rôle the kings party did not believe that henderson here told truth he had accepted the rôle they said but turned coward this is the more likely as in december 1600 a gentleman named robert oliphant a retainer of gowrie fled from edinburgh where certain revelations blabbed by him had come into publicity he had said that in paris early in 1600 gowrie moved him to take the part of the armed man in the turret that he had with good reason dissuaded him that the earl thereon left him and dealt with henderson in that matter that henderson undertook it and yet faintedthat is turned craven though nine years later in england the privy council acquitted oliphant of concealing treason had he not escaped from edinburgh in december 1600 the whole case might have been made clear for witnesses were then at hand  we conclude that as there certainly was a ruthven plot as the king could not possibly have invented and carried out the affair and that as gowrie the leader of the kirk party was young romantic and italianate he did plan a device of the regular and usual kind but was frustrated and fell into the pit which he had digged but the presbyterians would never believe that the young leader of the kirk party attempted what the leaders of the godly had often done and far more frequently had conspired to do with the full approval of cecil and elizabeth the plot was an orthodox plot but to this day historians of presbyterian and liberal tendencies prefer to believe that the king was the conspirator the dead ruthvens were long lamented and even in the nineteenth century the mothers in perthshire sang to their babes sleep ye sleep ye my bonny earl o gowrie15  footnote 15 the story with many new documents is discussed at quite full length in the authors king james and the gowrie mystery longmans 1902  a lady has even written to inform me that she is the descendant of the younger ruthven who escaped after being stabbed by ramsay and erskine fled to england married and had a family i in vain replied that young ruthvens body was embalmed exhibited in the scottish parliament and hacked to pieces which were set on spikes in public places and that after these sufferings he was unlikely to marry the lady was not to be shaken in her belief  in the athenæum for august 28 1902 mr edmund gosse recognises ramsay the ruthven slayer as author of a century of english sonnets 1619 of which lord cobham possesses a copy apparently unique the book was published at paris by réné giffart the scottish name gifford was at that time spelled giffart so the publisher was of scottish descent     viii  the strange case of daniel dunglas home   the case of daniel dunglas home is said in the dictionary of national biography to present a curious and unsolved problem it really presents i think two problems equally unsolved one scientific and the other social how did mr home the son of a scottish mother in the lower middle class at highest educated as far as he was educated at all in a village of connecticut attain his social position i do not ask why he was taken up by members of noble english families the caresses of the great may be lavished on athletes and actors and musicians and homes remarkable performances were quite enough to make him welcome in country houses moreover he played the piano the accordion and other musical instruments for his mysterious gift he might be invited to puzzle and amuse royal people not in england and continental emperors and kings but he did much more than what houdin or alexis a conjuror and a clairvoyant could do he successively married with the permission and good will of the czar two russian ladies of noble birth a feat inexplicable when we think of the rules of the continental noblesse a duc or a prince or a marquis may marry the daughter of an american citizen who has made a fortune in lard but the daughters of the russian noblesse do not marry poor american citizens with the good will of the czar by his marriages home far outwent such famous charlatans as cagliostro mesmer and the mysterious saint germain the deathless cagliostro and saint germain both came on the world with an appearance of great wealth and display the source of the opulence of saint germain is as obscure as was the source of the sudden enrichment of beau wilson whom law the financier killed in a duel cagliostro like law may have acquired his diamonds by gambling or swindling but neither these two men nor mesmer though much in the society of princes could have hoped openly and with the approval of louis xv or louis xvi to wed a noble lady yet home did so twice though he had no wealth at all  cagliostro was a lowborn neapolitan ruffian but he had a presence in the memoirs of madame doberkirch she tells us how much she disliked and distrusted cagliostro always avoiding him and warning cardinal rohan against himin vain but she admits that the man dominated her or would have dominated her by something inexplicable in his eyes his bearing and his unaccountable knowledge as when he publicly announced on a certain day the death of the great empress maria theresa of which the news did not arrive till five days later now home had none of this dominating personality he has been described to me by a lady who knew him in his later years when he had ceased to work drawingroom miracles in society as a gentle kindly quiet person with no obvious fault unless a harmless and childlike vanity be a fault thus he struck an observer not of his intimate circle he liked to give readings and recitations and he played the piano with a good deal of feeling he was a fair linguist he had been a catholic he was of the middle order of intelligence he had no mission except to prove that disembodied spirits exist if that were a legitimate inference from the marvels which attended him  mr robert bell in the cornhill magazine vol ii 1860 described homes miracles in an article called stranger than fiction his account of the mans personality is exactly like what i have already given home was a very mild specimen of familiar humanity his health was bad the expression of his face in repose he was only twentyseven is that of physical suffering there is more kindliness and gentleness than vigour in the character of his features he is yet so young that the playfulness of boyhood has not passed away and he never seems so thoroughly at ease with himself and others as when he is enjoying some light and temperate amusement  thus there was nothing in home to dominate or even to excite personal curiosity he and his more intimate friends not marchionesses but middleclass people corresponded in a style of rather distasteful effusiveness he was a pleasant young man in a house not a don juan i have never heard a whisper about light lovesunless mr hamilton aïdé to be quoted later reports such a whispernot a word against his private character except that he allowed a terribly vulgar rich woman to adopt him and give him a very large sum of money later withdrawn we shall see that she probably had mixed motives both for giving and for withdrawing the gift but it was asserted though on evidence far from sound that the spirits had rapped out a command to give home some thirty thousand pounds spirits ought not to do these things and certainly it would have been wiser in home to refuse the widows gold even if they did beyond this one affair and an alleged case of imposture at a séance homes private character raised no scandals that have survived into our knowledge it is a very strange thing as we shall see that the origin of homes miracles in broad daylight or artificial light could never be traced to fraud or indeed to any known cause while the one case in which imposture is alleged on firsthand evidence occurred under conditions of light so bad as to make detection as difficult as belief in such circumstances ought to have been impossible it is not easy to feel sure that we have certainly detected a fraud in a dim light but it is absurd to believe in a miracle when the conditions of light are such as to make detection difficult  given this mild young musical man the problems of how he achieved his social successes and how he managed to escape exposure if he did his miracles by conjuring are almost equally perplexing the second puzzle is perhaps the less hard of the two for home did not make money as a medium though he took moneys worth and in private society few seized and held the mystic hands that moved about or when they seized they could not hold them the hands melted away so people said  a sketch of homes life must now be given16 he was born in 1833 at currie a village near edinburgh in his later years he sent to his second wife a photograph of the street of cottages beside the burn in one of which he first saw the light his father had a right to bear the arms of the earls of home with a brisure being the natural son of alexander tenth earl of home17 the mediums ancestor had fought or according to other accounts had shirked fighting at flodden field as is popularly known from the ballad the sutors of selkirk the maiden name of homes mother was macneil he was adopted by an aunt who about 1842 carried the wondrous child to america he had since he was four years old given examples of second sight it was in the family homes mother who died in 1850 was secondsighted as were her greatuncle an urquhart and her uncle a mackenzie so far there was nothing unusual or alarming in homes case at least to any intelligent highlander not till 1850 after his mothers death did home begin to hear loud blows on the head of my bed as if struck by a hammer the wesley family in 171617 had been quite familiar with this phenomenon and with other rappings and movements of objects untouched in fact all these things are of worldwide diffusion and i know no part of the world savage or civilised where such events do not happen according to the evidence  footnote 16 i follow incidents in my life series i ii 1864 1872 the gift of daniel home by madame douglas home and other authorities  footnote 17 home mentions this fact in a note correcting an error of sir david brewsters incidents ii 48 note 1 the earl of home about 1856 asked questions on the subject and home stated what my connection with the family was dunglas is the second title in the family  in no instance as far as i am informed did anything extraordinary occur in connection with home which cannot be paralleled in the accounts of egyptian mediums in iamblichus18  footnote 18 the curious reader may consult my cock lane and common sense and the making of religion for examples of savage mediæval ancient egyptian and european cases  in 1850 america was interested in the rochester knockings and the case of the fox girls a replica of the old cock lane case which amused dr johnson and horace walpole the fox girls became professional mediums and long afterwards confessed that they were impostors they were so false that their confession is of no value as evidence but certainly they were humbugs the air was full of talk about them and other people like them when home aged seventeen was so constantly attended by noises of rappings that his aunt threw a chair at him summoned three preachers an independent a baptist and a wesleyan home was then a wesleyan and plunged into conflict with the devil the furniture now began to move about untouched by man and homes aunt turned him out of the house home went to a friend in another little town people crowded to witness the phenomena and the press blazoned the matter abroad henceforth home was a wonder worker but once for a whole yearfebruary 1856 to february 1857the power entirely deserted him and afterwards for shorter periods  in 1852 he was examined by the celebrated american poet bryant by a professor of harvard and others who reported the usual physical phenomena and emphatically declared that we know we were not imposed upon or deceived spirits spoke through the voice of the entranced home or rapped out messages usually gushing and home floated in the air at the house of mr ward cheney at south manchester connecticut this phenomenon is constantly reported in the bible in the lives of the saints by the bollandists in the experiences of the early irvingites in witch trials in iamblichus and in savage and european folklore lord elcho who was out with prince charles in the fortyfive writes in his unpublished memoirs that being at rome about 1767 he went to hear the evidence in the process of canonising a saint recently dead and heard witnesses swear that they had seen the saint while alive floating about in the air like home st theresa was notorious for this accomplishment homes first feat of this kind occurred in a darkened room a very dark room indeed as the evidence shows it had been darkened on purpose to try an experiment in seeing n rays which had been recently investigated by reichenbach science has brought them recently back into notice the evidence for the fact in this case was that people felt homes feet in mid air i have been lifted in the light of day only once and that was in america also in the light of four gas lamps in a room in sloane street  after attracting a good deal of notice in new york home on april 9 1855 turned up at coxs hotel jermyn street where mr cox gave him hospitality as a nonpaying guest now occurred the affair of sir david brewster and lord brougham both were capable of hallucinations lord brougham published an account of a common deathbed wraith which he saw once while in a bath the vision coincided with the death of the owner of the wraith and sir davids daughter tells how that philosopher saw that of the rev mr lyon in st leonards college st andrews a wraith whose owner was in perfect health sir david sent letters forming a journal to his family and in june no day given 1855 described his visit to home he says that he lord brougham mr cox and home sat down at a moderately sized table the structure of which we were invited to examine in a short time the table shuddered and a tremulous motion ran up our arms the table actually rose from the ground when no hand was upon it a larger table was produced and exhibited similar movements an accordion was held in lord broughams hand and gave out a single note a small handbell was then laid with its mouth on the carpet and after lying for some time it actually rang when nothing could have touched it the bell was then placed upon the other side still upon the carpet and it came over to me and placed itself in my hand it did the same to lord brougham these were the principal experiments we could give no explanation of them and could not conjecture how they could be produced by any kind of mechanism we do not believe that it was the work of spirits  so sir david wrote in a private letter of june 1855 just after the events but the affair came to be talked about and on september 29 1855 sir david wrote to the morning advertiser he had seen he said several mechanical effects which i was unable to explain but i saw enough to convince myself that they could all be produced by human feet and hands though he also in june could not conjecture how they could be produced by any kind of mechanism later october 9 sir david again wrote to the newspaper this time he said that he might have discovered the fraud had he been permitted to take a peep beneath the drapery of the table but in june he said that he was invited to examine the structure of the table he denied that a large table was moved about in a most extraordinary way in june he had asserted that this occurred he declared that the bell did not ring in june he averred that it rang when nothing could have touched it in october he suggested that machinery attached to the lower extremities of mr homes body could produce the effects in june we could not conjecture how they could be produced by any kind of mechanism on sir davids death his daughter and biographer mrs gordon published 1869 his letter of june 1855 home then scored rather freely as the man of science had denied publicly in october 1855 what he had privately written to his family in june 1855 when the events were fresh in his memory this was not the only case in which a scientist of european reputation did not increase his reputation for common veracity in his attempts to put down home  the adventures of home in the courts of europe his desertion of the errors of wesleyan methodism for those of the church of rome his handsome entertainment by diamondgiving emperors his expulsion from rome as a sorcerer and so forth cannot be dealt with here for lack of space we come to the great homebrowning problem  in 1855 home met mr and mrs browning at the house of a mr rymer at ealing the first of only two meetings19 on this occasion says home a wreath of clematis rose from the table and floated towards mrs browning behind whom her husband went and stood the wreath settled on the ladys head not on that of mr browning who home thought was jealous of the favour this is manifestly absurd soon after all but mr rymer were invited to leave the room two days later mr browning asked to be allowed to bring a friend for another séance but the arrangements of the rymers with whom home was staying made this impossible later home with mrs rymer called on the brownings in town and mr browning declined to notice home there was a scene and mrs browning who was later a threequarters believer in spirits was distressed in 1864 after mrs brownings death mr browning published mr sludge the medium which had the air of a personal attack on home as a detected and confessing american impostor such is homes account it was published in 1872 and was open to contradiction i am not aware that mr browning took any public notice of it  footnote 19 incidents ii 105  in july 1889 the late mr fwh myers and professor wf barrett published in the journal of the society for psychical research p 102 the following statement we have found no allegations of fraud in home on which we should be justified in laying much stress mr robert browning has told to one of us mr myers the circumstances which mainly led to that opinion of home which was expressed in mr sludge the medium it appears that a lady since dead repeated to mr browning a statement made to her by a lady and gentleman since dead as to their finding home in the act of experimenting with phosphorus on the production of spirit lights which so far as mr browning remembers were to be rubbed round the walls of the room near the ceiling so as to appear when the room was darkened this piece of evidence powerfully impressed mr browning but it comes to us at third hand without written record and at a distance of nearly forty years  clearly this story is not evidence against home  but several years ago an eminent writer whom i need not name published in a newspaper another version mr browning had told him he said that sitting with home and mrs browning apparently alone these three in a darkened room he saw a white object rise above the table this home represented as the phantasm of a child of mr and mrs browning which died in infancy mr browning seized the phantasm which was homes naked foot  but it must be remembered that 1 mr and mrs browning had no child which died in infancy and 2 mrs brownings belief survived the shock on december 5 1902 in the times literary supplement a letter by mr r barrett browning appeared he says mr hume who subsequently changed his name to home home is pronounced hume in scotland was detected in a vulgar fraud for i have heard my father repeatedly describe how he caught hold of his foot under the table in the other story the foot was above the table in the new version no infant phantasm occurs moreover to catch a mans foot under a table in itself proves nothing what was the foot doing and why did mr browning not tell this but quite a different story to mr myers we get no forrarder  on november 28 1902 mr merrifield in the times literary supplement published a letter on august 30  1855 from mrs browning to miss de gaudrion as to the séance with the brownings at ealing mrs browning enclosed a letter from mr browning giving his impressions mine i must frankly say were entirely different wrote mrs browning and home says mrs browning was much moved and she not only then but ever since expressed her entire belief and pleasure in what occurred in her letter mrs browning adds for my own part and in my own conscience i find no reason for considering the medium in question responsible for anything seen or heard on that occasion but i consider that the seeking for intercourse with any particular spirit would be apt to end either in disappointment or delusion and she uses the phrase the supposed spirits  this lady who wrote thus at the time cannot conceivably have been looking for the ghost of a child that never was born and been deceived by homes white foot which mr browning then caught hold ofan incident which mrs browning could not have forgotten by august 30 1855 if it occurred in july of that year yet mr  has published the statement that mr browning told him that story of homes foot dead child and all and mr  is a man of undoubted honour and of the acutest intelligence  mr browning august 30 1855 assured miss de gaudrion that he held the whole display of hands spirit utterances c to be a cheat and imposture he acquitted the rymers at whose house the séance was held of collusion and spoke very highly of their moral character but he gave no reason for his disbelief and said nothing about catching hold of homes foot either under or above the table he simply states his opinion the whole affair was melancholy stuff how can we account for the story of mr browning and homes foot can poets possess an imagination too exuberant or a memory not wholly accurate  but mr merrifield had written on august 18 1855 a record of an ealing séance of july 1855 about fourteen people sat round a table in a room of which two windows opened on the lawn the nature of the light is not stated there was heaving up of the table tapping playing an accordion under the table and so on no details are given but there were no visible hands later by such light as exists when the moon has set on a july night home gave another séance the outlines of the windows we could well see and the form of any large object intervening before them though not with accuracy of outline in these circumstances in a light sufficient he thinks mr merrifield detected an object resembling a childs hand with a long white sleeve attached to it and also attached to homes shoulder and arm and moving as home moved a lady who later became mrs merrifield corroborated20  footnote 20 journal spr may 1903 pp 77 78  this is the one known alleged case of detection of fraud on homes part given on firsthand evidence and written only a few weeks after the events one other case i was told by the observer very many years after the event and in this case fraud was not necessarily implied it is only fair to remark that mr fwh myers thought these phantasmal arms instructive in more than one respect as supplying a missing link between mere phantasms and ectoplastic phenomena21  footnote 21 human personality ii 546 547 by ectoplastic mr myers appears to have meant small materialisations exterior to the medium  now this is the extraordinary feature in the puzzle there are many attested accounts of hands seen in homes presence in a good light with no attachment and no fraud is known ever to have been detected in such instances the strange fact is that if we have one record of a detection of home in a puerile fraud in a faint light we have none of a detection in his most notable phenomena in a good light to take one example in the nineteenth century for april 1896 mr hamilton aïdé published the following statement of which he had made the record in his diary more than twenty years ago mr aïdé also told me the story in conversation he was prejudiced against home whom he met at nice in the house of a russian lady of distinction his very physical manifestations i was told had caused his expulsion from more than one private house of these aberrations one has not heard elsewhere mr aïdé was asked to meet m alphonse karr one of the hardestheaded the wittiest and most sceptical men in france a wellmerited description at a séance with home mr aïdés prejudice m karrs hardheaded scepticism prove them witnesses not biassed in favour of hocuspocus  the two arrived first at the villa and were shown into a very large uncarpeted and brilliantly lighted salon the furniture was very heavy the tables were mostly of marble and none of them had any cloths upon them there were about twenty candles in sconces all lit and a moderator lamp in the centre of the ponderous round rosewood table at which we were to sit mr aïdé examined the room carefully and observed that wires could not possibly be attached to the heavy furniture ranged along the walls and on the polished floor wires could not escape notice the number present including home was nine when all had arrived all hands were on the table but m alphonse karr insisted on being allowed to break the circle go under the table or make any other sort of search whenever he pleased this home made no objection to raps went round under the table fluttering hither and thither in a way difficult to account for by the dislocation of the mediums toe or knee the common explanation i may remark that this kind of rapping is now so rare that i think mr frederick myers with all his experience never heard it mr aïdé was observant enough to notice that a lady had casually dropped her bracelet though she vowed that it was snatched from her by a spirit it was certainly removed from her lap and danced about under the table  then suddenly a heavy armchair placed against the wall at the further end of the salotto ran violently out into the middle of the room towards us other chairs rushed about with still greater velocity the heavy table then tilted up and the moderator lamp with some pencils slid to the lower edge of the table but did not fall off mr aïdé looked under the table homes legs were inactive home said that he thought the table would ascend and alphonse karr dived under it and walked about on all fours examining everybodys feetthe others were standing up the table rose three or four feet at highest and remained in air from two to three minutes it rose so high that all could see karr and see also that no ones legs moved m karr was not a little annoyed but as sandow could not have lifted the table evenly even if allowed to put his hands beneath it and as home at one side had his hands above it clearly home did not lift it  all alike beheld this phenomenon and mr aïdé asks was i hypnotised were all hypnotised people have tried to hypnotise mr aïdé never with success and certainly no form of hypnotism known to science was here concerned no process of that sort had been gone through and except when home said that he thought the table would ascend there had been no verbal suggestion nobody was told what to look out for in hypnotic experiment it is found that a if told to see anything not present will succeed b will fail c will see something and so on though these subjects have been duly hypnotised which mr aïdé and the rest had not that an unhypnotised company or a company wholly unaware that any hypnotic process had been performed on them should all be subjected by any one to the same hallucination by an unuttered command is a thing unknown to science and most men of science would deny that even one single person could be hallucinated by a special suggestion not indicated by outward word gesture or otherwise we read of such feats in tales of glamour like that of the goblin page in the lay of the last minstrel but to psychological science i repeat they are absolutely unknown the explanation is not what is technically styled a vera causa mr aïdés story is absolutely unexplained and it is one of scores attested in letters to home from people of undoubted sense and good position mr myers examined and authenticated the letters by post marks handwriting and other tests22  footnote 22 journal spr july 1889 p 101  in one case the theory of hallucination induced by home so that people saw what did not occur was asserted by dr carpenter frs23 dr carpenter who was a wondrously superior person wrote the most diverse accounts of a séance will be given by a believer and a sceptic one will declare that a table rose in the air while another who had been watching its feet is confident that it never left the ground mr aïdés statement proves that this explanation does not fit his case dr carpenter went on to say what was not true a whole party of believers will affirm that they saw mr home float in at one window and out at another whilst a single honest sceptic declares that mr home was sitting in his chair all the time24 this was false dr carpenter referred to the published statement of lord adare dunraven and lord lindsay the earl of crawford that they saw home float into a window of the room where they were sitting out of the next room where home was and float back again at ashley place sw december 16 1868 no honest sceptic was present and denied the facts the other person present captain wynne wrote to home in a letter printed with excisions of some contemptuous phrases by madame home and read in the original ms by mr myers he said i wrote to the medium to say i was present as a witness i dont think that any one who knows me would for one moment say that i was a victim to hallucination or any humbug of that kind dr carpenter in 1871 writing in the quarterly review vol 131 pp 336 337 had criticised lord lindsays account of what occurred on december 16 1868 he took exception to a point in lord lindsays grammar he asked why lord lindsay did not cite the two other observers and he said what i doubt that the observations were made by moonlight so lord lindsay had said but the curious may consult the almanack even in a fog however people in a room can see a man come in by the window and go out again head first with the body rigid at a great height above the ground  footnote 23 contemporary review january 1876  footnote 24 contemporary review vol xxvii p 286  mr podmore has suggested that home thrust his head and shoulders out of the window and that the three excited friends fancied the rest but they first saw him in the air outside of the window of their room25 nothing is explained in this case by dr carpenters explanation dr carpenter 1871 discredited the experiments made on home by sir william crookes and attested by sir william huggins because the latter was only an amateur in a branch of research which tasks the keenest powers of observation not of experiment while in the chemical experiments of sir william crookes the ability he displayed was purely technical neither gentleman could dream that there are moral sources of error26  footnote 25 cf making of religion p 362 1898  footnote 26 quarterly review 1871 pp 342 343  alas dr carpenter when he boldly published in 1876 the thing that was not proved that a scientist may be misled by moral sources of error  in 1890 in proceedings of the spr sir william crookes published full contemporary accounts noted by himself of his experiments on home in 1871 with elaborate mechanical tests as to alteration of weights and recorded homes feats in handling redhot coals and communicating the power of doing so to others and to a fine cambric handkerchief on which a piece of redhot charcoal lay some time beyond a hole of half an inch in diameter to which home drew attention the cambric was unharmed sir william tested it it had undergone no chemical preparation  into the details of the mechanical tests as to alterations of weights i cannot go mr angelo lewis professor hoffman an expert in conjuring says that accepting sir williams veracity and that he was not hallucinated the phenomena seem to me distinctly to be outside the range of trick and therefore to be good evidence so far as we can trust personal evidence at all of homes power of producing motion without contact in inanimate bodies sir william himself writes 1890 i have discovered no flaw in the experiments or in the reasoning i based upon them27 the notes of the performances were written while they were actually in course of proceeding thus the table rose completely off the ground several times whilst the gentlemen present took a candle and kneeling down deliberately examined the position of mr homes knees and feet and saw the three feet of the table quite off the ground every observer in turn satisfied himself of the facts they could not all be hallucinated  footnote 27 proceedings spr vi 98  i have not entered on the spiritual part of the puzzle the communications from spirits of matters not consciously known to persons present but found to be correct that is too large a subject nor have i entered into the case of mrs lyons gift to home for the evidence only proved as the judge held that the gift was prompted at least to some extent by what home declared to be spiritual rappings but the only actual witness to the fact mrs lyon herself was the reverse of a trustworthy witness being a foolish capricious underbred woman humes transcribers note so in original mystery as far as the best of the drawingroom miracles are concerned is solved by no theory or combination of theories neither by the hypothesis of conjuring nor of collective hallucination nor of a blend of both the cases of sir david brewster and of dr carpenter prove how far some scientists will go rather than appear in an attitude of agnosticism of not having a sound explanation28  footnote 28 mr merrifield has reiterated his opinion that the conditions of light were adequate for his view of the object described on p 184 supra journal spr october 1904       notesince this paper was written i have been obliged by      several interesting communications from a person very      intimate with home nothing in these threw fresh light on      the mystery of his career still less tended to confirm any      theory of dishonesty on his part his legal adviser a man      of honour saw no harm in his accepting mrs lyons      proffered gift though he tried in vain to prevent her      from increasing her original present     ix  the case of captain green   play on captain greens wuddie29 said the caddy on leith links and his employer struck his ball in the direction of the captains gibbet on the sands mr duncan forbes of culloden sighed and taking off his hat bowed in the direction of the unhappy mariners monument  one can imagine this little scene repeating itself many a time long after captain thomas green his mate john madder or mather and another of his crew were taken to the sands at leith on the second wednesday in april 1705 being april 11 and there hanged within the floodmark upon a gibbet till they were dead mr forbes of culloden later president of the court of session and far more than the butcher cumberland the victor over the rising of 1745 believed in the innocence of captain green wore mourning for him attended the funeral at the risk of his own life and when the porteous riot was discussed in parliament rose in his place and attested his conviction that the captain was wrongfully done to death  footnote 29 gibbet  green like his namesake in the popish plot was condemned for a crime of which he was probably innocent nay more he died for a crime which was not proved to have been committed though it really may have been committed by persons with whom green had no connection while green may have been guilty of other misdeeds as bad as that for which he was hanged like the other green executed for the murder of sir edmund berry godfrey during the popish plot the captain was the victim of a fit of madness in a nation that nation being the scottish the cause of their fury was not religionthe fever of the covenant had passed awaybut commerce  twere long to tell and sad to trace the origin of the caledonian frenzy in 1695 the scottish parliament had passed with the royal assent an act granting a patent to a scottish company dealing with africa the indies and incidentally with the globe at large the act committed the occupant of the scottish throne william of orange to backing the company if attacked by alien power but it was unlucky that england was then an alien power and that the scots act infringed the patent of the much older english east india company englishmen dared not take shares finally in the venture of the scots and when the english board of trade found out in 1697 the real purpose of the scottish companynamely to set up a factory in darien and anticipate the advantages dreamed of by france in the case of m de lessepss panama canala strange thing happened the celebrated philosopher mr john locke and the other members of a committee of the english board of trade advised the english government to plagiarise the scottish project and seize the section of the isthmus of panama on which the scots meant to settle this was not done but the dutch usurper far from backing the scots company bade his colonies hold no sort of intercourse with them the scots were starved out of their settlement the few who remained fled to new york and jamaica and there perishing of hunger were refused supplies by the english colonial governors a second scottish colony succumbed to a spanish fleet and army and the company with a nominal capital of 400000l and with 220000l paid up was bankrupt macaulay calculates the loss at about the same as a loss of forty millions would have been to the scotland of his own day let us say twentytwo millions  we remember the excitement in france over the panama failure scotland in 1700 was even more furious and that led to the hanging of captain green and his men there were riots the rioters were imprisoned in the heart of midlothianthe tolbooththe crowd released them some of the crowd were feebly sentenced to the pillory the public pelted themwith white roses and had the chevalier de st george not been a child of twelve he would have had a fair chance of recovering his throne the trouble was tided over william iii died in 1702 queen anne came to the crown but the bankrupt company was not dead its charter was still legal and with borrowed money it sent out vessels to trade with the indies the company had a vessel the annandale which was seized in the thames at the instance of the east india company and condemned for a breach of that companys privileges  this capture awakened the sleeping fury among my fiery countrymen 1704 an english ship connected with either the english east india company or the rival million company put into leith road to repair here was a chance for the charter of the scots company authorised them to make reprisals and to seek and take reparation of damage done by sea and land on the strength of this clause which was never meant to apply to englishmen in scottish waters but to foreigners of all kinds on the spanish main the scottish admiralty took no steps but the company had a celtic secretary mr roderick mackenzie and the english parliament in 1695 had summoned mr mackenzie before them and asked him many questions of an impertinent and disagreeable nature this outrageous proceeding he resented for he was no more an english than he was a japanese subject the situation of the worcester in scottish waters gave roderick his chance his chief difficulty as he informed his directors was to get together a sufficient number of such genteel pretty fellows as would of their own free accord on a sudden advertisement be willing to accompany me on this adventure namely the capture of the worcester and whose dress and behaviour would not render them suspected of any uncommon design in going aboard a scheme more sudden and daring than the seizure by a few gentlemen of a wellarmed english vessel had not been executed since the bold buccleuch forced carlisle castle and carried away kinmont willie the day was saturday and mr mackenzie sauntered to the cross in the high street and invited genteel and pretty fellows to dine with him in the country they were given an inkling of what was going forward and some dropped off like the less resolute guests in mr stevensons adventure of the hansom cabs when they reached leith roderick found himself at the head of eleven persons of whom most be as good gentlemen and i must own much prettier fellows than i pretend to be they were of the same sort as roy middleton haliburton and dunbar who fourteen years earlier being prisoners on the bass rock seized the castle and through three long years held it for king james against the english navy  the eleven chose mr mackenzie as chief and having swords pistols and some with bayonets too set out mackenzie his servant and three friends took a boat at leith with provision of wine brandy sugar and lime juice four more came as a separate party from newhaven the rest first visited an english manofwar in the firth and then in a convivial manner boarded the worcester the punchbowls were produced liquor was given to the sailors while the officers of the worcester drank with the visitors in the cabin mackenzie was supposed to be a lord all was festivity a most compleat scene of a comedy acted to the life when as a scottish song was being sung each officer of the worcester found a pistol at his ear the carpenter and some of the crew rushed at the loaded blunderbusses that hung in the cabin but there were shining swords between them and the blunderbusses by nine at night on august 12 mackenzies followers were masters of the english ship and the hatches gunroom chests and cabinets were sealed with the official seal of the scottish african and east india company in a day or two the vessel lay without rudder or sails in bruntisland harbour as secure as a thief in a mill mackenzie landed eight of the ships guns and placed them in an old fort commanding the harbour entry manned them with gunners and all this while an english manofwar lay in the firth  for a peaceful secretary of a commercial company with a scratch eleven picked up in the street on a saturday afternoon to capture a vessel with a crew of twentyfour well accustomed to desperate deeds was a sufficient camisado or onfall for three or four days and nights mr mackenzie had scarcely an hours sleep by the end of august he had commenced an action in the high court of admiralty for condemning the worcester and her cargo to compensate for the damages sustained by his company through the english seizure of their ship the annandale when mackenzie sent in his report on september 4 he added that from very odd expressions dropt now and then from some of the ships crew he suspected that captain green of the worcester was guilty of some very unwarrantable practices  the scottish privy council were now formally apprised of the affair which they cautiously handed over to the admiralty the scottish company had for about three years bewailed the absence of a ship of their own the speedy return which had never returned at all her skipper was a captain drummond who had been very active in the darien expedition her surgeon was mr andrew wilkie brother of james wilkie tailor and burgess of edinburgh the pair were most probably descendants of the wilkie tailor in the canongate who was mixed up in the odd business of mr robert oliphant in the gowrie conspiracy of 1600 friends of captain drummond surgeon wilkie and others who had disappeared in the speedy return began to wonder whether the crew of the worcester in their wanderings had ever come across news of the missing vessel one george haines of the worcester hearing of a captain gordon who was the terror of french privateers said our sloop was more terrible upon the coast of malabar than ever captain gordon will be to the french mackenzie asking haines if he had ever heard of the speedy return the missing ship haines replied you need not trouble your head about her for i believe you wont see her in haste he thought that captain drummond had turned pirate  haines now fell in love with a girl at bruntisland aged nineteen named anne seaton and told her a number of things which she promised to repeat to mackenzie but disappointed him though she had blabbed to others it came to be reported that captain green had pirated the speedy return and murdered captain drummond and his crew the privy council in january 1705 took the matter up a seal or forged copy of the seal of the scottish african and east india company was found on board the worcester and her captain and crew were judicially interrogated after the manner of the french juge dinstruction  on march 5 1705 the scottish court of admiralty began the trial of green and his men charles may surgeon of the worcester and two negroes antonio ferdinando cooks mate and antonio francisco captains man were ready to give evidence against their comrades they were accused of attacking between february and may 1703 off the coast of malabar a vessel bearing a red flag and having english or scots aboard they pursued her in their sloop seized and killed the crew and stole the goods  everyone in scotland except resolute whigs believed the vessel attacked to have been captain drummonds speedy return but there was nothing definite to prove the fact there was no corpus delicti in fact the case was parallel to that of the campden mystery in which three people were hanged for killing old mr harrison who later turned up in perfect health in greens as in the campden case some of the accused confessed their guilt and yet evidence later obtained tends to prove that captain drummond and his ship and crew were all quite safe at the date of the alleged piracy by captain green none the less it does appear that captain green had been pirating somebody and perhaps he was none the waur o a hanging though as he had an english commission to act against pirates it was argued that if he had been fighting at all it was against pirates that he had been making war now hainess remark that captain drummond as he heard had turned pirate looks very like a hedge to be used in case the worcester was proved to have attacked the speedy return  there was a great deal of preliminary sparring between the advocates as to the propriety of the indictment the jury of fifteen contained five local skippers most of the others were traders one of them william blackwood was of a family that had been very active in the darien affair captain green had no better chance with these men than james stewart of the glens in face of a jury of campbells the first witness ferdinando the black sea cook deponed that he saw greens sloop take a ship under english colours and that green his mate madder and others killed the crew of the captured vessel with hatchets ferdinandos coat was part of the spoil and was said to be of scottish cloth charles may surgeon of the worcester being on shore heard firing at sea and later dressed a wound a gunshot he believed on the arm of the black cook dressed wounds also of two sailors of the worcester mackay and cumingscots obviously by their names he found the deck of the worcester when he came on board lumbered with goods and chests he remarked on this and madder the mate cursed him and bade him mind his plaister box he added that the worcester before his eyes while he stood on shore was towing another vessel which he heard was sold to a native dealercoge commodowho told the witness that the worcester had been fighting the worcester sprang a leak and sailed for five weeks to a place where she was repaired as if she were anxious to avoid inquiries  antonio francisco captain greens black servant swore that being chained and nailed to her forecastle he heard the worcester fire six shots two days later a quantity of goods was brought on board captured it would seem by the terrible sloop of the worcester and ferdinando then told this witness about the killing of the captured crew and showed his own wounded arm francisco himself lay in chains for two months and of course had a grudge against captain green it was proved that the worcester had a cipher wherein to communicate with her owners who used great secrecy that her cargo consisted of arms and was of such slight value as not to justify her voyage unless her real business was piracy the ship was of 200 tons twenty guns thirtysix men and the value of the cargo was but 1000l really things do not look very well for the enterprise of captain green there was also found a suspicious letter to one of the crew reynolds from his sisterinlaw advising him to confess and referring to a letter of his own in which he said that some of the crew had basely confessed the ladys letter and a copy of reynoldss admitted by him to be correct were before the court  again james wilkie tailor had tried at bruntisland to pump haines about captain drummond haines swore profane but later said that he heard drummond had turned pirate and that off the coast of malabar they had manned their sloop lest drummond whom they believed to be on that coast should attack them other witnesses corroborated wilkie and had heard haines say that it was a wonder the ground did not open and swallow them for the wickedness that had been committed during the last voyage on board of that old i omit a nautical term of endearment bess some one telling haines that the mates uncle had been burned in oil for trying to burn dutch ships at amsterdam the said george haines did tell the deponent that if what captain madder the mate had done during his last voyage were known he deserved as much as his uncle had met with anne seaton the girl of hainess heart admitted that haines had told her that he knew more of captain drummond than he would express at that time and she had heard his expressions of remorse he had blabbed to many witnesses of a precious something hidden aboard the worcester to anne he said that he had now thrown it overboard we shall see later what this object was anne was a reluctant witness glen a goldsmith had seen a seal of the scots east india company in the hands of madder the inference being that it was taken from the speedy return  sir david dalrymple for the prosecution made the most he could of the evidence the black cooks coat taken from the captured vessel in my judgment appears to be scots rugg he also thought it a point in favour of the cooks veracity that he was very ill and forced to lie down in court in fact the cook died suddenly on the day when captain green was condemned and the scots had a high opinion of dying confessions the white cook who joined the worcester after the seafight said that the black cook told him the whole story at that time why did the worcester sail for thirtyfive days to repair her leak which she might have done at goa or surat instead of sailing some 700 leagues for the purpose the jury found that there was one clear witness to robbery piracy and murder and accumulative corroboration  the judges ordered fourteen hangings to begin with those of green madder and three others on april 4 on march 16 at edinburgh thomas linsteed made an affidavit that the worcester left him on shore on business about january 1703 that fishing crews reported the fight of the sloop against a vessel unknown they left before the fight ended that the dutch and portuguese told him how the worcesters men had sold a prize and thought but little of it because it is what is ordinary on that coast and that the worcesters people told him to ask them no questions on march 27 george haines made a full confession of the murder of a captured crew he being accessory thereto at sacrifice rock between tellicherry and calicut and that he himself after being seized by mackenzie threw his journal of the exciting events overboard now in his previous blabbings before the trial as we have seen haines had spoken several times about something on board the worcester which the scots would be very glad to lay hands on thereby indicating this journal of his and he told anne seaton as she deponed at the trial that he had thrown the precious something overboard in his confession of march 27 he explained what the mysterious something was he also declared march 28 that the victims of the piracy spoke the scots language a sailor named bruckley also made full confession these men were reprieved and doubtless expected to be but haines all the while remorseful i think told the truth the worcester had been guilty of piracy  but had she pirated the scottish ship the speedy return captain drummond as to that point on april 5 in england two of the crew of the worcester who must somehow have escaped from mackenzies raid made affidavit that the worcester fought no ship during her whole voyage this would be more satisfactory if we knew more of the witnesses on march 21 at portsmouth two other english mariners made affidavit that they had been of the crew of the speedy return that she was captured by pirates while captain drummond and surgeon wilkie were on shore at maritan in madagascar and that these two witnesses went on board a moca ship called the defiance escaped from her at the mauritius and returned to england in the raper galley of the fate of drummond and wilkie left ashore in madagascar they naturally knew nothing if they spoke truth captain green certainly did not seize the speedy return whatever dark and bloody deeds he may have done off the coast of malabar  in england as secretary johnstone son of the caitiff covenanter waristoun wrote to baillie of jerviswoode the whigs made party capital out of the proceedings against green they said it was a jacobite plot i conceive that few scottish whigs to be sure marched under roderick mackenzie  in scotland the privy council refused queen annes demand that the execution of green should be suspended till her pleasure was known but they did grant a weeks respite on april 10 a mob partly from the country gathered in edinburgh the privy council between the mob and the queen let matters take their course on april 11 the mob raged round the meetingplace of the privy council rooms under the parliament house and chevied the chancellor into a narrow close whence he was hardly rescued however learning that green was to swing after all the mob withdrew to leith sands where they enjoyed the execution of an englishman the whole affair hastened the union of 1707 for it was a clear case of union or war between the two nations  as for drummond many years later on the occasion of the porteous riot forbes of culloden declared in the house of commons that a few months after green was hanged letters came from captain drummond of the speedy return and from the very ship for whose capture the unfortunate person suffered informing their friends that they were all safe but the speedy return was taken by pirates two of her crew say off madagascar and burned what was the date of the letters from the speedy return to which long afterwards forbes and he alone referred what was the date of the capture of the speedy return at maritan in madagascar without the dates we are no wiser  now comes an incidental and subsidiary mystery in 1729 was published madagascar or robert drurys journal during fifteen years captivity on that island written by himself digested into order and now published at the request of his friends drury says as we shall see that he a lad of fifteen was prisoner in madagascar from about 1703 to 1718 and that there he met captain drummond late of the speedy return if so green certainly did not kill captain drummond but drurys narrative seems to be about as authentic and historical as the socalled souvenirs of madame de créquy in the edition of 189030 of drurys book edited by captain pasfield oliver ra author of madagascar the captain throws a lurid light on drury and his volume captain pasfield oliver first candidly produces what he thinks the best evidence for the genuineness of drurys story namely a letter of the rev mr hirst on board hms lenox off madagascar 1759 this gentleman praises drurys book as the best and most authentic for drury says that he was wrecked in the degrave east indiaman and his story exactly agrees as far as it goes with the journal kept by mr john benbow second mate of the degrave that journal of benbows was burned in london in 1714 but several of his friends remembered that it tallied with drurys narrative but as drurys narrative was certainly edited probably by defoe that master of fiction may easily have known and used benbows journal otherwise if benbows journal contained the same references to captain drummond in madagascar as drury gives then the question is settled drummond died in madagascar after a stormy existence of some eleven years on that island as to drury captain pasfield oliver thinks that his editor probably defoe or an imitator of defoe faked the book partly out of de flacourts histoire de madagascar 1661 and a french authority adds another old french source dappers description de lafrique drury was himself a pirate his editor thinks defoe picked his brains or an imitator of defoe did so and defoe or whoever was the editor would know the story that drummond really lost the speedy return in madagascar and could introduce the scottish adventurer into drurys romance  footnote 30 fisher unwin  we can never be absolutely certain that captain drummond lost his ship but lived on as a kind of condottiere to a native prince in madagascar between us and complete satisfactory proof a great gulf has been made by fire and water foes of old as the greek poet says which conspired to destroy the journal kept by haines and the journal kept by benbow the former would have told us what piratical adventures captain green achieved in the worcester the latter if it spoke of captain drummond in madagascar would have proved that the captain and the speedy return were not among the worcesters victims if we could be sure that benbows journal corroborated drurys romance we could not be sure that the editor of the romance did not borrow the facts from the journal of benbow and we do not know that this journal made mention of captain drummond for the only valid testimony as to the captains appearance in madagascar is the affidavit of israel phippany and peter freeland at portsmouth march 31 1705 and these mariners may have perjured themselves to save the lives of english seamen condemned by the scots  yet as a patriotic scot i have reason for believing in the english affidavit at portsmouth the reason is simple but sufficient captain drummond if attacked by captain green was the man to defeat that officer make prize of his ship and hang at the yardarm the crew which was so easily mastered by mr roderick mackenzie and eleven pretty fellows hence i conclude that the worcester really had been pirating off the coast of malabar but that the ship taken by captain green in these waters was not the speedy return but another unknown if so there was no great miscarriage of justice for the indictment against captain green did not accuse him of seizing the speedy return but of piracy robbery and murder though the affair of the speedy return was brought in to give local colour this fact and the national excitement in scotland probably turned the scale with the jury who otherwise would have returned a verdict of not proven that verdict in fact would have been fitted to the merits of the case but there was mair tint at shirramuir than when captain green was hanged31 that green was deeply guilty i have inferred from the evidence to mr stephen ponder i owe corroboration he cites a passage from hamiltons new account of the east indies 1727 chap 25 which is crucial  footnote 31 the trial is in howells state trials vol xiv 1812 roderick mackenzies account of his seizure of the worcester was discovered by the late mr hill burton in an oak chest in the advocates library and is published in his scottish criminal trials vol i 1852  the unfortunate captain green who was afterwards hanged in scotland came on board my ship at sunset very much overtaken in drink and several of his men in the like condition at calicut february 1703 he wanted to sell hamilton some arms and ammunition and told me that they were what was left of a large quantity that he had brought from england but had been at madagascar and had disposed of the rest to good advantage among the pirates i told him that in prudence he ought to keep these as secrets lest he might be brought in trouble about them he made but little account of my advice and so departed about ten in the night his chief mate mr mather came on board of my ship and seemed to be very melancholy he burst out in tears and told me he was afraid that he was undone that they had acted such things in their voyage that would certainly bring them to shame and punishment if they should come to light and he was assured that such a company of drunkards as their crew was composed of could keep no secret i told him that i had heard at coiloan quilon that they had not acted prudently nor honestly in relation to some moors ships they had visited and plundered and in sinking a sloop with ten or twelve europeans in her off coiloan next day i went ashore and met captain green and his supercargo mr callant who had sailed a voyage from surat to sienly with me before dinnertime they were both drunk and callant told me that he did not doubt of making the greatest voyage that ever was made from england on so small a stock as 500l  in the evening their surgeon accosted me and asked if i wanted a surgeon he said he wanted to stay in india for his life was uneasy on board of his ship that though the captain was civil enough yet mr mather had treated him with blows for asking a pertinent question of some wounded men who were hurt in the engagement with the sloop i heard too much to be contented with their conduct and so i shunned their conversation for the little time i staid at calicut  whether captain green and mr mathew had justice impartially in their trial and sentence i know not i have heard of as great innocents condemned to death as they were  the evidence of hamilton settles the question of the guilt of green and his crew as regards some unfortunate vessel or sloop had the speedy return a sloop with her     x  queen oglethorpe  in collaboration with miss alice shield   her oglethorpe majesty was kind acute resolute and of good counsel she gave the prince much good advice that he was too weak to follow and loved him with a fidelity which he returned with an ingratitude quite royal  so writes colonel henry esmond describing that journey of his to barleduc in lorraine whence he brought back monsieur baptiste all to win fair beatrix esmond we know how monsieur baptiste stole his ladylove from the glum colonel and ran after the maids and drank too much wine and came to the kings arms at kensington the day after the fair he was always after the fair and found argylls regiment in occupation and heard king george proclaimed  where in the world did thackeray pick up the materials of that brilliant picture of james viii gay witty reckless ready to fling away three crowns for a fine pair of eyes or a neat pair of ankles his majestys enemies brought against him precisely the opposite kind of charges there is a broadsheet of 1716 hue and cry after the pretender which is either by swift or by one of the gentlemen whom like captain bobadil he had taught to write almost or altogether as well as himself as to gaiety in james you tell him it is a fine day and he weeps and says he was unfortunate from his mothers womb as to ladies a weakness for the sex remarked in many popular monarchs as atterbury said to lady castlewood our pamphleteer tells the opposite tale two highland charmers being introduced to comfort him after the comfort of a man james displayed an incredible inhumanity to beauty and clean linen merely asking them whether they thought the duke of argyll would stand another battle it is hard on a man to be stamped by history as recklessly gay and amorous also as a perfect mrs gummidge for tearful sentiment and culpably indifferent to the smiles of beauty james is greatly misunderstood the romance of his youthsword and cloak and disguise pistol dagger and poison prepared for him story of true love blighted by a humorous cast of destiny voyages perils shipwrecks dances at innsall is forgotten or is unknown  meanwhile who was her oglethorpean majesty and why does the pamphleteer of 1716 talk of james stuart alias oglethorpe by a strange combination of his bad luck james is called miss oglethorpes ungrateful lover by thackeray and miss oglethorpes brother by the pamphleteer and by whig slander in general thackeray in fact took miss oglethorpe from the letter which bolingbroke wrote to wyndham after st germains found him out as st jamess had done for a traitor bolingbroke merely mentions fanny oglethorpe as a busy intriguer there is no evidence that she ever was at barleduc in her life none that she ever was queen oglethorpe we propose to tell for the first time the real story of this lady and her sisters  the story centres round the meath home for incurables this excellent institution

river wey that once washed them on an october day the surrey hills standing round about in shadowy distances the silence of two centuries is scarcely broken by the rustle of leaves dropping on their own deep carpet and the very spirit of a lost cause dwells here slowly dying the house stands backed by a steep wooded hill beyond which cornfields clothe the wold and meet the sky the mansion is a grey twostoried parallelogram flanked by square towers of only slighter elevation their projecting bays surmounted by openwork cornices of leafy tracery in whiter stone  the tale used to run one has heard it vaguely in conversation that the old house at godalming is haunted by the ghost of prince charlie and one naturally asks what is he doing there what he was doing there will appear later  in 1688 the year of the regifugium westbrook place was sold to theophilus oglethorpe who had helped to drive                       the whigs     frae bothwell brigs  and later to rout monmouth at

the gentleman who remembered shooting snipe on the site of conduit street  after the revolution sir theophilus was engaged with sir john fenwick was with him when he cocked his beaver in the face of the princess of orange had to fly to france after the failure at la hogue and in 1693 was allowed to settle peacefully at westbrook place anne and eleanor were left in france where they were brought up as catholics at st germains and befriended by the exiled james and mary of modena now in 1699 theophilus one of the oglethorpe boys was sent out to his fathers old friend mr pitt governor of fort st george in india the man of the pitt diamond his outfit had to be prepared in a hurry and a young gentlewoman frances shaftoe was engaged to help with the sewing of his several dozens of linen shirts the flourishing of neckcloths and drawing of cotton stripes as young gentlewomen of limited means were used to do before they discovered hospitals and journalism this girl who developed a political romance of her own was of good northumberland family related to sir john fenwick and the delavals her father a merchant in newcastle had educated her in a civil and virtuous manner and she had lived there about eighteen years behaving herself discreetly modestly and honestly as nine northumbrian justices of the peace were ready to testify under their hand the strange story she later told of her experiences at westbrook and afterwards cannot therefore be wholly dismissed as a tale trumped up for political purposes though its most thrilling incident is so foolish a lie as to discredit the whole  on the saturday before christmas 1699 so ran her later revelations32 made in 1707 she took the coach from godalming obedient to instructions by letter from sir theophilus a little way down the strand he joined her in the coach accompanied by two young ladiesfriends she was told of lady oglethorpe and for some time she knew no more of who they were and whence they came they were very secret appeared in no company but made themselves useful in the pleasant homely ways of english country life of that time helped with the sewing made their own bed swept their chamber dressed the two little girls mary and fanny and waited on each other presently it turned out that they were anne and eleanor oglethorpe who had been eleven years in france at the court of james ii where they were known as anne and eleanor barkly they had taken advantage of the peace to come secretly over a long sea and had waited at the house of their mothers brotherinlaw mr cray the city winemerchant until parliament was up and their father could take them home for christmas a member of parliament must not be compromised by the presence of catholic daughters from st germains whom it was treason even to harbour  footnote 32 narrative of frances shaftoe printed 1707  fanny shaftoe was admitted into the family she says on quite familiar terms but always behaved very meek and humble ready to help any of the servants to make beds or to take care of the little boy the general when his nurse was busy helping in the garden anne and eleanor were merry friendly girls and chatted only too freely with fanny shaftoe over the sewing she certainly heard a great deal of treason talked she heard how sir theophilus and his wife went back and forward disguised between england and st germains how lady oglethorpe had taken charge of the queens diamonds when she fled from whitehall and safely returned them three years later travelling as an old doctorwoman in a ridinghood selling powders and plasters in a little basket there was unseemly jubilation over the death of queen annes son the little duke of gloucester in july 1700though fanny admits they were sorry at firstand somewhat partisan comparisons were drawn between him a poor soft child who had no wit he was really a very promising spirited boy and the little prince of wales who was very witty  to this careless chatter fanny shaftoe added exaggerations and backstairs gossip and an astounding statement which lived as the feeblest lie can live anne oglethorpe she said informed her that the real prince of wales born june 10 1688 had died at windsor of convulsions when five or six weeks old that lady oglethorpe hurried up to town with her little son james born a few days before the prince and that the oglethorpe baby died or was lost on the road the truth was a secret between her mother and the queen all they knew was that their little brother never turned up again anne added confusing the story by too much detail as all accounts of the royal fraud are confused that the children had been sick together that the prince had then died and her brother had been substituted for him  in november 1700 frances shaftoe according to her later revelations left westbrook her mother had written from newcastle to say her sister was dying anne and eleanor were very sympatheticthey were really nice girls lady oglethorpe was very kind and gave her four guineas for her eleven months services and she seems to have been satisfied with it as handsome remuneration she asserts inconsistently that she had much ado to get away but she never went to newcastle three months later being still in london she was sent for to a house in the strand where she met anne oglethorpe anne gave her a letter from her mother which had been kept back because anne had expected to come up sooner to town otherwise she would have sent it anne had a cold and a swelled face she and eleanor were going to france and she persuaded fanny to go with them to make a long tale short they shut her up in a convent lest she should blab the great secret james stuart is really james oglethorpe  in september 1701 james ii died and lady oglethorpe carried to the princess anne the affecting letter of farewell he wrote to her commending his family to her care anne and eleanor went to england in november 1702 and from that date until easter 1706 fanny shaftoe says she heard no more about them in april 1702 sir theophilus died and was buried in st jamess piccadilly where the memorial erected by his widow may be seen  theophilus the heir probably remained a while in the far east with pitt but there were oglethorpes nearer home to dabble in the scots plot of that year 1704 in june several scottish officerssir george maxwell captain livingstone and others amounting to fifteen or sixteen with three ladies one of whom was anne oglethorpe embarked at the hague for scotland sir george had tried in vain to procure a passport from queen annes envoy so though it was in wartime they sailed without one harley informed by captain lacan late of galways foot in piedmont told lord treasurer godolphin who had the party arrested on landing the queen who plotted as much as anybody on behalf of her brother was indulgent to fellowconspirators and though it was proved their purpose had been to raise commotions in scotland they were soon set at liberty and the informer sent back to holland with empty pockets33  footnote 33 boyer reign of queen anne  anne oglethorpe nevertheless having crossed without a pass lay at the mercy of the government but as with joseph in egypt her misfortune turned into her great opportunity the late mr h manners in an article in the dictionary of national biography34 supposes she had been king jamess mistress before she left st germains now see how thackeray has misled historians he makes fanny oglethorpe jamess mistress queen oglethorpe at barleduc in 1714 and resting on this evidence mr manners represents anne oglethorpe as jamess mistress at st germains in 1704 anne left st germains before james was sixteen and her character is blasted by the easy plan of mistaking her for her younger sister who was no more queen oglethorpe than she was  footnote 34 article oglethorpe sir theophilus  poor anne did not scape calumny perhaps deserved it boyer says that godolphin and harley quarrelled for her smiles which beamed on harley lord oxford swifts dragon and an irreconcilable enmity arose in 1713 schutz describes anne oglethorpe as oxfords mistress but she had troubles of her own before that date she arrived in england a jacobite conspirator in 1704 her wit and beauty endeared her to harley and she probably had a foot in both camps queen annes and king jamess  but in 1706 strange rumours came from the north mrs shaftoe had after five years silence received letters from her daughter fanny the sempstress by a secret hand and was filling newcastle with lamentations over trepanning imprisonment and compulsory conversion with the object of making fanny a nun a young english priest agent for supplying the catholic squires of northumberland with chaplains was sent to france by her catholic cousin mrs delaval to find out the truth the consequence of his inquiries was that anne oglethorpe was arrested in england and charged before the queen and council with trepanning and trying to force fanny shaftoe to become a nun anne flung herself at the queens feet and implored mercy she escaped being sent to newgate but was imprisoned in a messengers house to await further proceedings and ordered to produce fanny shaftoe as a witness  eleanor oglethorpe was in france and rushed to the convent where fanny shaftoe was held captive told her how anne was in prison on her account and entreated her to sign a statement that she had come to france and become a catholic of her own free will but fanny refused her long detailed story was printed and published for the prosecution in 1707 at the moment when the chevaliers chances in scotland were most promising had he landed only with his valet says ker of kersland scotland would have been his cameronians and cavaliers alike would have risen but the french admiral would not put him on shore as for anne she was discharged having great allies but fanny shaftoes story did its work james stuart for whig purposes was james oglethorpe annes brother fannys narrative was republished in 1745 to injure prince charlie  restored to society and harley anne queened it royally if we believe old tom hearne whose mss are in the bodleian anne practically negotiated the treaty of utrecht she found a french priest whose sister was in the household of madame de maintenon she wrote mysterious letters to him he showed them to louis xiv and the priest was presently lurking in miss oglethorpes town house harley visited his egeria she introduced the abbé gauthier the abbé himself and messager were appointed by france to treat harley insisted on the surrender of dunkirk louis offered anne oglethorpe 2000000 livres if she would save dunkirk for france her oglethorpean majesty refused the gold but did louiss turn on condition that he would restore king james for all this magnanimity we have only tom hearnes word swift for example was not likely to reveal these romantic circumstances about the lady and the dragon  swift does not mention anne in his letters but being so deep in the greatest intrigues of the day and in the smallest she was a valuable source of information to thomas carte the nonjuring historian and her lifelong correspondent when he was gathering materials for his life of the first duke of ormond and his history of england in 1713 nairne jamess secretary desires abram menzies to inquire if mrs oglethorpe had credit with honyton harley and how far35 schutz the hanoverian envoy writes to bothmar november 21 1713 miss oglethorpe the lord treasurers mistress said that the pretender was to travel and she said it on the very day the news came from holland that the bishop of london had declared to the plenipotentiaries who are there that the queen entreated their masters not to receive the pretender in their dominions36 she knew all the particulars of harleys opposition to the duke of ormonds schemes for improving the army and what the exchequer could and could not supply to back them37 she knew all about lady mashams quarrel with her cousin lord oxford in 1713 over the 100000l in ten per cents which lady masham had expected to make out of the quebec expedition and assiento contract had not his lordship so disobliged her anne acted as intermediary hunting up her friend the duke of ormond with whom her mother had great influence and fetching him to meet lady masham at kensingtonwho told him how ill the queen was and how uneasy at nothing being done for her brother the chevalier if ormond would but secure lady masham 30000l of the 100000l she would join with him and he should have the modelling of the army as he pleased ormond also failed to oblige lady masham but bolingbroke whom she hated snatched his opportunity in the quarrel and got her the money in return for which service lady masham had harley turned out of office and bolingbroke set in his place and then queen anne died  footnote 35 carte mss  footnote 36 macpherson hanoverian papers  footnote 37 carte mss in the bodleian  miss oglethorpe also knew that sir thomas hanmer and bishop atterbury were the two persons who sent the messenger mentioned only as sir cp in the carte papers to warn ormond to escape to france in 1715 women seem to have managed the whole political machine in those days as the lengthy and mysterious letters of mrs white jean murray and others in the carte mss testify  we are not much concerned with the brothers of the oglethorpe girls but the oldest theophilus turned jacobite that he had transferred his allegiance and active service to king james is proved by his letters from paris to james and to gualterio in 1720 and 172138 according to the second report on the stuart papers at windsor he was created a baron by james iii in 1717 in 1718 he was certainly outlawed for his younger brother james edward the famous general oglethorpe succeeded to the westbrook property in that year  footnote 38 gualterio mss add mss british museum  in july 1714 fanny oglethorpe now about

the rising collapsed returning to france james dismissed bolingbroke and retired to avignon thence to urbino and last to rome in 1719 he describes mrs oglethorpes letters as politically valueless and full of selfjustifications and old stories he answers them only through his secretary but in 1722 he consoled poor anne by making her a countess of ireland annes bolt was shot she had had her day but the day of her fair sisters was dawning mr john law of lauriston soidisant had made england too hot to hold him his great genius for financial combinations was at this time employed by him in gleek

marquis des marches whom she married in 1719 and so ceased conspiring the oglethorpe girls for penniless exiles had played their cards well fanny and eleanor had won noble husbands poor anne went back to godalming wherein the very darkest days of the jacobite party when james was a heartbroken widower and the star of prince charless natal day shone only on the siege of gaetashe plotted with thomas carte the historian  the race of 1715 was passing the race of 1745 was coming on and touching it is to read in the brown old letters the same loyal namesfloyds wogans gorings trants dillons staffords sheridans the scots of course and the french descendants of the oglethorpe girls eleanors infants the de mézières family had been growing up in beauty and honour as was to be expected of the children of the valiant marquis and the charming eleanor their eldest daughter eléonore eugénie married charles de rohan prince de montauban younger brother of the duc de montbazon whose wife was the daughter of the duc de bouillon and princess caroline sobieska and so first cousin to the sons of james iii that branch of oglethorpes thus became connected with the royal family which would go far towards rousing their hereditary jacobitism when the fortyfive cast its shadow before  in may 1740 madame de mézières took it into her head to run over to england and applied to newcastle for a pass through lady mary herbert of powisa very suspect channel the minister made such particular inquiries as to the names of the servants she intended to bring that she changed her mind and did not go one wonders what person purposed travelling in her suite whose identity dared not stand too close scrutiny there was a brave and eager prince of wales over the water nearly twenty who had some years ago fleshed his maiden sword with honour and who was in secret correspondence on his own account with his fathers english supporters could he have had some such plan even then of putting fate to the touch he is reported in coxes walpole to have been in spain in disguise years before  in 1742 eleanor had the sorrow of losing a daughter in a tragic way she had recently become a canoness of povesay a very noble foundation indeed in lorraine where the sisters wore little black ribbons on their heads which they called husbands she was twentyfive very pretty and most irreligiously devoted to shooting and hunting though these chapters of noble canonesses are not by any means strict after the use of ordinary convents there were serious expostulations made when the novice insisted upon constantly carrying a gun and shooting she fell one day when out with her gun as usual it went off and killed her on the spot  whatever eleanor aimed at in 1740 by a journey to england was baulked by newcastles caution in 1743 the indefatigable lady and a scottish lord submitted a scheme to louis xv but it was thwarted by de noailles then prince charles rode secretly out of rome landed like napoleon at fréjus and at the expedition of dunkirk met the earl marischal and young glengarry  the chevalier de mézières too eleanors son went to dunkirk with saxe to embark for england there was a great storm and the ships went aground several officers and soldiers jumped into the sea and some were drowned the chevalier de mézières came riding along the shore to hear that a dear friend was drowning the sea was going back but very heavy and de mézières rode straight into the raging waters to seek his friend the waves went over his head and carried away his hat but he persevered until he had seized a man he dragged him ashore to find it was a common soldier he hastened back and saved several soldiers and two or three officers his friend after all had never been in danger  the saxe expedition never sailed so eugène de mézières went to beat hanoverians elsewhere and was wounded at fontenoy consequently he could not follow the prince to scotland his mother eleanor plunged into intrigue for the forward party prince charlies party distrusted by james at rome she is a mad woman said james she and carte the historian were working up an english rising to join the princes scottish adventure but were baffled by jamess cautious helpless advisers then came the fortyfive eleanor was not subdued by culloden the undefeated old lady was a guest at the great dinner with the splendid new service of plate which the prince gave to the princesse de talmond and his friends in 1748 he was braving all europe in his hopeless way and refusing to leave france in accordance with the treaty of aixlachapelle when he was imprisoned at vincennes eleanor was threatened catholic as she was she frankly declared that prince charles had better declare himself a protestant and marry a german protestant princess he therefore proposed to one a day or two before he disappeared from avignon in february 1749 and he later went over to london and embraced the anglican faith  it was too late but eleanor oglethorpe was not beaten in october 1752 the great affair was being incubated again alexander murray of the elibank family exasperated by his imprisonment for a riot at the westminster election had taken service with prince charles he had arranged that a body of young jacobite officers in foreign service with four hundred highlanders under young glengarry should overpower the guards break into st jamess palace and seize king george while the westminster mob murrays lambs should create an uproar next day glengarry would post north the highlanders would muster at the house of touch and charles would appear among his beloved subjects the very medal to commemorate the event was struck with its motto laetamini cives the prince was on the coast in readinessnay if we are not mistaken the prince was in westbrook house at godalming  this we conjecture because in that very budding time of the elibank plot newcastle suddenly discovered that the unwearied eleanor oglethorpe marquise de mézières was in englandhad arrived secretly without any passport he tracked her down at westbrook house that lay all desolate and deserted the windows closed the rightofway through the grounds illegally shut up general oglethorpe after 1746 had abandoned his home for he had been courtmartialled on a charge of not attacking cluny and lord george murray when the highlanders stood at bay at clifton and defeated cumberlands advancedguard the general was acquitted but retiring to his wifes house at carham he deserted westbrook place  the empty house retired in its woodlands on the portsmouth road convenient for the coast was the very place for prince charles to lurk in while murray and glengarry cleared the way to the throne and so in fact we find eleanor oglethorpe secretly ensconced at westbrook place while the plot ripened and local tradition still shows the vault in which the pretender could take refuge if the house was searched all this again coincides with the vague legend of the tall brownhaired ghost who haunts westbrook placelast home of a last hope  the young glengarry as we know carried all the tale of the plot to the english prime minister while he made a merit of his share in it with james at rome eleanor too was run to earth at westbrook place she held her own gallantly as to having no passport she reminded newcastle that she had asked for a passport twelve years ago in 1740 she was now visiting england merely to see her sister anne who could not outlast the winter but who did so none the less nor could anne have been so very ill for on arriving at dover in october eleanor did not hasten to annes sickbed far from that she first spent an agreeable weekwith whom with my lady westmoreland at mereworth in kent now lord westmoreland was the head of the english jacobites and at mereworth according to authentic family tradition prince charles held his last council on english ground the whole plot seems delightfully transparent and it must be remembered that in october newcastle knew nothing of it he only received glengarrys information early in november  the letter of madame de mézières with her account of her innocent proceedings is written in french exactly like that of the dowager countess of castlewood in esmond she expressed her special pleasure in the hope of making newcastles personal acquaintance she went to bath she made lady albemarle profoundly uncomfortable about her lords famous mistress in paris and no doubt she plunged on her return into the plots with prussia for a restoration in the privy council in november 1753 her arrest was decided on newcastle jots down on a paper of notes to seize madame de mézières with her papers no expense to be spared to find the pretenders son sir john gooderich to be sent after him lord anson to have frigates on the scotch and irish coasts  by 1759 eleanor was perhaps weary of conspiring her daughter the princesse de ligne was the fair patroness of that expedition which hawke crushed in quibéron bay while charles received the news at dunkirk  all was ended for seventytwo years the oglethorpe women had used their wit and beauty through three generations for a lost cause they were not more lucky with the best intentions than eleanors grandson the prince de lambesc with hereditary courage he rescued an old woman from a burning cottage and flung her into a duckpond to extinguish her blazing clothes the old woman was drowned  not long ago a lady of much wit but of no occult pretensions and wholly ignorant of the oglethorpes looked over westbrook place then vacant with the idea of renting it on entering it she said i have a feeling that very interesting things have happened here probably they had40  footnote 40 the facts are taken from ailesburys de

dÉon   the mystery of the chevalier dÉon 17281810 the question of his sex on which so many thousand pounds were betted is no mystery at all the chevalier was a man and a man of extraordinary courage audacity resource physical activity industry and wit the real mystery is the problem why at a mature age fortytwo did dÉon take upon him and endure for forty years the travesty of feminine array which could only serve him as a source of notorietyin short as an advertisement the answer probably is that having early seized opportunity by the forelock and having been obliged after an extraordinary struggle to leave his hold he was obliged to clutch at some mode of keeping himself perpetually in the public eye hence probably his persistent assumption of feminine costume if he could be distinguished in no other way he could shine as a mystery there was even lucre in the pose41  footnote 41 the most recent work on dÉon le chevalier dÉon par octave homberg and fernand jousselin plonnourrit paris 1904 is rather disappointing the authors aver that at a recent sale they picked up many mss of dÉon which had lain for more than a century in the back shop of an english bookseller no other reference as to authenticity is given and some letters to dÉon of supreme importance are casually cited but are not printed on the other hand we have many new letters for the later period of the life of the hero the best modern accounts are that by the duc de broglie who used the french state archives and his own family papers in le secret du roi paris 1888 and the strange career of the chevalier dÉon 1885 by captain j buchan telfer rn longmans 1885 a book now out of print the author was industrious but not invariably happy in his translations of french originals dÉon himself drew up various accounts of his adventures some of which he published they are oddly careless in the essential matter of dates but contain many astounding genuine documents which lend a sort of doubtsome trust to others hardly more incredible which cannot be verified and are supposed by the duc de broglie to be interpolations captain buchan telfer is less sceptical the doubtfulness to put it mildly of some papers and the pretty obvious interpolations in others deepen the obscurity  charles dÉon was born on october 7 1728 near tonnerre his family was of chétive noblesse but well protected and provided for by patent places he was highly educated took the degree of doctor of law and wrote with acceptance on finance and literature his was a studious youth for he was as indifferent to female beauty as was frederick the great and his chief amusements were fencing of which art he was a perfect master and society in which his wit and gaiety made the girlishlooking lad equally welcome to men and women all were fond of le petit dÉon so audacious so ambitious and so amusing  the prince de conti was his chief early patron and it was originally in support of contis ambition to be king of poland that louis xv began his incredibly foolish secreta system of foreign policy conducted by hidden agents behind the backs of his responsible ministers at versailles and in the courts of europe the results naturally tend to recall a gilbert and sullivan comic opera of diplomacy we find magnificent ambassadors gravely trying to carry out the royal orders and thwarted by the kings secret agents the king seems to have been too lazy to face his ministers and compel them to take his own line while he was energetic enough to work like tiberius or philip ii of spain at his secret penelopes task of undoing by night the warp and woof which his ministers wove by day in these mysterious labours of his the comte de broglie later a firm friend of dÉon was with tercier one of his main assistants  the king thus enjoyed all the pleasures and excitements of a conspirator in his own kingdom dealing in ciphered despatches with the usual cant names carried in the false bottoms of snuffboxes precisely as if he had been a jacobite plotter it was entertaining but it was not diplomacy and sooner or later louis was certain to be blackmailed by some underling in his service that underling was to be dÉon  in 1755 louis wished to renew relations long interrupted with elizabeth empress of russia the lady whom prince charlie wanted to marry and from whose offered hand the brave james keith fled as fast as horses could carry him elizabeth in 1755 was an ally of england but was known to be french in her personal sympathies though she was difficult of access as a messenger louis chose a scot described by captain buchan telfer as a mackenzie a jesuit calling himself the chevalier douglas and a jacobite exile he is not to be found in the dictionary of national biography a sir james and a sir john douglasif both were not the same manwere employed as political agents between the english and scottish jacobites in 1746 and in 1749 between the prince and the landgrave of hesse whatever the true name of the douglas of louis xv i suspect that he was one or the other of these dim jacobites of the douglas clan in june 1755 this chevalier douglas was sent by louis to deal with elizabeth he was certainly understood by louis to be a real douglas a fugitive jacobite and he was to use in ciphered despatches precisely the same silly sort of veiled language about the fur trade as prince charless envoys had just been using about the timber trade with sweden  douglas set forth disguised as an intellectual british tourist in the summer of 1755 and it is captain buchan telfers view that dÉon joined him also as a political agent in female apparel on the road and that while douglas failed and left russia by october 1755 dÉon remained at st petersburg attired as a girl douglass niece and acting as the lectrice of the empress whom he converted to the french alliance this is the traditional theory but is almost certainly erroneous sometimes in his vast mss dÉon declares that he went to russia disguised in 1755 but he represents himself as then aged twenty whereas he was really twentyseven and this he does in 1773 before he made up his mind to pose for life as a woman he had a running claim against the french government for the expenses of his first journey to russia this voyage in 1776 he dates in 1755 but in 1763 in an official letter he dates his journey to russia of which the expenses were not repaid in 1756 that is the true chronology nobody denies that he did visit russia in 1756 attired as a male diplomatist but few now believe that in 1755 he accompanied douglas as that gentlemans pleasing young niece  mm homberg and jousselin in their recent work42 declare that among dÉons papers which lay for a century in the back shop of a london bookseller they find letters to him from june 1756 written by tercier who managed the secret of louis xv there are no known proofs of dÉons earlier presence in russia and in petticoats in 1755  footnote 42 le chevalier dÉon p 18  he did talk later of a private letter of louis xv of october 4 1763 in which the king wrote that he had served him usefully in the guise of a female and must now resume it and that letter is published but all the evidence to which we shall return tends to prove that this paper is an ingenious deceptive interpolation if the king did write it then he was deceiving the manager of his secret policytercierfor in the note he bids dÉon remain in england while he was at the same time telling tercier that he was uneasy as to what dÉon might do in france when he obeyed his public orders to return43 if then the royal letter of october 4 1763 testifying to dÉons feminine disguise in russia be genuine louis xv had three strings to his bow he had his public orders to ministers he had his private conspiracy worked through tercier and he had his secret intrigue with dÉon of which tercier was allowed to know nothing this hypothesis is difficult if not impossible and the result is that dÉon was not current in russia as douglass pretty french niece and as reader to the empress elizabeth in 1755  footnote 43 broglie secret du roi ii 51 note  in 1756 in his own character as a man and a secretary he did work under douglas then on his second visit public and successful to gain russia to the french alliance for dismissed in october 1755 douglas came back and publicly represented france at the russian court in july 1756 this was to the highest degree of probability dÉons first entrance into diplomacy and he triumphed in his mission he certainly made the acquaintance of the princess dashkoff and she as certainly in 17691771 when on a visit to england gave out that dÉon was received by elizabeth in a manner more appropriate to a woman than a man it is not easy to ascertain precisely what the tattle of the princess really amounted to but dÉon represents it so as to corroborate his tale about his residence at elizabeths court as lectrice in 1755 the evidence is of no value being a biassed thirdhand report of the russian ladys gossip there is a mezzotint published in 1788 from what professes to be a copy by angelica kauffmann of a portrait of dÉon in female costume at the age of twentyfive if these attributions are correct dÉon was masquerading as a girl three years before he went to russia and if the portrait is exact was wearing the order of st louis ten years before it was conferred on him the evidence as to this copy of an alleged portrait of dÉon is full of confusions and anachronisms and does not even prove that he thus travestied his sex in early life  in russia when he joined douglas there in the summer of 1756 dÉon was a busy secretary of legation in april 1757 he went back to versailles bearing rich diplomatic sheaves with him and one of those huge presents of money in gold to voltaire which no longer come in the way of men of letters while he was at vienna on his way back to st petersburg tidings came of the battle of prague dÉon hurried to versailles with the news and though he broke his leg in a carriage accident he beat the messenger whom count kaunitz officially despatched by thirtysix hours this unladylike proof of energy and endurance procured for dÉon a gold snuffbox elizabeth only gave him a trumpery snuffbox in tortoiseshell with the kings miniature a good deal of money and a commission in the dragoons for the little mans heart was really set on a military rather than a diplomatic career however as diplomat he ferreted out an important secret of russian internal treachery and rejected a bribe of a diamond of great value the moneys worth of the diamond was to be paid to him by his own government but he no more got that than he got the 10000 livres for his travelling expenses  thus early was he accommodated with a grievance and because dÉon had not the wisdom to see that a man with grievances is a ruined man he overthrew later a promising career in the violence of his attempts to obtain redress this was dÉons bane and the cause of the ruinous eccentricities for which he is remembered in 1759 he ably seconded the egregious louis xv in upsetting the policy which de choiseul was carrying on by the kings orders de choiseuls duty was to make the empress mediate for peace in the seven years war the duty of dÉon was to secure the failure of de choiseul without the knowledge of the french ambassador the marquis de lhospital of whom he was the secretary possessed of this pretty secret dÉon was a man whom louis could not safely offend and snub and dÉon must therefore have thought that there could scarcely be a limit to his success in life but he disliked russia and left it for good in august 1760  he received a life pension of 2000 livres and was appointed aidedecamp to the maréchal de broglie commanding on the upper rhine he distinguished himself in august 1761 by a very gallant piece of service in which he says truly or not he incurred the illwill of the comte de guerchy the pair were destined to ruin each other a few years later dÉon also declares that he led a force which dislodged the highland mountaineers in a gorge of the mountain at einbeck i know not what highland regiment is intended but dÉons orders bear that he was to withdraw troops opposed to the highlanders and a certificate in his favour from the duc and the comte de broglie does not allude to the circumstance that instead of retreating before the plaids he drove them back to the english camp it may therefore be surmised that though dÉon often distinguished himself and was wounded in the thigh at ultrop his claim of a victory over a highland regiment isan interpolation de broglie writes we purpose retreating i send m dÉon to withdraw the swiss and grenadiers of champagne who are holding in check the scottish highlanders lining the wood on the crest of the mountain whence they have caused us much annoyance the english outposts were driven in but after that was done the french advance was checked by the plaided gael dÉon did not                quell the mountaineer     as their tinchel quells the game  not a word is said about his triumph even in the certificate of the two de broglies which dÉon published in 1764  in 1762 france and england weary of war began the preliminaries of peace and dÉon was attached as secretary of legation to the french negotiator in london the duc de nivernais who was on terms so intimate with madame de pompadour that she addressed him in writing as petit époux in the language of the affections as employed by the black natives of australia this would have meant that de nivernais was the recognised rival of louis xv in the favour of the lady but the inference must not be carried to that length there are different versions of a trick which dÉon as secretary played on mr robert wood author of an interesting work on homer and with the jacobite savant jemmy dawkins the explorer of palmyra the story as given by nivernais is the most intelligible account mr wood as under secretary of state brought to nivernais and read to him a diplomatic document but gave him no copy dÉon however opened woods portfolio while he dined with nivernais and had the paper transcribed to this dÉon himself adds that he had given wood more than his whack during dinner of a heady wine grown in the vineyards of his native tonnerre  in short the little man was so serviceable that in the autumn of 1762 de nivernais proposed to leave him in england as interim minister after the ducs own return to france little dÉon is very active very discreet never curious or officious neither distrustful nor a cause of distrust in others de nivernais was so pleased with him and so anxious for his promotion that he induced the british ministers contrary to all precedent to send dÉon instead of a british subject to paris with the treaty for ratification he then received from louis xv the order of st louis and as de nivernais was weary of england where he had an eternal cold and resigned dÉon was made minister plenipotentiary in london till the arrival of the new ambassador de guerchy  now de guerchy if we believe dÉon had shown the better part of valour in a dangerous military task the removal of ammunition under fire whereas dÉon had certainly conducted the operation with courage and success the two men were thus on terms of jealousy if the story is true while de nivernais did not conceal from dÉon that he was to be the brain of the embassy and that de guerchy was only a dull figurehead dÉon possessed letters of de broglie and de praslin in which de guerchy was spoken of with pitying contempt in short his despatchboxes were magazines of dangerous diplomatic combustibles he also succeeded in irritating de praslin the french minister before returning to his new post in london for dÉon was a partisan of the two de broglies now in the disgrace of madame de pompadour and of louis xv though the comte de broglie disgraced as he was still managed the secret policy of the french king  dÉons position was thus full of traps he was at odds with the future ambassador de guerchy and with the minister de praslin and would not have been promoted at all had it been known to the minister that he was in correspondence with and was taking orders from the disgraced comte de broglie but by the fatuous system of the king dÉon in fact was doing nothing else de broglie exiled from court was dÉons real master he did not serve de guerchy and de praslin and madame de pompadour who was not in the secret of her royal lover  the kings secret now 1763 included a scheme for the invasion of england which dÉon and a military agent were to organise at the very moment when peace had been concluded there is fairly good evidence that prince charles visited london in this year no doubt with an eye to mischief in short the new minister plenipotentiary to st jamess unknown to the french government and to the future ambassador de guerchy was to manage a scheme for the ruin of the country to which he was accredited if ever this came out the result would be if not war with england at least war between louis xv his minister and madame de pompadour a result which frightened louis xv more than any other disaster  the importance of his position now turned dÉons head in the opinion of horace walpole who of course had not a guess at the true nature of the situation dÉon in london entertained french visitors of eminence and the best english society it appears with the splendour of a fullblown ambassador and at whose expense certainly not at his own and neither the late ambassador de nivernais nor the coming ambassador de guerchy a man far from wealthy had the faintest desire to pay the bills angry and tactless letters therefore passed between dÉon in london and de guerchy de nivernais and de praslin in paris de guerchy was dull and clumsy dÉon used him as the whetstone of his wit with a reckless abandonment which proves that he was as they say rather above himself like napoleon before the march to moscow london in short was the moscow of little dÉon when de guerchy arrived and dÉon was reduced to secrétariser and indeed was ordered to return to france and not to show himself at court he lost all selfcontrol the recall came from the minister de praslin but dÉon as we know though de praslin knew it not was secretly representing the king himself he declares that at this juncture october 11 1763 louis xv sent him the extraordinary private autograph letter speaking of his previous services in female attire and bidding him remain with his papers in england disguised as a woman the improbability of this action by the king has already been exposed pp 242 243 supra  but when we consider the predicament of louis obliged to recall dÉon publicly while all his ruinous secrets remained in the hands of that disgraced and infuriated little man it seems not quite impossible that he may have committed the folly of writing this letter for the public recall says nothing about the secret papers of which dÉon had quantities what was to become of them if he returned to france in disgrace if they reached the hands of de guerchy they meant an explosion between louis xv and his mistress and his ministers to parry the danger then according to dÉon louis privately bade him flee disguised with his cargo of papers and hide in female costume if louis really did this and dÉon told the story to the father of madame de campan he had three strings to his bow as we have shown and one string was concealed a secret within a secret even from tercier yet what folly was so great as to be beyond the capacity of louis  meanwhile dÉon simply refused to obey the kings public orders and denied their authenticity they were only signed with a griffe or stamp not by the kings pen and hand he would not leave london he fought de guerchy with every kind of arm accused him of suborning an assassin published private letters and his own version of the affair fled from a charge of libel could not be extradited by virtue of what mm homberg and jousselin call the law of home rule fortified his house and went armed probably there really were designs to kidnap him just as a regular plot was laid for the kidnapping of de la motte at newcastle after the affair of the diamond necklace in 1752 a marquis de fratteau was collared by a sham marshal court officer put on board a boat at gravesend and carried to the bastille  dÉon under charge of libel lived a fugitive and cloistered existence till the man who he says was to have assassinated him de vergy sought his alliance and accused de guerchy of having suborned him to murder the little daredevil a grand jury brought in a true bill against the french ambassador and the ambassadors butler accused of having drugged dÉon fled but the english government by aid of what the duc de broglie calls a noli prosequi nolle being usual tided over a difficulty of the gravest kind the granting of the nolle prosequi is denied44 the ambassador was mobbed and took leave of absence and louis xv through de broglie offered to dÉon terms humiliating to a king the chevalier finally gave up the warrant for his secret mission in exchange for a pension of 12000 livres but he retained all other secret correspondence and plans of invasion as for de guerchy he resigned 1767 and presently died of sheer annoyance while his enemy the chevalier stayed in england as london correspondent of louis xv he reported in 1766 that lord bute was a jacobite and de broglie actually took seriously the chance of restoring by butes aid charles iii who had just succeeded by the death of the old chevalier to a kingdom not of this world  footnote 44 political register sept 1767 buchan telfer p 181  the death of louis xv in 1774 brought the folly of the secret policy to an end but in the same year rumours about dÉons dubious sex appeared in the english newspapers on the occasion of his book les loisirs du chevalier dÉon published at amsterdam bets on his sex were made and dÉon beat some bookmakers with his stick but he persuaded drouet an envoy from france that the current stories were true and this can only be explained if explained at all by his perception of the fact that his secret employment being gone he felt the need of an advertisement overtures for the return of the secret papers were again made to dÉon but he insisted on the restoration of his diplomatic rank and on receiving 14000l on account of expenses he had aimed too high however and was glad to come to a compromise with the famous beaumarchais the extraordinary bargain was struck that dÉon for a consideration should yield the secret papers and to avoid a duel with the son of de guerchy and the consequent scandal should pretend to be a woman and wear the dress of that sex in his new capacity he might return to france and wear the cross of the order of st louis  beaumarchais was as thoroughly taken in as any dupe in his own comedies in dÉon he saw a blushing spinster a kind of jeanne darc of the eighteenth century pining for the weapons and uniform of the martial sex but yielding her secret and forsaking her arms in the interest of her king on the other side the blushless captain of dragoons listened with downcast eyes to the sentimental compliments of beaumarchais and suffered himself without a smile to be compared to the maid of orleans says the duc de broglie our manners are obviously softened wrote voltaire dÉon is a pucelle dorléans who has not been burned to de broglie dÉon described himself as the most unfortunate of unfortunate females dÉon returned to france where he found himself but a nine days wonder it was observed that this pucelle too obviously shaved that in the matter of muscular development she was a little hercules that she ran upstairs taking four steps at a stride that her hair like that of jeanne darc was coupé en rond of a military shortness and that she wore the shoes of men with low heels while she spoke like a grenadier at first dÉon had all the social advertisement which was now his one desire but he became a nuisance and by his quarrels with beaumarchais a scandal in drawingroom plays he acted his english adventures with the great playwriter whose part was highly ridiculous now dÉon pretended to desire to take the veil as a nun now to join the troops being sent to america he was consigned to retreat in the castle of dijon 1779 he had become a weariness to official mankind he withdrew 178185 to privacy at tonnerre and then returned to london in the semblance of a bediamonded old dame who after dinner did not depart with the ladies he took part in fencing matches with great success and in 1791 his library was sold at christies with his swords and jewels the catalogue bears the motto from juvenal      quale decus rerum si virginis auctio fiat  no doubt selected by the learned little man the snuffbox of the empress elizabeth a gift to the diplomatist of 1756 fetched 2l 13s 6d the poor old boy was badly hurt at a fencing match in his sixtyeighth year and henceforth lived retired from arms in the house of a mrs cole an object of charity he might have risen to the highest places if discretion had been among his gifts and his career proves the quantula sapientia of the french government before the revolution in no other time or country could the kings secret have run a course far more incredible than even the story of the chevalier dÉon     xii  saintgermain the deathless   among the best brief masterpieces of fiction are lyttons the haunters and the haunted and thackerays notch on the axe in roundabout papers both deal with a mysterious being who passes through the ages rich powerful always behind the scenes coming no man knows whence and dying or pretending to die obscurelyyou never find authentic evidence of his decease in other later times at other courts such an one reappears and runs the same course of luxury marvel and hidden potency  lytton returned to and elaborated his idea in the margrave of a strange story who has no soul and prolongs his physical and intellectual life by means of an elixir margrave is not bad but he is inferior to the hero less elaborately designed of the haunters and the haunted thackerays tale is written in a tone of mock mysticism but he confesses that he likes his own story in which the strange hero through all his many lives or reappearances and through all the countless loves on which he fatuously plumes himself retains a slight germanjewish accent  it appears to me that the historic original of these romantic characters is no other than the mysterious comte de saintgermainnot of course the contemporary and normal french soldier and minister of 17071778 who bore the same name i have found the name with dim allusions in the unpublished letters and mss of prince charles edward stuart and have not always been certain whether the reference was to the man of action or to the man of mystery on the secret of the latter the deathless one i have no new light to throw and only speak of him for a single reason aristotle assures us in his poetics that the best known myths dramatised on the athenian stage were known to very few of the athenian audience it is not impossible that the story of saintgermain though it seems as familiar as the myth of oedipus or thyestes may after all not be vividly present to the memory of every reader the omniscient larousse of the dictionnaire universel certainly did not know one very accessible fact about saintgermain nor have i seen it mentioned in other versions of his legend we read in larousse saintgermain is not heard of in france before 1750 when he established himself in paris no adventure had called attention to his existence it was only known that he had moved about europe lived in italy holland and in england and had borne the names of marquis de montferrat and of comte de bellamye which he used at venice  lascelles wraxall again in remarkable adventures 1863 says whatever truth there may be in saintgermains travels in england and the east indies it is indubitable that for from 1745 to 1755 he was a man of high position in vienna while in paris he does not appear according to wraxall till 1757 having been brought from germany by the maréchal de belleisle whose old boots says macallester the spy prince charles freely damned because they were always stuffed with projects now we hear of saintgermain by that name as resident not in vienna but in london at the very moment when prince charles evading cumberland who lay with his army at stone in staffordshire marched to derby horace walpole writes to mann in florence december 9 1745  we begin to take up people  the other day they seized an odd man who goes by the name of count saintgermain he has been here these two years and will not tell who he is or whence but professes that he does not go by his right name he sings plays on the violin wonderfully composes is mad and not very sensible he is called an italian a spaniard a pole a somebody that married a great fortune in mexico and ran away with her jewels to constantinople a priest a fiddler a vast nobleman the prince of wales has had unsatiated curiosity about him but in vain however nothing has been made out against him he is released and what convinces me he is not a gentleman stays here and talks of his being taken up for a spy  here is our earliest authentic note on saintgermain a note omitted by his french students he was in london from 1743 to 1745 under a name not his own but that which he later bore at the court of france from the allusion to his jewels those of a deserted mexican bride it appears that he was already as rich in these treasures as he was afterwards when his french acquaintances marvelled at them as to his being mad walpole may refer to saintgermains way of talking as if he had lived in remote ages and known famous people of the past  having caught this daylight glimpse of saintgermain in walpole having learned that in december 1745 he was arrested and examined as a possible jacobite agent we naturally expect to find contemporary official documents about his examination by the government scores of such records exist containing the questions put to and the answers given by suspected persons but we vainly hunt through the newcastle mss and the state papers domestic in the record office for a trace of the examination of saintgermain i am not aware that he has anywhere left his trail in official documents he lives in more or less legendary memoirs alone  at what precise date saintgermain became an intimate of louis xv the duc de choiseul madame de pompadour and the maréchal de belleisle one cannot ascertain the writers of memoirs are the vaguest of mortals about dates only one discerns that saintgermain was much about the french court and high in the favour of the king having rooms at chambord during the seven years war and just before the time of the peace negotiations of 17621763 the art of compiling false or forged memoirs of that period was widely practised but the memoirs of madame du hausset who speaks of saintgermain are authentic she was the widow of a poor man of noble family and was one of two femmes de chambre of madame de pompadour her manuscript was written she explains by aid of a brief diary which she kept during her term of service one day m senac de meilhan found madame de pompadours brother m de marigny about to burn a packet of papers it is the journal he said of a femme de chambre of my sister a good kind woman de meilhan asked for the manuscript which he later gave to mr crawford one of the kilwinning family in ayrshire who later helped in the escape of louis xvi and marie antoinette to varennes where they were captured with the journal of madame du hausset were several letters to marigny on points of historical anecdote45  footnote 45 one of these gives madame de vieuxmaison as the author of a roman à clef secret memoirs of the court of persia which contains an early reference to the man in the iron mask died 1703 the letterwriter avers that dargenson the famous minister of louis xv said that the man in the iron mask was really a person fort peu de chose of very little account and that the regent dorléans was of the same opinion this corroborates my theory that the mask was merely the valet of a huguenot conspirator roux de marsilly captured in england and imprisoned because he was supposed to know some terrible secretwhich he knew nothing about see the valets tragedy longmans 1903  crawford published the manuscript of madame du hausset which he was given by de meilhan and the memoirs are thus from an authentic source the author says that louis xv was always kind to her but spoke little to her whereas madame de pompadour remarked the king and i trust you so much that we treat you like a cat or a dog and talk freely before you  as to saintgermain madame du hausset writes a man who was as amazing as a witch came often to see madame de pompadour this was the comte de saintgermain who wished to make people believe that he had lived for several centuries one day madame said to him while at her toilet what sort of man was francis i a king whom i could have loved a good sort of fellow said saintgermain too fieryi could have given him a useful piece of advice but he would not have listened he then described in very general terms the beauty of mary stuart and la reine margot you seem to have seen them all said madame de pompadour laughing sometimes said saintgermain i amuse myself not by making people believe but by letting them believe that i have lived from time immemorial but you do not tell us your age and you give yourself out as very old madame de gergy who was wife of the french ambassador at venice fifty years ago i think says that she knew you there and that you are not changed in the least it is true madame that i knew madame de gergy long ago but according to her story you must now be over a century old it may be so but i admit that even more possibly the respected lady is in her dotage  at this time saintgermain says madame du hausset looked about fifty was neither thin nor stout seemed clever and dressed simply as a rule but in good taste say that the date was 1760 saintgermain looked fifty but he had looked the same age according to madame de gergy at venice fifty years earlier in 1710 we see how pleasantly he left madame de pompadour in doubt on that point  he pretended to have the secret of removing flaws from diamonds the king showed him a stone valued at 6000 francswithout a flaw it would have been worth 10000 saintgermain said that he could remove the flaw in a month and in a month he brought back the diamondflawless the king sent it without any comment to his jeweller who gave 9600 francs for the stone but the king returned the money and kept the gem as a curiosity probably it was not the original stone but another cut in the same fashion saintgermain sacrificing 3000 or 4000 francs to his practical joke he also said that he could increase the size of pearls which he could have proved very easilyin the same manner he would not oblige madame de pompadour by giving the king an elixir of life i should be mad if i gave the king a drug there seems to be a reference to this desire of madame de pompadour in an unlikely place a letter of pickle the spy to mr vaughn 1754 this conversation madame du hausset wrote down on the day of its occurrence  both louis xv and madame de pompadour treated saintgermain as a person of consequence he is a quack for he says he has an elixir said dr quesnay with medical scepticism moreover our master the king is obstinate he sometimes speaks of saintgermain as a person of illustrious birth  the age was sceptical unscientific and by reaction credulous the philosophes hume voltaire and others were exposing like an ingenious american gentleman the mistakes of moses the earl marischal told hume that life had been chemically produced in a laboratory so what becomes of creation prince charles hidden in a convent was being tutored by mlle luci in the sensational philosophy of locke nothing in the intellect which does not come through the sensesa queer theme for a man of the sword to study but thirty years earlier the regent dorléans had made crystalgazing fashionable and stories of ghosts and secondsight in the highest circles were popular mesmer had not yet appeared to give a fresh start to the old savage practice of hypnotism cagliostro was not yet on the scene with his freemasonry of the ancient egyptian school but people were already in extremes of doubt and of belief there might be something in the elixir of life and in the philosophers stone it might be possible to make precious stones chemically and saintgermain who seemed to be over a century old at least might have all these secrets  whence came his wealth in precious stones people asked unless from some mysterious knowledge or some equally mysterious and illustrious birth  he showed madame de pompadour a little box full of rubies topazes and diamonds madame de pompadour called madame du hausset to look at them she was dazzled but sceptical and made a sign to show that she thought them paste the count then exhibited a superb ruby tossing aside contemptuously a cross covered with gems that is not so contemptible said madame du hausset hanging it round her neck the count begged her to keep the jewel she refused and madame de pompadour backed her refusal but saintgermain insisted and madame de pompadour thinking that the cross might be worth forty louis made a sign to madame du hausset that she should accept she did and the jewel was valued at 1500 francswhich hardly proves that the other large jewels were genuine though von gleichen believed that they were and thought the counts cabinet of old masters very valuable  the fingers the watch the snuffbox the shoe buckles the garter studs the solitaires of the count on high days all burned with diamonds and rubies which were estimated one day at 200000 francs his wealth did not come from cards or swindlingno such charges are ever hinted at he did not sell elixirs nor prophecies nor initiations his habits do not seem to have been extravagant one might regard him as a clever eccentric person the unacknowledged child perhaps of some noble who had put his capital mainly into precious stones but louis xv treated him as a serious personage and probably knew or thought he knew the secret of his birth people held that he was a bastard of a king of portugal says madame du hausset perhaps the most ingenious and plausible theory of the birth of saintgermain makes him the natural son not of a king of portugal but of a queen of spain the evidence is not evidence but a series of surmises saintgermain on this theory wrop his buth up in a mistry like that of charles james fitzjames de la pluche out of regard for the character of his royal mamma i believe this about as much as i believe that a certain rev mr douglas an obstreperous covenanting minister was a descendant of the captive mary stuart however saintgermain is said like kaspar hauser to have murmured of dim memories of his infancy of diversions on magnificent terraces and of palaces glowing beneath an azure sky this is reported by von gleichen who knew him very well but thought him rather a quack possibly he meant to convey the idea that he was moses and that he had dwelt in the palaces of the ramessids the grave of the prophet was never known and saintgermain may have insinuated that he began a new avatar in a cleft of mount pisgah he was capable of it  however a less wild surmise avers that in 1763 the secrets of his birth and the source of his opulence were known in holland the authority is the memoirs of grosley 1813 grosley was an archæologist of troyes he had travelled in italy and written an account of his travels he also visited holland and england46 and later from a dutchman he picked up his information about saintgermain grosley was a fellow of our royal society and i greatly revere the authority of a frs his later years were occupied in the compilation of his memoirs including an account of what he did and heard in holland and he died in 1785 according to grosleys account of what the dutchman knew saintgermain was the son of a princess who fled obviously from spain to bayonne and of a portuguese jew dwelling in bordeaux  footnote 46 voyage en angleterre 1770  what fairy and fugitive princess can this be whom not in vain the ardent hebrew wooed she was she must have been as grosley saw the heroine of victor hugos ruy blas the unhappy charles ii of spain a kind of mammet as the english called the richard ii who appeared up in islay having escaped from pomfret castle had for his first wife a daughter of henrietta the favourite sister of our charles ii this childless bride after some ghostly years of matrimony after being exorcised in disgusting circumstances died in february 1689 in may 1690 a new bride marie de neubourg was brought to the grisly side of the crowned mammet of spain she too failed to prevent the wars of the spanish succession by giving an heir to the crown of spain scandalous chronicles aver that marie was chosen as queen of spain for the levity of her character and that the crown was expected as in the pictish monarchy to descend on the female side the father of the prince might be anybody what was needed was simply a son of the queen of spain she had while queen no son as far as is ascertained but she had a favourite a count andanero whom she made minister of finance he was not a born count he was a financier this favourite of the queen of spain that lady did go to live in bayonne in 1706 six years after the death of charles ii her husband the hypothesis is then that saintgermain was the son of this exqueen of spain and of the financial count andanero a man not born in the sphere of counts and easily transformed by tradition into a jewish banker of bordeaux the duc de choiseul who disliked the intimacy of louis xv and of the court with saintgermain said that the count was the son of a portuguese jew who deceives the court it is strange that the king is so often allowed to be almost alone with this man though when he goes out he is surrounded by guards as if he feared assassins everywhere this anecdote is from the memoirs of gleichen who had seen a great deal of the world he died in 1807  it seems a fair inference that the duc de choiseul knew what the dutch bankers knew the story of the counts being a child of a princess retired to bayonnenamely the exqueen of spainand of a portuguesehebrew financier de choiseul was ready to accept the jewish father but thought that in the matter of the royal mother saintgermain deceived the court  a queen of spain might have carried off any quantity of the diamonds of brazil the presents of diamonds from her almost idiotic lord must have been among the few comforts of her situation in a court overridden by etiquette the reader of madame daulnoys contemporary account of the court of spain knows what a dreadful dungeon it was again if born at bayonne about 1706 the count would naturally seem to be about fifty in 1760 the purity with which he spoke german and his familiarity with german princely courtswhere i do not remember that barry lyndon ever met himare easily accounted for if he had a royal german to his mother but alas if he was the son of a hebrew financier portuguese or alsatian as some said he was likely whoever his mother may have been to know german and to be fond of precious stones that oriental taste notoriously abides in the hearts of the chosen people      nay never shague your gory locks at me     dou canst not say i did it  quotes pinto the hero of thackerays notch on the axe he pronounced it by the way i dit it by which i know that pinto was a german says thackeray i make little doubt but that saintgermain too was a german whether by the mothers side and of princely blood or quite the reverse  grosley mixes saintgermain up with a lady as mysterious as himself who also lived in holland on wealth of an unknown source and grosley inclines to think that the count found his way into a french prison where he was treated with extraordinary respect  von gleichen on the other hand shows the count making love to a daughter of madame lambert and lodging in the house of the mother here von gleichen met the man of mystery and became rather intimate with him von gleichen deemed him very much older than he looked but did not believe in his elixir  in any case he was not a cardsharper a swindler a professional medium or a spy he passed many evenings almost alone with louis xv who where men were concerned liked them to be of good family about ladies he was much less exclusive the count had a grand manner he treated some great personages in a cavalier way as if he were at least their equal on the whole if not really the son of a princess he probably persuaded louis xv that he did come of that blue blood and the king would have every access to authentic information horace walpoles reasons for thinking saintgermain not a gentleman scarcely seem convincing  the duc de choiseul did not like the fashionable saintgermain he thought him a humbug even when the doings of the deathless one were perfectly harmless as far as is known his recipe for health consisted in drinking a horrible mixture called senna teawhich was administered to small boys when i was a small boyand in not drinking anything at his meals many people still observe this regimen in the interest it is said of their figures saintgermain used to come to the house of de choiseul but one day when von gleichen was present the minister lost his temper with his wife he observed that she took no wine at dinner and told her she had learned that habit of abstinence from saintgermain that he might do as he pleased but you madame whose health is precious to me i forbid to imitate the regimen of such a dubious character gleichen who tells the anecdote says that he was present when de choiseul thus lost his temper with his wife the dislike of de choiseul had a mournful effect on the career of saintgermain  in discussing the strange story of the chevalier dÉon we have seen that louis xv amused himself by carrying on a secret scheme of fantastic diplomacy through subordinate agents behind the backs and without the knowledge of his responsible ministers the duc de choiseul as minister of foreign affairs was excluded it seems from all knowledge of these double intrigues and the maréchal de belleisle minister of war was obviously kept in the dark as was madame de pompadour now it is stated by von gleichen that the maréchal de belleisle from the war office started a new secret diplomacy behind the back of de choiseul at the foreign office the king and madame de pompadour who was not initiated into the general scheme of the kings secret were both acquainted with what de choiseul was not to knownamely belleisles plan for secretly making peace through the mediation or management at all events of holland all this must have been prior to the death of the maréchal de belleisle in 1761 and probably de broglie who managed the regular old secret policy of louis xv knew nothing about this new clandestine adventure at all events the late duc de broglie says nothing about it in his book the kings secret47  footnote 47 the duc de broglie i am privately informed could find no clue to the mystery of saintgermain  the story as given by von gleichen goes on to say that saintgermain offered to conduct the intrigue at the hague as louis xv certainly allowed that maidenly captain of dragoons dÉon to manage his hidden policy in london it is not at all improbable that he really entrusted this fresh cabal in holland to saintgermain whom he admitted to great intimacy to the hague went saintgermain diamonds rubies senna tea and all and began to diplomatise with the dutch but the regular french minister at the hague daffry found out what was going on behind his backfound it out either because he was sharper than other ambassadors or because a personage so extraordinary as saintgermain was certain to be very closely watched or because the dutch did not take to the undying one and told daffry what he was doing daffry wrote to de choiseul an immortal but dubious personage he said was treating in the interests of france for peace which it was daffrys business to do if the thing was to be done at all choiseul replied in a rage by the same courier saintgermain he said must be extradited bound hand and foot and sent to the bastille choiseul thought that he might practise his regimen and drink his senna tea to the advantage of public affairs within those venerable walls then the angry minister went to the king told him what orders he had given and said that of course in a case of this kind it was superfluous to inquire as to the royal pleasure louis xv was caught so was the maréchal de belleisle they blushed and were silent  it must be remembered that this report of a private incident could only come to the narrator von gleichen from de choiseul with whom he professes to have been intimate the king and the maréchal de belleisle would not tell the story of their own discomfiture it is not very likely that de choiseul himself would blab however the anecdote avers that the king and the minister for war thought it best to say nothing and the demand for saintgermains extradition was presented at the hague but the dutch were not fond of giving up political offenders they let saintgermain have a hint he slipped over to london and a london paper published a kind of veiled interview with him in june 1760  his name we read when announced after his death will astonish the world more than all the marvels of his life he has been in england already 174317 he is a great unknown nobody can accuse him of anything dishonest or dishonourable when he was here before we were all mad about music and so he enchanted us with his violin but italy knows him as an expert in the plastic arts and germany admires in him a master in chemical science in france where he was supposed to possess the secret of the transmutation of metals the police for two years sought and failed to find any normal source of his opulence a lady of fortyfive once swallowed a whole bottle of his elixir nobody recognised her for she had become a girl of sixteen without observing the transformation  saintgermain is said to have remained in london but for a short period horace walpole does not speak of him again which is odd but probably the count did not again go into society our information mainly from von gleichen becomes very misty a thing of surmises really worthless the count is credited with a great part in the palace conspiracies of st petersburg he lived at berlin and under the name of tzarogy at the court of the margrave of anspach thence he went they say to italy and then north to the landgrave charles of hesse who dabbled in alchemy here he is said to have died about 178085 leaving his papers to the landgrave but all is very vague after he disappeared from paris in 1760 when next i meet saintgermain he is again at paris again mysteriously rich again he rather disappears than dies he calls himself major fraser and the date is in the last years of louis philippe my authority may be cavilled at it is that of the late ingenious mr van damme who describes major fraser in a book on the characters of the second empire he does not seem to have heard of saintgermain whom he does not mention  major fraser in spite of his english sic name was decidedly not english though he spoke the language he was like saintgermain one of the best dressed men of the period he lived alone and never alluded to his parentage he was always flush of money though the sources of his income were a mystery to every one the french police vainly sought to detect the origin of saintgermains supplies opening his letters at the postoffice major frasers knowledge of every civilised country at every period was marvellous though he had very few books his memory was something prodigious strange to say he used often to hint that his was no mere book knowledge of course it is perfectly ridiculous he remarked with a strange smile but every now and then i feel as if this did not come to me from reading but from personal experience at times i become almost convinced that i lived with nero that i knew dante personally and so forth48 at the majors death not a letter was found giving a clue to his antecedents and no money was discovered did he die as in the case of saintgermain no date is given the author had an idea that the major was an illegitimate son of some exalted person of the period of charles iv and ferdinand vii of spain  footnote 48 an englishman in paris vol i pp 130133 london 1892  the author does not mention saintgermain and may never have heard of him if his account of major fraser is not mere romance in that warrior we have the undying friend of louis xv and madame de pompadour he had drunk at medmenham with jack wilkes as riccio he had sung duets with the fairest of unhappy queens he had extracted from blanche de béchamel the secret of goby de mouchy as pinto he told much of his secret history to mr thackeray who says i am rather sorry to lose him after three little bits of roundabout papers  did saintgermain really die in a palace of prince charles of hesse about 178085 did he on the other hand escape from the french prison where grosley thought he saw him during the french revolution was he known to lord lytton about 1860 was he then major fraser is he the mysterious muscovite adviser of the dalai lama who knows he is a willothewisp of the memoirwriters of the eighteenth century whenever you think you have a chance of finding him in good authentic state papers he gives you the slip and if his existence were not vouched for by horace walpole i should incline to deem of him as betsy prig thought of mrs harris       notesince the publication of these essays i have learned      through the courtesy of a polish nobleman that there was      nothing mysterious in the origin and adventures of the major      fraser mentioned in pp 274276 he was of the saltoun      family and played a part in the civil wars of spain during      the second quarter of the nineteenth century major fraser      was known in paris to the father of my polish      correspondent     xiii  the mystery of the kirks   no historical problem has proved more perplexing to englishmen than the nature of the differences between the various kirks in scotland the southron found that whether he worshipped in a church of the established kirk the auld kirk of the free church or of the united presbyterian church the ups it was all the same thing the nature of the service was exactly similar though sometimes the congregation stood at prayers and sat when it sang sometimes stood when it sang and knelt at prayer not one of the kirks used a prescribed liturgy i have been in a free kirk which had no pulpit the pastor stood on a kind of raised platform like a lecturer in a lectureroom but that practice is unessential the kirks if i mistake not have different collections of hymns which till recent years were contemned as things of human invention and therefore idolatrous but hymns are now in use as also are organs or harmoniums or other musical instruments thus the faces of the kirks are similar and sisterly                      facies non omnibus una     nec diversa tamen qualem decet esse sororum  what then the southron used to ask is the difference between the free church the established church and the united presbyterian church if the southron put the question to a scottish friend the odds were that the scottish friend could not answer he might be a member of the scottish episcopal community and as ignorant as any anglican or he might not have made these profound studies in scottish history which throw glimmerings of light on this obscure subject  indeed the whole aspect of the mystery has shifted of late like the colours in a kaleidoscope the more conspicuous hues are no longer auld kirk free kirk and ups but auld kirk free kirk and united free kirk the united free kirk was composed in 1900 of the old united presbyterians as old as 1847 with the overwhelming majority of the old free kirk while the free kirk of the present moment consists of a tiny minority of the old free kirk which declined to join the recent union by a judgment one may well call it a judgment of the house of lords august 1 1904 the free kirk commonly called the wee frees now possesses the wealth that was the old free kirks before in 1900 it united with the united presbyterians and became the united free church it is to be hoped that common sense will discover some outgait or issue from this distressing imbroglio in the words which mr rl stevenson then a sage of twentyfour penned in 1874 we may say those who are at all open to a feeling of national disgrace look forward eagerly to such a possibility they have been witnesses already too long to the strife that has divided this small corner of christendom the eternal schisms of the kirk said rls exhibit something pitiful for the pitiful man but bitterly humorous for others  the humour of the present situation is only too manifest two generations ago about half of the ministers of the kirk of scotland left their manses and pleasant glebes for the sake of certain ideas of these ideas they abandoned some or left them in suspense a few years since and as a result they have lost if only for the moment their manses stipends colleges and pleasant glebes  why should all these things be so the answer can only be found in the historyand a history both sad and bitterly humorous it isof the reformation in scotland when john knox died on november 24 1572 a decent burgess of edinburgh wrote in his diary john knox minister deceased who had as was alleged the most part of the blame of all the sorrows of scotland since the slaughter of the late cardinal beaton murdered at st andrews in 1546 the sorrows of scotland had endured when knox died for but twentysix years since his death 332 years have gone by and the present sorrows of the united free kirk are the direct though distant result of some of the ideas of john knox  the whole trouble springs from his peculiar notions and the notions of his followers about the relations between church and state in 1843 half the ministers of the established kirk in scotland or more left the kirk and went into the wilderness for what they believed to be the ideal of knox in 1904 they have again a prospect of a similar exodus because they are no longer rigid adherents of the very same ideal a tiny minority of some twentyseven ministers clings to what it considers to be the knoxian ideal and is rewarded by all the wealth bestowed on the free kirk by pious benefactors during sixty years  the quarrel for 344 years 15601904 has been we know about the relations of church and state the disruption of 1843 the departure of the free kirk out of the established kirk arose thus according to lord macnaghten who gave one of the two opinions in favour of the united free kirks claim to the possessions held by the free kirk before its union in 1900 with the united presbyterians before 1843 there were says the sympathetic judge two parties in the established churchthe moderates and the evangelicals also called the wild men the highland host or the high flyers the evangelicals became the majority and they carried matters with a high hand they passed acts in the assembly  altogether beyond the competence of a church established by law the state refused to admit their claims the strong arm of the law restrained their extravagancies still they maintained that their proceedings were justified and required by the doctrine of the headship of christ  to which they attached peculiar and extraordinary significance  now the state in 18381843 could not and would not permit these extravagancies in a statepaid church the evangelical party therefore seceded maintaining as one of their leaders said that we are still the church of scotland the only church that deserves the name the only church that can be known and recognised by the maintaining of those principles to which the church of our fathers was true when she was on the mountain and on the field when she was under persecution when she was an outcast from the world  thus the free kirk was the kirk and the established kirk was heretical was what knox would have called ane rottin laodicean now the fact is that the church of scotland had been since august 1560 a kirk established by law or by what was said to be a legal parliament yet had never perhaps for an hour attained its own full ideal relation to the state had never been granted its entire claims but only so much or so little of these as the political situation compelled the state to concede or enabled it to withdraw there had always been members of the kirk who claimed all that the free kirk claimed in 1843 but they never got quite as much as they asked they often got much less than they wanted and the full sum of their desires could be granted by no state to a statepaid church entire independence could be obtained only by cutting the church adrift from the state the free kirk then did cut themselves adrift but they kept on maintaining that they were the church of scotland and that the state ought in duty to establish and maintain them while granting them absolute independence  the position was stated thus in 1851 by an act and declaration of the free kirks assembly she holds still and through gods grace ever will hold that it is the duty of civil rulers to recognise the truth of god according to his word and to promote and support the kingdom of christ without assuming any jurisdiction in it or any power over it  the state in fact if we may speak carnally ought to pay the piper but must not presume to call the tune  now we touch the skirt of the mystery what was the difference between the free kirk and the united presbyterians who since 1900 have been blended with that body the difference was that the free kirk held it to be the duty of the state to establish her and leave her perfect independence while the united presbyterians maintained the absolutely opposite opinionnamely that the state cannot and must not establish any church or pay any church out of the national resources when the two kirks united in 1900 then the free kirk either abandoned the doctrine of which in 1851 she said that she holds it still and through gods grace ever will hold it or she regarded it as a mere pious opinion which did not prevent her from coalescing with a kirk of contradictory ideas the tiny minoritythe wee frees the free kirk of todaywould not accept this compromise hence these tears to leave differences in purely metaphysical theology out of view  now the root of all the trouble all the schisms and sufferings of more than three centuries lies as we have said in some of the ideas of john knox and one asks of what kirk would john knox be if he were alive in the present state of affairs i venture to think that the venerable reformer would be found in the ranks of the established kirk the auld kirk he would not have gone out into the wilderness in 1843 and he would most certainly have opposed the ideas of the united presbyterians this theory may surprise at a first glance but it has been reached after many hours of earnest consideration  knoxs ideas as far as he ever reasoned them out reposed on this impregnable rock namely that calvinism as held by himself was an absolutely certain thing in every detail if the state or the civil magistrate as he put the case entirely agreed with knox then knox was delighted that the state should regulate religion the magistrate was to put down catholicism and other aberrations from the truth as it was in john knox with every available engine of the law corporal punishment prison exile and death if the state was ready and willing to do all this then the state was to be implicitly obeyed in matters of religion and the power in its hands was godgivenin fact the state was the secular aspect of the church looking at the state in this ideal aspect knox writes about the obedience due to the magistrate in matters religious after the manner of what in this country would be called the fiercest erastianism the state rules the roast in all matters of religion and may do what laud and charles i perished in attempting may alter forms of worshipalways provided that the state absolutely agrees with the kirk  thus under edward vi knox would have desired the secular power in england the civil magistrate to forbid people to kneel at the celebration of the sacrament that was entirely within the competence of the state simply and solely because knox desired that people should not kneel but when long after knoxs death the civil magistrate insisted in scotland that people should kneel the upholders of knoxs ideas denied that the magistrate james vi had any right to issue such an order and they refused to obey while remaining within the established church they did not disrupt like the free church they simply acted as they pleased and denounced their obedient brethren as no lawful ministers the end of it all was that they stirred up the civil war in which the first shot was fired by the legendary jenny geddes throwing her stool at the reader in st giless thus we see that the state was to be obeyed in matters of religion when the state did the bidding of the kirk and not otherwise when first employed as a licensed preacher and agent of the state in england knox accepted just as much of the states liturgy as he pleased the liturgy ordered the people to kneel knox and his berwick congregation disobeyed with equal freedom he and the other royal chaplains at easter preaching before the king denounced his ministers northumberland and the rest knox spoke of them in his sermon as judas shebna and some other scriptural malignants later he said that he repented having put things so mildly he ought to have called the ministers by their names not veiled things in a hint now we cannot easily conceive a chaplain of her late majesty in a sermon preached before her denouncing the chancellor of the exchequer say mr gladstone as judas yet knox a licensed preacher of a state church indulged his spiritual independence to that extent and took shame to himself that he had not gone further  obviously if this is erastianism it is of an unusual kind the idea of knox is that in a catholic state the ruler is not to be obeyed in religious matters by the true believers sometimes knox wrote that the catholic ruler ought to be met by passive resistance sometimes that he ought to be shot at sight he stated these diverse doctrines in the course of eighteen months in a protestant country the catholics must obey the protestant ruler or take their chances of prison exile fire and death the protestant ruler in a protestant state is to be obeyed in spiritual matters by protestants just as far as the kirk may happen to approve of his proceedings or even further in practice if there is no chance of successful resistance  we may take it that knox if he had been alive and retained his old ideas in 1843 would not have gone out of the established church with the free church because in his time he actually did submit to many state regulations of which he did not approve for example he certainly did not approve of bishops and had no bishops in the kirk as established on his model in 1560 but twelve years later bishops were reintroduced by the state in the person of the regent morton a ruffian and knox did not retire to the mountain and the fields but made the most practical efforts to get the best terms possible for the kirk he was old and outworn and he remained in the established kirk and advised no man to leave it it was his theory again as it was that of the free kirk that there should be no patronage no presentation of ministers to cures by the patron the congregations were to choose and call any properly qualified person at their own pleasure as they do now in all the kirks including since 1874 the established church but the state in knoxs lifetime overrode this privilege of the church the most infamous villain of the period archibald douglas was presented to the kirk of glasgow and indeed the nobles made many such presentations of unscrupulous and ignorant cadets to important livings morton gave a bishopric to one of the murderers of riccio yet knox did not advise a secession he merely advised that nonresidence or a scandalous life or erroneous doctrine on the part of the person presented should make his presentation null and of no force or effect and this to have place also in the nomination of the bishops thus knox was on occasion something of an opportunist if alive in 1843 he would probably have remained in the establishment and worked for that abolition of patronage which was secured from within in 1874 if this conjecture is right the free kirk was more knoxian than john knox and departed from his standard he was capable of sacrificing a good deal of spiritual independence rather than break with the state many times long after he was dead the national church under stress of circumstances accepted compromises  knox knew the difference between the ideal and the practical it was the ideal that all nonconvertible catholics should die the death but the ideal was never made real the state was not prepared to oblige the kirk in this matter it was the ideal that any of the brethren conscious of a vocation and seeing a good opportunity should treat an impenitent catholic ruler as jehu treated jezebel but if any brother had consulted knox as to the propriety of assassinating queen mary in 156167 he would have found out his mistake and probably have descended the reformers stairs much more rapidly than he mounted them  yet knox though he could submit to compromise really had a remarkably mystical idea of what the kirk was and of the attributes of her clergy the editor of the free church union case mr taylor innes himself author of a biography of the reformer writes in his preface to the judgment of the house of lords the church of scotland as a protestant church had its origin in the year 1560 for its first confession dates from august and its first assembly from december in that year in fact the confession was accepted and passed as law by a very dubiously legal convention of the estates in august 1560 but knox certainly conceived that the protestant church in if not of scotland existed a year before that date and before that date it possessed the power of the keys and even it would perhaps seem the power of the sword to his mind as soon as a local set of men of his own opinions met and chose a pastor and preacher who also administered the sacraments the protestant church was a church in being the catholic church then by law established was knox held no church at all her priests were not lawful ministers her pope was the man of sin ex officio and the church was the kirk of the malignantsa lady of pleasure in babylon bred  on the other hand the real churchit might be of but 200 menwas confronting the kirk of the malignants and alone was genuine the state did not make and could not unmake the trew church but was bound to establish foster and obey it  it was this last proviso which caused 130 years of bloodshed and persecution and general unrest in scotland from 1559 to 1690 why was the kirk so often out in the heather and hunted like a partridge on the field and the mountain the answer is that when the wilder spirits of the kirk were not being persecuted they were persecuting the state and bullying the individual subject all this arose from knoxs idea of the church to constitute a church no more was needed than a local set of calvinistic protestants and a lawful minister to constitute a lawful minister at first later far more was required no more was needed than a call to a preacher from a local set of calvinistic protestants but when once the call was given and accepted that lawful minister was by the theory as superior to the laws of the state as the celebrated emperor was superior to grammar a few lawful ministers of this kind possessed the power of the keys they could hand anybody over to satan by excommunicating the man and apparently they could present the power of the sword to any town council which could then decree capital punishment against any catholic priest who celebrated mass as by the law of the state he was in duty bound to do such were the moderate and reasonable claims of knoxs kirk in may 1559 even before it was accepted by the convention of estates in august 1560 it was because not the church but the wilder spirits among the ministers persevered in these claims that the state when it got the chance drove them into moors and mosses and hanged not a few of them  i have never found these facts fully stated by any historian or by any biographer of knox except by the reformer himself partly in his history partly in his letters to a lady of his acquaintance the mystery of the kirks turns on the knoxian conception of the lawful minister and his claim to absolutism  to give examples knox himself about 154043 was a priest of the altar one of baals shaven sort on that score he later claimed nothing after the murder of cardinal beaton the murderers and their associates forming a congregation in the castle of st andrews gave knox a call to be their preacher he was now a lawful minister in may 1559 he with about four or five equally lawful ministers two of them converted friars one of them a baker and one harlow a tailor were in company with their protestant backers who destroyed the monasteries in perth and the altars and ornaments of the church there they at once claimed the power of the keys and threatened to excommunicate such of their allies as did not join them in arms they the brethren also denounced capital punishment against any priest who celebrated mass at perth now the lawful ministers could not think of hanging the priests themselves they must therefore have somehow bestowed the power of the sword on the baillies and town council of perth i presume for the regent mary of guise when she entered the town dismissed these men from office which was regarded as an unlawful and perfidious act on her part again in the summer of 1560 the baillies of edinburghwhile catholicism was still by law establisheddenounced the death penalty against recalcitrant catholics the kirk also allotted lawful ministers to several of the large towns and thus established herself before she was established by the estates in august 1560 thus nothing could be more free and more absolute than the kirk in her early bloom on the other hand as we saw even in knoxs lifetime the state having the upper hand under the regent morton a strong man introduced prelacy of a modified kind and patronage did not restore to the kirk her patrimonythe lands of the old church and only hanged one priest not improbably for a certain reason of a private character  there was thus from the first a battle between the protestant church and state at various times one preacher is said to have declared that he was the solitary lawful minister in scotland and one of these men mr cargill excommunicated charles ii while another mr renwick denounced a war of assassination against the government both gentlemen were hanged  these were extreme assertions of spiritual independence and the kirk or at least the majority of the preachers protested against such conduct which might be the logical development of the doctrine of the lawful minister but was in practice highly inconvenient the kirk as a whole was loyal  sometimes the state under a strong man like morton or james stewart earl of arran a thoroughpaced ruffian put down these pretensions of the church at other times as when andrew melville led the kirk under james vi she maintained that there was but one king in scotland christ and that the actual king the lad james vi was but christs silly vassal he was supreme in temporal matters but the judicature of the church was supreme in spiritual matters  this sounds perfectly fair but who was to decide what matters were spiritual and what were temporal the kirk assumed the right to decide that question consequently it could give a spiritual colour to any problem of statesmanship for example a royal marriage trade with catholic spain which the kirk forbade or the expulsion of the catholic peers there is a judgment above yours said the rev mr pont to james vi and that is gods put in the hand of the ministers for we shall judge the angels saith the apostle again ye shall sit upon twelve thrones and judge quoted mr pont which is chiefly referred to the apostles and consequently to ministers  things came to a head in 1596 the king asked the representatives of the kirk whether he might call home certain earls banished for being catholics if they satisfied the kirk the answer was that he might not knox had long before maintained that a prophet might preach treason he is quite explicit and that the prophet and whoever carried his preaching into practical effect would be blameless a minister was accused at this moment of preaching libellously and he declined to be judged except by men of his own cloth if they acquitted him as they were morally certain to do what court of appeal could reverse the decision of men who claimed to judge angels a riot arose in edinburgh the king seized his opportunity he grasped his nettle the municipal authorities backed him and in effect the claims of true ministers thenceforth gave little trouble till the folly of charles i led to the rise of the covenant the sovereign had overshot his limits of power as wildly as ever the kirk had tried to do and the result was that the kirk having now the nobles and the people in arms on her side was absolutely despotic for about twelve years her final triumph was to resist the estates in parliament with success and to lay scotland open to the cromwellian conquest what plantagenets and tudors could never do noll effected he conquered scotland the kirk having paralysed the state the preachers found that cromwell was a perfect malignant that he would not suffer prophets to preach treason nor even allow the general assembly to meet angels they might judge if they pleased but not ironsides excommunication and kirk discipline were discountenanced even witches were less frequently burned the preachers cromwell said had done their do had shot their bolt  at this time they split into two parties the extremists calling themselves the godly and the men of milder mood  charles ii at the restoration ought probably to have sided with the milder party some of whom were anxious to see their fierce brethren banished to orkney out of the way but charless motto was never again and by a pettifogging fraud he reintroduced bishops without the hated liturgy after years of risings and suppressions the ministers were brought to submission accepting an indulgence from the state while but a few upholders of the old pretensions of the clergy stood out in the wildernesses of southwestern scotland there might be three or four such ministers there might be only one but they or he to the mind of the remnant were the only lawful ministers at the revolution of 168889 the remnant did not accept the compromise under which the presbyterian kirk was reestablished they stood out breaking into many sects the spiritual descendants of most of these blended into one body as the united presbyterian kirk in 1847 in the established kirk the moderates were in the majority till about 1837 when the inheritors of those extreme views which knox compromised about and which the majority of ministers disclaimed before the revolution of 1688 obtained the upper hand they had planted the remotest parishes of the highlands with their own kind of ministers who swamped in 1838 the votes of the lowland moderates exactly as under james vi highland moderates had swamped the votes of the lowland extremists the majority of extremists or most of it left the kirk in 1843 and made the free kirk in 1900 when the free kirk joined the united presbyterians it was highland ministers mainly who formed the minority of twentyseven or so who would not accept the new union and now constitute the actual free kirk or wee frees and possess the endowments of the old free kirk of 1843 we can scarcely say beati possidentes  it has been shown or i have tried erroneously or not to show that wild and impossible as were the ideal claims of knox of andrew melville of mr pont and others the old scottish kirk of 1560 by law established was capable of giving up or suppressing these claims even under knox and even while the covenant remained in being the mass of the ministers after the return of charles ii before worcester fight before bloody dunbar were not irreconcilables the auld kirk the kirk established has some right to call herself the church of scotland by historical continuity while the opposite claimants the men of 1843 may seem rather to descend from people like young renwick the last hero who died for their ideas but not in himself the only lawful minister between tweed and cape wrath other times other manners all the kirks are perfectly loyal now none persecutes interference with private life kirk discipline is a vanishing minimum and but for this recent garboil as our old writers put it we might have said that under differences of nomenclature all the kirks are united at last in the only union worth having that of peace and goodwill that union may be restored let us hope by good temper and common sense qualities that have not hitherto been conspicuous in the ecclesiastical history of scotland or of england     xiv  the end of jeanne de la motte   in the latest and best book on marie antoinette and the diamond

when june 21 1786 she has been publicly flogged and branded struggling scratching and biting like a wild cat her husband at about the same time was in edinburgh and had just escaped from being kidnapped by the french police in another work monsieur funckbrentano criticises with his remarkable learning the conclusion of the history of jeanne de la motte carlyle in his wellknown essay the diamond necklace leaves jeannes later adventures obscure and is in doubt as to the particulars of her death  perhaps absolute certainty except as to the cause of jeannes death is not to be obtained how she managed to escape from her prison the salpétrière later so famous for charcots hypnotic experiments on hysterical female patients remains a mystery it was certain that if she was once at liberty jeanne would tell the lies against the queen which she had told before and tell some more equally false popular and damaging yet escape she did in 1787 the year following that of her imprisonment at the salpétrière she reached england compiled the libels which she called her memoirs and died strangely in 1791  on june 21 1786 to follow m funckbrentano jeanne was taken after her flogging to her prison reserved for dissolute women the majority of the captives slept as they might confusedly in one room to jeanne was allotted one of thirtysix little cells of six feet square given up to her by a prisoner who went to join the promiscuous horde probably the woman was paid for this generosity by some partisan of jeanne on september 4 the property of the swindler and of her husband including their valuable furniture jewels books and plate was sold at barsuraube where they had a house  so far we can go guided by m funckbrentano who relies on authentic documents for what followed we have only the story of jeanne herself in her memoirs i quote the english translation which appears to vary from the french how did such a dangerous prisoner make her escape we cannot but wonder that she was not placed in a prison more secure her own version of course is not to be relied on she would tell any tale that suited her purpose a version which contradicts hers has reached me through the tradition of an english family but it presents some difficulties jeanne says that about the end of november or early in december 1786 she was allowed to have a maid named angelica this woman was a prisoner of long standing condemned on suspicion of having killed her child one evening a soldier on guard in the court of the salpétrière passed his musket through a hole in the wall or a broken window and tried to touch angelica he told her that many people of rank were grateful to her for her kindness to madame la motte he would procure writing materials for her that she might represent her case to them he did bring giltedged paper pens and ink and a letter for angelica who could not read  the letter contained in invisible ink brought out by jeanne the phrase it is understood be sure to be discreet people are intent on changing your condition was another phrase which jeanne applied to herself she conceived the probable hypothesis that her victims the queen and the cardinal de rohan had repented of their cruelty had discovered her to be innocent and were plotting for her escape of course nothing could be more remote from the interests of the queen presently the soldier brought another note jeanne must procure a model of the key that locked her cell and other doors by dint of staring at the key in the hands of the nuns who looked after the prisoners jeanne though unable to draw made two sketches of it and sent them out the useful soldier managing all communications how jeanne procured the necessary pencil she does not inform us practical locksmiths may decide whether it is likely that from two amateur drawings not to scale any man could make a key which would fit the locks the task appears impossible in any case in a few days the soldier pushed the key through the hole in the wall jeanne tried it on the door of her cell and on two doors in the passages found that it opened them and knelt in gratitude before her crucifix in place of running away jeanne now wrote to ladies of her acquaintance begging them to procure the release of angelica her nights she spent in writing three statements for the woman each occupying a hundred and eighty pages presumably of giltedged paper soon she heard that the king had signed angelicas pardon and on may 1 the woman was released  the next move of jeanne was to ask her unknown friend outside to send her a complete male costume a large blue coat a flannel waistcoat a pair of half boots and a tall roundshaped hat with a switch the soldier presently pushed these commodities through the hole in the wall the chaplain next asked her to write out all her story but sister martha her custodian would not give her writing materials and it did not apparently occur to her to bid the soldier bring fresh supplies cut off from the joys of literary composition jeanne arranged with her unknown friend to escape on june 8 first the handy soldier having ample leisure was to walk for days about the kings garden disguised as a waggoner and carrying a whip the use of this manoeuvre is not apparent unless jeanne with her switch was to be mistaken for the familiar presence of the carter  jeanne ended by devising a means of keeping one of the female porters away from her door she dressed as a man opened four doors in succession walked through a group of the nuns or sisters wandered into many other courts and at last joined herself to a crowd of sightseeing parisians and left the prison in their company she crossed the seine and now walking now hiring coaches and using various disguises she reached luxembourg here a mrs macmahon met her bringing a note from m de la motte this was on july 27 mrs macmahon and jeanne started next day for ostend and arrived at dover after a passage of fortytwo hours jeanne then repaired with mr macmahon to that ladys house in the haymarket  this tale is neither coherent nor credible on the other hand the tradition of an english family avers that a devonshire gentleman was asked by an important personage in france to succour an unnamed lady who was being smuggled over in a sailing boat to our southwest coast another gentleman not unknown to history actually entertained this french angel unawares not even knowing her name and jeanne when she departed for london left a miniature of herself which is still in the possession of the english family which tale is true and who was the unknown friend that suborned the versatile soldier and sent in not only giltedged paper and a suit of male attire but money for jeannes journey only the liberals in france had an interest in jeannes escape she might exude more useful venom against the queen in books or pamphlets and she did while giving the world to understand that the queen had favoured her flight the escape is the real mystery of the affair of the necklace the rest we now understand  the death of jeanne was strange the sequel to her memoirs in english avers that in 1791 a bailiff came to arrest her for a debt of 30l she gave him a bottle of wine slipped from the room and locked him in but he managed to get out and discovered the wretched woman in a chamber in the twopair back she threw up the window leaped out struck against a tree broke one knee shattered one thigh knocked one eye out yet was recovering when on august 21 1791 she partook too freely of mulberries to which she was very partial and died on tuesday august 23 this is confirmed by two newspaper paragraphs which i cite in full  first the london chronicle writes from saturday august 27 to tuesday august 30 1791  the unfortunate countess de la motte who died on tuesday last in consequence of a hurt from jumping out of a window was the wife of count de la motte who killed young grey the jeweller in a duel a few days ago at brussels this duel is recorded in the london chronicle august 2023  next the public advertiser remarks friday august 26 1791  the noted countess de la motte of necklace memory and who lately jumped out of a twopair of stairs window to avoid the bailiffs died on tuesday night last at eleven oclock at her lodgings near astleys riding school  but why did la motte fight the young jeweller it was to grey of new bond street that la motte sold a number of the diamonds from the necklace grey gave evidence to that fact and la motte killed him la motte himself lived to a bad old age                                       on studying m funckbrentanos work styled cagliostro  company in the english translation one observes a curious discrepancy according to the gazette dutrecht cited by m funckbrentano the window in jeannes cell was at a height of ten feet above the floor yet the useful soldier outside introduced the end of his musket through a broken pane of glass this does not seem plausible again the gazette dutrecht august 1 1780 says that jeanne made a hole in the wall of her room but failed to get her body through that aperture was that the hole through which in the english translation published after jeannes death the soldier introduced the end of his musket there are difficulties in both versions and it is not likely that jeanne gave a
