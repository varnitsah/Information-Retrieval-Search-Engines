71465010	ships company  by ww jacobs    for better or worse   mr george wotton gently pushing the swing doors of the public bar of the kings head an inch apart applied an eye to the aperture in the hope of discovering a moneyed friend  his gaze fell on the only man in the bar a greybeard of sixty whose weatherbeaten face and rough clothing spoke of the sea  with a faint sigh he widened the opening and passed through  mornin ben he said with an attempt at cheerfulness  have a drop with me said the other heartily  got any money about you  mr wotton shook his head and his face fell clearing somewhat as the other handed him his mug  drink it all up george he said  his friend complied  a more tactful man might have taken longer over the job but mr benjamin davis who appeared to be labouring under some strong excitement took no notice  ive had a shock george he said regarding the other steadily  ive heard news of my old woman  didnt know you ad one said mr wotton calmly  wots

interest  no said his friend but i did  wed been married three yearsthree long yearsand i had ad enough of it  awful temper she had  the last words i ever heard er say was take that  mr wotton took up the mug and after satisfying himself as to the absence of contents put it down again and yawned  i shouldnt worry about it if i was you he remarked  shes hardly likely to find you now  and if she does she wont get much  mr davis gave vent to a contemptuous laugh  get much  he repeated its her whats got it  i met a old shipmate of mine this morning what i adnt seen for ten years and he told me he

ive been working myself to skin and bone shes been living in comfort and idleness  ard lines said mr wotton shaking his head  it dont bear thinking of  why didnt she advertise for me  said mr davis raising his voice thats what i want to know  advertisements is cheap enough why didnt she advertise  i should ave come at once if shed said anything about money  mr wotton shook his head again  praps

aint bound to keep you  if you take my advice you wont dream of letting her know you run away from her  say you was cast away at sea and when you came back years afterwards you couldnt find her  mr davis pondered for some time in sulky silence  praps it would be as well he said at last but i shant stand no nonsense mind  if you like ill come with you said mr wotton  i aint got nothing to do  i could tell er i was cast away with you if you liked  anything to help a pal  mr davis took two inches of soiled clay pipe from his pocket and puffed thoughtfully  you can come he said at last  if youd only got a copper or two we could ride its down clapham way  mr wotton smiled feebly and after going carefully through his pockets shook his head and followed his friend outside  i wonder whether shell be pleased  he remarked as they walked slowly along  she might bewomen are funny creaturesso faithful  i knew one whose husband used to knock er about dreadful and after he died she was so true to his memory she wouldnt marry again  mr davis grunted and with a longing eye at the omnibuses passing over london bridge asked a policeman the distance to clapham  never mind said mr wotton as his friend uttered an exclamation youll have money in your pocket soon  mr daviss face brightened  and a watch and chain too he said  and smoke your cigar of a sunday said mr wotton and have a easy chair and a glass for a friend  mr davis almost smiled and then suddenly remembering his wasted twenty years shook his head grimly over the friendship that attached itself to easychairs and glasses of ale and said that there was plenty of it about  more friendship than glasses of ale and easychairs perhaps  at clapham they inquired the way of a small boy and after following the road indicated retraced their steps cheered by a faint but bloodthirsty hope of meeting him again  a friendly baker put them on the right track at last both gentlemen eyeing the road with a mixture of concern and delight  it was a road of trim semidetached villas each with a wellkept front garden and neatly curtained windows  at the gate of a house with the word blairgowrie inscribed in huge gilt letters on the fanlight mr davis paused for a moment uneasily and then walking up the path followed by mr wotton knocked at the door  he retired a step in disorder before the apparition of a maid in cap and apron  a sharp not today  sounded in his ears and the door closed again  he faced his friend gasping  i should give her the sack first thing said mr wotton  mr davis knocked again and again  the maid reappeared and after surveying them through the glass opened the door a little way and parleyed  i want to see your missis said mr davis fiercely  what for  demanded the girl  you tell er said mr davis inserting his foot just in time you tell er that theres two gentlemen here what have brought er news of her husband and look sharp about it  they was cast away with im said mr wotton  on a desert island said mr davis  he pushed his way in followed by his friend and a head that had been leaning over the banisters was suddenly withdrawn  for a moment he stood irresolute in the tiny passage and then with a husbands boldness he entered the front room and threw himself into an easychair  mr wotton after a scared glance around the wellfurnished room seated himself on the extreme edge of the most uncomfortable chair he could find and coughed nervously  illustration you tell er that theres two gentlemen here what have brought er news of her husband  better not be too sudden with her he whispered  you dont want her to faint or anything of that sort  dont let er know who you are at first let her find it out for herself  mr davis who was also suffering from the stiff grandeur of his surroundings nodded  praps youd better start in case she reckernizes my voice he said slowly  pitch it in strong about me and ow i was always wondering what had appened to her  youre in luck thats wot you are said his friend enviously  ive only seen furniture like thiss in shop windows before  hsh  here she comes  he started and both men tried to look at their ease as a stiff rustling sounded from the stairs  then the door opened and a tall stoutlybuilt old lady with white hair swept into the room and stood regarding them  mr davis unprepared for the changes wrought by thirtyfive years stared at her aghast  the black silk dress the gold watchchain and huge cameo brooch did not help to reassure him  goodgood afternoon maam said mr wotton in a thin voice  the old lady returned the greeting and crossing to a chair and seating herself in a very upright fashion regarded him calmly  wewe called to see you about a dear old palfriend i mean continued mr wotton one o the best  the best  yes  said the old lady  hes been missing said mr wotton watching closely for any symptoms of fainting for thirtyfive years  thirtyfive years agovery much against his wishhe left is young and handsome wife to go for a sea vyge and was shipwrecked and cast away on a desert island  yes  said the old lady again  i was cast away with im said mr wotton  both of us was cast away with him  he indicated mr davis with his hand and the old lady after a glance at that gentleman turned to mr wotton again  we was on that island for longer than i like to think of continued mr wotton who had a wholesome dread of dates  but we was rescued at last and ever since then he has been hunting high and low for his wife  its very interesting murmured the old lady but what has it got to do with me  mr wotton gasped and cast a helpless glance at his friend  you aint heard his name yet he said impressively  wot would you say if i said it wasben davis  i should say it wasnt true said the old lady promptly  nottrue  said mr wotton catching his breath painfully  wish i may die  about the desert island continued the old lady calmly  the story that i heard was that he went off like a cur and left his young wife to do the best she could for herself  i suppose hes heard since that she has come in for a bit of money  money repeated mr wotton in a voice that he fondly hoped expressed artless surprise  money  money said the old lady and i suppose he sent you two gentlemen round to see how the land lay  she was looking full at mr davis as she spoke and both men began to take a somewhat sombre view of the situation  you didnt know him else you wouldnt talk like that said mr wotton i dont suppose youd know im if you was to see him now  i dont suppose i should said the other  praps youd reckernize his voice  said mr davis breaking silence at last  mr wotton held his breath but the old lady merely shook her head thoughtfully  it was a disagreeable voice when his wife used to hear it she said at last  always faultfinding when it wasnt swearing  mr wotton glanced at his friend and raising his eyebrows slightly gave up his task  might ha been faults on both sides said mr davis gruffly  you werent all that you should ha been you know  me said his hostess raising her voice  illustration dont you know me mary  yes you said mr davis rising  dont you know me mary  why i knew you the moment you come into the room  he moved towards her awkwardly but she rose in her turn and drew back  if you touch me ill scream she said firmly  how dare you  why ive never seen you before in my life  its ben davis maam its im right enough said mr wotton meekly  hold your tongue said the old lady  look at me  commanded mr davis sternly  look at me straight in the eye  dont talk nonsense said the other sharply  look you in the eye indeed  i dont want to look in your eye  what would people think  let em think wot they like said mr davis recklessly  this is a nice homecoming after being away thirtyfive years  most of it on a desert island put in mr wotton pathetically  and now ive come back resumed mr davis come back to stop  he hung his cap on a vase on the mantelpiece that reeled under the shock and dropping into his chair again crossed his legs and eyed her sternly  her gaze was riveted on his dilapidated boots  she looked up and spoke mildly  youre not my husband she said  youve made a mistakei think you had better go  ho  said mr davis with a hard laugh  indeed  and ow do you know im not  for the best of reasons was the reply  besides how can you prove that you are  thirtyfive years is a long time  specially on a desert island said mr wotton rapidly  youd be surprised ow slow the time passes  i was there with im and i can lay my hand on my art and assure you that that is your husband  nonsense  said the old lady vigorously  rubbish  i can prove it said mr davis fixing her with a glittering eye  do you remember the serpent i ad tattooed on my leg for a garter  if you dont go at once said the old lady hastily ill send for the police  you used to admire it said mr davis reproachfully  i remember once  if you say another word said the other in a fierce voice ill send straight off for the police  you and your serpents  ill tell my husband of you thats what ill do  your what  roared mr davis springing to his feet  my husband  he wont stand any of your nonsense i can tell you  youd better go before he comes in  ooh said mr davis taking a long breath  oh so you been and got married again ave you  thats your love for your husband as was cast away while trying to earn a living for you  thats why you dont want me is it  well see  ill wait for him  you dont know what youre talking about said the other with great dignity  ive only been married once  mr davis passed the back of his hand across his eyes in a dazed fashion and stared at her  isis somebody passing himself off as me  he demanded  cos if he is ill ave you both up for bigamy  certainly not  butbut  mr davis turned and looked blankly at his friend  mr wotton met his gaze with dilated eyes  you say you recognize me as your wife  said the old lady  certainly said mr davis hotly  its very curious said the othervery  but are you sure  look again  mr davis thrust his face close to hers and stared hard  she bore his scrutiny without flinching  im positive certain said mr davis taking a breath  thats very curious said the old lady but then i suppose we are a bit alike  you see mrs davis being away im looking after her house for a bit  my name happens to be smith  mr davis uttered a sharp exclamation and falling back a step stared at her openmouthed  we all make mistakes urged mr wotton after a long silence and bens sight aint wot it used to be  he strained it looking out for a sail when we was on that desert  whenwhenll she be back  inquired mr davis finding his voice at last  the old lady affected to look puzzled  but i thought you were certain that i was your wife  she said smoothly  my mistake said mr davis ruefully  thirtyfive years is a long time and people change a bit i have myself  for one thing i must say i didnt expect to find er so stout  stout  repeated the other quickly  not that i mean youre too stout said mr davis hurriedlyfor people that like stoutness that is  my wife used to ave a very good figger  mr wotton nodded  he used to rave about it on that des  when will she be back  inquired mr davis interrupting him  mrs smith shook her head  i cant say she replied moving towards the door  when shes off holidaying i never know when shell return shall i tell her you called  tell her icertainly said mr davis with great vehemence  ill come in a weeks time and see if shes back  she might be away for months said the old lady moving slowly to the passage and opening the street door  goodafternoon  she closed the door behind them and stood watching them through the glass as they passed disconsolately into the street  then she went back into the parlour and standing before the mantelpiece looked long and earnestly into the mirror  mr davis returned a week lateralone and pausing at the gate glanced in dismay at a bill in the window announcing that the house was to be sold  he walked up the path still looking at it and being admitted by the trim servant was shown into the parlour and stood in a dispirited fashion before mrs smith  not back yet  he inquired gruffly  the old lady shook her head  whatwhatis that bill for  demanded mr davis jerking his thumb towards it  she is thinking of selling the house said mrs smith  i let her know you had been and that is the result  she wont comeback  you wont see her again  where is she  inquired mr davis frowning  mrs smith shook her head again  and it would be no use my telling you she said  what she has got is her own and the law wont let you touch a penny of it without her consent  you must have treated her badly why did you leave her  why  repeated mr davis  why  why because she hit me over the ead with a broomhandle  mrs smith tossed her head  fancy you remembering that for thirtyfive years  she said  fancy forgetting it  retorted mr davis  i suppose she had a hot temper said the old lady  ot temper  said the other  yes  he leaned forward and holding his chilled hands over the fire stood for some time deep in thought  i dont know what it is he said at last but theres a something about you that reminds me of her  it aint your voice cos she had a very nice voicewhen she wasnt in a temperand it aint your face because  yes  said mrs smith sharply  because it dont remind me of her  and yet the other day you said you recognized me at once said the old lady  i thought i did said mr davis  one thing is i was expecting to see her i spose  there was a long silence  well i wont keep you said mrs smith at last and its no good for you to keep coming here to see her  she will never come here again i dont want to hurt your feelings but you dont look over and above respectable  your coat is torn your trousers are patched in a dozen places and your boots are half off your feeti dont know what the servant must think  ii only came to look for my wife said mr davis in a startled voice  i wont come again  thats right said the old lady  thatll please her i know  and if she should happen to ask what sort of a living you are making what shall i tell her  tell her what you said about my clothes maam said mr davis with his hand on the doorknob  shell understand then  shes known wot it is to be poor herself  shed got a bad temper but shed have cut her tongue out afore shed ave thrown a poor devils rags in his face goodafternoon  goodafternoon ben said the old woman in a changed voice  mr davis halfway through the door started as though he had been shot and facing about stood eyeing her in dumb bewilderment  if i take you back again repeated his wife are you going to behave yourself  it isnt the same voice and it isnt the same face said the old woman but if id only got a broomhandle handy  mr davis made an odd noise in his throat  if you hadnt been so down on your luck said his wife blinking her eyes rapidly id have let you go  if you hadnt looked so miserable i could have stood it  if i take you back are you going to behave yourself  mr davis stood gaping at her  if i take you back again repeated his wife speaking very slowly are you going to behave yourself  yes said mr davis finding his voice at last  yes if you are
