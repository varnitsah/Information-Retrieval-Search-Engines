73304874	embarrassments  by henry james  1896    contents  the figure in the carpet  glasses  the next time  the way it came      the figure in the carpet     i  i had done a few things and earned a few pencei had perhaps even had time to begin to think i was finer than was perceived by the patronising but when i take the little measure of my course a fidgety habit for its none of the longest yet i count my real start from the evening george corvick breathless and worried came in to ask me a service he had done more things than i and earned more pence though there were chances for cleverness i thought he sometimes missed i could only however that evening declare to him that he never missed one for kindness there was almost rapture in hearing it proposed to me to prepare for the middle the organ of our lucubrations so called from the position in the week of its day of appearance an article for which he had made himself responsible and of which tied up with a stout string he laid on my table the subject i pounced upon my opportunitythat is on the first volume of itand paid scant attention to my friends explanation of his appeal what explanation could be more to the point than my obvious fitness for the task i had written on hugh vereker but never a word in the middle where my dealings were mainly with the ladies and the minor poets this was his new novel an advance copy and whatever much or little it should do for his reputation i was clear on the spot as to what it should do for mine moreover if i always read him as soon as i could get hold of him i had a particular reason for wishing to read him now i had accepted an invitation to bridges for the following sunday and it had been mentioned in lady janes note that mr vereker was to be there i was young enough to have an emotion about meeting a man of his renown and innocent enough to believe the occasion would demand the display of an acquaintance with his last  corvick who had promised a review of it had not even had time to read it he had gone to pieces in consequence of news requiringas on precipitate reflection he judgedthat he should catch the nightmail to paris he had had a telegram from gwendolen erme in answer to his letter offering to fly to her aid i knew already about gwendolen erme i had never seen her but i had my ideas which were mainly to the effect that corvick would marry her if her mother would only die that lady seemed now in a fair way to oblige him after some dreadful mistake about some climate or some waters she had suddenly collapsed on the return from abroad her daughter unsupported and alarmed desiring to make a rush for home but hesitating at the risk had accepted our friends assistance and it was my secret belief that at the sight of him mrs erme would pull round his own belief was scarcely to be called secret it discernibly at any rate differed from mine he had showed me gwendolens photograph with the remark that she wasnt pretty but was awfully interesting she had published at the age of nineteen a novel in three volumes deep down about which in the middle he had been really splendid he appreciated my present eagerness and undertook that the periodical in question should do no less then at the last with his hand on the door he said to me of course youll be all right you know seeing i was a trifle vague he added i mean you wont be silly  sillyabout vereker why what do i ever find him but awfully clever  well whats that but silly what on earth does awfully clever mean for gods sake try to get at him dont let him suffer by our arrangement speak of him you know if you can as should have spoken of him  i wondered an instant you mean as far and away the biggest of the lotthat sort of thing  corvick almost groaned oh you know i dont put them back to back that way its the infancy of art but he gives me a pleasure so rare the sense of he mused a littlesomething or other  i wondered again the sense pray of what  my dear man thats just what i want you to say  even before corvick had banged the door i had begun book in hand to prepare myself to say it i sat up with vereker half the night corvick couldnt have done more than that he was awfully cleveri stuck to that but he wasnt a bit the biggest of the lot i didnt allude to the lot however i flattered myself that i emerged on this occasion from the infancy of art its all right they declared vividly at the office and when the number appeared i felt there was a basis on which i could meet the great man it gave me confidence for a day or two and then that confidence dropped i had fancied him reading it with relish but if corvick was not satisfied how could vereker himself be i reflected indeed that the heat of the admirer was sometimes grosser even than the appetite of the scribe corvick at all events wrote me from paris a little illhumouredly mrs erme was pulling round and i hadnt at all said what vereker gave him the sense of     ii  the effect of my visit to bridges was to turn me out for more profundity hugh vereker as i saw him there was of a contact so void of angles that i blushed for the poverty of imagination involved in my small precautions if he was in spirits it was not because he had read my review in fact on the sunday morning i felt sure he hadnt read it though the middle had been out three days and bloomed i assured myself in the stiff garden of periodicals which gave one of the ormolu tables the air of a stand at a station the impression he made on me personally was such that i wished him to read it and i corrected to this end with a surreptitious hand what might be wanting in the careless conspicuity of the sheet i am afraid i even watched the result of my manouvre but up to luncheon i watched in vain  when afterwards in the course of our gregarious walk i found myself for half an hour not perhaps without another manoeuvre at the great mans side the result of his affability was a still livelier desire that he should not remain in ignorance of the peculiar justice i had done him it was not that he seemed to thirst for justice on the contrary i had not yet caught in his talk the faintest grunt of a grudgea note for which my young experience had already given me an ear of late he had had more recognition and it was pleasant as we used to say in the middle to see that it drew him out he wasnt of course popular but i judged one of the sources of his good humour to be precisely that his success was independent of that he had none the less become in a manner the fashion the critics at least had put on a spurt and caught up with him we had found out at last how clever he was and he had had to make the best of the loss of his mystery i was strongly tempted as i walked beside him to let him know how much of that unveiling was my act and there was a moment when i probably should have done so had not one of the ladies of our party snatching a place at his other elbow just then appealed to him in a spirit comparatively selfish it was very discouraging i almost felt the liberty had been taken with myself  i had had on my tongues end for my own part a phrase or two about the right word at the right time but later on i was glad not to have spoken for when on our return we clustered at tea i perceived lady jane who had not been out with us brandishing the middle with her longest arm she had taken it up at her leisure she was delighted with what she had found and i saw that as a mistake in a man may often be a felicity in a woman she would practically do for me what i hadnt been able to do for myself some sweet little truths that needed to be spoken i heard her declare thrusting the paper at rather a bewildered couple by the fireplace she grabbed it away from them again on the reappearance of hugh vereker who after our walk had been upstairs to change something i know you dont in general look at this kind of thing but its an occasion really for doing so you havent seen it then you must the man has actually got at you at what i always feel you know lady jane threw into her eyes a look evidently intended to give an idea of what she always felt but she added that she couldnt have expressed it the man in the paper expressed it in a striking manner just see there and there where ive dashed it how he brings it out she had literally marked for him the brightest patches of my prose and if i was a little amused vereker himself may well have been he showed how much he was when before us all lady jane wanted to read something aloud i liked at any rate the way he defeated her purpose by jerking the paper affectionately out of her clutch he would take it upstairs with him would look at it on going to dress he did this half an hour lateri saw it in his hand when he repaired to his room that was the moment at which thinking to give her pleasure i mentioned to lady jane that i was the author of the review i did give her pleasure i judged but perhaps not quite so much as i had expected if the author was only me the thing didnt seem quite so remarkable hadnt i had the effect rather of diminishing the lustre of the article than of adding to my own her ladyship was subject to the most extraordinary drops it didnt matter the only effect i cared about was the one it would have on vereker up there by his bedroom fire  at dinner i watched for the signs of this impression tried to fancy there was some happier light in his eyes but to my disappointment lady jane gave me no chance to make sure i had hoped she would call triumphantly down the table publicly demand if she hadnt been right the party was largethere were people from outside as well but i had never seen a table long enough to deprive lady jane of a triumph i was just reflecting in truth that this interminable board would deprive me of one when the guest next me dear womanshe was miss poyle the vicars sister a robust unmodulated personhad the happy inspiration and the unusual courage to address herself across it to vereker who was opposite but not directly so that when he replied they were both leaning forward she inquired artless body what he thought of lady janes panegyric which she had readnot connecting it however with her righthand neighbour and while i strained my ear for his reply i heard him to my stupefaction call back gaily with his mouth full of bread oh its all rightits the usual twaddle  i had caught verekers glance as he spoke but miss poyles surprise was a fortunate cover for my own you mean he doesnt do you justice said the excellent woman  vereker laughed out and i was happy to be able to do the same its a charming article he tossed us  miss poyle thrust her chin half across the cloth  oh youre so deep she drove home  as deep as the ocean all i pretend is the author doesnt see  a dish was at this point passed over his shoulder and we had to wait while he helped himself  doesnt see what my neighbour continued  doesnt see anything  dear mehow very stupid  not a bit vereker laughed again nobody does  the lady on his further side appealed to him and miss poyle sank back to me nobody sees anything she cheerfully announced to which i replied that i had often thought so too but had somehow taken the thought for a proof on my own part of a tremendous eye i didnt tell her the article was mine and i observed that lady jane occupied at the end of the table had not caught verekers words  i rather avoided him after dinner for i confess he struck me as cruelly conceited and the revelation was a pain the usual twaddlemy acute little study that ones admiration should have had a reserve or two could gall him to that point i had thought him placid and he was placid enough such a surface was the hard polished glass that encased the bauble of his vanity i was really ruffled the only comfort was that if nobody saw anything george corvick was quite as much out of it as i this comfort however was not sufficient after the ladies had dispersed to carry me in the proper manneri mean in a spotted jacket and humming an airinto the smokingroom i took my way in some dejection to bed but in the passage i encountered mr vereker who had been up once more to change coming out of his room he was humming an air and had on a spotted jacket and as soon as he saw me his gaiety gave a start  my dear young man he exclaimed im so glad to lay hands on you im afraid i most unwittingly wounded you by those words of mine at dinner to miss poyle i learned but half an hour ago from lady jane that you wrote the little notice in the middle  i protested that no bones were broken but he moved with me to my own door his hand on my shoulder kindly feeling for a fracture and on hearing that i had come up to bed he asked leave to cross my threshold and just tell me in three words what his qualification of my remarks had represented it was plain he really feared i was hurt and the sense of his solicitude suddenly made all the difference to me my cheap review fluttered off into space and the best things i had said in it became flat enough beside the brilliancy of his being there i can see him there still on my rug in the firelight and his spotted jacket his fine clear face all bright with the desire to be tender to my youth i dont know what he had at first meant to say but i think the sight of my relief touched him excited him brought up words to his lips from far within it was so these words presently conveyed to me something that as i afterwards knew he had never uttered to any one i have always done justice to the generous impulse that made him speak it was simply compunction for a snub unconsciously administered to a man of letters in a position inferior to his own a man of letters moreover in the very act of praising him to make the thing right he talked to me exactly as an equal and on the ground of what we both loved best the hour the place the unexpectedness deepened the impression he couldnt have done anything more exquisitely successful     iii  i dont quite know how to explain it to you he said but it was the very fact that your notice of my book had a spice of intelligence it was just your exceptional sharpness that produced the feelinga very old story with me i beg you to believeunder the momentary influence of which i used in speaking to that good lady the words you so naturally resent i dont read the things in the newspapers unless theyre thrust upon me as that one wasits always ones best friend that does it but i used to read them sometimesten years ago i daresay they were in general rather stupider then at any rate it always seemed to me that they missed my little point with a perfection exactly as admirable when they patted me on the back as when they kicked me in the shins whenever since ive happened to have a glimpse of them they were still blazing awaystill missing it i mean deliciously you miss it my dear fellow with inimitable assurance the fact of your being awfully clever and your articles being awfully nice doesnt make a hairs breadth of difference its quite with you rising young men vereker laughed that i feel most what a failure i am  i listened with intense interest it grew intenser as he talked you a failureheavens what then may your little point happen to be  have i got to tell you after all these years and labours there was something in the friendly reproach of thisjocosely exaggeratedthat made me as an ardent young seeker for truth blush to the roots of my hair im as much in the dark as ever though ive grown used in a sense to my obtuseness at that moment however verekers happy accent made me appear to myself and probably to him a rare donkey i was on the point of exclaiming ah yes dont tell me for my honour for that of the craft dont when he went on in a manner that showed he had read my thought and had his own idea of the probability of our some day redeeming ourselves by my little point i meanwhat shall i call itthe particular thing ive written my books most for isnt there for every writer a particular thing of that sort the thing that most makes him apply himself the thing without the effort to achieve which he wouldnt write at all the very passion of his passion the part of the business in which for him the flame of art burns most intensely well its that  i considered a moment i was fascinatedeasily youll say but i wasnt going after all to be put off my guard your descriptions certainly beautiful but it doesnt make what you describe very distinct  i promise you it would be distinct if it should dawn on you at all i saw that the charm of our topic overflowed for my companion into an emotion as lively as my own at any rate he went on i can speak for myself theres an idea in my work without which i wouldnt have given a straw for the whole job its the finest fullest intention of the lot and the application of it has been i think a triumph of patience of ingenuity i ought to leave that to somebody else to say but that nobody does say it is precisely what were talking about it stretches this little trick of mine from book to book and everything else comparatively plays over the surface of it the order the form the texture of my books will perhaps some day constitute for the initiated a complete representation of it so its naturally the thing for the critic to look for it strikes me my visitor added smiling even as the thing for the critic to find  this seemed a responsibility indeed you call it a little trick  thats only my little modesty its really an exquisite scheme  and you hold that youve carried the scheme out  the way ive carried it out is the thing in life i think a bit well of myself for  i was silent a moment dont you think you oughtjust a trifleto assist the critic  assist him what else have i done with every stroke of my pen ive shouted my intention in his great blank face at this laughing out again vereker laid his hand on my shoulder to show that the allusion was not to my personal appearance  but you talk about the initiated there must therefore you see be initiation  what else in heavens name is criticism supposed to be im afraid i coloured at this too but i took refuge in repeating that his account of his silver lining was poor in something or other that a plain man knows things by thats only because youve never had a glimpse of it he replied if you had had one the element in question would soon have become practically all youd see to me its exactly as palpable as the marble of this chimney besides the critic just isnt a plain man if he were pray what would he be doing in his neighbours garden youre anything but a plain man yourself and the very raison dêtre of you all is that youre little demons of subtlety if my great affairs a secret thats only because its a secret in spite of itselfthe amazing event has made it one i not only never took the smallest precaution to do so but never dreamed of any such accident if i had i shouldnt in advance have had the heart to go on as it was i only became aware little by little and meanwhile i had done my work  and now you quite like it i risked  my work  your secret its the same thing  your guessing that vereker replied is a proof that youre as clever as i say i was encouraged by this to remark that he would clearly be pained to part with it and he confessed that it was indeed with him now the great amusement of life i live almost to see if it will ever be detected he looked at me for a jesting challenge something at the back of his eyes seemed to peep out but i neednt worryit wont  you fire me as ive never been fired i returned you make me determined to do or die then i asked is it a kind of esoteric message  his countenance fell at thishe put out his hand as if to bid me goodnight ah my dear fellow it cant be described in cheap journalese  i knew of course he would be awfully fastidious but our talk had made me feel how much his nerves were exposed i was unsatisfiedi kept hold of his hand i wont make use of the expression then i said in the article in which i shall eventually announce my discovery though i daresay i shall have hard work to do without it but meanwhile just to hasten that difficult birth cant you give a fellow a clue i felt much more at my ease  my whole lucid effort gives him a clueevery page and line and letter the things as concrete there as a bird in a cage a bait on a hook a piece of cheese in a mousetrap its stuck into every volume as your foot is stuck into your shoe it governs every line it chooses every word it dots every i it places every comma  i scratched my head is it something in the style or something in the thought an element of form or an element of feeling  he indulgently shook my hand again and i felt my questions to be crude and my distinctions pitiful goodnight my dear boydont bother about it after all you do like a fellow  and a little intelligence might spoil it i still detained him  he hesitated well youve got a heart in your body is that an element of form or an element of feeling what i contend that nobody has ever mentioned in my work is the organ of life  i seeits some idea about life some sort of philosophy unless it be i added with the eagerness of a thought perhaps still happier some kind of game youre up to with your style something youre after in the language perhaps its a preference for the letter p i ventured profanely to break out papa potatoes prunesthat sort of thing he was suitably indulgent he only said i hadnt got the right letter but his amusement was over i could see he was bored there was nevertheless something else i had absolutely to learn should you be able pen in hand to state it clearly yourselfto name it phrase it formulate it  oh he almost passionately sighed if i were only pen in hand one of you chaps  that would be a great chance for you of course but why should you despise us chaps for not doing what you cant do yourself  cant do he opened his eyes havent i done it in twenty volumes i do it in my way he continued you dont do it in yours  ours is so devilish difficult i weakly observed  so is mine we each choose our own theres no compulsion you wont come down and smoke  no i want to think this thing out  youll tell me then in the morning that youve laid me bare  ill see what i can do ill sleep on it but just one word more i added we had left the roomi walked again with him a few steps along the passage this extraordinary general intention as you call itfor thats the most vivid description i can induce you to make of itis then generally a sort of buried treasure  his face lighted yes call it that though its perhaps not for me to do so  nonsense i laughed you know youre hugely proud of it  well i didnt propose to tell you so but it is the joy of my soul  you mean its a beauty so rare so great  he hesitated a moment the loveliest thing in the world we had stopped and on these words he left me but at the end of the corridor while i looked after him rather yearningly he turned and caught sight of my puzzled face it made him earnestly indeed i thought quite anxiously shake his head and wave his finger give it upgive it up  this wasnt a challengeit was fatherly advice if i had had one of his books at hand i would have repeated my recent act of faithi would have spent half the night with him at three oclock in the morning not sleeping remembering moreover how indispensable he was to lady jane i stole down to the library with a candle there wasnt so far as i could discover a line of his writing in the house     iv  returning to town i feverishly collected them all i picked out each in its order and held it up to the light this gave me a maddening month in the course of which several things took place one of these the last i may as well immediately mention was that i acted on verekers advice i renounced my ridiculous attempt i could really make nothing of the business it proved a dead loss after all before as he had himself observed i liked him and what now occurred was simply that my new intelligence and vain preoccupation damaged my liking i not only failed to find his general intentioni found myself missing the subordinate intentions i had formerly found his books didnt even remain the charming things they had been for me the exasperation of my search put me out of conceit of them instead of being a pleasure the more they became a resource the less for from the moment i was unable to follow up the authors hint i of course felt it a point of honour not to make use professionally of my knowledge of them i had no knowledgenobody had any it was humiliating but i could bear itthey only annoyed me now at last they even bored me and i accounted for my confusionperversely i confessby the idea that vereker had made a fool of me the buried treasure was a bad joke the general intention a monstrous pose  the great incident of the time however was that i told george corvick all about the matter and that my information had an immense effect upon him he had at last come back but so unfortunately had mrs erme and there was as yet i could see no question of his nuptials he was immensely stirred up by the anecdote i had brought from bridges it fell in so completely with the sense he had had from the first that there was more in vereker than met the eye when i remarked that the eye seemed what the printed page had been expressly invented to meet he immediately accused me of being spiteful because i had been foiled our commerce had always that pleasant latitude the thing vereker had mentioned to me was exactly the thing he corvick had wanted me to speak of in my review on my suggesting at last that with the assistance i had now given him he would doubtless be prepared to speak of it himself he admitted freely that before doing this there was more he must understand what he would have said had he reviewed the new book was that there was evidently in the writers inmost art something to be understood i hadnt so much as hinted at that no wonder the writer hadnt been flattered i asked corvick what he really considered he meant by his own supersubtlety and unmistakably kindled he replied it isnt for the vulgarit isnt for the vulgar he had hold of the tail of something he would pull hard pull it right out he pumped me dry on verekers strange confidence and pronouncing me the luckiest of mortals mentioned half a dozen questions he wished to goodness i had had the gumption to put yet on the other hand he didnt want to be told too muchit would spoil the fun of seeing what would come the failure of my fun was at the moment of our meeting not complete but i saw it ahead and corvick saw that i saw it i on my side saw likewise that one of the first things he would do would be to rush off with my story to gwendolen  on the very day after my talk with him i was surprised by the receipt of a note from hugh vereker to whom our encounter at bridges had been recalled as he mentioned by his falling in a magazine on some article to which my signature was appended i read it with great pleasure he wrote and remembered under its influence our lively conversation by your bedroom fire the consequence of this has been that i begin to measure the temerity of my having saddled you with a knowledge that you may find something of a burden now that the fits over i cant imagine how i came to be moved so much beyond my wont i had never before related no matter in what expansion the history of my little secret and i shall never speak of the business again i was accidentally so much more explicit with you than it had ever entered into my game to be that i find this gamei mean the pleasure of playing itsuffers considerably in short if you can understand it ive spoiled a part of my fun i really dont want to give anybody what i believe you clever young men call the tip thats of course a selfish solicitude and i name it to you for what it may be worth to you if youre disposed to humour me dont repeat my revelation think me dementedits your right but dont tell anybody why  the sequel to this communication was that as early on the morrow as i dared i drove straight to mr verekers door he occupied in those years one of the honest old houses in kensingtonsquare he received me immediately and as soon as i came in i saw i had not lost my power to minister to his mirth he laughed out at the sight of my face which doubtless expressed my perturbation i had been indiscreetmy compunction was great i have told somebody i panted and im sure that person will by this time have told somebody else its a woman into the bargain  the person youve told  no the other person im quite sure he must have told her  for all the good it will do heror do me a woman will never find out  no but shell talk all over the place shell do just what you dont want  vereker thought a moment but he was not so disconcerted as i had feared he felt that if the harm was done it only served him right it doesnt matterdont worry  ill do my best i promise you that your talk with me shall go no further  very good do what you can  in the meantime i pursued george corvicks possession of the tip may on his part really lead to something  that will be a brave day  i told him about corvicks cleverness his admiration the intensity of his interest in my anecdote and without making too much of the divergence of our respective estimates mentioned that my friend was already of opinion that he saw much further into a certain affair than most people he was quite as fired as i had been at bridges he was moreover in love with the young lady perhaps the two together would puzzle something out  vereker seemed struck with this do you mean theyre to be married  i daresay thats what it will come to  that may help them he conceded but we must give them time  i spoke of my own renewed assault and confessed my difficulties whereupon he repeated his former advice give it up give it up he evidently didnt think me intellectually equipped for the adventure i stayed half an hour and he was most goodnatured but i couldnt help pronouncing him a man of shifting moods he had been free with me in a mood he had repented in a mood and now in a mood he had turned indifferent this general levity helped me to believe that so far as the subject of the tip went there wasnt much in it i contrived however to make him answer a few more questions about it though he did so with visible impatience for himself beyond doubt the thing we were all so blank about was vividly there it was something i guessed in the primal plan something like a complex figure in a persian carpet he highly approved of this image when i used it and he used another himself its the very string he said that my pearls are strung on the reason of his note to me had been that he really didnt want to give us a grain of succourour destiny was a thing too perfect in its way to touch he had formed the habit of depending upon it and if the spell was to break it must break by some force of its own he comes back to me from that last occasionfor i was never to speak to him againas a man with some safe secret for enjoyment i wondered as i walked away where he had got his tip     v  when i spoke to george corvick of the caution i had received he made me feel that any doubt of his delicacy would be almost an insult he had instantly told gwendolen but gwendolens ardent response was in itself a pledge of discretion the question would now absorb them and they would enjoy their fun too much to wish to share it with the crowd they appeared to have caught instinctively verekers peculiar notion of fun their intellectual pride however was not such as to make them indifferent to any further light i might throw on the affair they had in hand they were indeed of the artistic temperament and i was freshly struck with my colleagues power to excite himself over a question of art he called it letters he called it lifeit was all one thing in what he said i now seemed to understand that he spoke equally for gwendolen to whom as soon as mrs erme was sufficiently better to allow her a little leisure he made a point of introducing me i remember our calling together one sunday in august at a huddled house in chelsea and my renewed envy of corvicks possession of a friend who had some light to mingle with his own he could say things to her that i could never say to him she had indeed no sense of humour and with her pretty way of holding her head on one side was one of those persons whom you want as the phrase is to shake but who have learnt hungarian by themselves she conversed perhaps in hungarian with corvick she had remarkably little english for his friend corvick afterwards told me that i had chilled her by my apparent indisposition to oblige her with the detail of what vereker had said to me i admitted that i felt i had given thought enough to this exposure hadnt i even made up my mind that it was hollow wouldnt stand the test the importance they attached to it was irritatingit rather envenomed my dissent  that statement looks unamiable and what probably happened was that i felt humiliated at seeing other persons derive a daily joy from an experiment which had brought me only chagrin i was out in the cold while by the evening fire under the lamp they followed the chase for which i myself had sounded the horn they did as i had done only more deliberately and sociablythey went over their author from the beginning there was no hurry corvick saidthe future was before them and the fascination could only grow they would take him page by page as they would take one of the classics inhale him in slow draughts and let him sink deep in i doubt whether they would have got so wound up if they had not been in love poor verekers secret gave them endless occasion to put their young heads together none the less it represented the kind of problem for which corvick had a special aptitude drew out the particular pointed patience of which had he lived he would have given more striking and it is to be hoped more fruitful examples he at least was in verekers words a little demon of subtlety we had begun by disputing but i soon saw that without my stirring a finger his infatuation would have its bad hours he would bound off on false scents as i had donehe would clap his hands over new lights and see them blown out by the wind of the turned page he was like nothing i told him but the maniacs who embrace some bedlamitical theory of the cryptic character of shakespeare to this he replied that if we had had shakespeares own word for his being cryptic he would immediately have accepted it the case there was altogether differentwe had nothing but the word of mr snooks i rejoined that i was stupefied to see him attach such importance even to the word of mr vereker he inquired thereupon whether i treated mr verekers word as a lie i wasnt perhaps prepared in my unhappy rebound to go as far as that but i insisted that till the contrary was proved i should view it as too fond an imagination i didnt i confess sayi didnt at that time quite knowall i felt deep down as miss erme would have said i was uneasy i was expectant at the core of my personal confusionfor my curiosity lived in its asheswas the sharpness of a sense that corvick would at last probably come out somewhere he made in defence of his credulity a great point of the fact that from of old in his study of this genius he had caught whiffs and hints of he didnt know what faint wandering notes of a hidden music that was just the rarity that was the charm it fitted so perfectly into what i reported  if i returned on several occasions to the little house in chelsea i daresay it was as much for news of vereker as for news of miss ermes mamma the hours spent there by corvick were present to my fancy as those of a chessplayer bent with a silent scowl all the lamplit winter over his board and his moves as my imagination filled it out the picture held me fast on the other side of the table was a ghostlier form the faint figure of an antagonist goodhumouredly but a little wearily securean antagonist who leaned back in his chair with his hands in his pockets and a smile on his fine clear face close to corvick behind him was a girl who had begun to strike me as pale and wasted and even on more familiar view as rather handsome and who rested on his shoulder and hung upon his moves he would take up a chessman and hold it poised a while over one of the little squares and then he would put it back in its place with a long sigh of disappointment the young lady at this would slightly but uneasily shift her position and look across very hard very long very strangely at their dim participant i had asked them at an early stage of the business if it mightnt contribute to their success to have some closer communication with him the special circumstances would surely be held to have given me a right to introduce them corvick immediately replied that he had no wish to approach the altar before he had prepared the sacrifice he quite agreed with our friend both as to the sport and as to the honourhe would bring down the animal with his own rifle when i asked him if miss erme were as keen a shot he said after an hesitation no im ashamed to say she wants to set a trap shed give anything to see him she says she requires another tip shes really quite morbid about it but she must play fairshe shant see him he emphatically added i had a suspicion that they had even quarrelled a little on the subjecta suspicion not corrected by the way he more than once exclaimed to me shes quite incredibly literary you knowquite fantastically i remember his saying of her that she felt in italics and thought in capitals oh when ive run him to earth he also said then you know i shall knock at his door ratheri beg you to believe ill have it from his own lips right you are my boy youve done it this time he shall crown me victorwith the critical laurel  meanwhile he really avoided the chances london life might have given him of meeting the distinguished novelist a danger however that disappeared with verekers leaving england for an indefinite absence as the newspapers announcedgoing to the south for motives connected with the health of his wife which had long kept her in retirement a yearmore than a yearhad elapsed since the incident at bridges but i had not encountered him again i think at bottom i was rather ashamedi hated to remind him that though i had irremediably missed his point a reputation for acuteness was rapidly overtaking me this scruple led me a dance kept me out of lady janes house made me even decline when in spite of my bad manners she was a second time so good as to make me a sign an invitation to her beautiful seat i once saw her with vereker at a concert and was sure i was seen by them but i slipped out without being caught i felt as on that occasion i splashed along in the rain that i couldnt have done anything else and yet i remember saying to myself that it was hard was even cruel not only had i lost the books but i had lost the man himself they and their author had been alike spoiled for me i knew too which was the loss i most regretted i had liked the man still better than i had liked the books     vi  six months after vereker had left england george corvick who made his living by his pen contracted for a piece of work which imposed on him an absence of some length and a journey of some difficulty and his undertaking of which was much of a surprise to me his brotherinlaw had become editor of a great provincial paper and the great provincial paper in a fine flight of fancy had conceived the idea of sending a special commissioner to india special commissioners had begun in the metropolitan press to be the fashion and the journal in question felt that it had passed too long for a mere country cousin corvick had no hand i knew for the big brush of the correspondent but that was his brotherinlaws affair and the fact that a particular task was not in his line was apt to be with himself exactly a reason for accepting it he was prepared to outherod the metropolitan press he took solemn precautions against priggishness he exquisitely outraged taste nobody ever knew itthe taste was all his own in addition to his expenses he was to be conveniently paid and i found myself able to help him for the usual fat book to a plausible arrangement with the usual fat publisher i naturally inferred that his obvious desire to make a little money was not unconnected with the prospect of a union with gwendolen erme i was aware that her mothers opposition was largely addressed to his want of means and of lucrative abilities but it so happened that on my saying the last time i saw him something that bore on the question of his separation from our young lady he exclaimed with an emphasis that startled me ah im not a bit engaged to her you know  not overtly i answered because her mother doesnt like you but ive always taken for granted a private understanding  well there was one but there isnt now that was all he said except something about mrs ermes having got on her feet again in the most extraordinary waya remark from which i gathered he wished me to think he meant that private understandings were of little use when the doctor didnt share them what i took the liberty of really thinking was that the girl might in some way have estranged him well if he had taken the turn of jealousy for instance it could scarcely be jealousy of me in that case besides the absurdity of it he wouldnt have gone away to leave us together for some time before his departure we had indulged in no allusion to the buried treasure and from his silence of which mine was the consequence i had drawn a sharp conclusion his courage had dropped his ardour had gone the way of minethis inference at least he left me to enjoy more than that he couldnt do he couldnt face the triumph with which i might have greeted an explicit admission he neednt have been afraid poor dear for i had by this time lost all need to triumph in fact i considered that i showed magnanimity in not reproaching him with his collapse for the sense of his having thrown up the game made me feel more than ever how much i at last depended on him if corvick had broken down i should never know no one would be of any use if he wasnt it wasnt a bit true that i had ceased to care for knowledge little by little my curiosity had not only begun to ache again but had become the familiar torment of my consciousness there are doubtless people to whom torments of such an order appear hardly more natural than the contortions of disease but i dont know after all why i should in this connection so much as mention them for the few persons at any rate abnormal or not with whom my anecdote is concerned literature was a game of skill and skill meant courage and courage meant honour and honour meant passion meant life the stake on the table was of a different substance and our roulette was the revolving mind but we sat round the green board as intently as the grim gamblers at monte carlo gwendolen erme for that matter with her white face and her fixed eyes was of the very type of the lean ladies one had met in the temples of chance i recognised in corvicks absence that she made this analogy vivid it was extravagant i admit the way she lived for the art of the pen her passion visibly preyed upon her and in her presence i felt almost tepid i got hold of deep down again it was a desert in which she had lost herself but in which too she had dug a wonderful hole in the sanda cavity out of which corvick had still more remarkably pulled her  early in march i had a telegram from her in consequence of which i repaired immediately to chelsea where the first thing she said to me was he has got it he has got it  she was moved as i could see to such depths that she must mean the great thing verekers idea  his general intention george has cabled from bombay  she had the missive open there it was emphatic but it was brief eureka immense that was allhe had saved the money of the signature i shared her emotion but i was disappointed he doesnt say what it is  how could hein a telegram hell write it  but how does he know  know its the real thing oh im sure when you see it you do know vera incessu patuit dea  its you miss erme who are a dear for bringing me such newsi went all lengths in my high spirits but fancy finding our goddess in the temple of vishnu how strange of george to have been able to go into the thing again in the midst of such different and such powerful solicitations  he hasnt gone into it i know its the thing itself let severely alone for six months that has simply sprung out at him like a tigress out of the jungle he didnt take a book with himon purpose indeed he wouldnt have needed tohe knows every page as i do by heart they all worked in him together and some day somewhere when he wasnt thinking they fell in all their superb intricacy into the one right combination the figure in the carpet came out thats the way he knew it would come and the real reasonyou didnt in the least understand but i suppose i may tell you nowwhy he went and why i consented to his going we knew the change would do it the difference of thought of scene would give the needed touch the magic shake we had perfectly we had admirably calculated the elements were all in his mind and in the secousse of a new and intense experience they just struck light she positively struck light herselfshe was literally facially luminous i stammered something about unconscious cerebration and she continued hell come right homethis will bring him  to see vereker you mean  to see verekerand to see me think what hell have to tell me  i hesitated about india  about fiddlesticks about verekerabout the figure in the carpet  but as you say we shall surely have that in a letter  she thought like one inspired and i remembered how corvick had told me long before that her face was interesting perhaps it wont go in a letter if its immense  perhaps not if its immense bosh if he has got something that wont go in a letter he hasnt got the thing verekers own statement to me was exactly that the figure would go in a letter  well i cabled to george an hour agotwo words said gwendolen  is it indiscreet of me to inquire what they were  she hung fire but at last she brought them out angel write  good i exclaimed ill make it sureill send him the same     vii  my words however were not absolutely the samei put something instead of angel and in the sequel my epithet seemed the more apt for when eventually we heard from corvick it was merely it was thoroughly to be tantalised he was magnificent in his triumph he described his discovery as stupendous but his ecstasy only obscured itthere were to be no particulars till he should have submitted his conception to the supreme authority he had thrown up his commission he had thrown up his book he had thrown up everything but the instant need to hurry to rapallo on the genoese shore where vereker was making a stay i wrote him a letter which was to await him at adeni besought him to relieve my suspense that he found my letter was indicated by a telegram which reaching me after weary days and without my having received an answer to my laconic dispatch at bombay was evidently intended as a reply to both communications those few words were in familiar french the french of the day which corvick often made use of to show he wasnt a prig it had for some persons the opposite effect but his message may fairly be paraphrased have patience i want to see as it breaks on you the face youll make tellement envie de voir ta têtethat was what i had to sit down with i can certainly not be said to have sat down for i seem to remember myself at this time as rushing constantly between the little house in chelsea and my own our impatience gwendolens and mine was equal but i kept hoping her light would be greater we all spent during this episode for people of our means a great deal of money in telegrams and i counted on the receipt of news from rapallo immediately after the junction of the discoverer with the discovered the interval seemed an age but late one day i heard a hansom rattle up to my door with a crash engendered by a hint of liberality i lived with my heart in my mouth and i bounded to the windowa movement which gave me a view of a young lady erect on the footboard of the vehicle and eagerly looking up at my house at sight of me she flourished a paper with a movement that brought me straight down the movement with which in melodramas handkerchiefs and reprieves are flourished at the foot of the scaffold  just seen verekernot a note wrong pressed me to bosomkeeps me a month so much i read on her paper while the cabby dropped a grin from his perch in my excitement i paid him profusely and in hers she suffered it then as he drove away we started to walk about and talk we had talked heaven knows enough before but this was a wondrous lift we pictured the whole scene at rapallo where he would have written mentioning my name for permission to call that is i pictured it having more material than my companion whom i felt hang on my lips as we stopped on purpose before shopwindows we didnt look into about one thing we were clear if he was staying on for fuller communication we should at least have a letter from him that would help us through the dregs of delay we understood his staying on and yet each of us saw i think that the other hated it the letter we were clear about arrived it was for gwendolen and i called upon her in time to save her the trouble of bringing it to me she didnt read it out as was natural enough but she repeated to me what it chiefly embodied this consisted of the remarkable statement that he would tell her when they were married exactly what she wanted to know  only when were marriednot before she explained its tantamount to sayingisnt itthat i must marry him straight off she smiled at me while i flushed with disappointment a vision of fresh delay that made me at first unconscious of my surprise it seemed more than a hint that on me as well he would impose some tiresome condition suddenly while she reported several more things from his letter i remembered what he had told me before going away he found mr vereker deliriously interesting and his own possession of the secret a kind of intoxication the buried treasure was all gold and gems now that it was there it seemed to grow and grow before him it was in all time in all tongues one of the most wonderful flowers of art nothing above all when once one was face to face with it had been more consummately done when once it came out it came out was there with a splendour that made you ashamed and there had not been save in the bottomless vulgarity of the age with every one tasteless and tainted every sense stopped the smallest reason why it should have been overlooked it was immense but it was simpleit was simple but it was immense and the final knowledge of it was an experience quite apart he intimated that the charm of such an experience the desire to drain it in its freshness to the last drop was what kept him there close to the source gwendolen frankly radiant as she tossed me these fragments showed the elation of a prospect more assured than my own that brought me back to the question of her marriage prompted me to ask her if what she meant by what she had just surprised me with was that she was under an engagement  of course i am she answered didnt you know it she appeared astonished but i was still more so for corvick had told me the exact contrary i didnt mention this however i only reminded her that i had not been to that degree in her confidence or even in corvicks and that moreover i was not in ignorance of her mothers interdict at bottom i was troubled by the disparity of the two assertions but after a moment i felt that corvicks was the one i least doubted this simply reduced me to asking myself if the girl had on the spot improvised an engagementvamped up an old one or dashed off a newin order to arrive at the satisfaction she desired i reflected that she had resources of which i was destitute but she made her case slightly more intelligible by rejoining presently what the state of things has been is that we felt of course bound to do nothing in mammas lifetime  but now you think youll just dispense with your mothers consent  ah it may not come to that i wondered what it might come to and she went on poor dear she may swallow the dose in fact you know she added with a laugh she really musta proposition of which on behalf of every one concerned i fully acknowledged the force     viii  nothing more annoying had ever happened to me than to become aware before corvicks arrival in england that i should not be there to put him through i found myself abruptly called to germany by the alarming illness of my younger brother who against my advice had gone to munich to study at the feet indeed of a great master the art of portraiture in oils the near relative who made him an allowance had threatened to withdraw it if he should under specious pretexts turn for superior truth to parisparis being somehow for a cheltenham aunt the school of evil the abyss i deplored this prejudice at the time and the deep injury of it was now visiblefirst in the fact that it had not saved the poor boy who was clever frail and foolish from congestion of the lungs and second in the greater remoteness from london to which the event condemned me i am afraid that what was uppermost in my mind during several anxious weeks was the sense that if we had only been in paris i might have run over to see corvick this was actually out of the question from every point of view my brother whose recovery gave us both plenty to do was ill for three months during which i never left him and at the end of which we had to face the absolute prohibition of a return to england the consideration of climate imposed itself and he was in no state to meet it alone i took him to meran and there spent the summer with him trying to show him by example how to get back to work and nursing a rage of another sort that i tried not to show him  the whole business proved the first of a series of phenomena so strangely combined that taken together which was how i had to take them they form as good an illustration as i can recall of the manner in which for the good of his soul doubtless fate sometimes deals with a mans avidity these incidents certainly had larger bearings than the comparatively meagre consequence we are here concerned withthough i feel that consequence also to be a thing to speak of with some respect its mainly in such a light i confess at any rate that at this hour the ugly fruit of my exile is present to me even at first indeed the spirit in which my avidity as i have called it made me regard this term owed no element of ease to the fact that before coming back from rapallo george corvick addressed me in a way i didnt like his letter had none of the sedative action that i must today profess myself sure he had wished to give it and the march of occurrences was not so ordered as to make up for what it lacked he had begun on the spot for one of the quarterlies a great last word on verekers writings and this exhaustive study the only one that would have counted have existed was to turn on the new light to utteroh so quietlythe unimagined truth it was in other words to trace the figure in the carpet through every convolution to reproduce it in every tint the result said corvick was to be the greatest literary portrait ever painted and what he asked of me was just to be so good as not to trouble him with questions till he should hang up his masterpiece before me he did me the honour to declare that putting aside the great sitter himself all aloft in his indifference i was individually the connoisseur he was most working for i was therefore to be a good boy and not try to peep under the curtain before the showwas ready i should enjoy it all the more if i sat very still  i did my best to sit very still but i couldnt help giving a jump on seeing in the times after i had been a week or two in munich and before as i knew corvick had reached london the announcement of the sudden death of poor mrs erme i instantly wrote to gwendolen for particulars and she replied that her mother had succumbed to longthreatened failure of the heart she didnt say but i took the liberty of reading into her words that from the point of view of her marriage and also of her eagerness which was quite a match for mine this was a solution more prompt than could have been expected and more radical than waiting for the old lady to swallow the dose i candidly admit indeed that at the timefor i heard from her repeatedlyi read some singular things into gwendolens words and some still more extraordinary ones into her silences pen in hand this way i live the time over and it brings back the oddest sense of my having been for months and in spite of myself a kind of coerced spectator all my life had taken refuge in my eyes which the procession of events appeared to have committed itself to keep astare there were days when i thought of writing to hugh vereker and simply throwing myself on his charity but i felt more deeply that i hadnt fallen quite so low besides which quite properly he would send me about my business mrs ermes death brought corvick straight home and within the month he was united very quietlyas quietly i suppose as he meant in his article to bring out his trouvailleto the young lady he had loved and quitted i use this last term i may parenthetically say because i subsequently grew sure that at the time he went to india at the time of his great news from bombay there was no engagement whatever there was none at the moment she affirmed the opposite on the other hand he certainly became engaged the day he returned the happy pair went down to torquay for their honeymoon and there in a reckless hour it occurred to poor corvick to take his young bride a drive he had no command of that business this had been brought home to me of old in a little tour we had once made together in a dogcart in a dogcart he perched his companion for a rattle over devonshire hills on one of the likeliest of which he brought his horse who it was true had bolted down with such violence that the occupants of the cart were hurled forward and that he fell horribly on his head he was killed on the spot gwendolen escaped unhurt  i pass rapidly over the question of this unmitigated tragedy of what the loss of my best friend meant for me and i complete my little history of my patience and my pain by the frank statement of my having in a postscript to my very first letter to her after the receipt of the hideous news asked mrs corvick whether her husband had not at least finished the great article on vereker her answer was as prompt as my inquiry the article which had been barely begun was a mere heartbreaking scrap she explained that corvick had just settled down to it when he was interrupted by her mothers death then on his return he had been kept from work by the engrossments into which that calamity plunged them the opening pages were all that existed they were striking they were promising but they didnt unveil the idol that great intellectual feat was obviously to have formed his climax she said nothing more nothing to enlighten me as to the state of her own knowledgethe knowledge for the acquisition of which i had conceived her doing prodigious things this was above all what i wanted to know had she seen the idol unveiled had there been a private ceremony for a palpitating audience of one for what else but that ceremony had the previous ceremony been enacted i didnt like as yet to press her though when i thought of what had passed between us on the subject in corvicks absence her reticence surprised me it was therefore not till much later from meran that i risked another appeal risked it in some trepidation for she continued to tell me nothing did you hear in those few days of your blighted bliss i wrote what we desired so to hear i said we as a little hint and she showed me she could take a little hint i heard everything she replied and i mean to keep it to myself     ix  it was impossible not to be moved with the strongest sympathy for her and on my return to england i showed her every kindness in my power her mothers death had made her means sufficient and she had gone to live in a more convenient quarter but her loss had been great and her visitation cruel it never would have occurred to me moreover to suppose she could come to regard the enjoyment of a technical tip of a piece of literary experience as a counterpoise to her grief strange to say none the less i couldnt help fancying after i had seen her a few times that i caught a glimpse of some such oddity i hasten to add that there had been other things i couldnt help fancying and as i never felt i was really clear about these so as to the point i here touch on i give her memory the benefit of every doubt stricken and solitary highly accomplished and now in her deep mourning her maturer grace and her uncomplaining sorrow incontestably handsome she presented herself as leading a life of singular dignity and beauty i had at first found a way to believe that i should soon get the better of the reserve formulated the week after the catastrophe in her reply to an appeal as to which i was not unconscious that it might strike her as mistimed certainly that reserve was something of a shock to mecertainly it puzzled me the more i thought of it though i tried to explain it with moments of success by the supposition of exalted sentiments of superstitious scruples of a refinement of loyalty certainly it added at the same time hugely to the price of verekers secret precious as that mystery already appeared i may as well confess abjectly that mrs corvicks unexpected attitude was the final tap on the nail that was to fix as they say my luckless idea convert it into the obsession of which i am for ever conscious but this only helped me the more to be artful to be adroit to allow time to elapse before renewing my suit there were plenty of speculations for the interval and one of them was deeply absorbing corvick had kept his information from his young friend till after the removal of the last barriers to their intimacy then he had let the cat out of the bag was it gwendolens idea taking a hint from him to liberate this animal only on the basis of the renewal of such a relation was the figure in the carpet traceable or describable only for husbands and wivesfor lovers supremely united it came back to me in a mystifying manner that in kensingtonsquare when i told him that corvick would have told the girl he loved some word had dropped from vereker that gave colour to this possibility there might be little in it but there was enough to make me wonder if i should have to marry mrs corvick to get what i wanted was i prepared to offer her this price for the blessing of her knowledge ah that way madness layso i said to myself at least in bewildered hours i could see meanwhile the torch she refused to pass on flame away in her chamber of memorypour through her eyes a light that made a glow in her lonely house at the end of six months i was fully sure of what this warm presence made up to her for we had talked again and again of the man who had brought us together of his talent his character his personal charm his certain career his dreadful doom and even of his clear purpose in that great study which was to have been a supreme literary portrait a kind of critical vandyke or velasquez she had conveyed to me in abundance that she was tonguetied by her perversity by her piety that she would never break the silence it had not been given to the right person as she said to break the hour however finally arrived one evening when i had been sitting with her longer than usual i laid my hand firmly on her arm  now at last what is it  she had been expecting me she was ready she gave a long slow soundless headshake merciful only in being inarticulate this mercy didnt prevent its hurling at me the largest finest coldest never i had yet in the course of a life that had known denials had to take full in the face i took it and was aware that with the hard blow the tears had come into my eyes so for a while we sat and looked at each other after which i slowly rose i was wondering if some day she would accept me but this was not what i brought out i said as i smoothed down my hat i know what to think then its nothing  a remote disdainful pity for me shone out of her dim smile then she exclaimed in a voice that i hear at this moment its my life as i stood at the door she added youve insulted him  do you mean vereker  i meanthe dead  i recognised when i reached the street the justice of her charge yes it was her lifei recognised that too but her life none the less made room with the lapse of time for another interest a year and a half after corvicks death she published in a single volume her second novel overmastered which i pounced on in the hope of finding in it some telltale echo or some peeping face all i found was a much better book than her younger performance showing i thought the better company she had kept as a tissue tolerably intricate it was a carpet with a figure of its own but the figure was not the figure i was looking for on sending a review of it to the middle i was surprised to learn from the office that a notice was already in type when the paper came out i had no hesitation in attributing this article which i thought rather vulgarly overdone to drayton deane who in the old days had been something of a friend of corvicks yet had only within a few weeks made the acquaintance of his widow i had had an early copy of the book but deane had evidently had an earlier he lacked all the same the light hand with which corvick had gilded the gingerbreadhe laid on the tinsel in splotches     x  six months later appeared the right of way the last chance though we didnt know it that we were to have to redeem ourselves written wholly during verekers absence the book had been heralded in a hundred paragraphs by the usual ineptitudes i carried it as early a copy as any i this time flattered myself straightway to mrs corvick this was the only use i had for it i left the inevitable tribute of the middle to some more ingenious mind and some less irritated temper but i already have it gwendolen said drayton deane was so good as to bring it to me yesterday and ive just finished it  yesterday how did he get it so soon  he gets everything soon hes to review it in the middle  hedrayton deanereview vereker i couldnt believe my ears  why not one fine ignorance is as good as another  i winced but i presently said you ought to review him yourself  i dont review she laughed im reviewed  just then the door was thrown open ah yes heres your reviewer drayton deane was there with his long legs and his tall forehead he had come to see what she thought of the right of way and to bring news which was singularly relevant the evening papers were just out with a telegram on the author of that work who in rome had been ill for some days with an attack of malarial fever it had at first not been thought grave but had taken in consequence of complications a turn that might give rise to anxiety anxiety had indeed at the latest hour begun to be felt  i was struck in the presence of these tidings with the fundamental detachment that mrs corvicks public regret quite failed to conceal it gave me the measure of her consummate independence that independence rested on her knowledge the knowledge which nothing now could destroy and which nothing could make different the figure in the carpet might take on another twist or two but the sentence had virtually been written the writer might go down to his grave she was the person in the world to whomas if she had been his favoured heirhis continued existence was least of a need this reminded me how i had observed at a particular momentafter corvicks deaththe drop of her desire to see him face to face she had got what she wanted without that i had been sure that if she hadnt got it she wouldnt have been restrained from the endeavour to sound him personally by those superior reflections more conceivable on a mans part than on a womans which in my case had served as a deterrent it wasnt however i hasten to add that my case in spite of this invidious comparison wasnt ambiguous enough at the thought that vereker was perhaps at that moment dying there rolled over me a wave of anguisha poignant sense of how inconsistently i still depended on him a delicacy that it was my one compensation to suffer to rule me had left the alps and the apennines between us but the vision of the waning opportunity made me feel as if i might in my despair at last have gone to him of course i would really have done nothing of the sort i remained five minutes while my companions talked of the new book and when drayton deane appealed to me for my opinion of it i replied getting up that i detested hugh verekersimply couldnt read him i went away with the moral certainty that as the door closed behind me deane would remark that i was awfully superficial his hostess wouldnt contradict him  i continue to trace with a briefer touch our intensely odd concatenation three weeks after this came verekers death and before the year was out the death of his wife that poor lady i had never seen but i had had a futile theory that should she survive him long enough to be decorously accessible i might approach her with the feeble flicker of my petition did she know and if she knew would she speak it was much to be presumed that for more reasons than one she would have nothing to say but when she passed out of all reach i felt that renouncement was indeed my appointed lot i was shut up in my obsession for evermy gaolers had gone off with the key i find myself quite as vague as a captive in a dungeon about the time that further elapsed before mrs corvick became the wife of drayton deane i had foreseen through my bars this end of the business though there was no indecent haste and our friendship had rather fallen off they were both so awfully intellectual that it struck people as a suitable match but i knew better than any one the wealth of understanding the bride would contribute to the partnership never for a marriage in literary circlesso the newspapers described the alliancehad a bride been so handsomely dowered i began with due promptness to look for the fruit of their unionthat fruit i mean of which the premonitory symptoms would be peculiarly visible in the husband taking for granted the splendour of the ladys nuptial gift i expected to see him make a show commensurate with his increase of means i knew what his means had beenhis article on the right of way had distinctly given one the figure as he was now exactly in the position in which still more exactly i was not i watched from month to month in the likely periodicals for the heavy message poor corvick had been unable to deliver and the responsibility of which would have fallen on his successor the widow and wife would have broken by the rekindled hearth the silence that only a widow and wife might break and deane would be as aflame with the knowledge as corvick in his own hour as gwendolen in hers had been well he was aflame doubtless but the fire was apparently not to become a public blaze i scanned the periodicals in vain drayton deane filled them with exuberant pages but he withheld the page i most feverishly sought he wrote on a thousand subjects but never on the subject of vereker his special line was to tell truths that other people either funked as he said or overlooked but he never told the only truth that seemed to me in these days to signify i met the couple in those literary circles referred to in the papers i have sufficiently intimated that it was only in such circles we were all constructed to revolve gwendolen was more than ever committed to them by the publication of her third novel and i myself definitely classed by holding the opinion that this work was inferior to its immediate predecessor was it worse because she had been keeping worse company if her secret was as she had told me her lifea fact discernible in her increasing bloom an air of conscious privilege that cleverly corrected by pretty charities gave distinction to her appearanceit had yet not a direct influence on her work that only madeeverything only madeone yearn the more for it rounded it off with a mystery finer and subtler     xi  it was therefore from her husband i could never remove my eyes i hovered about him in a manner that might have made him uneasy i went even so far as to engage him in conversation didnt he know hadnt he come into it as a matter of coursethat question hummed in my brain of course he knew otherwise he wouldnt return my stare so queerly his wife had told him what i wanted and he was amiably amused at my impotence he didnt laughhe was not a laugher his system was to present to my irritation so that i should crudely expose myself a conversational blank as vast as his big bare brow it always happened that i turned away with a settled conviction from these unpeopled expanses which seemed to complete each other geographically and to symbolise together drayton deanes want of voice want of form he simply hadnt the art to use what he knew he literally was incompetent to take up the duty where corvick had left it i went still furtherit was the only glimpse of happiness i had i made up my mind that the duty didnt appeal to him he wasnt interested he didnt care yes it quite comforted me to believe him too stupid to have joy of the thing i lacked he was as stupid after as before and that deepened for me the golden glory in which the mystery was wrapped i had of course however to recollect that his wife might have imposed her conditions and exactions i had above all to recollect that with verekers death the major incentive dropped he was still there to be honoured by what might be donehe was no longer there to give it his sanction who alas but he had the authority  two children were born to the pair but the second cost the mother her life after this calamity i seemed to see another ghost of a chance i jumped at it in thought but i waited a certain time for manners and at last my opportunity arrived in a remunerative way his wife had been dead a year when i met drayton deane in the smokingroom of a small club of which we both were members but where for monthsperhaps because i rarely entered iti had not seen him the room was empty and the occasion propitious i deliberately offered him to have done with the matter for ever that advantage for which i felt he had long been looking  as an older acquaintance of your late wifes than even you were i began you must let me say to you something i have on my mind i shall be glad to make any terms with you that you see fit to name for the information she had from george corvickthe information you know that he poor fellow in one of the happiest hours of his life had straight from hugh vereker  he looked at me like a dim phrenological bust the information  verekers secret my dear manthe general intention of his books the string the pearls were strung on the buried treasure the figure in the carpet  he began to flushthe numbers on his bumps to come out verekers books had a general intention  i stared in my turn you dont mean to say you dont know it i thought for a moment he was playing with me mrs deane knew it she had it as i say straight from corvick who had after infinite search and to verekers own delight found the very mouth of the cave where is the mouth he told after their marriageand told alonethe person who when the circumstances were reproduced must have told you have i been wrong in taking for granted that she admitted you as one of the highest privileges of the relation in which you stood to her to the knowledge of which she was after corvicks death the sole depositary all i know is that that knowledge is infinitely precious and what i want you to understand is that if you will in your turn admit me to it you will do me a kindness for which i shall be everlastingly grateful  he had turned at last very red i daresay he had begun by thinking i had lost my wits little by little he followed me on my own side i stared with a livelier surprise i dont know what youre talking about he said  he wasnt actingit was the absurd truth she didnt tell you  nothing about hugh vereker  i was stupefied the room went round it had been too good even for that upon your honour  upon my honour what the devils the matter with you he demanded  im astoundedim disappointed i wanted to get it out of you  it isnt in me he awkwardly laughed and even if it were  if it were youd let me have itoh yes in common humanity but i believe you i seei see i went on conscious with the full turn of the wheel of my great delusion my false view of the poor mans attitude what i saw though i couldnt say it was that his wife hadnt thought him worth enlightening this struck me as strange for a woman who had thought him worth marrying at last i explained it by the reflection that she couldnt possibly have married him for his understanding she had married him for something else he was to some extent enlightened now but he was even more astonished more disconcerted he took a moment to compare my story with his quickened memories the result of his meditation was his presently saying with a good deal of rather feeble form  this is the first i hear of what you allude to i think you must be mistaken as to mrs drayton deanes having had any unmentioned and still less any unmentionable knowledge about hugh vereker she would certainly have wished itif it bore on his literary characterto be used  it was used she used it herself she told me with her own lips that she lived on it  i had no sooner spoken than i repented of my words he grew so pale that i felt as if i had struck him ah lived he murmured turning short away from me  my compunction was real i laid my hand on his shoulder i beg you to forgive meive made a mistake you dont know what i thought you knew you could if i had been right have rendered me a service and i had my reasons for assuming that you would be in a position to meet me  your reasons he asked what were your reasons  i looked at him well i hesitated i considered come and sit down with me here and ill tell you i drew him to a sofa i lighted another cigarette and beginning with the anecdote of verekers one descent from the clouds i gave him an account of the extraordinary chain of accidents that had in spite of it kept me till that hour in the dark i told him in a word just what ive written out here he listened with deepening attention and i became aware to my surprise by his ejaculations by his questions that he would have been after all not unworthy to have been trusted by his wife so abrupt an experience of her want of trust had an agitating effect on him but i saw that immediate shock throb away little by little and then gather again into waves of wonder and curiositywaves that promised i could perfectly judge to break in the end with the fury of my own highest tides i may say that today as victims of unappeased desire there isnt a pin to choose between us the poor mans state is almost my consolation there are indeed moments when i feel it to be almost my revenge  yes indeed i say to myself pen in hand i can keep hold of the thread and let it lead me back to the first impression the little story is all there i can touch it from point to point for the thread as i call it is a row of coloured beads on a string none of the beads are missingat least i think theyre not thats exactly what i shall amuse myself with finding out     glasses     i  i had been all summer working hard in town and then had gone down to folkestone for a blow art was long i felt and my holiday short my mother was settled at folkestone and i paid her a visit when i could i remember how on this occasion after weeks in my stuffy studio with my nose on my palette i sniffed up the clean salt air and cooled my eyes with the purple sea the place was full of lodgings and the lodgings were at that season full of people people who had nothing to do but to stare at one another on the great flat down there were thousands of little chairs and almost as many little jews and there was music in an open rotunda over which the little jews wagged their big noses we all strolled to and fro and took pennyworths of rest the long level clifftop edged in places with its iron rail might have been the deck of a huge crowded ship there were old folks in bath chairs and there was one dear chair creeping to its last full stop by the side of which i always walked there was in fine weather the coast of france to look at and there were the usual things to say about it there was also in every state of the atmosphere our friend mrs meldrum a subject of remark not less inveterate the widow of an officer in the engineers she had settled like many members of the martial miscellany well within sight of the hereditary enemy who however had left her leisure to form in spite of the difference of their years a close alliance with my mother she was the heartiest the keenest the ugliest of women the least apologetic the least morbid in her misfortune she carried it high aloft with loud sounds and free gestures made it flutter in the breeze as if it had been the flag of her country it consisted mainly of a big red face indescribably out of drawing from which she glared at you through goldrimmed aids to vision optic circles of such diameter and so frequently displaced that some one had vividly spoken of her as flattening her nose against the glass of her spectacles she was extraordinarily nearsighted and whatever they did to other objects they magnified immensely the kind eyes behind them blessed conveniences they were in their hideous honest strengththey showed the good lady everything in the world but her own queerness this element was enhanced by wild braveries of dress reckless charges of colour and stubborn resistances of cut wonderous encounters in which the art of the toilet seemed to lay down its life she had the tread of a grenadier and the voice of an angel  in the course of a walk with her the day after my arrival i found myself grabbing her arm with sudden and undue familiarity i had been struck by the beauty of a face that approached us and i was still more affected when i saw the face at the sight of my companion open like a window thrown wide a smile fluttered out of it as brightly as a drapery dropped from a silla drapery shaken there in the sun by a young lady flanked with two young men a wonderful young lady who as we drew nearer rushed up to mrs meldrum with arms flourished for an embrace my immediate impression of her had been that she was dressed in mourning but during the few moments she stood talking with our friend i made more discoveries the figure from the neck down was meagre the stature insignificant but the desire to please towered high as well as the air of infallibly knowing how and of never never missing it this was a little person whom i would have made a high bid for a good chance to paint the head the features the colour the whole facial oval and radiance had a wonderful purity the deep grey eyesthe most agreeable i thought that i had ever seenbrushed with a kind of winglike grace every object they encountered their possessor was just back from boulogne where she had spent a week with dear mrs floydtaylor this accounted for the effusiveness of her reunion with dear mrs meldrum her black garments were of the freshest and daintiest she suggested a pinkandwhite wreath at a showy funeral she confounded us for three minutes with her presence she was a beauty of the great conscious public responsible order the young men her companions gazed at her and grinned i could see there were very few moments of the day at which young men these or others would not be so occupied the people who approached took leave of their manners every one seemed to linger and gape when she brought her face close to mrs meldrumsand she appeared to be always bringing it close to somebodysit was a marvel that objects so dissimilar should express the same general identity the unmistakable character of the english gentlewoman mrs meldrum sustained the comparison with her usual courage but i wondered why she didnt introduce me i should have had no objection to the bringing of such a face close to mine however when the young lady moved on with her escort she herself bequeathed me a sense that some such rapprochement might still occur was this by reason of the general frequency of encounters at folkestone or by reason of a subtle acknowledgment that she contrived to make of the rights on the part of others that such beauty as hers created i was in a position to answer that question after mis meldrum had answered a few of mine     ii  flora saunt the only daughter of an old soldier had lost both her parents her mother within a few months mrs meldrum had known them disapproved of them considerably avoided them she had watched the girl off and on from her early childhood flora just twenty was extraordinarily alone in the worldso alone that she had no natural chaperon no one to stay with but a mercenary stranger mrs hammond synge the sisterinlaw of one of the young men i had just seen she had lots of friends but none of them nice she kept picking up impossible people the floydtaylors with whom she had been at boulogne were simply horrid the hammond synges were perhaps not so vulgar but they had no conscience in their dealings with her  she knows what i think of them said mrs meldrum and indeed she knows what i think of most things  she shares that privilege with most of your friends i replied laughing  no doubt but possibly to some of my friends it makes a little difference that girl doesnt care a button she knows best of all what i think of flora saunt  and what may your opinion be  why that shes not worth talking aboutan idiot too abysmal  doesnt she care for that  just enough as you saw to hug me till i cry out shes too pleased with herself for anything else to matter  surely my dear friend i rejoined she has a good deal to be pleased with  so every one tells her and so you would have told her if i had given you a chance however that doesnt signify either for her vanity is beyond all making or mending she believes in herself and shes welcome after all poor dear having only herself to look to ive seldom met a young woman more completely at liberty to be silly she has a clear courseshell make a showy finish  well i replied as she probably will reduce many persons to the same degraded state her partaking of it wont stand out so much  if you mean that the worlds full of twaddlers i quite agree with you cried mrs meldrum trumpeting her laugh half across the channel  i had after this to consider a little what she would call my mothers son but i didnt let it prevent me from insisting on her making me acquainted with flora saunt indeed i took the bull by the horns urging that she had drawn the portrait of a nature which common charity now demanded that she should put into relation with a character really fine such a frail creature was just an object of pity this contention on my part had at first of course been jocular but strange to say it was quite the ground i found myself taking with regard to our young lady after i had begun to know her i couldnt have said what i felt about her except that she was undefended from the first of my sitting with her there after dinner under the starsthat was a week at folkestone of balmy nights and muffled tides and crowded chairsi became aware both that protection was wholly absent from her life and that she was wholly indifferent to its absence  the odd thing was that she was not appealing she was abjectly divinely conceited absurdly fantastically happy her beauty was as yet all the world to her a world she had plenty to do to live in mrs meldrum told me more about her and there was nothing that as the centre of a group of giggling nudging spectators she was not ready to tell about herself she held her little court in the crowd upon the grass playing her light over jews and gentiles completely at ease in all promiscuities it was an effect of these things that from the very first with every one listening i could mention that my main business with her would be just to have a go at her head and to arrange in that view for an early sitting it would have been as impossible i think to be impertinent to her as it would have been to throw a stone at a plateglass window so any talk that went forward on the basis of her loveliness was the most natural thing in the world and immediately became the most general and sociable it was when i saw all this that i judged how though it was the last thing she asked for what one would ever most have at her service was a curious compassion that sentiment was coloured by the vision of the dire exposure of a being whom vanity had put so off her guard hers was the only vanity i have ever known that made its possessor superlatively soft mrs meldrums further information contributed moreover to these indulgencesher account of the girls neglected childhood and queer continental relegations with straying squabbling montecarlohaunting parents the more invidious picture above all of her pecuniary arrangement still in force with the hammond synges who really though they never took her outpractically she went out alonehad their hands half the time in her pocket she had to pay for everything down to her share of the winebills and the horses fodder down to bertie hammond synges fare in the underground when he went to the city for her she had been left with just money enough to turn her head and it hadnt even been put in trust nothing prudent or proper had been done with it she could spend her capital and at the rate she was going expensive extravagant and with a swarm of parasites to help it certainly wouldnt last very long  couldnt you perhaps take her independent unencumbered as you are i asked of mrs meldrum youre probably with one exception the sanest person she knows and you at least wouldnt scandalously fleece her  how do you know what i wouldnt do my humorous friend demanded of course ive thought how i can help herit has kept me awake at night but i cant help her at all shell take nothing from me you know what she doesshe hugs me and runs away she has an instinct about me she feels that ive one about her and then she dislikes me for another reason that im not quite clear about but that im well aware of and that i shall find out some day so far as her settling with me goes it would be impossible moreover here she wants naturally enough a much wider field she must live in londonher game is there so she takes the line of adoring me of saying she can never forget that i was devoted to her motherwhich i wouldnt for the world have beenand of giving me a wide berth i think she positively dislikes to look at me its all right theres no obligation though people in general cant take their eyes off me  i see that at this moment i replied but what does it matter where or how for the present she lives shell marry infallibly marry early and everything then will change  whom will she marry my companion gloomily asked  any one she likes shes so abnormally pretty she can do anything shell fascinate some nabob or some prince  shell fascinate him first and bore him afterwards moreover shes not so pretty as you make her out she has a scrappy little figure  no doubt but one doesnt in the least notice it  not now said mrs meldrum but one will when shes older  when shes older shell be a princess so it wont matter  she has other drawbacks my companion went on those wonderful eyes are good for nothing but to roll about like sugarballswhich they greatly resemblein a childs mouth she cant use them  use them why she does nothing else  to make fools of young men but not to read or write not to do any sort of work she never opens a book and her maid writes her notes youll say that those who live in glass houses shouldnt throw stones of course i know that if i didnt wear my goggles i shouldnt be good for much  do you mean that miss saunt ought to sport such things i exclaimed with more horror than i meant to show  i dont prescribe for her i dont know that theyre what she requires  whats the matter with her eyes i asked after a moment  i dont exactly know but i heard from her mother years ago that even as a child they had had for a while to put her into spectacles and that though she hated them and had been in a fury of disgust she would always have to be extremely careful im sure i hope she is  i echoed the hope but i remember well the impression this made upon memy immediate pang of resentment a disgust almost equal to floras own i felt as if a great rare sapphire had split in my hand     iii  this conversation occurred the night before i went back to town i settled on the morrow to take a late train so that i had still my morning to spend at folkestone where during the greater part of it i was out with my mother every one in the place was as usual out with some one else and even had i been free to go and take leave of her i should have been sure that flora saunt would not be at home just where she was i presently discovered she was at the far end of the cliff the point at which it overhangs the pretty view of sandgate and hythe her back however was turned to this attraction it rested with the aid of her elbows thrust slightly behind her so that her scanty little shoulders were raised toward her ears on the high rail that inclosed the down two gentlemen stood before her whose faces we couldnt see but who even as observed from the rear were visibly absorbed in the charming figurepiece submitted to them i was freshly struck with the fact that this meagre and defective little person with the cock of her hat and the flutter of her crape with her eternal idleness her eternal happiness her absence of moods and mysteries and the pretty presentation of her feet which especially now in the supported slope of her posture occupied with their imperceptibility so much of the foregroundi was reminded anew i say how our young lady dazzled by some art that the enumeration of her merits didnt explain and that the mention of her lapses didnt affect where she was amiss nothing counted and where she was right everything did i say she was wanting in mystery but that after all was her secret this happened to be my first chance of introducing her to my mother who had not much left in life but the quiet look from under the hood of her chair at the things which when she should have quitted those she loved she could still trust to make the world good for them i wondered an instant how much she might be moved to trust flora saunt and then while the chair stood still and she waited i went over and asked the girl to come and speak to her in this way i saw that if one of floras attendants was the inevitable young hammond synge master of ceremonies of her regular court always offering the use of a telescope and accepting that of a cigar the other was a personage i had not yet encountered a small pale youth in showy knickerbockers whose eyebrows and nose and the glued points of whose little moustache were extraordinarily uplifted and sustained i remember taking him at first for a foreigner and for something of a pretender i scarcely know why unless because of the motive i felt in the stare he fixed on me when i asked miss saunt to come away he struck me a little as a young man practising the social art of impertinence but it didnt matter for flora came away with alacrity bringing all her prettiness and pleasure and gliding over the grass in that rustle of delicate mourning which made the endless variety of her garments as a painter could take heed strike one always as the same obscure elegance she seated herself on the floor of my mothers chair a little too much on her right instep as i afterwards gathered caressing her stiff hand smiling up into her cold face commending and approving her without a reserve and without a doubt she told her immediately as if it were something for her to hold on by that she was soon to sit to me for a likeness and these words gave me a chance to inquire if it would be the fate of the picture should i finish it to be presented to the young man in the knickerbockers her lips at this parted in a stare her eyes darkened to the purple of one of the shadowpatches on the sea she showed for the passing instant the face of some splendid tragic mask and i remembered for the inconsequence of it what mrs meldrum had said about her sight i had derived from this lady a worrying impulse to catechise her but that didnt seem exactly kind so i substituted another question inquired who the pretty young man in knickerbockers might happen to be  oh a gentleman i met at boulogne he has come over to see me after a moment she added hes lord iffield  i had never heard of lord iffield but her mention of his having been at boulogne helped me to give him a niche mrs meldrum had incidentally thrown a certain light on the manners of mrs floydtaylor floras recent hostess in that charming town a lady who it appeared had a special vocation for helping rich young men to find a use for their leisure she had always one or other in hand and she had apparently on this occasion pointed her lesson at the rare creature on the opposite coast i had a vague idea that boulogne was not a resort of the aristocracy at the same time there might very well have been a strong attraction there even for one of the darlings of fortune i could perfectly understand in any case that such a darling should be drawn to folkestone by flora saunt but it was not in truth of these things i was thinking what was uppermost in my mind was a matter which though it had no sort of keeping insisted just then on coming out  is it true miss saunt i suddenly demanded that youre so unfortunate as to have had some warning about your beautiful eyes  i was startled by the effect of my words the girl threw back her head changing colour from brow to chin true who in the world says so i repented of my question in a flash the way she met it made it seem cruel and i saw that my mother looked at me in some surprise i took care in answer to floras challenge not to incriminate mrs meldrum i answered that the rumour had reached me only in the vaguest form and that if i had been moved to put it to the test my very real interest in her must be held responsible her blush died away but a pair of still prettier tears glistened in its track if you ever hear such a thing said again you can say its a horrid lie i had brought on a commotion deeper than any i was prepared for but it was explained in some degree by the next words she uttered im happy to say theres nothing the matter with any part of my body not the least little thing she spoke with her habitual complacency with triumphant assurance she smiled again and i could see that she was already sorry she had shown herself too disconcerted she turned it off with a laugh ive good eyes good teeth a good digestion and a good temper im sound of wind and limb nothing could have been more characteristic than her blush and her tears nothing less acceptable to her than to be thought not perfect in every particular she couldnt submit to the imputation of a flaw i expressed my delight in what she told me assuring her i should always do battle for her and as if to rejoin her companions she got up from her place on my mothers toes the young men presented their backs to us they were leaning on the rail of the cliff our incident had produced a certain awkwardness and while i was thinking of what next to say she exclaimed irrelevantly dont you know hell be lord considine at that moment the youth marked for this high destiny turned round and she went on to my mother ill introduce him to youhes awfully nice she beckoned and invited him with her parasol the movement struck me as taking everything for granted i had heard of lord considine and if i had not been able to place lord iffield it was because i didnt know the name of his eldest son the young man took no notice of miss saunts appeal he only stared a moment and then on her repeating it quietly turned his back she was an odd creature she didnt blush at this she only said to my mother apologetically but with the frankest sweetest amusement you dont mind do you hes a monster of shyness it was as if she were sorry for every onefor lord iffield the victim of a complaint so painful and for my mother the object of a trifling incivility im sure i dont want him said my mother but flora added some remark about the rebuke she would give him for slighting us she would clearly never explain anything by any failure of her own power there rolled over me while she took leave of us and floated back to her friends a wave of tenderness superstitious and silly i seemed somehow to see her go forth to her fate and yet what should fill out this orb of a high destiny if not such beauty and such joy i had a dim idea that lord considine was a great proprietor and though there mingled with it a faint impression that i shouldnt like his son the result of the two images was a whimsical prayer that the girl mightnt miss her possible fortune     iv  one day in the course of the following june there was ushered into my studio a gentleman whom i had not yet seen but with whom i had been very briefly in correspondence a letter from him had expressed to me some days before his regret on learning that my splendid portrait of titras flora louisa saunt whose full name figured by her own wish in the catalogue of the exhibition of the academy had found a purchaser before the close of the private view he took the liberty of inquiring whether i might have at his service some other memorial of the same lovely head some preliminary sketch some study for the picture i had replied that i had indeed painted miss saunt more than once and that if he were interested in my work i should be happy to show him what i had done mr geoffrey dawling the person thus introduced to me stumbled into my room with awkward movements and equivocal soundsa long lean confused confusing young man with a bad complexion and large protrusive teeth he bore in its most indelible pressure the postmark as it were of oxford and as soon as he opened his mouth i perceived in addition to a remarkable revelation of gums that the text of the queer communication matched the registered envelope he was full of refinements and angles of dreary and distinguished knowledge of his unconscious drollery his dress freely partook it seemed from the gold ring into which his red necktie was passed to the square toecaps of his boots to conform with a high sense of modernness to the fashion before the last there were moments when his overdone urbanity all suggestive stammers and interrogative quavers made him scarcely intelligible but i felt him to be a gentleman and i liked the honesty of his errand and the expression of his good green eyes  as a worshipper at the shrine of beauty however he needed explaining especially when i found he had no acquaintance with my brilliant model had on the mere evidence of my picture taken as he said a tremendous fancy to her face i ought doubtless to have been humiliated by the simplicity of his judgment of it a judgment for which the rendering was lost in the subject quite leaving out the element of art he was like the innocent reader for whom the story is really true and the author a negligible quantity he had come to me only because he wanted to purchase and i remember being so amused at his attitude which i had never seen equally marked in a person of education that i asked him why for the sort of enjoyment he desired it wouldnt be more to the point to deal directly with the lady he stared and blushed at this it was plain the idea frightened him he was an extraordinary casepersonally so modest that i could see it had never occurred to him he had fallen in love with a painted sign and seemed content just to dream of what it stood for he was the young prince in the legend or the comedy who loses his heart to the miniature of the outland princess until i knew him better this puzzled me muchthe link was so missing between his sensibility and his type he was of course bewildered by my sketches which implied in the beholder some sense of intention and quality but for one of them a comparative failure he ended by conceiving a preference so arbitrary and so lively that taking no second look at the others he expressed the wish to possess it and fell into the extremity of confusion over the question of the price i simplified that problem and he went off without having asked me a direct question about miss saunt yet with his acquisition under his arm his delicacy was such that he evidently considered his rights to be limited he had acquired none at all in regard to the original of the picture there were othersfor i was curious about himthat i wanted him to feel i conceded i should have been glad of his carrying away a sense of ground acquired for coming back to insure this i had probably only to invite him and i perfectly recall the impulse that made me forbear it operated suddenly from within while he hung about the door and in spite of the diffident appeal that blinked in his gentle grin if he was smitten with floras ghost what mightnt be the direct force of the luminary that could cast such a shadow this source of radiance flooding my poor place might very well happen to be present the next time he should turn up the idea was sharp within me that there were complications it was no mission of mine to bring about if they were to occur they might occur by a logic of their own  let me say at once that they did occur and that i perhaps after all had something to do with it if mr dawling had departed without a fresh appointment he was to reappear six months later under protection no less adequate than that of our young lady herself i had seen her repeatedly for months she had grown to regard my studio as the tabernacle of her face this prodigy was frankly there the sole object of interest in other places there were occasionally other objects the freedom of her manners continued to be stupefying there was nothing so extraordinary save the absence in connection with it of any catastrophe she was kept innocent by her egotism but she was helped also though she had now put off her mourning by the attitude of the lone orphan who had to be a law unto herself it was as a lone orphan that she came and went as a lone orphan that she was the centre of a crush the neglect of the hammond synges gave relief to this character and she paid them handsomely to be as every one said shocking lord iffield had gone to india to shoot tigers but he returned in time for the private view it was he who had snapped up as flora called it the gem of the exhibition  my hope for the girls future had slipped ignominiously off his back but after his purchase of the portrait i tried to cultivate a new faith the girls own faith was wonderful it couldnt however be contagious too great was the limit of her sense of what painters call values her colours were laid on like blankets on a cold night how indeed could a person speak the truth who was always posturing and bragging she was after all vulgar enough and by the time i had mastered her profile and could almost with my eyes shut do it in a single line i was decidedly tired of her perfection there grew to be something silly in its eternal smoothness one moved with her moreover among phenomena mismated and unrelated nothing in her talk ever matched with anything out of it lord iffield was dying of love for her but his family was leading him a life his mother horrid woman had told some one that she would rather he should be swallowed by a tiger than marry a girl not absolutely one of themselves he had given his young friend unmistakable signs but he was lying low gaining time it was in his fathers power to be both in personal and in pecuniary ways excessively nasty to him his father wouldnt last for everquite the contrary and he knew how thoroughly in spite of her youth her beauty and the swarm of her admirers some of them positively threatening in their passion he could trust her to hold out there were richer cleverer men there were greater personages too but she liked her little viscount just as he was and liked to think that bullied and persecuted he had her there so luxuriously to rest upon she came back to me with tale upon tale and it all might be or mightnt i never met my pretty model in the worldshe moved it appeared in exalted circlesand could only admire in her wealth of illustration the grandeur of her life and the freedom of her hand  i had on the first opportunity spoken to her of geoffrey dawling and she had listened to my story so far as she had the art of such patience asking me indeed more questions about him than i could answer then she had capped my anecdote with others much more striking revelations of effects produced in the most extraordinary quarters on people who had followed her into railwaycarriages guards and porters even who had literally stuck there others who had spoken to her in shops and hung about her housedoor cabmen upon her honour in london who to gaze their fill at her had found excuses to thrust their petrifaction through the very glasses of fourwheelers she lost herself in these reminiscences the moral of which was that poor mr dawling was only one of a million when therefore the next autumn she flourished into my studio with her odd companion at her heels her first care was to make clear to me that if he was now in servitude it wasnt because she had run after him dawling hilariously explained that when one wished very much to get anything one usually ended by doing soa proposition which led me wholly to dissent and our young lady to asseverate that she hadnt in the least wished to get mr dawling she mightnt have wished to get him but she wished to show him and i seemed to read that if she could treat him as a trophy her affairs were rather at the ebb true there always hung from her belt a promiscuous fringe of scalps much at any rate would have come and gone since our separation in july she had spent four months abroad where on swiss and italian lakes in german cities in paris many accidents might have happened     v  i had been again with my mother but except mrs meldrum and the gleam of france had not found at folkestone my old resources and pastimes mrs meldrum much edified by my report of the performances as she called them in my studio had told me that to her knowledge flora would soon be on the straw she had cut from her capital such fine fat slices that there was almost nothing more left to swallow perched on her breezy cliff the good lady dazzled me as usual by her universal light she knew so much more about everything and everybody than i could ever squeeze out of my colourtubes she knew that flora was acting on system and absolutely declined to be interfered with her precious reasoning was that her money would last as long as she should need it that a magnificent marriage would crown her charms before she should be really pinched she had a sum put by for a liberal outfit meanwhile the proper use of the rest was to decorate her for the approaches to the altar keep her afloat in the society in which she would most naturally meet her match lord iffield had been seen with her at lucerne at cadenabbia but it was mrs meldrums conviction that nothing was to be expected of him but the most futile flirtation the girl had a certain hold of him but with a great deal of swagger he hadnt the spirit of a sheep he was in fear of his father and would never commit himself in lord considines lifetime the most flora might achieve would be that he wouldnt marry some one else geoffrey dawling to mrs meldrums knowledge i had told her of the young mans visit had attached himself on the way back from italy to the hammond synge group my informant was in a position to be definite about this dangler she knew about his people she had heard of him before hadnt he been at oxford a friend of one of her nephews hadnt he spent the christmas holidays precisely three years before at her brotherinlaws in yorkshire taking that occasion to get himself refused with derision by wilful betty the second daughter of the house her sister who liked the floundering youth had written to her to complain of betty and that the young man should now turn up as an appendage of floras was one of those oftcited proofs that the world is small and that there are not enough people to go round his father had been something or other in the treasury his grandfather on the mothers side had been something or other in the church he had come into the paternal estate two or three thousand a year in hampshire but he had let the place advantageously and was generous to four ugly sisters who lived at bournemouth and adored him the family was hideous all round but the salt of the earth he was supposed to be unspeakably clever he was fond of london fond of books of intellectual society and of the idea of a political career that such a man should be at the same time fond of flora saunt attested as the phrase in the first volume of gibbon has it the variety of his inclinations i was soon to learn that he was fonder of her than of all the other things together betty one of five and with views above her station was at any rate felt at home to have dished herself by her perversity of course no one had looked at her since and no one would ever look at her again it would be eminently desirable that flora should learn the lesson of bettys fate  i was not struck i confess with all this in my mind by any symptoms on our young ladys part of that sort of meditation the only moral she saw in anything was that of her incomparable countenance which mr dawling smitten even like the railway porters and the cabmen by the doomdealing gods had followed from london to venice and from venice back to london again i afterwards learned that her version of this episode was profusely inexact his personal acquaintance with her had been determined by an accident remarkable enough i admit in connection with what had gone beforea coincidence at all events superficially striking at munich returning from a tour in the tyrol with two of his sisters he had found himself at the table dhôte of his inn opposite to the full presentment of that face of which the mere clumsy copy had made him dream and desire he had been tossed by it to a height so vertiginous as to involve a retreat from the table but the next day he had dropped with a resounding thud at the very feet of his apparition on the following with an equal incoherence a sacrifice even of his bewildered sisters whom he left behind he made an heroic effort to escape by flight from a fate of which he already felt the cold breath that fate in london very little later drove him straight before itdrove him one sunday afternoon in the rain to the door of the hammond synges he marched in other words close up to the cannon that was to blow him to pieces but three weeks when he reappeared to me had elapsed since then yet to vary my metaphor the burden he was to carry for the rest of his days was firmly lashed to his back i dont mean by this that flora had been persuaded to contract her scope i mean that he had been treated to the unconditional snub which as the event was to show couldnt have been bettered as a means of securing him she hadnt calculated but she had said never and that word had made a bed big enough for his longlegged patience he became from this moment to my mind the interesting figure in the piece  now that he had acted without my aid i was free to show him this and having on his own side something to show me he repeatedly knocked at my door what he brought with him on these occasions was a simplicity so huge that as i turn my ear to the past i seem even now to hear it bumping up and down my stairs that was really what i saw of him in the light of his behaviour he had fallen in love as he might have broken his leg and the fracture was of a sort that would make him permanently lame it was the whole man who limped and lurched with nothing of him left in the same position as before the tremendous cleverness the literary society the political ambition the bournemouth sisters all seemed to flop with his every movement a little nearer to the floor i hadnt had an oxford training and i had never encountered the great man at whose feet poor dawling had most submissively sat and who had addressed him his most destructive sniffs but i remember asking myself if such privileges had been an indispensable preparation to the career on which my friend appeared now to have embarked i remember too making up my mind about the cleverness which had its uses and i suppose in impenetrable shades even its critics but from which the friction of mere personal intercourse was not the sort of process to extract a revealing spark he accepted without a question both his fever and his chill and the only thing he showed any subtlety about was this convenience of my friendship he doubtless told me his simple story but the matter comes back to me in a kind of sense of my being rather the mouthpiece of my having had to thresh it out for him he took it from me without a groan and i gave it to him as we used to say pretty hot he took it again and again spending his odd halfhours with me as if for the very purpose of learning how idiotically he was in love he told me i made him see things to begin with hadnt i first made him see flora saunt i wanted him to give her up and luminously informed him why on which he never protested nor contradicted never was even so alembicated as to declare just for the sake of the drama that he wouldnt he simply and undramatically didnt and when at the end of three months i asked him what was the use of talking with such a fellow his nearest approach to a justification was to say that what made him want to help her was just the deficiencies i dwelt on i could only reply without pointing the moral oh if youre as sorry for her as that i too was nearly as sorry for her as that but it only led me to be sorrier still for other victims of this compassion with dawling as with me the compassion was at first in excess of any visible motive so that when eventually the motive was supplied each could to a certain extent compliment the other on the fineness of his foresight  after he had begun to haunt my studio miss saunt quite gave it up and i finally learned that she accused me of conspiring with him to put pressure on her to marry him she didnt know i would take it that way else she wouldnt have brought him to see me it was in her view a part of the conspiracy that to show him a kindness i asked him at last to sit to me i daresay moreover she was disgusted to hear that i had ended by attempting almost as many sketches of his beauty as i had attempted of hers what was the value of tributes to beauty by a hand that luxuriated in ugliness my relation to poor dawlings want of modelling was simple enough i was really digging in that sandy desert for the buried treasure of his soul     vi  it befell at this period just before christmas that on my having gone under pressure of the season into a great shop to buy a toy or two my eye fleeing from superfluity lighted at a distance on the bright concretion of flora saunt an exhibitability that held its own even against the most plausible pinkness of the most developed dolls a huge quarter of the place the biggest bazaar on earth was peopled with these and other effigies and fantasies as well as with purchasers and vendors haggard alike in the blaze of the gas with hesitations i was just about to appeal to flora to avert that stage of my errand when i saw that she was accompanied by a gentleman whose identitythough more than a year had elapsed came back to me from the folkestone cliff it had been associated in that scene with showy knickerbockers at present it overflowed more splendidly into a furtrimmed overcoat lord iffields presence made me waver an instant before crossing over and during that instant flora blank and undistinguishing as if she too were after all weary of alternatives looked straight across at me i was on the point of raising my hat to her when i observed that her face gave no sign i was exactly in the line of her vision but she either didnt see me or didnt recognise me or else had a reason to pretend she didnt was her reason that i had displeased her and that she wished to punish me i had always thought it one of her merits that she wasnt vindictive she at any rate simply looked away and at this moment one of the shopgirls who had apparently gone off in search of it bustled up to her with a small mechanical toy it so happened that i followed closely what then took place afterwards recognising that i had been led to do so led even through the crowd to press nearer for the purpose by an impression of which in the act i was not fully conscious  flora with the toy in her hand looked round at her companion then seeing his attention had been solicited in another quarter she moved away with the shopgirl who had evidently offered to conduct her into the presence of more objects of the same sort when she reached the indicated spot i was in a position still to observe her she had asked some question about the working of the toy and the girl taking it herself began to explain the little secret flora bent her head over it but she clearly didnt understand i saw her in a manner that quickened my curiosity give a glance back at the place from which she had come lord iffield was talking with another young person she satisfied herself of this by the aid of a question addressed to her own attendant she then drew closer to the table near which she stood and turning her back to me bent her head lower over the collection of toys and more particularly over the small object the girl had attempted to explain she took it back and after a moment with her face well averted made an odd motion of her arms and a significant little duck of her head these slight signs singular as it may appear produced in my bosom an agitation so great that i failed to notice lord iffields whereabouts he had rejoined her he was close upon her before i knew it or before she knew it herself i felt at that instant the strangest of all impulses if it could have operated more rapidly it would have caused me to dash between them in some such manner as to give flora a warning in fact as it was i think i could have done this in time had i not been checked by a curiosity stronger still than my impulse there were three seconds during which i saw the young man and yet let him come on didnt i make the quick calculation that if he didnt catch what flora was doing i too might perhaps not catch it she at any rate herself took the alarm on perceiving her companions nearness she made still averted another duck of her head and a shuffle of her hands so precipitate that a little tin steamboat she had been holding escaped from them and rattled down to the floor with a sharpness that i hear at this hour lord iffield had already seized her arm with a violent jerk he brought her round toward him then it was that there met my eyes a quite distressing sight this exquisite creature blushing glaring exposed with a pair of big blackrimmed eyeglasses defacing her by their position crookedly astride of her beautiful nose she made a grab at them with her free hand while i turned confusedly away     vii  i dont remember how soon it was i spoke to geoffrey dawling his sittings were irregular but it was certainly the very next time he gave me one  has any rumour ever reached you of miss saunts having anything the matter with her eyes he stared with a candour that was a sufficient answer to my question backing it up with a shocked and mystified never then i asked him if he had observed in her any symptom however disguised of embarrassed sight on which after a moments thought he exclaimed disguised as if my use of that word had vaguely awakened a train shes not a bit myopic he said she doesnt blink or contract her lids i fully recognised this and i mentioned that she altogether denied the impeachment owing it to him moreover to explain the ground of my inquiry i gave him a sketch of the incident that had taken place before me at the shop he knew all about lord iffield that nobleman had figured freely in our conversation as his preferred his injurious rival poor dawlings contention was that if there had been a definite engagement between his lordship and the young lady the sort of thing that was announced in the morning post renunciation and retirement would be comparatively easy to him but that having waited in vain for any such assurance he was entitled to act as if the door were not really closed or were at any rate not cruelly locked he was naturally much struck with my anecdote and still more with my interpretation of it  there is something there is somethingpossibly something very grave certainly something that requires she should make use of artificial aids she wont admit it publicly because with her idolatry of her beauty the feeling she is all made up of she sees in such aids nothing but the humiliation and the disfigurement she has used them in secret but that is evidently not enough for the affection she suffers from apparently some definite ailment has lately grown much worse she looked straight at me in the shop which was violently lighted without seeing it was i at the same distance at folkestone where as you know i first met her where i heard this mystery hinted at and where she indignantly denied the thing she appeared easily enough to recognise people at present she couldnt really make out anything the shopgirl showed her she has successfully concealed from the man i saw her with that she resorts in private to a pincenez and that she does so not only under the strictest orders from an oculist but because literally the poor thing cant accomplish without such help half the business of life iffield however has suspected something and his suspicions whether expressed or kept to himself have put him on the watch i happened to have a glimpse of the movement at which he pounced on her and caught her in the act  i had thought it all out my idea explained many things and dawling turned pale as he listened to me  was he rough with her he anxiously asked  how can i tell what passed between them i fled from the place  my companion stared at me a moment do you mean to say her eyesights going  heaven forbid in that case how could she take life as she does  how does she take life thats the question he sat there bewilderedly brooding the tears had come into his eyes they reminded me of those i had seen in floras the day i risked my inquiry the question he had asked was one that to my own satisfaction i was ready to answer but i hesitated to let him hear as yet all that my reflections had suggested i was indeed privately astonished at their ingenuity for the present i only rejoined that it struck me she was playing a particular game at which he went on as if he hadnt heard me suddenly haunted with a fear lost in the dark possibility i had opened up do you mean theres a danger of anything very bad my dear fellow you must ask her oculist who in the world is her oculist i havent a conception but we mustnt get too excited my impression would be that she has only to observe a few ordinary rules to exercise a little common sense  dawling jumped at this i seeto stick to the pincenez  to follow to the letter her oculists prescription whatever it is and at whatever cost to her prettiness its not a thing to be trifled with  upon my honour it shant be trifled with he roundly declared and he adjusted himself to his position again as if we had quite settled the business after a considerable interval while i botched away he suddenly said did they make a great difference  a great difference  those things she had put on  oh the glassesin her beauty she looked queer of course but it was partly because one was unaccustomed there are women who look charming in nippers what at any rate if she does look queer she must be mad not to accept that alternative  she is mad said geoffrey dawling  mad to refuse you i grant besides i went on the pincenez which was a large and peculiar one was all awry she had half pulled it off but it continued to stick and she was crimson she was angry  it must have been horrible my companion murmured  it was horrible but its still more horrible to defy all warnings its still more horrible to be landed in without saying in what i disgustedly shrugged my shoulders  after a glance at me dawling jerked round then you do believe that she may be  i hesitated the thing would be to make her believe it she only needs a good scare  but if that fellow is shocked at the precautions she does take  oh who knows i rejoined with small sincerity i dont suppose iffield is absolutely a brute  i would take her with leather blinders like a shying mare cried geoffrey dawling  i had an impression that iffield wouldnt but i didnt communicate it for i wanted to pacify my friend whom i had discomposed too much for the purposes of my sitting i recollect that i did some good work that morning but it also comes back to me that before we separated he had practically revealed to me that my anecdote connecting itself in his mind with a series of observations at the time unconscious and unregistered had covered with light the subject of our colloquy he had had a formless perception of some secret that drove miss saunt to subterfuges and the more he thought of it the more he guessed this secret to be the practice of making believe she saw when she didnt and of cleverly keeping people from finding out how little she saw when one patched things together it was astonishing what ground they covered just as he was going away he asked me from what source at folkestone the horrid tale had proceeded when i had given him as i saw no reason not to do the name of mrs meldrum he exclaimed oh i know all about her shes a friend of some friends of mine at this i remembered wilful betty and said to myself that i knew some one who would probably prove more wilful still     viii  a few days later i again heard dawling on my stairs and even before he passed my threshold i knew he had something to tell me  ive been down to folkestoneit was necessary i should see her i forget whether he had come straight from the station he was at any rate out of breath with his news which it took me however a minute to interpret  you mean that youve been with mrs meldrum  yes to ask her what she knows and how she comes to know it it worked upon me awfullyi mean what you told me he made a visible effort to seem quieter than he was and it showed me sufficiently that he had not been reassured i laid to comfort him and smiling at a venture a friendly hand on his arm and he dropped into my eyes fixing them an instant a strange distended look which might have expressed the cold clearness of all that was to come i knownow he said with an emphasis he rarely used  what then did mrs meldrum tell you  only one thing that signified for she has no real knowledge but that one thing was everything  what is it then  why that she cant bear the sight of her his pronouns required some arranging but after i had successfully dealt with them i replied that i knew perfectly miss saunt had a trick of turning her back on the good lady of folkestone but what did that prove have you never guessed i guessed as soon as she spoke dawling towered over me in dismal triumph it was the first time in our acquaintance that intellectually speaking this had occurred but even so remarkable an incident still left me sufficiently at sea to cause him to continue why the effect of those spectacles  i seemed to catch the tail of his idea mrs meldrums  theyre so awfully ugly and they increase so the dear womans ugliness this remark began to flash a light and when he quickly added she sees herself she sees her own fate my response was so immediate that i had almost taken the words out of his mouth while i tried to fix this sudden image of floras face glazed in and crossbarred even as mrs meldrums was glazed and barred he went on to assert that only the horror of that image looming out at herself could be the reason of her avoiding such a monitress the fact he had encountered made everything hideously vivid and more vivid than anything else that just such another pair of goggles was what would have been prescribed to flora  i seei see i presently rejoined what would become of lord iffield if she were suddenly to come out in them what indeed would become of every one what would become of everything this was an inquiry that dawling was evidently unprepared to meet and i completed it by saying at last my dear fellow for that matter what would become of you  once more he turned on me his good green eyes oh i shouldnt mind  the tone of his words somehow made his ugly face beautiful and i felt that there dated from this moment in my heart a confirmed affection for him none the less at the same time perversely and rudely i became aware of a certain drollery in our discussion of such alternatives it made me laugh out and say to him while i laughed youd take her even with those things of mrs meldrums  he remained mournfully grave i could see that he was surprised at my rude mirth but he summoned back a vision of the lady at folkestone and conscientiously replied even with those things of mrs meldrums i begged him not to think my laughter in bad taste it was only a practical recognition of the fact that we had built a monstrous castle in the air didnt he see on what flimsy ground the structure rested the evidence was preposterously small he believed the worst but we were utterly ignorant  i shall find out the truth he promptly replied  how can you if you question her youll simply drive her to perjure herself wherein after all does it concern you to know the truth its the girls own affair  then why did you tell me your story  i was a trifle embarrassed to warn you off i returned smiling he took no more notice of these words than presently to remark that lord iffield had no serious intentions very possibly i said but you mustnt speak as if lord iffield and you were her only alternatives  dawling thought a moment wouldnt the people she has consulted give some information she must have been to people how else can she have been condemned  condemned to what condemned to perpetual nippers of course she has consulted some of the big specialists but she has done it you may be sure in the most clandestine manner and even if it were supposable that they would tell you anythingwhich i altogether doubtyou would have great difficulty in finding out which men they are therefore leave it alone never show her what you suspect  i even before he quitted me asked him to promise me this all right i promise he said gloomily enough he was a lover who could tacitly grant the proposition that there was no limit to the deceit his loved one was ready to practise it made so remarkably little difference i could see that from this moment he would be filled with a passionate pity ever so little qualified by a sense of the girls fatuity and folly she was always accessible to himthat i knew for if she had told him he was an idiot to dream she could dream of him she would have resented the imputation of having failed to make it clear that she would always be glad to regard him as a friend what were most of her friendswhat were all of thembut repudiated idiots i was perfectly aware that in her conversations and confidences i myself for instance had a niche in the gallery as regards poor dawling i knew how often he still called on the hammond synges it was not there but under the wing of the floydtaylors that her intimacy with lord iffield most flourished at all events when a week after the visit i have just summarised floras name was one morning brought up to me i jumped at the conclusion that dawling had been with her and even i fear briefly entertained the thought that he had broken his word     ix  she left me after she had been introduced in no suspense about her present motive she was on the contrary in a visible fever to enlighten me but i promptly learned that for the alarm with which she pitiably panted our young man was not accountable she had but one thought in the world and that thought was for lord iffield i had the strangest saddest scene with her and if it did me no other good it at least made me at last completely understand why insidiously from the first she had struck me as a creature of tragedy in showing me the whole of her folly it lifted the curtain of her misery i dont know how much she meant to tell me when she camei think she had had plans of elaborate misrepresentation at any rate she found it at the end of ten minutes the simplest way to break down and sob to be wretched and true when she had once begun to let herself go the movement took her off her feet the relief of it was like the cessation of a cramp she shared in a word her long secret she shifted her sharp pain she brought i confess tears to my own eyes tears of helpless tenderness for her helpless poverty her visit however was not quite so memorable in itself as in some of its consequences the most immediate of which was that i went that afternoon to see geoffrey dawling who had in those days rooms in welbeck street where i presented myself at an hour late enough to warrant the supposition that he might have come in he had not come in but he was expected and i was invited to enter and wait for him a lady i was informed was already in his sittingroom i hesitated a little at a loss it had wildly coursed through my brain that the lady was perhaps flora saunt but when i asked if she were young and remarkably pretty i received so significant a no sir that i risked an advance and after a minute in this manner found myself to my astonishment face to face with mrs meldrum oh you dear thing she exclaimed im delighted to see you you spare me another compromising démarche but for this i should have called on you also know the worst at once if you see me here its at least deliberateits planned plotted shameless i came up on purpose to see him upon my word im in love with him why if you valued my peace of mind did you let him the other day at folkestone dawn upon my delighted eyes i took there in half an hour the most extraordinary fancy to him with a perfect sense of everything that can be urged against him i find him none the less the very pearl of men however i havent come up to declare my passionive come to bring him news that will interest him much more above all ive come to urge upon him to be careful  about flora saunt  about what he says and does he must be as still as a mouse shes at last really engaged  but its a tremendous secret i was moved to merriment  precisely she telegraphed me this noon and spent another shilling to tell me that not a creature in the world is yet to know it  she had better have spent it to tell you that she had just passed an hour with the creature you see before you  she has just passed an hour with every one in the place mrs meldrum cried theyve vital reasons she wired for its not coming out for a month then it will be formally announced but meanwhile her happiness is delirious i daresay mr dawling already knows and he may as its nearly seven oclock have jumped off london bridge but an effect of the talk i had with him the other day was to make me on receipt of my telegram feel it to be my duty to warn him in person against taking action as it were on the horrid certitude which i could see he carried away with him i had added somehow to that certitude he told me what you had told him you had seen in your shop  mrs meldrum i perceived had come to welbeck street on an errand identical with my owna circumstance indicating her rare sagacity inasmuch as her ground for undertaking it was a very different thing from what floras wonderful visit had made of mine i remarked to her that what i had seen in the shop was sufficiently striking but that i had seen a great deal more that morning in my studio in short i said ive seen everything  she was mystified everything  the poor creature is under the darkest of clouds oh she came to triumph but she remained to talk something approaching to sense she put herself completely in my handsshe does me the honour to intimate that of all her friends im the most disinterested after she had announced to me that lord iffield was bound hands and feet and that for the present i was absolutely the only person in the secret she arrived at her real business she had had a suspicion of me ever since the day at folkestone i asked her for the truth about her eyes the truth is what you and i both guessed she has no end of a danger hanging over her  but from what cause i who by gods mercy have kept mine know everything that can be known about eyes said mrs meldrum  she might have kept hers if she had profited by gods mercy if she had done in time done years ago what was imperatively ordered her if she hadnt in fine been cursed with the loveliness that was to make her behaviour a thing of fable she may keep them still if shell sacrificeand after all so littlethat purely superficial charm she must do as youve done she must wear dear lady what you wear  what my companion wore glittered for the moment like a melonframe in august heaven forgive hernow i understand she turned pale  but i wasnt afraid of the effect on her good nature of her thus seeing through her great goggles why it had always been that flora held her at such a distance i cant tell you i said from what special affection what state of the eye her danger proceeds thats the one thing she succeeded this morning in keeping from me she knows it herself perfectly she has had the best advice in europe its a thing thats awful simply awfulthat was the only account she would give me year before last while she was at boulogne she went for three days with mrs floydtaylor to paris she there surreptitiously consulted the greatest maneven mrs floydtaylor doesnt know last autumn in germany she did the same first put on certain special spectacles with a straight bar in the middle then well talkthats practically what they say what she says is that shell put on anything in nature when shes married but that she must get married first she has always meant to do everything as soon as shes married then and then only shell be safe how will any one ever look at her if she makes herself a fright how could she ever have got engaged if she had made herself a fright from the first its no use to insist that with her beauty she can never be a fright she said to me this morning poor girl the most characteristic the most harrowing things my face is all i haveand such a face i knew from the first i could do anything with it but i needed it alli need it still every exquisite inch of it it isnt as if i had a figure or anything else oh if god had only given me a figure too i dont say yes with a figure a really good one like fanny floydtaylors whos hideous id have risked plain glasses que voulezvous no one is perfect she says she still has money left but i dont believe a word of it she has been speculating on her impunity on the idea that her danger would hold off she has literally been running a race with it her theory has been as you from the first so clearly saw that shed get in ahead she swears to me that though the bar is too cruel she wears when shes alone what she has been ordered to wear but when the deuce is she alone its herself of course that she has swindled worst she has put herself off so insanely that even her vanity but half accounts for it with little inadequate concessions little false measures and preposterous evasions and childish hopes her great terror is now that iffield who already has suspicions who has found out her pincenez but whom she has beguiled with some unblushing hocuspocus may discover the dreadful facts and the essence of what she wanted this morning was in that interest to square me to get me to deny indignantly and authoritatively for isnt she my favourite sitter that she has anything whatever the matter with any part of her she sobbed she went on she entreated after we got talking her extraordinary nerve left her and she showed me what she has been throughshowed me also all her terror of the harm i could do her wait till im married wait till im married she took hold of me she almost sank on her knees it seems to me highly immoral ones participation in her fraud but theres no doubt that she must be married i dont know what i dont see behind it therefore i wound up dawling must keep his hands off  mrs meldrum had held her breath she exhaled a long moan well thats exactly what i came here to tell him  then here he is our unconscious host had just opened the door immensely startled at finding us he turned a frightened look from one to the other as if to guess what disaster we were there to announce or avert  mrs meldrum on the spot was all gaiety ive come to return your sweet visit ah she laughed i mean to keep up the acquaintance  dodo he murmured mechanically and absently continuing to look at us then abruptly he broke out hes going to marry her  i was surprised you already know  he had had in his hand an evening newspaper he tossed it down on the table its in that  publishedalready i was still more surprised  oh flora cant keep a secret mrs meldrum humorously declared she went up to poor dawling and laid a motherly hand upon him its all rightits just as it ought to be dont think about her ever any more then as he met this adjuration with a dismal stare in which the thought of her was as abnormally vivid as the colour of the pupil the excellent woman put up her funny face and tenderly kissed him on the cheek     x  i have spoken of these reminiscences as of a row of coloured beads and i confess that as i continue to straighten out my chaplet i am rather proud of the comparison the beads are all there as i saidthey slip along the string in their small smooth roundness geoffrey dawling accepted like a gentleman the event his evening paper had proclaimed in view of which i snatched a moment to murmur him a hint to offer mrs meldrum his hand he returned me a heavy headshake and i judged that marriage would henceforth strike him very much as the traffic of the street may strike some poor incurable at the window of an hospital circumstances arising at this time promptly led to my making an absence from england and circumstances already existing offered him a solid basis for similar action he had after all the usual resource of a britonhe could take to his boats  he started on a journey round the globe and i was left with nothing but my inference as to what might have happened later observation however only confirmed my belief that if at any time during the couple of months that followed flora saunts brilliant engagement he had made up as they say to the good lady of folkestone that good lady would not have pushed him over the cliff strange as she was to behold i knew of cases in which she had been obliged to administer that shove i went to new york to paint a couple of portraits but i found once on the spot that i had counted without chicago where i was invited to blot out this harsh discrimination by the production of no less than ten i spent a year in america and should probably have spent a second had i not been summoned back to england by alarming news from my mother her strength had failed and as soon as i reached london i hurried down to folkestone arriving just at the moment to offer a welcome to some slight symptom of a rally she had been much worse but she was now a little better and though i found nothing but satisfaction in having come to her i saw after a few hours that my london studio where arrears of work had already met me would be my place to await whatever might next occur before returning to town however i had every reason to sally forth in search of mrs meldrum from whom in so many months i had not had a line and my view of whom with the adjacent objects as i had left them had been intercepted by a luxuriant foreground  before i had gained her house i met her as i supposed coming toward me across the down greeting me from afar with the familiar twinkle of her great vitreous badge and as it was late in the autumn and the esplanade was a blank i was free to acknowledge this signal by cutting a caper on the grass my enthusiasm dropped indeed the next moment for it had taken me but a few seconds to perceive that the person thus assaulted had by no means the figure of my military friend i felt a shock much greater than any i should have thought possible as on this persons drawing near i identified her as poor little flora saunt at what moment flora had recognised me belonged to an order of mysteries over which it quickly came home to me one would never linger again i could intensely reflect that once we were face to face it chiefly mattered that i should succeed in looking still more intensely unastonished all i saw at first was the big gold bar crossing each of her lenses over which something convex and grotesque like the eyes of a large insect something that now represented her whole personality seemed as out of the orifice of a prison to strain forward and press the face had shrunk away it looked smaller appeared even to look plain it was at all events so far as the effect on a spectator was concerned wholly sacrificed to this huge apparatus of sight there was no smile in it and she made no motion to take my offered hand  i had no idea you were down here i exclaimed and i wondered whether she didnt know me at all or knew me only by my voice  you thought i was mrs meldrum she very quietly remarked  it was the quietness itself that made me feel the necessity of an answer almost violently gay oh yes i laughed you have a tremendous deal in common with mrs meldrum ive just returned to england after a long absence and im on my way to see her wont you come with me it struck me that her old reason for keeping clear of our friend was well disposed of now  ive just left her im staying with her she stood solemnly fixing me with her goggles would you like to paint me now she asked she seemed to speak with intense gravity from behind a mask or a cage  there was nothing to do but to treat the question with the same exuberance it would be a fascinating little artistic problem that something was wrong it was not difficult to perceive but a good deal more than met the eye might be presumed to be wrong if flora was under mrs meldrums roof i had not for a year had much time to think of her but my imagination had had sufficient warrant for lodging her in more gilded halls one of the last things i had heard before leaving england was that in commemoration of the new relationship she had gone to stay with lady considine this had made me take everything else for granted and the noisy american world had deafened my ears to possible contradictions her spectacles were at present a direct contradiction they seemed a negation not only of new relationships but of every old one as well i remember nevertheless that when after a moment she walked beside me on the grass i found myself nervously hoping she wouldnt as yet at any rate tell me anything very dreadful so that to stave off this danger i harried her with questions about mrs meldrum and without waiting for replies became profuse on the subject of my own doings my companion was completely silent and i felt both as if she were watching my nervousness with a sort of sinister irony and as if i were talking to some different strange person flora plain and obscure and soundless was no flora at all at mrs meldrums door she turned off with the observation that as there was certainly a great deal i should have to say to our friend she had better not go in with me i looked at her againi had been keeping my eyes away from herbut only to meet her magnified stare i greatly desired in truth to see mrs meldrum alone but there was something so pitiful in the girls predicament that i hesitated to fall in with this idea of dropping her yet one couldnt express a compassion without seeming to take too much wretchedness for granted i reflected that i must really figure to her as a fool which was an entertainment i had never expected to give her it rolled over me there for the first timeit has come back to me sincethat there is strangely in very deep misfortune a dignity finer even than in the most inveterate habit of being all right i couldnt have to her the manner of treating it as a mere detail that i was face to face with a part of what at our last meeting we had had such a scene about but while i was trying to think of some manner that i could have she said quite colourlessly yet somehow as if she might never see me again goodbye im going to take my walk  all alone  she looked round the great bleak clifftop with whom should i go besides i like to be alonefor the present  this gave me the glimmer of a vision that she regarded her disfigurement as temporary and the confidence came to me that she would never for her happiness cease to be a creature of illusions it enabled me to exclaim smiling brightly and feeling indeed idiotic oh i shall see you again but i hope youll have a very pleasant walk  all my walks are very pleasant thank youthey do me such a lot of good she was as quiet as a mouse and her words seemed to me stupendous in their wisdom i take several a day she continued she might have been an ancient woman responding with humility at the church door to the patronage of the parson the more i take the better i feel im ordered by the doctors to keep all the while in the air and go in for plenty of exercise it keeps up my general health you know and if that goes on improving as it has lately done everything will soon be all right all that was the matter with me beforeand always it was too recklesswas that i neglected my general health it acts directly on the state of the particular organ so im going three miles  i grinned at her from the doorstep while mrs meldrums maid stood there to admit me oh im so glad i said looking at her as she paced away with the pretty flutter she had kept and remembering the day when while she rejoined lord iffield i had indulged in the same observation her air of assurance was on this occasion not less than it had been on that but i recalled that she had then struck me as marching off to her doom was she really now marching away from it     xi  as soon as i saw mrs meldrum i broke out to her is there anything in it is her general health  mrs meldrum interrupted me with her great amused blare youve already seen her and she has told you her wondrous tale whats in it is what has been in everything she has ever donethe most comical tragical belief in herself she thinks shes doing a cure  and what does her husband think  her husband what husband  hasnt she then married lord iffield  vousenêtes là cried my hostess he behaved like a regular beast  how should i know you never wrote to me  mrs meldrum hesitated covering me with what poor flora called the particular organ no i didnt write to you and i abstained on purpose if i didnt i thought you mightnt over there hear what had happened if you should hear i was afraid you would stir up mr dawling  stir him up  urge him to fly to the rescue write out to him that there was another chance for him  i wouldnt have done it i said  well mrs meldrum replied it was not my business to give you an opportunity  in short you were afraid of it  again she hesitated and though it may have been only my fancy i thought she considerably reddened at all events she laughed out then i was afraid of it she very honestly answered  but doesnt he know has he given no sign  every sign in lifehe came straight back to her he did everything to get her to listen to him but she hasnt the smallest idea of it  has he seen her as she is now i presently and just a trifle awkwardly inquired  indeed he has and borne it like a hero he told me all about it  how much youve all been through i ventured to ejaculate then what has become of him  hes at home in hampshire he has got back his old place and i believe by this time his old sisters its not half a bad little place  yet its attractions say nothing to flora  oh floras by no means on her back my interlocutress laughed  shes not on her back because shes on yours have you got her for the rest of your life  once more my hostess genially glared at me did she tell you how much the hammond synges have kindly left her to live on not quite eighty pounds a year  thats a good deal but it wont pay the oculist what was it that at last induced her to submit to him  her general collapse after that brute of an iffields rupture she cried her eyes outshe passed through a horror of black darkness then came a gleam of light and the light appears to have broadened she went into goggles as repentant magdalens go into the catholic church  yet you dont think shell be saved  she thinks she willthats all i can tell you theres no doubt that when once she brought herself to accept her real remedy as she calls it she began to enjoy a relief that she had never known that feeling very new and in spite of what she pays for it most refreshing has given her something to hold on by begotten in her foolish little mind a belief that as she says shes on the mend and that in the course of time if she leads a tremendously healthy life shell be able to take off her muzzle and become as dangerous again as ever it keeps her going  and what keeps you youre good until the parties begin again  oh she doesnt object to me now smiled mrs meldrum im going to take her abroad we shall be a pretty pair i was struck with this energy and after a moment i inquired the reason of it its to divert her mind my friend replied reddening again i thought a little we shall go next week ive only waited to start to see how your mother would be i expressed to her hereupon my sense of her extraordinary merit and also that of the inconceivability of floras fancying herself still in a situation not to jump at the chance of marrying a man like dawling she says hes too ugly she says hes too dreary she says in fact hes nobody mrs meldrum pursued she says above all that hes not her own sort she doesnt deny that hes good but she insists on the fact that hes grotesque hes quite the last person she would ever dream of i was almost disposed on hearing this to protest that if the girl had so little proper feeling her noble suitor had perhaps served her right but after a while my curiosity as to just how her noble suitor had served her got the better of that emotion and i asked a question or two which led my companion again to apply to him the invidious epithet i have already quoted what had happened was simply that flora had at the eleventh hour broken down in the attempt to put him off with an uncandid account of her infirmity and that his lordships interest in her had not been proof against the discovery of the way she had practised on him her dissimulation he was obliged to perceive had been infernally deep the future in short assumed a new complexion for him when looked at through the grim glasses of a bride who as he had said to some one couldnt really when you came to find out see her hand before her face he had conducted himself like any other jockeyed customerhe had returned the animal as unsound he had backed out in his own way giving the business by some sharp shuffle such a turn as to make the rupture ostensibly floras but he had none the less remorselessly and basely backed out he had cared for her lovely face cared for it in the amused and haunted way it had been her poor little delusive gift to make men care and her lovely face damn it with the monstrous gear she had begun to rig upon it was just what had let him in he had in the judgment of his family done everything that could be expected of him he had mademrs meldrum had herself seen the lettera handsome offer of pecuniary compensation oh if flora with her incredible buoyancy was in a manner on her feet again now it was not that she had not for weeks and weeks been prone in the dust strange were the humiliations the prostrations it was given to some natures to survive that flora had survived was perhaps after all a sort of sign that she was reserved for some final mercy but she has been in the abysses at any rate said mrs meldrum and i really dont think i can tell you what pulled her through  i think i can tell you i said what in the world but mrs meldrum  at the end of an hour flora had not come in and i was obliged to announce that i should have but time to reach the station where in charge of my mothers servant i was to find my luggage mrs meldrum put before me the question of waiting till a later train so as not to lose our young lady but i confess i gave this alternative a consideration less profound than i pretended somehow i didnt care if i did lose our young lady now that i knew the worst that had befallen her it struck me still less as possible to meet her on the ground of condolence and with the melancholy aspect she wore to me what other ground was left i lost her but i caught my train in truth she was so changed that one hated to see it and now that she was in charitable hands one didnt feel compelled to make great efforts i had studied her face for a particular beauty i had lived with that beauty and reproduced it but i knew what belonged to my trade well enough to be sure it was gone for ever     xii  i was soon called back to folkestone but mrs meldrum and her young friend had already left england finding to that end every convenience on the spot and not having had to come up to town my thoughts however were so painfully engaged there that i should in any case have had little attention for them the event occurred that was to bring my series of visits to a close when this high tide had ebbed i returned to america and to my interrupted work which had opened out on such a scale that with a deep plunge into a great chance i was three good years in rising again to the surface there are nymphs and naiads moreover in the american depths they may have had something to do with the duration of my dive i mention them to account for a grave misdemeanourthe fact that after the first year i rudely neglected mrs meldrum she had written to me from florence after my mothers death and had mentioned in a postscript that in our young ladys calculations the lowest numbers were now italian counts this was a good omen and if in subsequent letters there was no news of a sequel i was content to accept small things and to believe that grave tidings should there be any would come to me in due course the gravity of what might happen to a featherweight became indeed with time and distance less appreciable and i was not without an impression that mrs meldrum whose sense of proportion was not the least of her merits had no idea of boring the world with the ups and downs of her pensioner the poor girl grew dusky and dim a small fitful memory a regret tempered by the comfortable consciousness of how kind mrs meldrum would always be to her i was professionally more preoccupied than i had ever been and i had swarms of pretty faces in my eyes and a chorus of high voices in my ears geoffrey dawling had on his return to england written me two or three letters his last information had been that he was going into the figures of rural illiteracy i was delighted to receive it and had no doubt that if he should go into figures they would as they are said to be able to prove anything prove at least that my advice was sound and that he had wasted time enough this quickened on my part another hope a hope suggested by some roundabout rumouri forget how it reached methat he was engaged to a girl down in hampshire he turned out not to be but i felt sure that if only he went into figures deep enough he would become among the girls down in hampshire or elsewhere one of those numerous prizes of battle whose defences are practically not on the scale of their provocations i nursed in short the thought that it was probably open to him to become one of the types as to which as the years go on frivolous and superficial spectators lose themselves in the wonder that they ever succeeded in winning even the least winsome mates he never alluded to flora saunt and there was in his silence about her quite as in mrs meldrums an element of instinctive tact a brief implication that if you didnt happen to have been in love with her she was not an inevitable topic  within a week after my return to london i went to the opera of which i had always been much of a devotee i arrived too late for the first act of lohengrin but the second was just beginning and i gave myself up to it with no more than a glance at the house when it was over i treated myself with my glass from my place in the stalls to a general survey of the boxes making doubtless on their contents the reflections pointed by comparison that are most familiar to the wanderer restored to london there was a certain proportion of pretty women but i suddenly became aware that one of these was far prettier than the others this lady alone in one of the smaller receptacles of the grand tier and already the aim of fifty tentative glasses which she sustained with admirable serenitythis single exquisite figure placed in the quarter furthest removed from my stall was a person i immediately felt to cause ones curiosity to linger dressed in white with diamonds in her hair and pearls on her neck she had a pale radiance of beauty which even at that distance made her a distinguished presence and with the air that easily attaches to lonely loveliness in public places an agreeable mystery a mystery however she remained to me only for a minute after i had levelled my glass at her i feel to this moment the startled thrill the shock almost of joy with which i suddenly encountered in her vague brightness a rich revival of flora saunt i say a revival because to put it crudely i had on that last occasion left poor flora for dead at present perfectly alive again she was altered only as it were by resurrection a little older a little quieter a little finer and a good deal fairer she was simply transfigured by recovery sustained by the reflection that even recovery wouldnt enable her to distinguish me in the crowd i was free to look at her well then it was it came home to me that my vision of her in her great goggles had been cruelly final as her beauty was all there was of her that machinery had extinguished her and so far as i had thought of her in the interval i had thought of her as buried in the tomb her stern specialist had built with the sense that she had escaped from it came a lively wish to return to her and if i didnt straightway leave my place and rush round the theatre and up to her box it was because i was fixed to the spot some moments longer by the simple inability to cease looking at her  she had been from the first of my seeing her practically motionless leaning back in her chair with a kind of thoughtful grace and with her eyes vaguely directed as it seemed to me to one of the boxes on my side of the house and consequently over my head and out of my sight the only movement she made for some time was to finger with an ungloved hand and as if with the habit of fondness the row of pearls on her neck which my glass showed me to be large and splendid her diamonds and pearls in her solitude mystified me making me as she had had no such brave jewels in the days of the hammond synges wonder what undreamtof improvement had taken place in her fortunes the ghost of a question hovered there a moment could anything so prodigious have happened as that on her tested and proved amendment lord iffield had taken her back this could not have occurred without my hearing of it and moreover if she had become a person of such fashion where was the little court one would naturally see at her elbow her isolation was puzzling though it could easily suggest that she was but momentarily alone if she had come with mrs meldrum that lady would have taken advantage of the interval to pay a visit to some other boxdoubtless the box at which flora had just been looking mrs meldrum didnt account for the jewels but the refreshment of floras beauty accounted for anything she presently moved her eyes over the house and i felt them brush me again like the wings of a dove i dont know what quick pleasure flickered into the hope that she would at last see me she did see me she suddenly bent forward to take up the little doublebarrelled ivory glass that rested on the edge of the box and to all appearance fix me with it i smiled from my place straight up at the searching lenses and after an instant she dropped them and smiled as straight back at me oh her smile it was her old smile her young smile her peculiar smile made perfect i instantly left my stall and hurried off for a nearer view of it quite flushed i remember as i went with the annoyance of having happened to think of the idiotic way i had tried to paint her poor iffield with his sample of that error and still poorer dawling in particular with his i hadnt touched her i was professionally humiliated and as the attendant in the lobby opened her box for me i felt that the very first thing i should have to say to her would be that she must absolutely sit to me again     xiii  she gave me the smile once more as over her shoulder from her chair she turned her face to me here you are again she exclaimed with her disgloved hand put up a little backward for me to take i dropped into a chair just behind her and having taken it and noted that one of the curtains of the box would make the demonstration sufficiently private bent my lips over it and impressed them on its fingertips it was given me however to my astonishment to feel next that all the privacy in the world couldnt have sufficed to mitigate the start with which she greeted this free application of my moustache the blood had jumped to her face she quickly recovered her hand and jerked at me twisting herself round a vacant challenging stare during the next few instants several extraordinary things happened the first of which was that now i was close to them the eyes of loveliness i had come up to look into didnt show at all the conscious light i had just been pleased to see them flash across the house they showed on the contrary to my confusion a strange sweet blankness an expression i failed to give a meaning to until without delay i felt on my arm directed to it as if instantly to efface the effect of her start the grasp of the hand she had impulsively snatched from me it was the irrepressible question in this grasp that stopped on my lips all sound of salutation she had mistaken my entrance for that of another person a pair of lips without a moustache she was feeling me to see who i was with the perception of this and of her not seeing me i sat gaping at her and at the wild word that didnt come the right word to express or to disguise my stupefaction what was the right word to commemorate ones sudden discovery at the very moment too at which one had been most encouraged to count on better things that ones dear old friend had gone blind before the answer to this question dropped upon meand the moving moments though few seemed manyi heard with the sound of voices the click of the attendants key on the other side of the door poor flora heard also and with the hearing still with her hand on my arm she brightened again as i had a minute since seen her brighten across the house she had the sense of the return of the person she had taken me forthe person with the right pair of lips as to whom i was for that matter much more in the dark than she i gasped but my word had come if she had lost her sight it was in this very loss that she had found again her beauty i managed to speak while we were still alone before her companion had appeared youre lovelier at this day than you have ever been in your life at the sound of my voice and that of the opening of the door her excitement broke into audible joy she sprang up recognising me always holding me and gleefully cried to a gentleman who was arrested in the doorway by the sight of me he has come back he has come back and you should have heard what he says of me the gentleman was geoffrey dawling and i thought it best to let him hear on the spot how beautiful she is my dear manbut how extraordinarily beautiful more beautiful at this hour than ever ever before  it gave them almost equal pleasure and made dawling blush up to his eyes while this in turn produced in spite of deepened astonishment a blessed snap of the strain that i had been under for some moments i wanted to embrace them both and while the opening bars of another scene rose from the orchestra i almost did embrace dawling whose first emotion on beholding me had visibly and ever so oddly been a consciousness of guilt i had caught him somehow in the act though that was as yet all i knew but by the time we had sunk noiselessly into our chairs again for the music was supreme wagner passed first my demonstration ought pretty well to have given him the limit of the criticism he had to fear i myself indeed while the opera blazed was only too afraid he might divine in our silent closeness the very moral of my optimism which was simply the comfort i had gathered from seeing that if our companions beauty lived again her vanity partook of its life i had hit on the right notethat was what eased me off it drew all pain for the next halfhour from the sense of the deep darkness in which the stricken woman sat there if the music in that darkness happily soared and swelled for her it beat its wings in unison with those of a gratified passion a great deal came and went between us without profaning the occasion so that i could feel at the end of twenty minutes as if i knew almost everything he might in kindness have to tell me knew even why flora while i stared at her from the stalls had misled me by the use of ivory and crystal and by appearing to recognise me and smile she leaned back in her chair in luxurious ease i had from the first become aware that the way she fingered her pearls was a sharp image of the wedded state nothing of old had seemed wanting to her assurance but i hadnt then dreamed of the art with which she would wear that assurance as a married woman she had taken him when everything had failed he had taken her when she herself had done so his embarrassed eyes confessed it all confessed the deep peace he found in it they only didnt tell me why he had not written to me nor clear up as yet a minor obscurity flora after a while again lifted the glass from the ledge of the box and elegantly swept the house with it then by the mere instinct of her grace a motion but half conscious she inclined her head into the void with the sketch of a salute producing i could see a perfect imitation of a response to some homage dawling and i looked at each other again the tears came into his eyes she was playing at perfection still and her misfortune only simplified the process  i recognised that this was as near as i should ever come certainly as i should come that night to pressing on her misfortune neither of us would name it more than we were doing then and flora would never name it at all little by little i perceived that what had occurred was strange as it might appear the best thing for her happiness the question was now only of her beauty and her being seen and marvelled at with dawling to do for her everything in life her activity was limited to that such an activity was all within her scope it asked nothing of her that she couldnt splendidly give as from time to time in our delicate communion she turned her face to me with the parody of a look i lost none of the signs of its strange new glory the expression of the eyes was a bit of pastel put in by a masters thumb the whole head stamped with a sort of showy suffering had gained a fineness from what she had passed through yes flora was settled for lifenothing could hurt her further i foresaw the particular praise she would mostly incurshe would be incomparably interesting she would charm with her pathos more even than she had charmed with her pleasure for herself above all she was fixed for ever rescued from all change and ransomed from all doubt her old certainties her old vanities were justified and sanctified and in the darkness that had closed upon her one object remained clear that object as unfading as a mosaic mask was fortunately the loveliest she could possibly look upon the greatest blessing of all was of course that dawling thought so her future was ruled with the straightest line and so for that matter was his there were two facts to which before i left my friends i gave time to sink into my spirit one of them was that he had changed by some process as effective as floras change had been simplified somehow into service as she had been simplified into success he was such a picture of inspired intervention as i had never yet encountered he would exist henceforth for the sole purpose of rendering unnecessary or rather impossible any reference even on her own part to his wifes infirmity oh yes how little desire he would ever give me to refer to it he principally after a while made me feeland this was my second lessonthat goodnatured as he was my being there to see it all oppressed him so that by the time the act ended i recognised that i too had filled out my hour dawling remembered things i think he caught in my very face the irony of old judgments they made him thresh about in his chair i said to flora as i took leave of her that i would come to see her but i may mention that i never went ill go tomorrow if i hear she wants me but what in the world can she ever want as i quitted them i laid my hand on dawlings arm and drew him for a moment into the lobby  why did you never write to me of your marriage  he smiled uncomfortably showing his long yellow teeth and something more i dont knowthe whole thing gave me such a tremendous lot to do  this was the first dishonest speech i had heard him make he really hadnt written to me because he had an idea i would think him a still bigger fool than before i didnt insist but i tried there in the lobby so far as a pressure of his hand could serve me to give him a notion of what i thought him i cant at any rate make out i said why i didnt hear from mrs meldrum  she didnt write to you  never a word what has become of her  i think shes at folkestone dawling returned but im sorry to say that practically she has ceased to see us  you havent quarrelled with her  how could we think of all we owe her at the time of our marriage and for months before she did everything for us i dont know how we should have managed without her but since then she has never been near us and has given us rather markedly little encouragement to try and keep up our relations with her  i was struck with this though of course i admit i am struck with all sorts of things well i said after a moment even if i could imagine a reason for that attitude it wouldnt explain why she shouldnt have taken account of my natural interest  just so dawlings face was a windowless wall he could contribute nothing to the mystery and quitting him i carried it away it was not till i went down to see mrs meldrum that it was really dispelled she didnt want to hear of them or to talk of them not a bit and it was just in the same spirit that she hadnt wanted to write of them she had done everything in the world for them but now thank heaven the hard business was over after i had taken this in which i was quick to do we quite avoided the subject she simply couldnt bear it     the next time  mrs highmores errand this morning was odd enough to deserve commemoration she came to ask me to write a notice of her great forthcoming work her great works have come forth so frequently without my assistance that i was sufficiently entitled on this occasion to open my eyes but what really made me stare was the ground on which her request reposed and what leads me to record the incident is the train of memory lighted by that explanation poor ray limbert while we talked seemed to sit there between us she reminded me that my acquaintance with him had begun eighteen years ago with her having come in precisely as she came in this morning to bespeak my charity for him if she didnt know then how little my charity was worth she is at least enlightened about it today and this is just the circumstance that makes the drollery of her visit as i hold up the torch to the dusky yearsby which i mean as i cipher up with a pen that stumbles and stops the figured column of my reminiscencesi see that limberts public hour or at least my small apprehension of it is rounded by those two occasions it was finis with a little moralising flourish that mrs highmore seemed to trace today at the bottom of the page one of the most voluminous writers of the time she has often repeated this sign but never i daresay in spite of her professional command of appropriate emotion with an equal sense of that mystery and that sadness of things which to people of imagination generally hover over the close of human histories this romance at any rate is bracketed by her early and her late appeal and when its melancholy protrusions had caught the declining light again from my halfhours talk with her i took a private vow to recover while that light still lingers something of the delicate flush to pick out with a brief patience the perplexing lesson  it was wonderful to observe how for herself mrs highmore had already done so she wouldnt have hesitated to announce to me what was the matter with ralph limbert or at all events to give me a glimpse of the high admonition she had read in his career there could have been no better proof of the vividness of this parable which we were really in our pleasant sympathy quite at one about than that mrs highmore of all hardened sinners should have been converted this indeed was not news to me she impressed upon me that for the last ten years she had wanted to do something artistic something as to which she was prepared not to care a rap whether or no it should sell she brought home to me further that it had been mainly seeing what her brotherinlaw did and how he did it that had wedded her to this perversity as he didnt sell dear soul and as several persons of whom i was one thought highly of that the fancy had taken hertaken her even quite early in her prolific courseof reaching if only once the same heroic eminence she yearned to be like limbert but of course only once an exquisite failure there was something a failure was a failure in the market that a success somehow wasnt a success was as prosaic as a good dinner there was nothing more to be said about it than that you had had it who but vulgar people in such a case made gloating remarks about the courses it was often by such vulgar people that a success was attested it made if you came to look at it nothing but money that is it made so much that any other result showed small in comparison a failure now could makeoh with the aid of immense talent of course for there were failures and failuressuch a reputation she did me the honourshe had often done itto intimate that what she meant by reputation was seeing me toss a flower if it took a failure to catch a failure i was by my own admission well qualified to place the laurel it was because she had made so much money and mr highmore had taken such care of it that she could treat herself to an hour of pure glory she perfectly remembered that as often as i had heard her heave that sigh i had been prompt with my declaration that a book sold might easily be as glorious as a book unsold of course she knew this but she knew also that it was the age of trash triumphant and that she had never heard me speak of anything that had done well exactly as she had sometimes heard me speak of something that hadntwith just two or three words of respect which when i used them seemed to convey more than they commonly stood for seemed to hush up the discussion a little as if for the very beauty of the secret  i may declare in regard to these allusions that whatever i then thought of myself as a holder of the scales i had never scrupled to laugh out at the humour of mrs highmores pursuit of quality at any price it had never rescued her even for a day from the hard doom of popularity and though i never gave her my word for it there was no reason at all why it should the public would have her as her husband used roguishly to remark not indeed that making her bargains standing up to her publishers and even in his higher flights to her reviewers he ever had a glimpse of her attempted conspiracy against her genius or rather as i may say against mine it was not that when she tried to be what she called subtle for wasnt limbert subtle and wasnt i her fond consumers bless them didnt suspect the trick nor show what they thought of it they straightway rose on the contrary to the morsel she had hoped to hold too high and making but a big cheerful bite of it wagged their great collective tail artlessly for more it was not given to her not to please nor granted even to her best refinements to affright i have always respected the mystery of those humiliations but i was fully aware this morning that they were practically the reason why she had come to me therefore when she said with the flush of a bold joke in her kind coarse face what i feel is you know that you could settle me if you only would i knew quite well what she meant she meant that of old it had always appeared to be the fine blade as some one had hyperbolically called it of my particular opinion that snapped the silken thread by which limberts chance in the market was wont to hang she meant that my favour was compromising that my praise indeed was fatal i had made myself a little specialty of seeing nothing in certain celebrities of seeing overmuch in an occasional nobody and of judging from a point of view that say what i would for it and i had a monstrous deal to say remained perverse and obscure mine was in short the love that killed for my subtlety unlike mrs highmores produced no tremor of the public tail she had not forgotten how toward the end when his case was worst limbert would absolutely come to me with a funny shy pathos in his eyes and say my dear fellow i think ive done it this time if youll only keep quiet if my keeping quiet in those days was to help him to appear to have hit the usual taste for the want of which he was starving so now my breaking out was to help mrs highmore to appear to have hit the unusual  the moral of all this was that i had frightened the public too much for our late friend but that as she was not starving this was exactly what her grosser reputation required and then she goodnaturedly and delicately intimated there would always be if further reasons were wanting the price of my clever little article i think she gave that hint with a flattering impressionspoiled child of the booksellers as she isthat the price of my clever little articles is high whatever it is at any rate she had evidently reflected that poor limberts anxiety for his own profit used to involve my sacrificing mine any inconvenience that my obliging her might entail would not in fine be pecuniary her appeal her motive her fantastic thirst for quality and her ingenious theory of my influence struck me all as excellent comedy and when i consented contingently to oblige her she left me the sheets of her new novel i could plead no inconvenience and have been looking them over but i am frankly appalled at what she expects of me what is she thinking of poor dear and what has put it into her head that quality has descended upon her why does she suppose that she has been artistic she hasnt been anything whatever i surmise that she has not inveterately been what does she imagine she has left out what does she conceive she has put in she has neither left out nor put in anything i shall have to write her an embarrassed note the book doesnt exist and theres nothing in life to say about it how can there be anything but the same old faithful rush for it     i  this rush had already begun when early in the seventies in the interest of her prospective brotherinlaw she approached me on the singular ground of the unencouraged sentiment i had entertained for her sister pretty pink maud had cast me out but i appear to have passed in the flurried little circle for a magnanimous youth pretty pink maud so lovely then before her troubles that dusky jane was gratefully conscious of all she made up for maud stannace very literary too very languishing and extremely bullied by her mother had yielded invidiously as it might have struck me to ray limberts suit which mrs stannace was not the woman to stomach mrs stannace was seldom the woman to do anything she had been shocked at the way her children with the grubby taint of their fathers blood he had published pale remains or flat conversations of his father breathed the alien air of authorship if not the daughter nor even the niece she was if i am not mistaken the second cousin of a hundred earls and a great stickler for relationship so that she had other views for her brilliant child especially after her quiet one such had been her original discreet forecast of the producer of eighty volumes became the second wife of an exarmysurgeon already the father of four children mrs stannace had too manifestly dreamed it would be given to pretty pink maud to detach some one of the hundred who wouldnt be missed from the cluster it was because she cared only for cousins that i unlearnt the way to her house which she had once reminded me was one of the few paths of gentility i could hope to tread ralph limbert who belonged to nobody and had done nothingnothing even at cambridgehad only the uncanny spell he had cast upon her younger daughter to recommend him but if her younger daughter had a spark of filial feeling she wouldnt commit the indecency of deserting for his sake a deeply dependent and intensely aggravated mother  these things i learned from jane highmore who as if her books had been babies they remained her only ones had waited till after marriage to show what she could do and now bade fair to surround her satisfied spouse he took for some mysterious reason a part of the credit with a little family in sets of triplets which properly handled would be the support of his declining years the young couple neither of whom had a penny were now virtually engaged the thing was subject to ralphs putting his hand on some regular employment people more enamoured couldnt be conceived and mrs highmore honest woman who had moreover a professional sense for a lovestory was eager to take them under her wing what was wanted was a decent opening for limbert which it had occurred to her i might assist her to find though indeed i had not yet found any such matter for myself but it was well known that i was too particular whereas poor ralph with the easy manners of genius was ready to accept almost anything to which a salary even a small one was attached if he could only for instance get a place on a newspaper the rest of his maintenance would come freely enough it was true that his two novels one of which she had brought to leave with me had passed unperceived and that to her mrs highmore personally they didnt irresistibly appeal but she could all the same assure me that i should have only to spend ten minutes with him and our encounter must speedily take place to receive an impression of latent power  our encounter took place soon after i had read the volumes mrs highmore had left with me in which i recognised an intention of a sort that i had then pretty well given up the hope of meeting i daresay that without knowing it i had been looking out rather hungrily for an altar of sacrifice however that may be i submitted when i came across ralph limbert to one of the rarest emotions of my literary life the sense of an activity in which i could critically rest the rest was deep and salutary and it has not been disturbed to this hour it has been a long large surrender the luxury of dropped discriminations he couldnt trouble me whatever he did for i practically enjoyed him as much when he was worse as when he was better it was a case i suppose of natural prearrangement in which i hasten to add i keep excellent company we are a numerous band partakers of the same repose who sit together in the shade of the tree by the plash of the fountain with the glare of the desert around us and no great vice that i know of but the habit perhaps of estimating people a little too much by what they think of a certain style if it had been laid upon these few pages none the less to be the history of an enthusiasm i should not have undertaken them they are concerned with ralph limbert in relations to which i was a stranger or in which i participated only by sympathy i used to talk about his work but i seldom talk now the brotherhood of the faith have become like the trappists a silent order if to the day of his death after mortal disenchantments the impression he first produced always evoked the word ingenuous those to whom his face was familiar can easily imagine what it must have been when it still had the light of youth i had never seen a man of genius look so passive a man of experience so off his guard at the period i made his acquaintance this freshness was all unbrushed his foot had begun to stumble but he was full of big intentions and of sweet maud stannace blackhaired and pale deceptively languid he had the eyes of a clever child and the voice of a bronze bell he saw more even than i had done in the girl he was engaged to as time went on i became conscious that we had both properly enough seen rather more than there was our odd situation that of the three of us became perfectly possible from the moment i observed that he had more patience with her than i should have had i was happy at not having to supply this quantity and she on her side found pleasure in being able to be impertinent to me without incurring the reproach of a bad wife  limberts novels appeared to have brought him no money they had only brought him so far as i could then make out tributes that took up his time these indeed brought him from several quarters some other things and on my part at the end of three months the blackport beacon i dont today remember how i obtained for him the london correspondence of the great northern organ unless it was through somebodys having obtained it for myself i seem to recall that i got rid of it in limberts interest persuaded the editor that he was much the better man the better man was naturally the man who had pledged himself to support a charming wife we were neither of us good as the event proved but he had a finer sort of badness the blackport beacon had two london correspondentsone a supposed haunter of political circles the other a votary of questions sketchily classified as literary they were both expected to be lively and what was held out to each was that it was honourably open to him to be livelier than the other i recollect the political correspondent of that period and how the problem offered to ray limbert was to try to be livelier than pat moyle he had not yet seemed to me so candid as when he undertook this exploit which brought matters to a head with mrs stannace inasmuch as her opposition to the marriage now logically fell to the ground its all tears and laughter as i look back upon that admirable time in which nothing was so romantic as our intense vision of the real no fools paradise ever rustled such a cradlesong it was anything but bohemiait was the very temple of mrs grundy we knew we were too critical and that made us sublimely indulgent we believed we did our duty or wanted to and that made us free to dream but we dreamed over the multiplicationtable we were nothing if not practical oh the long smokes and sudden ideas the knowing hints and banished scruples the great thing was for limbert to bring out his next book which was just what his delightful engagement with the beacon would give him leisure and liberty to do the kind of work all human and elastic and suggestive was capital experience in picking up things for his biweekly letter he would pick up life as well he would pick up literature the new publications the new pictures the new peoplethere would be nothing too novel for us and nobody too sacred we introduced everything and everybody into mrs stannaces drawingroom of which i again became a familiar  mrs stannace it was true thought herself in strange company she didnt particularly mind the new books though some of them seemed queer enough but to the new people she had decided objections it was notorious however that poor lady robeck secretly wrote for one of the papers and the thing had certainly in its glance at the doings of the great world a side that might be made attractive but we were going to make every side attractive and we had everything to say about the sort of thing a paper like the beacon would want to give it what it would want and to give it nothing else was not doubtless an inspiring but it was a perfectly respectable task especially for a man with an appealing bride and a contentious motherinlaw i thought lamberts first letters as charming as the type allowed though i wont deny that in spite of my sense of the importance of concessions i was just a trifle disconcerted at the way he had caught the tone the tone was of course to be caught but need it have been caught so in the act the creature was even cleverer as maud stannace said than she had ventured to hope verily it was a good thing to have a dose of the wisdom of the serpent if it had to be journalismwell it was journalism if he had to be chatty well he was chatty now and then he made a hit thatit was stupid of mebrought the blood to my face i hated him to be so personal but still if it would make his fortune it wouldnt of course directly but the book would practically and in the sense to which our pure ideas of fortune were confined and these things were all for the book the daily balm meanwhile was in what one knew of the bookthere were exquisite things to know in the quiet monthly cheques from blackport and in the deeper rose of mauds little preparations which were as dainty on their tiny scale as if she had been a hummingbird building a nest when at the end of three months her betrothed had fairly settled down to his correspondencein which mrs highmore was the only person so far as we could discover disappointed even she moreover being in this particular tortuous and possibly jealous when the situation had assumed such a comfortable shape it was quite time to prepare i published at that moment my first volume mere faded ink today a little collection of literary impressions odds and ends of criticism contributed to a journal less remunerative but also less chatty than the beacon small ironies and ecstasies great phrases and mistakes and the very week it came out poor limbert devoted half of one of his letters to it with the happy sense this time of gratifying both himself and me as well as the blackport breakfasttables i remember his saying it wasnt literature the stuff superficial stuff he had to write about me but what did that matter if it came back as we knew to the making for literature in the roundabout way i sold the thing i remember for ten pounds and with the money i bought in vigo street a quaint piece of old silver for maud stannace which i carried to her with my own hand as a weddinggift in her mothers small drawingroom a faded bower of photography fenced in and bedimmed by folding screens out of which sallow persons of fashion with dashing signatures looked at you from retouched eyes and little windows of plush i was left to wait long enough to feel in the air of the house a hushed vibration of disaster when our young lady came in she was very pale and her eyes too had been retouched  something horrid has happened i immediately said and having really all along but half believed in her mothers meagre permission i risked with an unguarded groan the introduction of mrs stannaces name  yes she has made a dreadful scene she insists on our putting it off again were very unhappy poor ray has been turned off her tears began to flow again  i had such a good conscience that i stared turned off what  why his paper of course the beacon has given him what he calls the sack they dont like his letters theyre not the style of thing they want  my blankness could only deepen then what style of thing do they want  something more chatty  more i cried aghast  more gossipy more personal they want journalism they want tremendous trash  why thats just what his letters have been i broke out  this was strong and i caught myself up but the girl offered me the pardon of a beautiful wan smile so ray himself declares he says he has stooped so low  very wellhe must stoop lower he must keep the place  he cant poor maud wailed he says he has tried all he knows has been abject has gone on all fours and that if they dont like that  he accepts his dismissal i interposed in dismay  she gave a tragic shrug what other course is open to him he wrote to them that such work as he has done is the very worst he can do for the money  therefore i inquired with a flash of hope theyll offer him more for worse  no indeed she answered they havent even offered him to go on at a reduction he isnt funny enough  i reflected a moment but surely such a thing as his notice of my book  it was your wretched book that was the last straw he should have treated it superficially  well if he didnt i began then i  checked myself je vous porte malheur  she didnt deny this she only went on what on earth is he to do  hes to do better than the monkeys hes to write  but what on earth are we to marry on  i considered once more youre to marry on the major key     ii  the major key was the new novel and the great thing accordingly was to finish it a consummation for which three months of the beacon had in some degree prepared the way the action of that journal was indeed a shock but i didnt know then the worst didnt know that in addition to being a shock it was also a symptom it was the first hint of the difficulty to which poor limbert was eventually to succumb his state was the happier of a truth for his not immediately seeing all that it meant difficulty was the law of life but one could thank heaven it was exceptionally present in that horrid quarter there was the difficulty that inspired the difficulty of the major key to wit which it was after all base to sacrifice to the turning of somersaults for pennies these convictions ray limbert beguiled his fresh wait by blandly entertaining not indeed i think that the failure of his attempt to be chatty didnt leave him slightly humiliated if it was bad enough to have grinned through a horsecollar it was very bad indeed to have grinned in vain well he would try no more grinning or at least no more horsecollars the only success worth ones powder was success in the line of ones idiosyncrasy consistency was in itself distinction and what was talent but the art of being completely whatever it was that one happened to be ones things were characteristic or they were nothing i look back rather fondly on our having exchanged in those days these admirable remarks and many others on our having been very happy too in spite of postponements and obscurities in spite also of such occasional hauntings as could spring from our lurid glimpse of the fact that even twaddle cunningly calculated was far above peoples heads it was easy to wave away spectres by the reflection that all one had to do was not to write for people it was certainly not for people that limbert wrote while he hammered at the major key the taint of literature was fatal only in a certain kind of air which was precisely the kind against which we had now closed our window mrs stannace rose from her crumpled cushions as soon as she had obtained an adjournment and maud looked pale and proud quite victorious and superior at her having obtained nothing more maud behaved well i thought to her mother and well indeed for a girl who had mainly been taught to be flowerlike to every one what she gave ray limbert her fine abundant needs made him then and ever pay for but the gift was liberal almost wonderfulan assertion i make even while remembering to how many clever women early and late his work has been dear it was not only that the woman he was to marry was in love with him but that this was the strangeness she had really seen almost better than any one what he could do the greatest strangeness was that she didnt want him to do something different this boundless belief was indeed the main way of her devotion and as an act of faith it naturally asked for miracles she was a rare wife for a poet if she was not perhaps the best who could have been picked out for a poor man  well we were to have the miracles at all events and we were in a perfect state of mind to receive them there were more of us every day and we thought highly even of our friends odd jobs and potboilers the beacon had had no successor but he found some quiet comers and stray chances perpetually poking the fire and looking out of the window he was certainly not a monster of facility but he was thanks perhaps to a certain method in that madness a monster of certainty it wasnt every one however who knew him for this many editors printed him but once he was getting a small reputation as a man it was well to have the first time he created obscure apprehensions as to what might happen the second he was good for making an impression but no one seemed exactly to know what the impression was good for when made the reason was simply that they had not seen yet the major key that fieryhearted rose as to which we watched in private the formation of petal after petal and flame after flame nothing mattered but this for it had already elicited a splendid bid much talked about in mrs highmores drawingroom where at this point my reminiscences grow particularly thick her roses bloomed all the year and her sociability increased with her row of prizes we had an idea that we met every one thereso we naturally thought when we met each other between our hostess and ray limbert flourished the happiest relation the only cloud on which was that her husband eyed him rather askance when he was called clever this personage wanted to know what he had to show and it was certain that he showed nothing that could compare with jane highmore mr highmore took his stand on accomplished work and turning up his coattails warmed his rear with a good conscience at the neat bookcase in which the generations of triplets were chronologically arranged the harmony between his companions rested on the fact that as i have already hinted each would have liked so much to be the other limbert couldnt but have a feeling about a woman who in addition to being the best creature and her sisters backer would have made could she have condescended such a success with the beacon on the other hand mrs highmore used freely to say do you know hell do exactly the thing that i want to do i shall never do it myself but hell do it instead yes hell do my thing and i shall hate him for itthe wretch hating him was her pleasant humour for the wretch was personally to her taste  she prevailed on her own publisher to promise to take the major key and to engage to pay a considerable sum down as the phrase is on the presumption of its attracting attention this was good news for the evenings end at mrs highmores when there were only four or five left and cigarettes ran low but there was better news to come and i have never forgotten how as it was i who had the good fortune to bring it i kept it back on one of those occasions for the sake of my effect till only the right people remained the right people were now more and more numerous but this was a revelation addressed only to a choice residuuma residuum including of course limbert himself with whom i haggled for another cigarette before i announced that as a consequence of an interview i had had with him that afternoon and of a subtle argument i had brought to bear mrs highmores pearl of publishers had agreed to put forth the new book as a serial he was to run it in his magazine and he was to pay ever so much more for the privilege i produced a fine gasp which presently found a more articulate relief but poor limberts voice failed him once for all he knew he was to walk away with me and it was some one else who asked me in what my subtle argument had resided i forget what florid description i then gave of it today i have no reason not to confess that it had resided in the simple plea that the book was exquisite i had said come my dear friend be original just risk it for that my dear friend seemed to rise to the chance and i followed up my advantage permitting him honestly no illusion as to the quality of the work he clutched interrogatively at two or three attenuations but i dashed them aside leaving him face to face with the formidable truth it was just a pure gem was he the man not to flinch his danger appeared to have acted upon him as the anaconda acts upon the rabbit fascinated and paralysed he had been engulfed in the long pink throat when a week before at my request limbert had let me possess for a day the complete manuscript beautifully copied out by maud stannace i had flushed with indignation at its having to be said of the author of such pages that he hadnt the common means to marry i had taken the field in a great glow to repair this scandal and it was therefore quite directly my fault if three months later when the major key began to run mrs stannace was driven to the wall she had made a condition of a fixed income and at last a fixed income was achieved  she had to recognise it and after much prostration among the photographs she recognised it to the extent of accepting some of the convenience of it in the form of a project for a common household to the expenses of which each party should proportionately contribute jane highmore made a great point of her not being left alone but mrs stannace herself determined the proportion which on limberts side at least and in spite of many other fluctuations was never altered his income had been fixed with a vengeance having painfully stooped to the comprehension of it mrs stannace rested on this effort to the end and asked no further question on the subject the major key in other words ran ever so long and before it was half out limbert and maud had been married and the common household set up these first months were probably the happiest in the family annals with weddingbells and budding laurels the quiet assured course of the book and the friendly familiar note round the corner of mrs highmores big guns they gave ralph time to block in another picture as well as to let me know after a while that he had the happy prospect of becoming a father we had at times some dispute as to whether the major key was making an impression but our contention could only be futile so long as we were not agreed as to what an impression consisted of several persons wrote to the author and several others asked to be introduced to him wasnt that an impression one of the lively weeklies snapping at the deadly monthlies said the whole thing was grossly inartisticwasnt that it was somewhere else proclaimed a wonderfully subtle characterstudywasnt that too the strongest effect doubtless was produced on the publisher when in its lemoncoloured volumes like a little dish of three custards the book was at last served cold he never got his money back and so far as i know has never got it back to this day the major key was rather a great performance than a great success it converted readers into friends and friends into lovers it placed the author as the phrase isplaced him all too definitely but it shrank to obscurity in the account of sales eventually rendered it was in short an exquisite thing but it was scarcely a thing to have published and certainly not a thing to have married on i heard all about the matter for my intervention had much exposed me mrs highmore said the second volume had given her ideas and the ideas are probably to be found in some of her works to the circulation of which they have even perhaps contributed this was not absolutely yet the very thing she wanted to do but it was on the way to it so much she informed me she particularly perceived in the light of a critical study which i put forth in a little magazine which the publisher in his advertisements quoted from profusely and as to which there sprang up some absurd story that limbert himself had written it i remember that on my asking some one why such an idiotic thing had been said my interlocutor replied oh because you know its just the way he would have written my spirit sank a little perhaps as i reflected that with such analogies in our manner there might prove to be some in our fate  it was during the next four or five years that our eyes were open to what unless something could be done that fate at least on limberts part might be the thing to be done was of course to write the book the book that would make the difference really justify the burden he had accepted and consummately express his power for the works that followed upon the major key he had inevitably to accept conditions the reverse of brilliant at a time too when the strain upon his resources had begun to show sharpness with three babies in due course an ailing wife and a complication still greater than these it became highly important that a man should do only his best whatever limbert did was his best so at least each time i thought and so i unfailingly said somewhere though it was not my saying it heaven knows that made the desired difference every one else indeed said it and there was among multiplied worries always the comfort that his position was quite assured the two books that followed the major key did more than anything else to assure it and jane highmore was always crying out you stand alone dear ray you stand absolutely alone dear ray used to tell me that he felt the truth of this in feebly attempted discussions with his bookseller his sisterinlaw gave him good advice into the bargain she was a repository of knowing hints of esoteric learning these things were doubtless not the less valuable to him for bearing wholly on the question of how a reputation might be with a little gumption as mrs highmore said worked save when she occasionally bore testimony to her desire to do as limbert did something some day for her own very self i never heard her speak of the literary motive as if it were distinguishable from the pecuniary she cocked up his hat she pricked up his prudence for him reminding him that as one seemed to take ones self so the silly world was ready to take one it was a fatal mistake to be too candid even with those who were all rightnot to look and to talk prosperous not at least to pretend that one had beautiful sales to listen to her you would have thought the profession of letters a wonderful game of bluff wherever ones idea began it ended somehow in inspired paragraphs in the newspapers i pretend i assure you that you are going off like wildfirei can at least do that for you she often declared prevented as she was from doing much else by mr highmores insurmountable objection to their taking mrs stannace  i couldnt help regarding the presence of this latter lady in limberts life as the major complication whatever he attempted it appeared given to him to achieve as best he could in the mere margin of the space in which she swung her petticoats i may err in the belief that she practically lived on him for though it was not in him to follow adequately mrs highmores counsel there were exasperated confessions he never made scanty domestic curtains he rattled on their rings i may exaggerate in the retrospect his apparent anxieties for these after all were the years when his talent was freshest and when as a writer he most laid down his line it wasnt of mrs stannace nor even as time went on of mrs limbert that we mainly talked when i got at longer intervals a smokier hour in the little grey den from which we could step out as we used to say to the lawn the lawn was the backgarden and limberts study was behind the diningroom with folding doors not impervious to the clatter of the childrens tea we sometimes took refuge from it in the depthsa bush and a half deepof the shrubbery where was a bench that gave us a view while we gossiped of mrs stannaces tiaralike headdress nodding at an upper window within doors and without limberts life was overhung by an awful region that figured in his conversation comprehensively and with unpremeditated art as upstairs it was upstairs that the thunder gathered that mrs stannace kept her accounts and her state that mrs limbert had her babies and her headaches that the bells for ever jangled at the maids that everything imperative in short took placeeverything that he had somehow pen in hand to meet and dispose of in the little room on the gardenlevel i dont think he liked to go upstairs but no special burst of confidence was needed to make me feel that a terrible deal of service went it was the habit of the ladies of the stannace family to be extremely waited on and ive never been in a house where three maids and a nurserygoverness gave such an impression of a retinue oh theyre so deucedly so hereditarily finei remember how that dropped from him in some worried hour well it was because maud was so universally fine that we had both been in love with her it was not an air moreover for the plaintive note no private inconvenience could long outweigh for him the great happiness of these yearsthe happiness that sat with us when we talked and that made it always amusing to talk the sense of his being on the heels of success coming closer and closer touching it at last knowing that he should touch it again and hold it fast and hold it high of course when we said success we didnt mean exactly what mrs highmore for instance meant he used to quote at me as a definition something from a nameless page of my own some stray dictum to the effect that the man of his craft had achieved it when of a beautiful subject his expression was complete well wasnt limberts in all conscience complete     iii  it was bang upon this completeness all the same that the turn arrived the turn i cant say of his fortunefor what was thatbut of his confidence of his spirits and what was more to the point of his system the whole occasion on which the first symptom flared out is before me as i write i had met them both at dinner they were diners who had reached the penultimate stagethe stage which in theory is a rigid selection and in practice a wan submission it was late in the season and stronger spirits than theirs were broken the night was close and the air of the banquet such as to restrict conversation to the refusal of dishes and consumption to the sniffing of a flower it struck me all the more that mrs limbert was flying her flag as vivid as a page of her husbands prose she had one of those flickers of freshness that are the miracle of her sex and one of those expensive dresses that are the miracle of ours she had also a neat brougham in which she had offered to rescue an old lady from the possibilities of a queer cabhorse so that when she had rolled away with her charge i proposed a walk home with her husband whom i had overtaken on the doorstep before i had gone far with him he told me he had news for mehe had accepted of all people and of all things an editorial position it had come to pass that very day from one hour to another without time for appeals or ponderations mr bousefield the proprietor of a highclass monthly making as they said a sudden change had dropped on him heavily out of the blue it was all rightthere was a salary and an idea and both of them as such things went rather high we took our way slowly through the vacant streets and in the explanations and revelations that as we lingered under lampposts i drew from him i found with an apprehension that i tried to gulp down a foretaste of the bitter end he told me more than he had ever told me yet he couldnt balance accountsthat was the trouble his expenses were too rising a tide it was absolutely necessary that he should at last make money and now he must work only for that the need this last year had gathered the force of a crusher it had rolled over him and laid him on his back he had his scheme this time he knew what he was about on some good occasion with leisure to talk it over he would tell me the blessed whole his editorship would help him and for the rest he must help himself if he couldnt they would have to do something fundamentalchange their life altogether give up london move into the country take a house at thirty pounds a year send their children to the boardschool i saw that he was excited and he admitted that he was he had waked out of a trance he had been on the wrong tack he had piled mistake on mistake it was the vision of his remedy that now excited him ineffably grotesquely simple it had yet come to him only within a day or two no he wouldnt tell me what it was he would give me the night to guess and if i shouldnt guess it would be because i was as big an ass as himself however a lone man might be an ass he had room in his life for his ears ray had a burden that demanded a back the back must therefore now be properly instituted as to the editorship it was simply heavensent being not at all another case of the blackport beacon but a case of the very opposite the proprietor the great mr bousefield had approached him precisely because his name which was to be on the cover didnt represent the chatty the whole thing was to beoh on fiddling little lines of coursea protest against the chatty bousefield wanted him to be himself it was for himself bousefield had picked him out wasnt it beautiful and brave of bousefield he wanted literature he saw the great reaction coming the way the cat was going to jump where will you get literature i wofully asked to which he replied with a laugh that what he had to get was not literature but only what bousefield would take for it  in that single phrase without more ado i discovered his famous remedy what was before him for the future was not to do his work but to do what somebody else would take for it i had the question out with him on the next opportunity and of all the lively discussions into which we had been destined to drift it lingers in my mind as the liveliest this was not i hasten to add because i disputed his conclusions it was an effect of the very force with which when i had fathomed his wretched premises i took them to my soul it was very well to talk with jane highmore about his standing alone the eminent relief of this position had brought him to the verge of ruin several persons admired his booksnothing was less contestable but they appeared to have a mortal objection to acquiring them by subscription or by purchase they begged or borrowed or stole they delegated one of the party perhaps to commit the volumes to memory and repeat them like the bards of old to listening multitudes some ingenious theory was required at any rate to account for the inexorable limits of his circulation it wasnt a thing for five people to live on therefore either the objects circulated must change their nature or the organisms to be nourished must the former change was perhaps the easier to consider first limbert considered it with extraordinary ingenuity from that time on and the ingenuity greater even than any i had yet had occasion to admire in him made the whole next stage of his career rich in curiosity and suspense  i have been butting my skull against a wall he had said in those hours of confidence and to be as sublime a blockhead if youll allow me the word you my dear fellow have kept sounding the charge weve sat prating here of success heaven help us like chanting monks in a cloister hugging the sweet delusion that it lies somewhere in the work itself in the expression as you said of ones subject or the intensification as somebody else somewhere says of ones note one has been going on in short as if the only thing to do were to accept the law of ones talent and thinking that if certain consequences didnt follow it was only because one wasnt logical enough my disaster has served me righti mean for using that ignoble word at all its a mere distributors a mere hawkers word what is success anyhow when a books right its rightshame to it surely if it isnt when it sells it sellsit brings money like potatoes or beer if theres dishonour one way and inconvenience the other it certainly is comfortable but it as certainly isnt glorious to have escaped them people of delicacy dont brag either about their probity or about their luck success be hangedi want to sell its a question of life and death i must study the way ive studied too much the other wayi know the other way now every inch of it i must cultivate the marketits a science like another i must go in for an infernal cunning it will be very amusing i foresee that i shall lead a dashing life and drive a roaring trade i havent been obviousi must be obvious i havent been populari must be popular its another artor perhaps it isnt an art at all its something else one must find out what it is is it something awfully queeryou blushsomething barely decent all the greater incentive to curiosity curiositys an immense motive we shall have tremendous sport they all do it its only a question of how of course ive everything to unlearn but what is life as jane highmore says but a lesson i must get all i can all she can give me from jane she cant explain herself much shes all intuition her processes are obscure its the spirit that swoops down and catches her up but i must study her reverently in her works yes youve defied me before but now my loins are girded i declare ill read one of themi really will ill put it through if i perish  i wont pretend that he made all these remarks at once but there wasnt one that he didnt make at one time or another for suggestion and occasion were plentiful enough his life being now given up altogether to his new necessity it wasnt a question of his having or not having as they say my intellectual sympathy the brute force of the pressure left no room for judgment it made all emotion a mere recourse to the spyglass i watched him as i should have watched a long race or a long chase irresistibly siding with him but much occupied with the calculation of odds i confess indeed that my heart for the endless stretch that he covered so fast was often in my throat i saw him peg away over the sundappled plain i saw him double and wind and gain and lose and all the while i secretly entertained a conviction i wanted him to feed his many mouths but at the bottom of all things was my sense that if he should succeed in doing so in this particular way i should think less well of him now i had an absolute terror of that meanwhile so far as i could i backed him up i helped him all the more that i had warned him immensely at first smiled with a compassion it was very good of him not to have found exasperating over the complacency of his assumption that a man could escape from himself ray limbert at all events would certainly never escape but one could make believe for him make believe very hardan undertaking in which at first mr bousefield was visibly a blessing limbert was delightful on the business of this being at last my chance toomy chance so miraculously vouchsafed to appear with a certain luxuriance he didnt care how often he printed me for wasnt it exactly in my direction mr bousefield held that the cat was going to jump this was the least he could do for me i might write on anything i likedon anything at least but mr limberts second manner he didnt wish attention strikingly called to his second manner it was to operate insidiously people were to be left to believe they had discovered it long ago ralph limbert why when did we ever live without himthats what he wanted them to say besides they hated mannerslet sleeping dogs lie his understanding with mr bousefieldon which he had had not at all to insist it was the excellent man who insistedwas that he should run one of his beautiful stories in the magazine as to the beauty of his story however limbert was going to be less admirably straight than as to the beauty of everything else that was another reason why i mustnt write about his new line mr bousefield was not to be too definitely warned that such a periodical was exposed to prostitution by the time he should find it out for himself the publicle gros publicwould have bitten and then perhaps he would be conciliated and forgive everything else would be literary in short and above all i would be only ralph limbert wouldnthed chuck up the whole thing sooner hed be vulgar hed be rudimentary hed be atrocious hed be elaborately what he hadnt been before i duly noticed that he had more trouble in making everything else literary than he had at first allowed for but this was largely counteracted by the ease with which he was able to obtain that his mark should not be overshot he had taken well to heart the old lesson of the beacon he remembered that he was after all there to keep his contributors down much rather than to keep them up i thought at times that he kept them down a trifle too far but he assured me that i neednt be nervous he had his limithis limit was inexorable he would reserve pure vulgarity for his serial over which he was sweating blood and water elsewhere it should be qualified by the prime qualification the mediocrity that attaches that endears bousefield he allowed was proud was difficult nothing was really good enough for him but the middling good but he himself was prepared for adverse comment resolute for his noble course hadnt limbert moreover in the event of a charge of laxity from headquarters the great strength of being able to point to my contributions therefore i must let myself go i must abound in my peculiar sense i must be a resource in case of accidents limberts vision of accidents hovered mainly over the sudden awakening of mr bousefield to the stuff that in the department of fiction his editor was palming off he would then have to confess in all humility that this was not what the good old man wanted but i should be all the more there as a salutary specimen i would cross the scent with something showily impossible splendidly unpopulari must be sure to have something on hand i always had plenty on handpoor limbert neednt have worried the magazine was forearmed each month by my care with a retort to any possible accusation of trifling with mr bousefields standard he had admitted to limbert after much consideration indeed that he was prepared to be perfectly human but he had added that he was not prepared for an abuse of this admission the thing in the world i think i least felt myself was an abuse even though as i had never mentioned to my friendly editor i too had my project for a bigger reverberation i daresay i trusted mine more than i trusted limberts at all events the golden mean in which in the special case he saw his salvation as an editor was something i should be most sure of if i were to exhibit it myself i exhibited it month after month in the form of a monstrous levity only praying heaven that my editor might now not tell me as he had so often told me that my result was awfully good i knew what that would signifyit would signify sketchily speaking disaster what he did tell me heartily was that it was just what his game required his new line had brought with it an earnest assumptionearnest save when we privately laughed about itof the locutions proper to real bold enterprise if i tried to keep him in the dark even as he kept mr bousefield there was nothing to show that i was not tolerably successful each case therefore presented a promising analogy for the other he never noticed my descent and it was accordingly possible that mr bousefield would never notice his  but would nobody notice it at allthat was a question that added a prospective zest to ones possession of a critical sense so much depended upon it that i was rather relieved than otherwise not to know the answer too soon i waited in fact a yearthe year for which limbert had cannily engaged on trial with mr bousefield the year as to which through the same sharpened shrewdness it had been conveyed in the agreement between them that mr bousefield was not to intermeddle it had been limberts general prayer that we would during this period let him quite alone his terror of my direct rays was a droll dreadful force that always operated he explained it by the fact that i understood him too well expressed too much of his intention saved him too little from himself the less he was saved the more he didnt sell i literally interpreted and that was simply fatal  i held my breath accordingly i did morei closed my eyes i guarded my treacherous ears he induced several of us to do that of such devotions we were capable so that not even glancing at the thing from month to month and having nothing but his shamed anxious silence to go by i participated only vaguely in the little hum that surrounded his act of sacrifice it was blown about the town that the public would be surprised it was hinted it was printed that he was making a desperate bid his new work was spoken of as more calculated for general acceptance these tidings produced in some quarters much reprobation and nowhere more i think than on the part of certain persons who had never read a word of him or assuredly had never spent a shilling on him and who hung for hours over the other attractions of the newspaper that announced his abasement so much asperity cheered me a littleseemed to signify that he might really be doing something on the other hand i had a distinct alarm some one sent me for some alien reason an american journal containing frankly more than that source of affliction in which was quoted a passage from our friends last instalment the passagei couldnt for my life help reading itwas simply superb ah he would have to move to the country if that was the worst he could do it gave me a pang to see how little after all he had improved since the days of his competition with pat moyle there was nothing in the passage quoted in the american paper that pat would for a moment have owned during the last weeks as the opportunity of reading the complete thing drew near ones suspense was barely endurable and i shall never forget the july evening on which i put it to rout coming home to dinner i found the two volumes on my table and i sat up with them half the night dazed bewildered rubbing my eyes wondering at the monstrous joke was it a monstrous joke his second mannerwas this the new line the desperate bid the scheme for more general acceptance and the remedy for material failure had he made a fool of all his following or had he most injuriously made a still bigger fool of himself obviouswhere the deuce was it obvious popularhow on earth could it be popular the thing was charming with all his charm and powerful with all his power it was an unscrupulous an unsparing a shameless merciless masterpiece it was no doubt like the old letters to the beacon the worst he could do but the perversity of the effort even though heroic had been frustrated by the purity of the gift under what illusion had he laboured with what wavering treacherous compass had he steered his honour was inviolable his measurements were all wrong i was thrilled with the whole impression and with all that came crowding in its train it was too grand a collapseit was too hideous a triumph i exalted almost with tearsi lamented with a strange delight indeed as the short night waned and threshing about in my emotion i fidgeted to my highperched window for a glimpse of the summer dawn i became at last aware that i was staring at it out of eyes that had compassionately and admiringly filled the eastern sky over the london housetops had a wonderful tragic crimson that was the colour of his magnificent mistake     iv  if something less had depended on my impression i daresay i should have communicated it as soon as i had swallowed my breakfast but the case was so embarrassing that i spent the first half of the day in reconsidering it dipping into the book again almost feverishly turning its leaves and trying to extract from them for my friends benefit some symptom of reassurance some ground for felicitation this rash challenge had consequences merely dreadful the wretched volumes imperturbable and impeccable with their shyer secrets and their second line of defence were like a beautiful woman more denuded or a great symphony on a new hearing there was something quite sinister in the way they stood up to me i couldnt however be dumbthat was to give the wrong tinge to my disappointment so that later in the afternoon taking my courage in both hands i approached with a vain tortuosity poor limberts door a smart victoria waited before it in which from the bottom of the street i saw that a lady who had apparently just issued from the house was settling herself i recognised jane highmore and instantly paused till she should drive down to me she presently met me halfway and as soon as she saw me stopped her carriage in agitation this was a reliefit postponed a moment the sight of that pale fine face of our friends fronting me for the right verdict i gathered from the flushed eagerness with which mrs highmore asked me if i had heard the news that a verdict of some sort had already been rendered  what newsabout the book  about that horrid magazine theyre shockingly upset he has lost his positionhe has had a fearful flareup with mr bousefield  i stood there blank but not unaware in my blankness of how history repeats itself there came to me across the years mauds announcement of their ejection from the beacon and dimly confusedly the same explanation was in the air this time however i had been on my guard i had had my suspicion he has made it too flippant i found breath after an instant to inquire  mrs highmores vacuity exceeded my own too flippant he has made it too oracular mr bousefield says he has killed it then perceiving my stupefaction dont you know what has happened she pursued isnt it because in his trouble poor love he has sent for you that youve come youve heard nothing at all then you had better know before you see them get in here with meill take you a turn and tell you we were close to the park the regents and when with extreme alacrity i had placed myself beside her and the carriage had begun to enter it she went on it was what i feared you know it reeked with culture he keyed it up too high  i felt myself sinking in the general collapse what are you talking about  why about that beastly magazine theyre all on the streets i shall have to take mamma  i pulled myself together what on earth then did bousefield want he said he wanted intellectual power  yes but ray overdid it  why bousefield said it was a thing he couldnt overdo  well ray managed he took mr bousefield too literally it appears the thing has been doing dreadfully but the proprietor couldnt say anything because he had covenanted to leave the editor quite free he describes himself as having stood there in a fever and seen his ship go down a day or two ago the year was up so he could at last break out maud says he did break out quite fearfully he came to the house and let poor ray have it ray gave it to him back he reminded him of his own idea of the way the cat was going to jump  i gasped with dismay has bousefield abandoned that idea isnt the cat going to jump  mrs highmore hesitated it appears that she doesnt seem in a hurry ray at any rate has jumped too far ahead of her he should have temporised a little mr bousefield says but im beginning to think you know said my companion that ray cant temporise fresh from my emotions of the previous twentyfour hours i was scarcely in a position to disagree with her he published too much pure thought  pure thought i cried why it struck me so oftencertainly in a due proportion of casesas pure drivel  oh youre more keyed up than he mr bousefield says that of course he wanted things that were suggestive and clever things that he could point to with pride but he contends that ray didnt allow for human weakness he gave everything in too stiff doses  sensibly i fear to my neighbour i winced at her words i felt a prick that made me meditate then i said is that by chance the way he gave me mrs highmore remained silent so long that i had somehow the sense of a fresh pang and after a minute turning in my seat i laid my hand on her arm fixed my eyes upon her face and pursued pressingly do you suppose it to be to my occasional remarks that mr bousefield refers  at last she met my look can you bear to hear it  i think i can bear anything now  well then it was really what i wanted to give you an inkling of its largely over you that theyve quarrelled mr bousefield wants him to chuck you  i grabbed her arm again and limbert wont  he seems to cling to you mr bousefield says no magazine can afford you  i gave a laugh that agitated the very coachman why my dear lady has he any idea of my price  it isnt your pricehe says youre dear at any price you do so much to sink the ship your remarks are called occasional but nothing could be more deadly regular youre there month after month and youre never anywhere else and you supply no public want  i supply the most delicious irony  so ray appears to have declared mr bousefield says thats not in the least a public want no one can make out what youre talking about and no one would care if he could im only quoting him mind  quote quoteif limbert holds out i think i must leave you now please i must rush back to express to him what i feel  ill drive you to his door that isnt all said mrs highmore and on the way when the carriage had turned she communicated the rest mr bousefield really arrived with an ultimatum it had the form of something or other by minnie meadows  minnie meadows i was stupefied  the new ladyhumourist every one is talking about its the first of a series of screaming sketches for which poor ray was to find a place is that mr bousefields idea of literature no but he says its the publics and youve got to take some account of the public aux grands maux les grands remèdes they had a tremendous lot of ground to make up and no one would make it up like minnie she would be the best concession they could make to human weakness she would strike at least this note of showing that it was not going to be quite allwell all you now ray draws the line at minnie he wont stoop to minnie he declines to touch to look at minnie when mr bousefieldrather imperiously i believemade minnie a sine quâ non of his retention of his post he said something rather violent told him to go to some unmentionable place and take minnie with him that of course put the fat on the fire they had really a considerable scene  so had he with the beacon man i musingly replied poor dear he seems born for considerable scenes its on minnie then that theyve really split mrs highmore exhaled her despair in a sound which i took for an assent and when we had rolled a little further i rather inconsequently and to her visible surprise broke out of my reverie it will never do in the worldhe must stoop to minnie  its too lateand what ive told you still isnt all mr bousefield raises another objection  what other pray  cant you guess  i wondered no more of rays fiction  not a line thats something else no magazine can stand now that his novel has run its course mr bousefield is distinctly disappointed  i fairly bounded in my place then it may do  mrs highmore looked bewildered why so if he finds it too dull  dull ralph limbert hes as fine as a needle  it comes to the same thinghe wont penetrate leather mr bousefield had counted on something that would on something that would have a wider acceptance ray says he wants iron pegs i collapsed again my flicker of elation dropped to a throb of quieter comfort and after a moments silence i asked my neighbour if she had herself read the work our friend had just put forth no she replied i gave him my word at the beginning on his urgent request that i wouldnt  not even as a book  he begged me never to look at it at all he said he was trying a low experiment of course i knew what he meant and i entreated him to let me just for curiosity take a peep but he was firm he declared he couldnt bear the thought that a woman like me should see him in the depths  hes only thank god in the depths of distress i replied his experiments nothing worse than a failure  then bousefield is righthis circulation wont budge  it wont move one as they say in fleet street the book has extraordinary beauty  poor duckafter trying so hard jane highmore sighed with real tenderness what will then become of them  i was silent an instant you must take your mother  she was silent too i must speak of it to cecil she presently said cecil is mr highmore who then entertained i knew strong views on the inadjustability of circumstances in general to the idiosyncrasies of mrs stannace he held it supremely happy that in an important relation she should have met her match her match was ray limbertnot much of a writer but a practical man the dear things still think you know my companion continued that the book will be the beginning of their fortune their illusion if youre right will be rudely dispelled  thats what makes me dread to face them ive just spent with his volumes an unforgettable night his illusion has lasted because so many of us have been pledged till this moment to turn our faces the other way we havent known the truth and have therefore had nothing to say now that we do know it indeed we have practically quite as little i hang back from the threshold how can i follow up with a burst of enthusiasm such a catastrophe as mr bousefields visit  as i turned uneasily about my neighbour more comfortably snuggled well im glad then i havent read him and have nothing unpleasant to say we had come back to limberts door and i made the coachman stop short of it but hell try again with that determination of his hell build his hopes on the next time  on what else has he built them from the very first its never the present for him that bears the fruit thats always postponed and for somebody else there has always to be another try i admit that his idea of a new line has made him try harder than ever it makes no difference i brooded still timorously lingering his achievement of his necessity his hope of a market will continue to attach themselves to the future but the next time will disappoint him as each last time has doneand then the next and the next and the next  i found myself seeing it all with a clearness almost inspired it evidently cast a chill on mrs highmore then what on earth will become of him she plaintively asked  i dont think i particularly care what may become of him i returned with a conscious reckless increase of my exaltation i feel it almost enough to be concerned with what may become of ones enjoyment of him i dont know in short what will become of his circulation i am only quite at my ease as to what will become of his work it will simply keep all its quality hell try again for the common with what hell believe to be a still more infernal cunning and again the common will fatally elude him for his infernal cunning will have been only his genius in an ineffectual disguise we sat drawn up by the pavement facing poor limberts future as i saw it it relieved me in a manner to know the worst and i prophesied with an assurance which as i look back upon it strikes me as rather remarkable que voulezvous i went on you cant make a sows ear of a silk purse its grievous indeed if you likethere are people who cant be vulgar for trying he cantit wouldnt come off i promise you even once it takes more than tryingit comes by grace it happens not to be given to limbert to fall he belongs to the heightshe breathes there he lives there and its accordingly to the heights i must ascend i said as i took leave of my conductress to carry him this wretched news from where we move     v  a few months were sufficient to show how right i had been about his circulation it didnt move one as i had said it stopped short in the same place fell off in a sheer descent like some precipice gaped up at by tourists the public in other words drew the line for him as sharply as he had drawn it for minnie meadows minnie has skipped with a flouncing caper over his line however whereas the mark traced by a lustier cudgel has been a barrier insurmountable to limbert those next times i had spoken of to jane highmore i see them simplified by retrocession again and again he made his desperate bidagain and again he tried to his rupture with mr bousefield caused him i fear in professional circles to be thought impracticable and i am perfectly aware to speak candidly that no sordid advantage ever accrued to him from such public patronage of my performances as he had occasionally been in a position to offer i reflect for my comfort that any injury i may have done him by untimely application of a faculty of analysis which could point to no converts gained by honourable exercise was at least equalled by the injury he did himself more than once as i have hinted i held my tongue at his request but my frequent plea that such favours werent politic never found him when in other connections there was an opportunity to give me a lift anything but indifferent to the danger of the association he let them have me in a word whenever he could sometimes in periodicals in which he had credit sometimes only at dinner he talked about me when he couldnt get me in but it was always part of the bargain that i shouldnt make him a topic how can i successfully serve you if you do he used to ask he was more afraid than i thought he ought to have been of the charge of tit for tat i didnt care for i never could distinguish tat from tit but as i have intimated i dropped into silence really more than anything else because there was a certain fascinated observation of his course which was quite testimony enough and to which in this huddled conclusion of it he practically reduced me  i see it all foreshortened his wonderful remaindersee it from the end backward with the direction widening toward me as if on a level with the eye the migration to the country promised him at first great thingssmaller expenses larger leisure conditions eminently conducive on each occasion to the possible triumph of the next time mrs stannace who altogether disapproved of it gave as one of her reasons that her soninlaw living mainly in a village on the edge of a goosegreen would be deprived of that contact with the great world which was indispensable to the painter of manners she had the showiest arguments for keeping him in touch as she called it with good society wishing to know with some force where from the moment he ceased to represent it from observation the novelist could be said to be in london fortunately a clever man was just a clever man there were charming houses in which a person of rays undoubted ability even though without the knack of making the best use of it could always be sure of a quiet corner for watching decorously the social kaleidoscope but the kaleidoscope of the goosegreen what in the world was that and what such delusive thrift as drives about the land with a fearful account for flys from the inn to leave cards on the country magnates this solicitude for limberts subjectmatter was the specious colour with which deeply determined not to affront mere tolerance in a cottage mrs stannace overlaid her indisposition to place herself under the heel of cecil highmore she knew that he ruled upstairs as well as down and she clung to the fable of the association of interests in the north of london the highmores had a better addressthey lived now in stanhope gardens but cecil was fearfully artfulhe wouldnt hear of an association of interests nor treat with his motherinlaw save as a visitor she didnt like false positions but on the other hand she didnt like the sacrifice of everything she was accustomed to her universe at all events was a universe full of cardleavings and charming houses and it was fortunate that she couldnt upstairs catch the sound of the doom to which in his little grey den describing to me his diplomacy limbert consigned alike the country magnates and the opportunities of london despoiled of every guarantee she went to stanhope gardens like a mere maidservant with restrictions on her very luggage while during the year that followed this upheaval limbert strolling with me on the goosegreen to which i often ran down played extravagantly over the theme that with what he was now going in for it was a positive comfort not to have the social kaleidoscope with a coldblooded trick in view what had life or manners or the best society or flys from the inn to say to the question it was as good a place as another to play his new game he had found a quieter corner than any corner of the great world and a damp old house at sixpence a year which beside leaving him all his margin to educate his children would allow of the supreme luxury of his frankly presenting himself as a poor man this was a convenience that ces dames as he called them had never yet fully permitted him  it rankled in me at first to see his reward so meagre his conquest so mean but the simplification effected had a charm that i finally felt it was a forcinghouse for the three or four other fine miscarriages to which his scheme was evidently condemned i limited him to three or four having had my sharp impression in spite of the perpetual broad joke of the thing that a spring had really snapped in him on the occasion of that deeply disconcerting sequel to the episode of his editorship he never lost his sense of the grotesque want in the difference made of adequate relation to the effort that had been the intensest of his life he had from that moment a charge of shot in him and it slowly worked its way to a vital part as he met his embarrassments each year with his punctual false remedy i wondered periodically where he found the energy to return to the attack he did it every time with a rage more blanched but it was clear to me that the tension must finally snap the cord we got again and again the irrepressible work of art but what did he get poor man who wanted something so different there were likewise odder questions than this in the matter phenomena more curious and mysteries more puzzling which often for sympathy if not for illumination i intimately discussed with mrs limbert she had her burdens dear lady after the removal from london and a considerable interval she twice again became a mother mrs stannace too in a more restricted sense exhibited afresh in relation to the home she had abandoned the same exemplary character in her poverty of guarantees at stanhope gardens there had been least of all it appeared a proviso that she shouldnt resentfully revert again from goneril to regan she came down to the goosegreen like lear himself with fewer knights or at least baronets and the joint household was at last patched up it fell to pieces and was put together on various occasions before ray limbert died he was ridden to the end by the superstition that he had broken up mrs stannaces original home on pretences that had proved hollow and that if he hadnt given maud what she might have had he could at least give her back her mother i was always sure that a sense of the compensations he owed was half the motive of the dogged pride with which he tried to wake up the libraries i believed mrs stannace still had money though she pretended that called upon at every turn to retrieve deficits she had long since poured it into the general fund this conviction haunted me i suspected her of secret hoards and i said to myself that she couldnt be so infamous as not some day on her deathbed to leave everything to her less opulent daughter my compassion for the limberts led me to hover perhaps indiscreetly round that closing scene to dream of some happy time when such an accession of means would make up a little for their present penury  this however was crude comfort as in the first place i had nothing definite to go by and in the second i held it for more and more indicated that ray wouldnt outlive her i never ventured to sound him as to what in this particular he hoped or feared for after the crisis marked by his leaving london i had new scruples about suffering him to be reminded of where he fell short the poor man was in truth humiliated and there were things as to which that kept us both silent in proportion as he tried more fiercely for the market the old plaintiff arithmetic fertile in jokes dropped from our conversation we joked immensely still about the process but our treatment of the results became sparing and superficial he talked as much as ever with monstrous arts and borrowed hints of the traps he kept setting but we all agreed to take merely for granted that the animal was caught this propriety had really dawned upon me the day that after mr bousefields visit mrs highmore put me down at his door mr bousefield in that juncture had been served up to me anew but after we had disposed of him we came to the book which i was obliged to confess i had already rushed through it was from this momentthe moment at which my terrible impression of it had blinked out at his anxious querythat the image of his scared face was to abide with me i couldnt attenuate thenthe cat was out of the bag but later each of the next times i did i acknowledge attenuate we all did religiously so far as was possible we cast ingenious ambiguities over the strong places the beauties that betrayed him most and found ourselves in the queer position of admirers banded to mislead a confiding artist if we stifled our cheers however and dissimulated our joy our fond hypocrisy accomplished little for limberts finger was on a pulse that told a plainer story it was a satisfaction to have secured a greater freedom with his wife who at last much to her honour entered into the conspiracy and whose sense of responsibility was flattered by the frequency of our united appeal to her for some answer to the marvellous riddle we had all turned it over till we were tired of it threshing out the question why the note he strained every chord to pitch for common ears should invariably insist on addressing itself to the angels being as it were ourselves the angels we had only a limited quarrel in each case with the event but its inconsequent character given the forces set in motion was peculiarly baffling it was like an interminable sum that wouldnt come straight nobody had the time to handle so many figures limbert gathered to make his pudding dry bones and dead husks how then was one to formulate the law that made the dish prove a feast what was the cerebral treachery that defied his own vigilance there was some obscure interference of taste some obsession of the exquisite all one could say was that genius was a fatal disturber or that the unhappy man had no effectual flair when he went abroad to gather garlic he came home with heliotrope  i hasten to add that if mrs limbert was not directly illuminating she was yet rich in anecdote and example having found a refuge from mystification exactly where the rest of us had found it in a more devoted embrace and the sense of a finer glory her disappointments and eventually her privations had been many her discipline severe but she had ended by accepting the long grind of life and was now quite willing to take her turn at the mill she was essentially one of usshe always understood touching and admirable at the last when through the unmistakable change in limberts health her troubles were thickest was the spectacle of the particular pride that she wouldnt have exchanged for prosperity she had said to me onceonly once in a gloomy hour in london days when things were not going at allthat one really had to think him a very great man because if one didnt one would be rather ashamed of him she had distinctly felt it at firstand in a very tender placethat almost every one passed him on the road but i believe that in these final years she would almost have been ashamed of him if he had suddenly gone into editions it is certain indeed that her complacency was not subjected to that shock she would have liked the money immensely but she would have missed something she had taught herself to regard as rather rare there is another remark i remember her making a remark to the effect that of course if she could have chosen she would have liked him to be shakespeare or scott but that failing this she was very glad he wasntwell she named the two gentlemen but i wont i daresay she sometimes laughed out to escape an alternative she contributed passionately to the capture of the second manner foraging for him further afield than he could conveniently go gleaning in the barest stubble picking up shreds to build the nest and in particular in the study of the great secret of how as we always said they all did it laying waste the circulating libraries if limbert had a weakness he rather broke down in his reading it was fortunately not till after the appearance of the hidden heart that he broke down in everything else he had had rheumatic fever in the spring when the book was but half finished and this ordeal in addition to interrupting his work had enfeebled his powers of resistance and greatly reduced his vitality he recovered from the fever and was able to take up the book again but the organ of life was pronounced ominously weak and it was enjoined upon him with some sharpness that he should lend himself to no worries it might have struck me as on the cards that his worries would now be surmountable for when he began to mend he expressed to me a conviction almost contagious that he had never yet made so adroit a bid as in the idea of the hidden heart it is grimly droll to reflect that this superb little composition the shortest of his novels but perhaps the loveliest was planned from the first as an adventurestory on approved lines it was the way they all did the adventurestory that he tried most dauntlessly to emulate i wonder how many readers ever divined to which of their bookshelves the hidden heart was so exclusively addressed high medical advice early in the summer had been quite viciously clear as to the inconvenience that might ensue to him should he neglect to spend the winter in egypt he was not a man to neglect anything but egypt seemed to us all then as unattainable as a second edition he finished the hidden heart with the energy of apprehension and desire for if the book should happen to do what books of that class as the publisher said sometimes did he might well have a fund to draw on as soon as i read the deep and delicate thing i knew as i had known in each case before exactly how well it would do poor limbert in this long business always figured to me an undiscourageable parent to whom only girls kept being born a bouncing boy a son and heir was devoutly prayed for and almanacks and old wives consulted but the spell was inveterate incurable and the hidden heart proved so to speak but another female child when the winter arrived accordingly egypt was out of the question jane highmore to my knowledge wanted to lend him money and there were even greater devotees who did their best to induce him to lean on them there was so marked a movement among his friends that a very considerable sum would have been at his disposal but his stiffness was invincible it had its root i think in his sense on his own side of sacrifices already made he had sacrificed honour and pride and he had sacrificed them precisely to the question of money he would evidently should he be able to go on have to continue to sacrifice them but it must be all in the way to which he had now as he considered hardened himself he had spent years in plotting for favour and since on favour he must live it could only be as a bargain and a price  he got through the early part of the season better than we feared and i went down in great elation to spend christmas on the goosegreen  he told me late on christmas eve after our simple domestic revels had sunk to rest and we sat together by the fire that he had been visited the night before in wakeful hours by the finest fancy for a really good thing that he had ever felt descend in the darkness its just the vision of a situation that contains upon my honour everything he said and i wonder that ive never thought of it before he didnt describe it further contrary to his common practice and i only knew later by mrs limbert that he had begun derogation and that he was completely full of his subject it was a subject however that he was not to live to treat the work went on for a couple of months in happy mystery without revelations even to his wife he had not invited her to help him to get up his caseshe had not taken the field with him as on his previous campaigns we only knew he was at it again but that less even than ever had been said about the impression to be made on the market i saw him in february and thought him sufficiently at ease the great thing was that he was immensely interested and was pleased with the omens i got a strange stirring sense that he had not consulted the usual ones and indeed that he had floated away into a grand indifference into a reckless consciousness of art the voice of the market had suddenly grown faint and far he had come back at the last as people so often do to one of the moods the sincerities of his prime was he really with a blurred sense of the urgent doing something now only for himself we wondered and waitedwe felt that he was a little confused what had happened i was afterwards satisfied was that he had quite forgotten whether he generally sold or not he had merely waked up one morning again in the country of the blue and had stayed there with a good conscience and a great idea he stayed till death knocked at the gate for the pen dropped from his hand only at the moment when from sudden failure of the heart his eyes as he sank back in his chair closed for ever derogation is a splendid fragment it evidently would have been one of his high successes i am not prepared to say it would have waked up the libraries     the way it came  i find as you prophesied much thats interesting but little that helps the delicate questionthe possibility of publication her diaries are less systematic than i hoped she only had a blessed habit of noting and narrating she summarised she saved she appears seldom indeed to have let a good story pass without catching it on the wing i allude of course not so much to things she heard as to things she saw and felt she writes sometimes of herself sometimes of others sometimes of the combination its under this last rubric that shes usually most vivid but its not you will understand when shes most vivid that shes always most publishable to tell the truth shes fearfully indiscreet or has at least all the material for making me so take as an instance the fragment i send you after dividing it for your convenience into several small chapters it is the contents of a thin blankbook which i have had copied out and which has the merit of being nearly enough a rounded thing an intelligible whole these pages evidently date from years ago ive read with the liveliest wonder the statement they so circumstantially make and done my best to swallow the prodigy they leave to be inferred these things would be striking wouldnt they to any reader but can you imagine for a moment my placing such a document before the world even though as if she herself had desired the world should have the benefit of it she has given her friends neither name nor initials have you any sort of clue to their identity i leave her the floor     i  i know perfectly of course that i brought it upon myself but that doesnt make it any better i was the first to speak of her to himhe had never even heard her mentioned even if i had happened not to speak some one else would have made up for it i tried afterwards to find comfort in that reflection but the comfort of reflections is thin the only comfort that counts in life is not to have been a fool thats a beatitude i shall doubtless never enjoy why you ought to meet her and talk it over is what i immediately said birds of a feather flock together i told him who she was and that they were birds of a feather because if he had had in youth a strange adventure she had had about the same time just such another it was well known to her friendsan incident she was constantly called on to describe she was charming clever pretty unhappy but it was none the less the thing to which she had originally owed her reputation  being at the age of eighteen somewhere abroad with an aunt she had had a vision of one of her parents at the moment of death the parent was in england hundreds of miles away and so far as she knew neither dying nor dead it was by day in the museum of some great foreign town she had passed alone in advance of her companions into a small room containing some famous work of art and occupied at that moment by two other persons one of these was an old custodian the second before observing him she took for a stranger a tourist she was merely conscious that he was bareheaded and seated on a bench the instant her eyes rested on him however she beheld to her amazement her father who as if he had long waited for her looked at her in singular distress with an impatience that was akin to reproach she rushed to him with a bewildered cry papa what is it but this was followed by an exhibition of still livelier feeling when on her movement he simply vanished leaving the custodian and her relations who were at her heels to gather round her in dismay these persons the official the aunt the cousins were therefore in a manner witnesses of the factthe fact at least of the impression made on her and there was the further testimony of a doctor who was attending one of the party and to whom it was immediately afterwards communicated he gave her a remedy for hysterics but said to the aunt privately wait and see if something doesnt happen at home something had happenedthe poor father suddenly and violently seized had died that morning the aunt the mothers sister received before the day was out a telegram announcing the event and requesting her to prepare her niece for it her niece was already prepared and the girls sense of this visitation remained of course indelible we had all as her friends had it conveyed to us and had conveyed it creepily to each other twelve years had elapsed and as a woman who had made an unhappy marriage and lived apart from her husband she had become interesting from other sources but since the name she now bore was a name frequently borne and since moreover her judicial separation as things were going could hardly count as a distinction it was usual to qualify her as the one you know who saw her fathers ghost  as for him dear man he had seen his mothers i had never heard of that till this occasion on which our closer our pleasanter acquaintance led him through some turn of the subject of our talk to mention it and to inspire me in so doing with the impulse to let him know that he had a rival in the fielda person with whom he could compare notes later on his story became for him perhaps because of my unduly repeating it likewise a convenient wordly label but it had not a year before been the ground on which he was introduced to me he had other merits just as she poor thing had others i can honestly say that i was quite aware of them from the firsti discovered them sooner than he discovered mine i remember how it struck me even at the time that his sense of mine was quickened by my having been able to match though not indeed straight from my own experience his curious anecdote it dated this anecdote as hers did from some dozen years beforea year in which at oxford he had for some reason of his own been staying on into the long he had been in the august afternoon on the river coming back into his room while it was still distinct daylight he found his mother standing there as if her eyes had been fixed on the door he had had a letter from her that morning out of wales where she was staying with her father at the sight of him she smiled with extraordinary radiance and extended her arms to him and then as he sprang forward and joyfully opened his own she vanished from the place he wrote to her that night telling her what had happened the letter had been carefully preserved the next morning he heard of her death he was through this chance of our talk extremely struck with the little prodigy i was able to produce for him he had never encountered another case certainly they ought to meet my friend and he certainly they would have something in common i would arrange this wouldnt iif she didnt mind for himself he didnt mind in the least i had promised to speak to her of the matter as soon as possible and within the week i was able to do so she minded as little as he she was perfectly willing to see him and yet no meeting was to occuras meetings are commonly understood     ii  thats just half my talethe extraordinary way it was hindered this was the fault of a series of accidents but the accidents continued for years and became for me and for others a subject of hilarity with either party they were droll enough at first then they grew rather a bore the odd thing was that both parties were amenable it wasnt a case of their being indifferent much less of their being indisposed it was one of the caprices of chance aided i suppose by some opposition of their interests and habits his were centred in his office his eternal inspectorship which left him small leisure constantly calling him away and making him break engagements he liked society but he found it everywhere and took it at a run i never knew at a given moment where he was and there were times when for months together i never saw him she was on her side practically suburban she lived at richmond and never went out she was a woman of distinction but not of fashion and felt as people said her situation decidedly proud and rather whimsical she lived her life as she had planned it there were things one could do with her but one couldnt make her come to ones parties one went indeed a little more than seemed quite convenient to hers which consisted of her cousin a cup of tea and the view the tea was good but the view was familiar though perhaps not like the cousina disagreeable old maid who had been of the group at the museum and with whom she now livedoffensively so this connection with an inferior relative which had partly an economical motiveshe proclaimed her companion a marvellous managerwas one of the little perversities we had to forgive her another was her estimate of the proprieties created by her rupture with her husband that was extrememany persons called it even morbid she made no advances she cultivated scruples she suspected or i should perhaps rather say she remembered slights she was one of the few women i have known whom that particular predicament had rendered modest rather than bold dear thing she had some delicacy especially marked were the limits she had set to possible attentions from men it was always her thought that her husband was waiting to pounce on her she discouraged if she didnt forbid the visits of male persons not senile she said she could never be too careful  when i first mentioned to her that i had a friend whom fate had distinguished in the same weird way as herself i put her quite at liberty to say oh bring him out to see me i should probably have been able to bring him and a situation perfectly innocent or at any rate comparatively simple would have been created but she uttered no such word she only said i must meet him certainly yes i shall look out for him that caused the first delay and meanwhile various things happened one of them was that as time went on she made charming as she was more and more friends and that it regularly befell that these friends were sufficiently also friends of his to bring him up in conversation it was odd that without belonging as it were to the same world or according to the horrid term the same set my baffled pair should have happened in so many cases to fall in with the same people and make them join in the funny chorus she had friends who didnt know each other but who inevitably and punctually recommended him she had also the sort of originality the intrinsic interest that led her to be kept by each of us as a kind of private resource cultivated jealously more or less in secret as a person whom one didnt meet in society whom it was not for every onewhom it was not for the vulgarto approach and with whom therefore acquaintance was particularly difficult and particularly precious we saw her separately with appointments and conditions and found it made on the whole for harmony not to tell each other somebody had always had a note from her still later than somebody else there was some silly woman who for a long time among the unprivileged owed to three simple visits to richmond a reputation for being intimate with lots of awfully clever outoftheway people  every one has had friends it has seemed a happy thought to bring together and every one remembers that his happiest thoughts have not been his greatest successes but i doubt if there was ever a case in which the failure was in such direct proportion to the quantity of influence set in motion it is really perhaps here the quantity of influence that was most remarkable my lady and gentleman each declared to me and others that it was like the subject of a roaring farce the reason first given had with time droppedout of sight and fifty better ones flourished on top of it they were so awfully alike they had the same ideas and tricks and tastes the same prejudices and superstitions and heresies they said the same things and sometimes did them they liked and disliked the same persons and places the same books authors and styles any one could see a certain identity even in their looks and their features it established much of a propriety that they were in common parlance equally nice and almost equally handsome but the great sameness for wonder and chatter was their rare perversity in regard to being photographed they were the only persons ever heard of who had never been taken and who had a passionate objection to it they just wouldnt be for anything any one could say i had loudly complained of this him in particular i had so vainly desired to be able to show on my drawingroom chimneypiece in a bond street frame it was at any rate the very liveliest of all the reasons why they ought to know each otherall the lively reasons reduced to naught by the strange law that had made them bang so many doors in each others face made them the buckets in the well the two ends of the seesaw the two parties in the state so that when one was up the other was down when one was out the other was in neither by any possibility entering a house till the other had left it or leaving it all unawares till the other was at hand they only arrived when they had been given up which was precisely also when they departed they were in a word alternate and incompatible they missed each other with an inveteracy that could be explained only by its being preconcerted it was however so far from preconcerted that it had endedliterally after several yearsby disappointing and annoying them i dont think their curiosity was lively till it had been proved utterly vain a great deal was of course done to help them but it merely laid wires for them to trip to give examples i should have to have taken notes but i happen to remember that neither had ever been able to dine on the right occasion the right occasion for each was the occasion that would be wrong for the other on the wrong one they were most punctual and there were never any but wrong ones the very elements conspired and the constitution of man reinforced them a cold a headache a bereavement a storm a fog an earthquake a cataclysm infallibly intervened the whole business was beyond a joke  yet as a joke it had still to be taken though one couldnt help feeling that the joke had made the situation serious had produced on the part of each a consciousness an awkwardness a positive dread of the last accident of all the only one with any freshness left the accident that would bring them face to face the final effect of its predecessors had been to kindle this instinct they were quite ashamedperhaps even a little of each other so much preparation so much frustration what indeed could be good enough for it all to lead up to a mere meeting would be mere flatness did i see them at the end of years they often asked just stupidly confronted if they were bored by the joke they might be worse bored by something else they made exactly the same reflections and each in some manner was sure to hear of the others  i really think it was this peculiar diffidence that finally controlled the situation i mean that if they had failed for the first year or two because they couldnt help it they kept up the habit because they hadwhat shall i call itgrown nervous it really took some lurking volition to account for anything so absurd     iii  when to crown our long acquaintance i accepted his renewed offer of marriage it was humorously said i know that i had made the gift of his photograph a condition this was so far true that i had refused to give him mine without it at any rate i had him at last in his high distinction on the chimneypiece where the day she called to congratulate me she came nearer than she had ever done to seeing him he had set her in being taken an example which i invited her to follow he had sacrificed his perversitywouldnt she sacrifice hers she too must give me something on my engagementwouldnt she give me the companionpiece she laughed and shook her head she had headshakes whose impulse seemed to come from as far away as the breeze that stirs a flower the companionpiece to the portrait of my future husband was the portrait of his future wife she had taken her standshe could depart from it as little as she could explain it it was a prejudice an entêtement a vowshe would live and die unphotographed now too she was alone in that state this was what she liked it made her so much more original she rejoiced in the fall of her late associate and looked a long time at his picture about which she made no memorable remark though she even turned it over to see the back about our engagement she was charmingfull of cordiality and sympathy youve known him even longer than ive not she said and that seems a very long time she understood how we had jogged together over hill and dale and how inevitable it was that we should now rest together im definite about all this because what followed is so strange that its a kind of relief to me to mark the point up to which our relations were as natural as ever it was i myself who in a sudden madness altered and destroyed them i see now that she gave me no pretext and that i only found one in the way she looked at the fine face in the bond street frame how then would i have had her look at it what i had wanted from the first was to make her care for him well that was what i still wantedup to the moment of her having promised me that he would on this occasion really aid me to break the silly spell that had kept them asunder i had arranged with him to do his part if she would as triumphantly do hers i was on a different footing nowi was on a footing to answer for him i would positively engage that at five on the following saturday he would be on that spot he was out of town on pressing business but pledged to keep his promise to the letter he would return on purpose and in abundant time are you perfectly sure i remember she asked looking grave and considering i thought she had turned a little pale she was tired she was indisposed it was a pity he was to see her after all at so poor a moment if he only could have seen her five years before however i replied that this time i was sure and that success therefore depended simply on herself at five oclock on the saturday she would find him in a particular chair i pointed out the one in which he usually sat and in whichthough this i didnt mentionhe had been sitting when the week before he put the question of our future to me in the way that had brought me round she looked at it in silence just as she had looked at the photograph while i repeated for the twentieth time that it was too preposterous it shouldnt somehow be feasible to introduce to ones dearest friend ones second self am i your dearest friend she asked with a smile that for a moment brought back her beauty i replied by pressing her to my bosom after which she said well ill come im extraordinarily afraid but you may count on me  when she had left me i began to wonder what she was afraid of for she had spoken as if she fully meant it the next day late in the afternoon i had three lines from her she had found on getting home the announcement of her husbands death she had not seen him for seven years but she wished me to know it in this way before i should hear of it in another it made however in her life strange and sad to say so little difference that she would scrupulously keep her appointment i rejoiced for heri supposed it would make at least the difference of her having more money but even in this diversion far from forgetting that she had said she was afraid i seemed to catch sight of a reason for her being so her fear as the evening went on became contagious and the contagion took in my breast the form of a sudden panic it wasnt jealousyit was the dread of jealousy i called myself a fool for not having been quiet till we were man and wife after that i should somehow feel secure it was only a question of waiting another montha trifle surely for people who had waited so long it had been plain enough she was nervous and now that she was free she naturally wouldnt be less so what was her nervousness therefore but a presentiment she had been hitherto the victim of interference but it was quite possible she would henceforth be the source of it the victim in that case would be my simple self what had the interference been but the finger of providence pointing out a danger the danger was of course for poor me it had been kept at bay by a series of accidents unexampled in their frequency but the reign of accident was now visibly at an end i had an intimate conviction that both parties would keep the tryst it was more and more impressed upon me that they were approaching converging we had talked about breaking the spell well it would be effectually brokenunless indeed it should merely take another form and overdo their encounters as it had overdone their escapes  this was something i couldnt sit still for thinking of it kept me awakeat midnight i was full of unrest at last i felt there was only one way of laying the ghost if the reign of accident was over i must just take up the succession i sat down and wrote a hurried note which would meet him on his return and which as the servants had gone to bed i sallied forth bareheaded into the empty gusty street to drop into the nearest pillarbox it was to tell him that i shouldnt be able to be at home in the afternoon as i had hoped and that he must postpone his visit till dinnertime this was an implication that he would find me alone     iv  when accordingly at five she presented herself i naturally felt false and base my act had been a momentary madness but i had at least to be consistent she remained an hour he of course never came and i could only persist in my perfidy i had thought it best to let her come singular as this now seems to me i thought it diminished my guilt yet as she sat there so visibly white and weary stricken with a sense of everything her husbands death had opened up i felt an almost intolerable pang of pity and remorse if i didnt tell her on the spot what i had done it was because i was too ashamed i feigned astonishmenti feigned it to the end i protested that if ever i had had confidence i had had it that day i blush as i tell my storyi take it as my penance there was nothing indignant i didnt say about him i invented suppositions attenuations i admitted in stupefaction as the hands of the clock travelled that their luck hadnt turned she smiled at this vision of their luck but she looked anxiousshe looked unusual the only thing that kept me up was the fact that oddly enough she wore mourningno great depths of crape but simple and scrupulous black she had in her bonnet three small black feathers she carried a little muff of astrachan this put me by the aid of some acute reflection a little in the right she had written to me that the sudden event made no difference for her but apparently it made as much difference as that if she was inclined to the usual forms why didnt she observe that of not going the first day or two out to tea there was some one she wanted so much to see that she couldnt wait till her husband was buried such a betrayal of eagerness made me hard and cruel enough to practise my odious deceit though at the same time as the hour waxed and waned i suspected in her something deeper still than disappointment and somewhat less successfully concealed i mean a strange underlying relief the soft low emission of the breath that comes when a danger is past what happened as she spent her barren hour with me was that at last she gave him up she let him go for ever she made the most graceful joke of it that ive ever seen made of anything but it was for all that a great date in her life she spoke with her mild gaiety of all the other vain times the long game of hideandseek the unprecedented queerness of such a relation for it was or had been a relation wasnt it hadnt it that was just the absurd part of it when she got up to go i said to her that it was more a relation than ever but that i hadnt the face after what had occurred to propose to her for the present another opportunity it was plain that the only valid opportunity would be my accomplished marriage of course she would be at my wedding it was even to be hoped that he would  if i am he wont be she declared with a laugh i admitted there might be something in that the thing was therefore to get us safely married first that wont help us nothing will help us she said as she kissed me farewell i shall never never see him it was with those words she left me  i could bear her disappointment as ive called it but when a couple of hours later i received him at dinner i found that i couldnt bear his the way my manoeuvre might have affected him had not been particularly present to me but the result of it was the first word of reproach that had ever yet dropped from him i say reproach because that expression is scarcely too strong for the terms in which he conveyed to me his surprise that under the extraordinary circumstances i should not have found some means not to deprive him of such an occasion i might really have managed either not to be obliged to go out or to let their meeting take place all the same they would probably have got on in my drawingroom without me at this i quite broke downi confessed my iniquity and the miserable reason of it i had not put her off and i had not gone out she had been there and after waiting for him an hour had departed in the belief that he had been absent by his own fault  she must think me a precious brute he exclaimed did she say of mewhat she had a right to say  i assure you she said nothing that showed the least feeling she looked at your photograph she even turned round the back of it on which your address happens to be inscribed yet it provoked her to no demonstration she doesnt care so much as all that  then why are you afraid of her  it was not of her i was afraid it was of you  did you think i would fall in love with her you never alluded to such a possibility before he went on as i remained silent admirable person as you pronounced her that wasnt the light in which you showed her to me  do you mean that if it had been you would have managed by this time to catch a glimpse of her i didnt fear things then i added i hadnt the same reason  he kissed me at this and when i remembered that she had done so an hour or two before i felt for an instant as if he were taking from my lips the very pressure of hers in spite of kisses the incident had shed a certain chill and i suffered horribly from the sense that he had seen me guilty of a fraud he had seen it only through my frank avowal but i was as unhappy as if i had a stain to efface i couldnt get over the manner of his looking at me when i spoke of her apparent indifference to his not having come  for the first time since i had known him he seemed to have expressed a doubt of my word before we parted i told him that i would undeceive her start the first thing in the morning for richmond and there let her know that he had been blameless at this he kissed me again i would expiate my sin i said i would humble myself in the dust i would confess and ask to be forgiven at this he kissed me once more     v  in the train the next day this struck me as a good deal for him to have consented to but my purpose was firm enough to carry me on i mounted the long hill to where the view begins and then i knocked at her door i was a trifle mystified by the fact that her blinds were still drawn reflecting that if in the stress of my compunction i had come early i had certainly yet allowed people time to get up  at home mum she has left home for ever  i was extraordinarily startled by this announcement of the elderly parlourmaid she has gone away  shes dead mum please then as i gasped at the horrible word she died last night  the loud cry that escaped me sounded even in my own ears like some harsh violation of the hour i felt for the moment as if i had killed her i turned faint and saw through a vagueness the woman hold out her arms to me of what next happened i have no recollection nor of anything but my friends poor stupid cousin in a darkened room after an interval that i suppose very brief sobbing at me in a smothered accusatory way i cant say how long it took me to understand to believe and then to press back with an immense effort that pang of responsibility which superstitiously insanely had been at first almost all i was conscious of the doctor after the fact had been superlatively wise and clear he was satisfied of a longlatent weakness of the heart determined probably years before by the agitations and terrors to which her marriage had introduced her she had had in those days cruel scenes with her husband she had been in fear of her life all emotion everything in the nature of anxiety and suspense had been after that to be strongly deprecated as in her marked cultivation of a quiet life she was evidently well aware but who could say that any one especially a real lady could be successfully protected from every little rub she had had one a day or two before in the news of her husbands death for there were shocks of all kinds not only those of grief and surprise for that matter she had never dreamed of so near a release it had looked uncommonly as if he would live as long as herself then in the evening in town she had manifestly had another something must have happened there which it would be indispensable to clear up she had come back very lateit was past eleven oclock and on being met in the hall by her cousin who was extremely anxious had said that she was tired and must rest a moment before mounting the stairs they had passed together into the diningroom her companion proposing a glass of wine and bustling to the sideboard to pour it out this took but a moment and when my informant turned round our poor friend had not had time to seat herself suddenly with a little moan that was barely audible she dropped upon the sofa she was dead what unknown little rub had dealt her the blow what shock in the name of wonder had she had in town i mentioned immediately the only one i could imagineher having failed to meet at my house to which by invitation for the purpose she had come at five oclock the gentleman i was to be married to who had been accidentally kept away and with whom she had no acquaintance whatever this obviously counted for little but something else might easily have occurred nothing in the london streets was more possible than an accident especially an accident in those desperate cabs what had she done where had she gone on leaving my house i had taken for granted she had gone straight home we both presently remembered that in her excursions to town she sometimes for convenience for refreshment spent an hour or two at the gentlewomen the quiet little ladies club and i promised that it should be my first care to make at that establishment thorough inquiry then we entered the dim and dreadful chamber where she lay locked up in death and where asking after a little to be left alone with her i remained for half an hour death had made her had kept her beautiful but i felt above all as i kneeled at her bed that it had made her had kept her silent it had turned the key on something i was concerned to know  on my return from richmond and after another duty had been performed i drove to his chambers it was the first time but i had often wanted to see them on the staircase which as the house contained twenty sets of rooms was unrestrictedly public i met his servant who went back with me and ushered me in at the sound of my entrance he appeared in the doorway of a further room and the instant we were alone i produced my news shes dead  dead  he was tremendously struck and i observed that he had no need to ask whom in this abruptness i meant  she died last eveningjust after leaving me  he stared with the strangest expression his eyes searching mine as if they were looking for a trap last eveningafter leaving you he repeated my words in stupefaction then he brought out so that it was in stupefaction i heard impossible i saw her  you saw her  on that spotwhere you stand  this brought back to me after an instant as if to help me to take it in the memory of the strange warning of his youth in the hour of deathi understand as you so beautifully saw your mother  ah not as i saw my mothernot that way not that way he was deeply moved by my newsfar more moved i perceived than he would have been the day before it gave me a vivid sense that as i had then said to myself there was indeed a relation between them and that he had actually been face to face with her such an idea by its reassertion of his extraordinary privilege would have suddenly presented him as painfully abnormal had he not so vehemently insisted on the difference i saw her livingi saw her to speak to heri saw her as i see you now  it is remarkable that for a moment though only for a moment i found relief in the more personal as it were but also the more natural of the two phenomena the next as i embraced this image of her having come to him on leaving me and of just what it accounted for in the disposal of her time i demanded with a shade of harshness of which i was awarewhat on earth did she come for he had now had a minute to thinkto recover himself and judge of effects so that if it was still with excited eyes he spoke he showed a conscious redness and made an inconsequent attempt to smile away the gravity of his words  she came just to see me she cameafter what had passed at your houseso that we should after all at last meet the impulse seemed to me exquisite and that was the way i took it  i looked round the room where she had beenwhere she had been and i never had been  and was the way you took it the way she expressed it  she only expressed it by being here and by letting me look at her that was enough he exclaimed with a singular laugh  i wondered more and more you mean she didnt speak to you  she said nothing she only looked at me as i looked at her  and you didnt speak either  he gave me again his painful smile i thought of you the situation was every way delicate i used the finest tact but she saw she had pleased me he even repeated his dissonant laugh  she evidently pleased you then i thought a moment how long did she stay  how can i say it seemed twenty minutes but it was probably a good deal less  twenty minutes of silence i began to have my definite view and now in fact quite to clutch at it do you know youre telling me a story positively monstrous  he had been standing with his back to the fire at this with a pleading look he came to me i beseech you dearest to take it kindly  i could take it kindly and i signified as much but i couldnt somehow as he rather awkwardly opened his arms let him draw me to him so there fell between us for an appreciable time the discomfort of a great silence     vi  he broke it presently by saying theres absolutely no doubt of her death  unfortunately none ive just risen from my knees by the bed where theyve laid her out  he fixed his eyes hard on the floor then he raised them to mine how does she look  she looksat peace  he turned away again while i watched him but after a moment he began at what hour then  it must have been near midnight she dropped as she reached her housefrom an affection of the heart which she knew herself and her physician knew her to have but of which patiently bravely she had never spoken to me  he listened intently and for a minute he was unable to speak at last he broke out with an accent of which the almost boyish confidence the really sublime simplicity rings in my ears as i write wasnt she wonderful even at the time i was able to do it justice enough to remark in reply that i had always told him so but the next minute as if after speaking he had caught a glimpse of what he might have made me feel he went on quickly you see that if she didnt get home till midnight  i instantly took him up there was plenty of time for you to have seen her how so i inquired when you didnt leave my house till late i dont remember the very momenti was preoccupied but you know that though you said you had lots to do you sat for some time after dinner she on her side was all the evening at the gentlewomen ive just come from thereive ascertained she had tea there she remained a long long time  what was she doing all the long long time i saw that he was eager to challenge at every step my account of the matter and the more he showed this the more i found myself disposed to insist on that account to prefer with apparent perversity an explanation which only deepened the marvel and the mystery but which of the two prodigies it had to choose from my reviving jealousy found easiest to accept he stood there pleading with a candour that now seems to me beautiful for the privilege of having in spite of supreme defeat known the living woman while i with a passion i wonder at today though it still smoulders in a manner in its ashes could only reply that through a strange gift shared by her with his mother and on her own side likewise hereditary the miracle of his youth had been renewed for him the miracle of hers for her she had been to himyes and by an impulse as charming as he liked but oh she had not been in the body it was a simple question of evidence i had had i assured him a definite statement of what she had donemost of the timeat the little club the place was almost empty but the servants had noticed her she had sat motionless in a deep chair by the drawingroom fire she had leaned back her head she had closed her eyes she had seemed softly to sleep  i see but till what oclock  there i was obliged to answer the servants fail me a little the portress in particular is unfortunately a fool though even she too is supposed to be a gentlewoman she was evidently at that period of the evening without a substitute and against regulations absent for some little time from the cage in which its her business to watch the comings and goings shes muddled she palpably prevaricates so i cant positively from her observation give you an hour but it was remarked toward halfpast ten that our poor friend was no longer in the club  she came straight here and from here she went straight to the train  she couldnt have run it so close i declared that was a thing she particularly never did  there was no need of running it close my dearshe had plenty of time your memory is at fault about my having left you late i left you as it happens unusually early im sorry my stay with you seemed long for i was back here by ten  to put yourself into your slippers i rejoined and fall asleep in your chair you slept till morningyou saw her in a dream he looked at me in silence and with sombre eyeseyes that showed me he had some irritation to repress presently i went on you had a visit at an extraordinary hour from a ladysoit nothing in the world is more probable but there are ladies and ladies how in the name of goodness if she was unannounced and dumb and you had into the bargain never seen the least portrait of herhow could you identify the person were talking of  havent i to absolute satiety heard her described ill describe her for you in every particular  dont i exclaimed with a promptness that made him laugh once more i coloured at this but i continued did your servant introduce her  he wasnt herehes always away when hes wanted one of the features of this big house is that from the streetdoor the different floors are accessible practically without challenge my servant makes love to a young person employed in the rooms above these and he had a long bout of it last evening when hes out on that job he leaves my outer door on the staircase so much ajar as to enable him to slip back without a sound the door then only requires a push she pushed itthat simply took a little courage  a little it took tons and it took all sorts of impossible calculations  well she had themshe made them mind you i dont deny for a moment he added that it was very very wonderful  something in his tone prevented me for a while from trusting myself to speak at last i said how did she come to know where you live  by remembering the address on the little label the shoppeople happily left sticking to the frame i had had made for my photograph  and how was she dressed  in mourning my own dear no great depths of crape but simple and scrupulous black she had in her bonnet three small black feathers she carried a little muff of astrachan she has near the left eye he continued a tiny vertical scar  i stopped him short the mark of a caress from her husband then i added how close you must have been to her he made no answer to this and i thought he blushed observing which i broke straight off well goodbye  you wont stay a little he came to me again tenderly and this time i suffered him her visit had its beauty he murmured as he held me but yours has a greater one  i let him kiss me but i remembered as i had remembered the day before that the last kiss she had given as i supposed in this world had been for the lips he touched  im life you see i answered what you saw last night was death  it was lifeit was life  he spoke with a kind of soft stubbornness and i disengaged myself we stood looking at each other hard  you describe the sceneso far as you describe it at allin terms that are incomprehensible she was in the room before you knew it  i looked up from my letterwritingat that table under the lamp i had been wholly absorbed in itand she stood before me  then what did you do  i sprang up with an ejaculation and she with a smile laid her finger ever so warningly yet with a sort of delicate dignity to her lips i knew it meant silence but the strange thing was that it seemed immediately to explain and to justify her we at any rate stood for a time that as ive told you i cant calculate face to face it was just as you and i stand now  simply staring  he impatiently protested ah were not staring  yes but were talking  well we wereafter a fashion he lost himself in the memory of it it was as friendly as this i had it on my tongues end to ask if that were saying much for it but i remarked instead that what they had evidently done was to gaze in mutual admiration then i inquired whether his recognition of her had been immediate not quite he replied for of course i didnt expect her but it came to me long before she went who she waswho she could only be  i thought a little and how did she at last go  just as she arrived the door was open behind her and she passed out  was she rapidslow  rather quick but looking behind her he added with a smile i let her go for i perfectly understood that i was to take it as she wished  i was conscious of exhaling a long vague sigh well you must take it now as i wishyou must let me go  at this he drew near me again detaining and persuading me declaring with all due gallantry that i was a very different matter i would have given anything to have been able to ask him if he had touched her but the words refused to form themselves i knew well enough how horrid and vulgar they would sound i said something elsei forget exactly what it was feebly tortuous and intended to make him tell me without my putting the question but he didnt tell me he only repeated as if from a glimpse of the propriety of soothing and consoling me the sense of his declaration of some minutes beforethe assurance that she was indeed exquisite as i had always insisted but that i was his real friend and his very own for ever this led me to reassert in the spirit of my previous rejoinder that i had at least the merit of being alive which in turn drew from him again the flash of contradiction i dreaded oh she was alive she was she was  she was dead she was dead i asseverated with an energy a determination that it should be so which comes back to me now almost as grotesque but the sound of the word as it rang out filled me suddenly with horror and all the natural emotion the meaning of it might have evoked in other conditions gathered and broke in a flood it rolled over me that here was a great affection quenched and how much i had loved and trusted her i had a vision at the same time of the lonely beauty of her end shes goneshes lost to us for ever i burst into sobs  thats exactly what i feel he exclaimed speaking with extreme kindness and pressing me to him for comfort shes gone shes lost to us for ever so what does it matter now he bent over me and when his face had touched mine i scarcely knew if it were wet with my tears or with his own     vii  it was my theory my conviction it became as i may say my attitude that they had still never met and it was just on this ground that i said to myself it would be generous to ask him to stand with me beside her grave he did so very modestly and tenderly and i assumed though he himself clearly cared nothing for the danger that the solemnity of the occasion largely made up of persons who had known them both and had a sense of the long joke would sufficiently deprive his presence of all light association on the question of what had happened the evening of her death little more passed between us i had been overtaken by a horror of the element of evidence it seemed gross and prying on either hypothesis he on his side had none to produce none at least but a statement of his houseporteron his own admission a most casual and intermittent personagethat between the hours of ten oclock and midnight no less than three ladies in deep black had flitted in and out of the place this proved far too much we had neither of us any use for three he knew that i considered i had accounted for every fragment of her time and we dropped the matter as settled we abstained from further discussion what i knew however was that he abstained to please me rather than because he yielded to my reasons he didnt yieldhe was only indulgent he clung to his interpretation because he liked it better he liked it better i held because it had more to say to his vanity that in a similar position would not have been its effect on me though i had doubtless quite as much but these are things of individual humour as to which no person can judge for another i should have supposed it more gratifying to be the subject of one of those inexplicable occurrences that are chronicled in thrilling books and disputed about at learned meetings i could conceive on the part of a being just engulfed in the infinite and still vibrating with human emotion of nothing more fine and pure more high and august than such an impulse of reparation of admonition or even of curiosity that was beautiful if one would and i should in his place have thought more of myself for being so distinguished it was public that he had already that he had long been distinguished and what was this in itself but almost a proof each of the strange visitations contributed to establish the other he had a different feeling but he had also i hasten to add an unmistakable desire not to make a stand or as they say a fuss about it i might believe what i likedthe more so that the whole thing was in a manner a mystery of my producing it was an event of my history a puzzle of my consciousness not of his therefore he would take about it any tone that struck me as convenient we had both at all events other business on hand we were pressed with preparations for our marriage  mine were assuredly urgent but i found as the days went on that to believe what i liked was to believe what i was more and more intimately convinced of i found also that i didnt like it so much as that came to or that the pleasure at all events was far from being the cause of my conviction my obsession as i may really call it and as i began to perceive refused to be elbowed away as i had hoped by my sense of paramount duties if i had a great deal to do i had still more to think about and the moment came when my occupations were gravely menaced by my thoughts i see it all now i feel it i live it over its terribly void of joy its full indeed to overflowing of bitterness and yet i must do myself justicei couldnt possibly be other than i was the same strange impressions had i to meet them againwould produce the same deep anguish the same sharp doubts the same still sharper certainties oh its all easier to remember than to write but even if i could retrace the business hour by hour could find terms for the inexpressible the ugliness and the pain would quickly stay my hand let me then note very simply and briefly that a week before our weddingday three weeks after her death i became fully aware that i had something very serious to look in the face and that if i was to make this effort i must make it on the spot and before another hour should elapse my unextinguished jealousythat was the medusamask it hadnt died with her death it had lividly survived and it was fed by suspicions unspeakable they would be unspeakable today that is if i hadnt felt the sharp need of uttering them at the time  this need took possession of meto save me as it appeared from my fate when once it had done so i sawin the urgency of the case the diminishing hours and shrinking intervalonly one issue that of absolute promptness and frankness i could at least not do him the wrong of delaying another day i could at least treat my difficulty as too fine for a subterfuge therefore very quietly but none the less abruptly and hideously i put it before him on a certain evening that we must reconsider our situation and recognise that it had completely altered  he stared bravely how has it altered another person has come between us he hesitated a moment i wont pretend not to know whom you mean he smiled in pity for my aberration but he meant to be kind a woman dead and buried  shes buried but shes not dead shes dead for the worldshes dead for me but shes not dead for you  you hark back to the different construction we put on her appearance that evening  no i answered i hark back to nothing ive no need of it ive more than enough with whats before me  and pray darling what is that  youre completely changed  by that absurdity he laughed  not so much by that one as by other absurdities that have followed it  and what may they have been  we had faced each other fairly with eyes that didnt flinch but his had a dim strange light and my certitude triumphed in his perceptible paleness do you really pretend i asked not to know what they are  my dear child he replied you describe them too sketchily  i considered a moment one may well be embarrassed to finish the picture but from that point of viewand from the beginningwhat was ever more embarrassing than your idiosyncrasy  he was extremely vague my idiosyncrasy  your notorious your peculiar power  he gave a great shrug of impatience a groan of overdone disdain oh my peculiar power  your accessibility to forms of life i coldly went on your command of impressions appearances contacts closedfor our gain or our lossto the rest of us that was originally a part of the deep interest with which you inspired meone of the reasons i was amused i was indeed positively proud to know you it was a magnificent distinction its a magnificent distinction still but of course i had no prevision then of the way it would operate now and even had that been the case i should have had none of the extraordinary way in which its action would affect me  to what in the name of goodness he pleadingly inquired are you fantastically alluding then as i remained silent gathering a tone for my charge how in the world does it operate he went on and how in the world are you affected  she missed you for five years i said but she never misses you now youre making it up  making it up he had begun to turn from white to red  you see heryou see her you see her every night he gave a loud sound of derision but it was not a genuine one she comes to you as she came that evening i declared having tried it she found she liked it i was able with gods help to speak without blind passion or vulgar violence but those were the exact wordsand far from sketchy they then appeared to methat i uttered he had turned away in his laughter clapping his hands at my folly but in an instant he faced me again with a change of expression that struck me do you dare to deny i asked that you habitually see her  he had taken the line of indulgence of meeting me halfway and kindly humouring me at all events to my astonishment he suddenly said well my dear what if i do  its your natural right it belongs to your constitution and to your wonderful if not perhaps quite enviable fortune but you will easily understand that it separates us i unconditionally release you  release me  you must choose between me and her  he looked at me hard i see then he walked away a little as if grasping what i had said and thinking how he had best treat it at last he turned upon me afresh how on earth do you know such an awfully private thing  you mean because youve tried so hard to hide it it is awfully private and you may believe i shall never betray you youve done your best youve acted your part youve behaved poor dear loyally and admirably therefore ive watched you in silence playing my part too ive noted every drop in your voice every absence in your eyes every effort in your indifferent hand ive waited till i was utterly sure and miserably unhappy how can you hide it when youre abjectly in love with her when youre sick almost to death with the joy of what she gives you i checked his quick protest with a quicker gesture you love her as youve never loved and passion for passion she gives it straight back she rules you she holds you she has you all a woman in such a case as mine divines and feels and sees shes not an idiot who has to be credibly informed you come to me mechanically compunctiously with the dregs of your tenderness and the remnant of your life i can renounce you but i cant share you the best of you is hers i know what it is and i freely give you up to her for ever  he made a gallant fight but it couldnt be patched up he repeated his denial he retracted his admission he ridiculed my charge of which i freely granted him moreover the indefensible extravagance i didnt pretend for a moment that we were talking of common things i didnt pretend for a moment that he and she were common people pray if they had been how should i ever have cared for them they had enjoyed a rare extension of being and they had caught me up in their flight only i couldnt breathe in such an air and i promptly asked to be set down everything in the facts was monstrous and most of all my lucid perception of them the only thing allied to nature and truth was my having to act on that perception i felt after i had spoken in this sense that my assurance was complete nothing had been wanting to it but the sight of my effect on him he disguised indeed the effect in a cloud of chaff a diversion that gained him time and covered his retreat he challenged my sincerity my sanity almost my humanity and that of course widened our breach and confirmed our rupture he did everything in short but convince me either that i was wrong or that he was unhappy we separated and i left him to his inconceivable communion  he never married any more than ive done when six years later in solitude and silence i heard of his death i hailed it as a direct contribution to my theory it was sudden it was never properly accounted for it was surrounded by circumstances in whichfor oh i took them to piecesi distinctly read an intention the mark of his own hidden hand it was the result of a long necessity of an unquenchable desire to say exactly what i mean it was a response to an irresistible call  the end
