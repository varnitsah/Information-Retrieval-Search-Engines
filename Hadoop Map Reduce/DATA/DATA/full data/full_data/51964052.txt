years afterward    1  once on a time  i am going to tell a story one of those tales of astonishing adventures that happened years and years and years ago  perhaps you wonder why it is that so many stories are told of once on a time and so few of these days in which we live but that is easily explained  in the old days when the world was young there were no automobiles nor flyingmachines to make one wonder nor were there railway trains nor telephones nor mechanical inventions of any sort to keep people keyed up to a high pitch of excitement  men and women lived simply and quietly  they were natures children and breathed fresh air into their lungs instead of smoke and coal gas and tramped through green meadows and deep forests instead of riding in street cars and went to bed when it grew dark and rose with the sunwhich is vastly different from the present custom  having no books to read they told their adventures to one another and to their little ones and the stories were handed down from generation to generation and reverently believed  those who peopled the world in the old days having nothing but their hands to depend on were to a certain extent helpless and so the fairies were sorry for them and ministered to their wants patiently and frankly often showing themselves to those they befriended  so people knew fairies in those days my dear and loved them together with all the ryls and knooks and pixies and nymphs and other beings that belong to the hordes of immortals  and a fairy tale was a thing to be wondered at and spoken of in awed whispers for no one thought of doubting its truth  today the fairies are shy for so many curious inventions of men have come into use that the wonders of fairyland are somewhat tame beside them and even the boys and girls can not be so easily interested or surprised as in the old days  so the sweet and gentle little immortals perform their tasks unseen and unknown and live mostly in their own beautiful realms where they are almost unthought of by our busy bustling world  yet when we come to storytelling the marvels of our own age shrink into insignificance beside the brave deeds and absorbing experiences of the days when fairies were better known and so we go back to once on a time for the tales that we most loveand that children have ever loved since mankind knew that fairies exist    2  the enchanted isle  once there was an enchanted island in the middle of the sea  it was called the isle of yew  and in it were five important kingdoms ruled by men and many woodland dells and forest glades and pleasant meadows and grim mountains inhabited by fairies  from the fairies some of the men had learned wonderful secrets and had become magicians and sorcerers with powers so great that the entire island was reputed to be one of enchantments  who these men were the common people did not always know for while some were kings and rulers others lived quietly hidden away in forests or mountains and seldom or never showed themselves  indeed there were not so many of these magicians as people thought only it was so hard to tell them from common folk that every stranger was regarded with a certain amount of curiosity and fear  the island was roundlike a mince pie  and it was divided into four quartersalso like a pieexcept that there was a big place in the center where the fifth kingdom called spor lay in the midst of the mountains  spor was ruled by king terribus whom no one but his own subjects had ever seenand not many of them  for no one was allowed to enter the kingdom of spor and its king never left his palace  but the people of spor had a bad habit of rushing down from their mountains and stealing the goods of the inhabitants of the other four kingdoms and carrying them home with them without offering any apologies whatever for such horrid conduct  sometimes those they robbed tried to fight them but they were a terrible people consisting of giants with huge clubs and dwarfs who threw flaming darts and the stern gray men of spor who were most frightful of all  so as a rule every one fled before them and the people were thankful that the fierce warriors of spor seldom came to rob them oftener than once a year  it was on this account that all who could afford the expense built castles to live in with stone walls so thick that even the giants of spor could not batter them down  and the children were not allowed to stray far from home for fear some roving band of robbers might steal them and make their parents pay large sums for their safe return  yet for all this the people of the enchanted isle of yew were happy and prosperous  no grass was greener no forests more cool and delightful no skies more sunny no sea more blue and rippling than theirs  and the nations of the world envied them but dared not attempt to conquer an island abounding in enchantments    3  the fairy bower  that part of the enchanted isle which was kissed by the rising sun was called dawna the kingdom that was tinted rose and purple by the setting sun was known as auriel and the southland where fruits and flowers abounded was the kingdom of plenta  up at the north lay heg the home of the great barons who feared not even the men of spor and in the kingdom of heg our story opens  upon a beautiful plain stood the castle of the great baron merdrenowned alike in war and peace and second in importance only to the king of heg  it was a castle of vast extent built with thick walls and protected by strong gates  in front of it sloped a pretty stretch of land with the sea glistening far beyond and back of it but a short distance away was the edge of the forest of lurla  one fair summer day the custodian of the castle gates opened a wicket and let down a drawbridge when out trooped three pretty girls with baskets dangling on their arms  one of the maids walked in front of her companions as became the only daughter of the mighty baron merd she was named seseley and had yellow hair and red cheeks and big blue eyes  behind her merry and laughing yet with a distinct deference to the high station of their young lady walked berna and heldadark brunettes with mischievous eyes and slender lithe limbs  berna was the daughter of the chief archer and helda the niece of the captain of the guard and they were appointed playfellows and comrades of the fair seseley  up the hill to the forests edge ran the three and then without hesitation plunged into the shade of the ancient trees  there was no sunlight now but the air was cool and fragrant of nuts and mosses and the children skipped along the paths joyously and without fear  to be sure the forest of lurla was well known as the home of fairies but seseley and her comrades feared nothing from such gentle creatures and only longed for an interview with the powerful immortals whom they had been taught to love as the tender guardians of mankind  nymphs there were in lurla as well and crooked knooks it was said yet for many years past no person could boast the favor of meeting any one of the fairy creatures face to face  so gathering a few nuts here and a sweet forest flower there the three maidens walked farther and farther into the forest until they came upon a clearingformed like a circlewith mosses and ferns for its carpet and great overhanging branches for its roof  how pretty cried seseley gaily  let us eat our luncheon in this lovely banquethall  so berna and helda spread a cloth and brought from their baskets some golden platters and a store of food  yet there was little ceremony over the meal you may be sure and within a short space all the children had satisfied their appetites and were laughing and chatting as merrily as if they were at home in the great castle  indeed it is certain they were happier in their forest glade than when facing grim walls of stone and the three were in such gay spirits that whatever one chanced to say the others promptly joined in laughing over  soon however they were startled to hear a silvery peal of laughter answering their own and turning to see whence the sound proceeded they found seated near them a creature so beautiful that at once the three pairs of eyes opened to their widest extent and three hearts beat much faster than before  well i must say you do stare exclaimed the newcomer who was clothed in soft floating robes of rose and pearl color and whose eyes shone upon them like two stars  forgive our impertinence answered the little lady seseley trying to appear dignified and unmoved but you must acknowledge that you came among us uninvited andand you are certainly rather odd in appearance  again the silvery laughter rang through the glade  uninvited echoed the creature clapping her hands together delightedly uninvited to my own forest home  why my dear girls you are the uninvited onesindeed you areto thus come romping into our fairy bower  the children did not open their eyes any wider on hearing this speech for they could not but their faces expressed their amazement fully while helda gasped the words  a fairy bower  we are in a fairy bower  most certainly was the reply  and as for being odd in appearance let me ask how you could reasonably expect a fairy to appear as mortal maidens do  a fairy exclaimed seseley  are you then a real fairy  i regret to say i am returned the other more soberly as she patted a mossbank with a silvertipped wand  then for a moment there was silence while the three girls sat very still and stared at their immortal companion with evident curiosity finally seseley asked  why do you regret being a fairy  i have always thought them the happiest creatures in the world  perhaps we ought to be happy answered the fairy gravely for we have wonderful powers and do much to assist you helpless mortals  and i suppose some of us really are happy  but for my part i am so utterly tired of a fairy life that i would do anything to change it  that is strange declared berna  you seem very young to be already discontented with your lot  now at this the fairy burst into laughter again and presently asked  how old do you think me  about our own age said berna after a glance at her and a moments reflection  nonsense retorted the fairy sharply  these trees are hundreds of years old yet i remember when they were mere twigs  and i remember when mortals first came to live upon this island yesand when this island was first created and rose from the sea after a great earthquake  i remember for many many centuries my dears  i have grown tired of rememberingand of being a fairy continually without any change to brighten my life  to be sure said seseley with sympathy  i never thought of fairy life in that way before  it must get to be quite tiresome  and think of the centuries i must yet live exclaimed the fairy in a dismal voice  isnt it an awful thing to look forward to  it is indeed agreed seseley  id be glad to exchange lives with you said helda looking at the fairy with intense admiration  but you cant do that answered the little creature quickly mortals cant become fairies you knowalthough i believe there was once a mortal who was made immortal  but fairies can become anything they desire cried berna  oh no they cant  you are mistaken if you believe that was the reply  i could change you into a fly or a crocodile or a bobolink if i wanted to but fairies cant change themselves into anything else  how strange murmured seseley much impressed  but you can cried the fairy jumping up and coming toward them you are mortals and by the laws that govern us a mortal can change a fairy into anything she pleases  oh said seseley filled with amazement at the idea  the fairy fell on her knees before the barons daughter pleaseplease dear seseley she pleaded change me into a mortal    4  prince marvel  it is easy to imagine the astonishment of the three girls at hearing this strange request  they gazed in a bewildered fashion upon the kneeling fairy and were at first unable to answer one word  then seseley saidsadly for she grieved to disappoint the pretty creature  we are but mortal children and have no powers of enchantment at all  ah that is true so far as concerns yourselves replied the fairy eagerly yet mortals may easily transform fairies into anything they wish  if that is so why have we never heard of this power before asked seseley  because fairies as a rule are content with their lot and do not wish to appear in any form but their own  and knowing that evil or mischievous mortals can transform them at will the fairies take great care to remain invisible so they can not be interfered with  have you ever she asked suddenly seen a fairy before  never replied seseley  nor would you have seen me today had i not known you were kind and purehearted or had i not resolved to ask you to exercise your powers upon me  i must say remarked helda boldly that you are foolish to wish to become anything different from what you are  for you are very beautiful now added berna admiringly  beautiful retorted the fairy with a little frown what does beauty amount to if one is to remain invisible  not much that is true agreed berna smoothing her own dark locks  and as for being foolish continued the fairy i ought to be allowed to act foolishly if i want to  for centuries past i have not had a chance to do a single foolish thing  poor dear said helda softly  seseley had listened silently to this conversation  now she inquired  what do you wish to become  a mortal answered the fairy promptly  a girl like ourselves questioned the barons daughter  perhaps said the fairy as if undecided  then you would be likely to endure many privations said seseley gently  for you would have neither father nor mother to befriend you nor any house to live in  and if you hired your services to some baron you would be obliged to wash dishes all day or mend clothing or herd cattle said berna  but i should travel all over the island said the fairy brightly and that is what i long to do  i do not care to work  i fear a girl would not be allowed to travel alone seseley remarked after some further thought  at least she added i have never heard of such a thing  no said the fairy rather bitterly your men are the ones that roam abroad and have adventures of all kinds  your women are poor weak creatures i remember  there was no denying this so the three girls sat silent until seseley asked  why do you wish to become a mortal  to gain exciting experiences answered the fairy  im tired of being a humdrum fairy year in and year out  of course i do not wish to become a mortal for all time for that would get monotonous too but to live a short while as the earth people do would amuse me very much  if you want variety you should become a boy said helda with a laugh the life of a boy is one round of excitement  then make me a boy exclaimed the fairy eagerly  a boy they all cried in consternation  and seseley added  whyyoure a girl fairy arent you  wellyes i suppose i am answered the beautiful creature smiling but as you are going to change me anyway i may as well become a boy as a girl  better declared helda clapping her hands for then you can do as you please  but would it be right asked seseley with hesitation  why not retorted the fairy  i can see nothing wrong in being a boy  make me a tall slender youth with waving brown hair and dark eyes  then i shall be as unlike my own self as possible and the adventure will be all the more interesting  yes i like the idea of being a boy very much indeed  but i dont know how to transform you some one will have to show me the way to do it protested seseley who was getting worried over the task set her  oh that will be easy enough returned the little immortal  have you a wand  no  then ill loan you mine for i shall not need it  and you must wave it over my head three times and say by my mortal powers i transform you into a boy for the space of one year  one year  isnt that too long  its a very short time to one who has lived thousands of years as a fairy  that is true answered the barons daughter  now ill begin by doing a little transforming myself said the fairy getting upon her feet again and you can watch and see how i do it  she brushed a bit of moss from her gauzy skirts and continued if im to become a boy i shall need a horse you know  a handsome prancing steed very fleet of foot  a moment she stood motionless as if listening  then she uttered a low but shrill whistle  the three girls filled with eager interest watched her intently  presently a trampling of footsteps was heard through the brushwood and a beautiful deer burst from the forest and fearlessly ran to the fairy without hesitation she waved her wand above the deers head and exclaimed  by all my fairy powers i command you to become a warhorse for the period of one year  instantly the deer disappeared and in its place was a handsome charger milkwhite in color with flowing mane and tail  upon its back was a saddle sparkling with brilliant gems sewn upon fine dressed leather  the girls uttered cries of astonishment and delight and the fairy said  you see these transformations are not at all difficult  i must now have a sword  she plucked a twig from a nearby tree and cast it upon the ground at her feet  again she waved her wandand the twig turned to a gleaming sword richly engraved that seemed to the silent watchers to tremble slightly in its sheath as if its heart of steel throbbed with hopes of battles to come  and now i must have shield and armor said the fairy gaily  this will make a shieldand she stripped a sheet of loose bark from a treetrunkbut for armor i must have something better  will you give me your cloak  this appeal was made to seseley and the barons daughter drew her white velvet cloak from her shoulders and handed it to the fairy  a moment later it was transformed into a suit of glittering armor that seemed fashioned of pure silver inlaid with gold while the sheet of bark at the same time became a handsome shield with the figures of three girls graven upon it  seseley recognized the features as those of herself and her comrades and noted also that they appeared sitting at the edge of a forest the great trees showing plainly in the background  i shall be your champion you see laughed the fairy gleefully and maybe i shall be able to repay you for the loss of your cloak  i do not mind the cloak returned the child who had been greatly interested in these strange transformations  but it seems impossible that a dainty little girl like you can ride this horse and carry these heavy arms  ill not be a girl much longer said the little creature  here take my wand and transform me into a noble youth  again the pretty fairy kneeled before seseley her dainty rounded limbs of white and rose showing plainly through her gauzy attire  and the barons daughter was suddenly inspired to be brave not wishing to disappoint the venturous immortal  so she rose and took the magic wand in her hand waving it three times above the head of the fairy  by my powers as a mortal she said marveling even then at the strange speech i command you to become a brave and gallant youthhandsome strong fearless  and such shall you remain for the space of one year  as she ceased speaking the fairy was gone and a slender youth darkeyed and laughing was holding her hand in his and kissing it gratefully  i thank you most lovely maiden he said in a pleasant voice for giving me a place in the world of mortals  i shall ride at once in search of adventure but my good sword is ever at your service  with this he gracefully arose and began to buckle on his magnificent armor and to fasten the sword to his belt  seseley drew a long sighing breath of amazement at her own powers and turning to berna and helda she asked  do i see aright  is the little fairy really transformed to this youth  it certainly seems so returned helda who being unabashed by the marvels she had beheld turned to gaze boldly upon the young knight  do you still remember that a moment ago you were a fairy she inquired  yes indeed said he smiling and i am really a fairy now being but changed in outward form  but no one must know this save yourselves until the year has expired and i resume my true station will you promise to guard my secret  oh yes they exclaimed in chorus  for they were delighted as any children might well be at having so remarkable a secret to keep and talk over among themselves  i must ask one more favor continued the youth that you give me a name for in this island i believe all men bear names of some sort to distinguish them one from another  true said seseley thoughtfully  what were you called as a fairy  that does not matter in the least he answered hastily  i must have an entirely new name  suppose we call him the silver knight suggested berna as she eyed his glistening armor  oh nothat is no name at all declared helda  we might better call him baron strongarm  i do not like that either said the lady seseley for we do not know whether his arm is strong or not  but he has been transformed in a most astonishing and bewildering manner before our very eyes and i think the name of prince marvel would suit him very well  excellent cried the youth picking up his richly graven shield the name seems fitting in every way  and for a year i shall be known to all this island as prince marvel    5  the king of thieves  old marshelm the captain of the guard was much surprised when he saw the barons daughter and her playmates approach her fathers castle escorted by a knight in glittering armor  to be sure it was a rather small knight but the horse he led by the bridle was so stately and magnificent in appearance that old marshelm who was an excellent judge of horses at once decided the stranger must be a personage of unusual importance  as they came nearer the captain of the guard also observed the beauty of the little knights armor and caught the glint of jewels set in the handle of his sword so he called his men about him and prepared to receive the knight with the honors doubtless due his high rank  but to the captains disappointment the stranger showed no intention of entering the castle  on the contrary he kissed the little lady seseleys hand respectfully waved an adieu to the others and then mounted his charger and galloped away over the plains  the drawbridge was let down to permit the three children to enter and the great baron merd came himself to question his daughter  who was the little knight he asked  his name is prince marvel answered seseley demurely  prince marvel exclaimed the baron  i have never heard of him does he come from the kingdom of dawna or that of auriel or plenta  that i do not know said seseley with truth  where did you meet him continued the baron  in the forest my father and he kindly escorted us home  hm muttered the baron thoughtfully  did he say what adventure brought him to our kingdom of heg  no father  but he mentioned being in search of adventure  oh hell find enough to busy him in this wild island where every man he meets would rather draw his sword than eat returned the old warrior smiling  how old may this prince marvel be  he looks not over fifteen years of age said seseley uneasy at so much questioning for she did not wish to be forced to tell an untruth but it is possible he is much older she added beginning to get confused  well well i am sorry he did not pay my castle a visit declared the baron  he is very small and slight to be traveling this dangerous country alone and i might have advised him as to his welfare  seseley thought that prince marvel would need no advice from any one as to his conduct but she wisely refrained from speaking this thought and the old baron walked away to glance through a slit in the stone wall at the figure of the now distant knight  prince marvel was riding swiftly toward the brow of the hill and shortly his great warhorse mounted the ascent and disappeared on its farther slope  the youths heart was merry and light and he reflected joyously as he rode along that a whole year of freedom and fascinating adventure lay before him  the valley in which he now found himself was very beautiful the soft grass beneath his horses feet being sprinkled with bright flowers while clumps of trees stood here and there to break the monotony of the landscape  for an hour the prince rode along rejoicing in the free motion of his horse and breathing in the perfumeladen air  then he found he had crossed the valley and was approaching a series of hills  these were broken by huge rocks the ground being cluttered with boulders of rough stone  his horse speedily found a pathway leading through these rocks but was obliged to proceed at a walk turning first one way and then another as the path zigzagged up the hill  presently being engaged in deep thought and little noting the way prince marvel rode between two high walls of rock standing so close together that horse and rider could scarcely pass between the sides having traversed this narrow space some distance the wall opened suddenly upon a level plat of ground where grass and trees grew  it was not a very big place but was surely the end of the path as all around it stood bare walls so high and steep that neither horse nor man could climb them  in the side of the rocky wall facing the entrance the traveler noticed a hollow like the mouth of a cave across which was placed an iron gate  and above the gateway was painted in red letters on the gray stone the following words               wultakim          king of thieves                        his treasure house              keep out   prince marvel laughed on reading this and after getting down from his saddle he advanced to the iron gate and peered through its heavy bars  i have no idea who this wultakim is he said for i know nothing at all of the ways of men outside the forest in which i have always dwelt but thieves are bad people i am quite sure and since wultakim is the king of thieves he must be by far the worst man on this island  then he saw through the bars of the gate that a great cavern lay beyond in which were stacked treasures of all sorts rich cloths golden dishes and ornaments gemmed coronets and bracelets cleverly forged armor shields and battleaxes  also there were casks and bales of merchandise of every sort  the gate appeared to have no lock so prince marvel opened it and walked in  then he perceived perched on the very top of a pyramid of casks the form of a boy who sat very still and watched him with a look of astonishment upon his face  what are you doing up there asked the prince  nothing said the boy  if i moved the least little bit this pile of casks would topple over and i should be thrown to the ground  well returned the prince what of it  but just then he glanced at the ground and saw why the boy did not care to tumble down  for in the earth were planted many swords with their sharp blades pointing upward and to fall upon these meant serious wounds and perhaps death  oh ho cried marvel i begin to understand  you are a prisoner  yes as you will also be shortly answered the boy  and then you will understand another thingthat you were very reckless ever to enter this cave  why inquired the prince who really knew little of the world and was interested in everything he saw and heard  because it is the stronghold of the robber king and when you opened that gate you caused a bell to ring far down on the hillside  so the robbers are now warned that an enemy is in their cave and they will soon arrive to make you a prisoner even as i am  ah i see said the prince with a laugh it is a rather clever contrivance but having been warned in time i should indeed be foolish to be caught in such a trap  with this he half drew his sword but thinking that robbers were not worthy to be slain with its untarnished steel he pushed it back into the jeweled scabbard and looked around for another weapon  a stout oaken staff lay upon the ground and this he caught up and ran with it from the cave placing himself just beside the narrow opening that led into this rockencompassed plain  for he quickly saw that this was the only way any one could enter or leave the place and therefore knew the robbers were coming up the narrow gorge even as he had himself done  soon they were heard stumbling along at a rapid pace crying to one another to make haste and catch the intruder  the first that came through the opening received so sharp a blow upon the head from prince marvels oak staff that he fell to the ground and lay still while the next was treated in a like manner and fell beside his comrade  perhaps the thieves had not expected so sturdy an enemy for they continued to rush through the opening in the rocks and to fall beneath the steady blows of the princes staff until every one of them lay senseless before the victor  at first they had piled themselves upon one another very neatly but the pile got so high at last that the prince was obliged to assist the last thieves to leap to the top of the heap before they completely lost their senses  i have no doubt our prince feeling himself yet strange in the new form he had acquired and freshly transported from the forest glades in which he had always lived was fully as much astonished at his deed of valor as were the robbers themselves and if he shuddered a little when looking upon the heap of senseless thieves you must forgive him this weakness  for he straightway resolved to steel his heart to such sights and to be every bit as stern and severe as a mortal knight would have been  throwing down his staff he ran to the cave again and stepping between the sword points he approached the pile of casks and held out his arms to the boy who was perched upon the top  the thieves are conquered he cried  jump down  i wont said the boy  why not inquired the prince  cant you see im very miserable asked the boy in return dont you understand that every minute i expect to fall upon those sword points  but i will catch you cried the prince  i dont want you to catch me said the boy  i want to be miserable its the first chance ive ever had and im enjoying my misery very much  this speech so astonished prince marvel that for a moment he stood motionless  then he retorted angrily  youre a fool  if i wasnt so miserable up here id come down and thrash you for that said the boy with a sigh  this answer so greatly annoyed prince marvel that he gave the central cask of the pyramid a sudden push and the next moment the casks were tumbling in every direction while the boy fell headlong in their midst  but marvel caught him deftly in his arms and so saved him from the sword points  there he said standing the boy upon his feet now you are released from your misery  and i should be glad to punish you for your interference declared the boy gloomily eying his preserver had you not saved my life by catching me  according to the code of honor of knighthood i can not harm one who has saved my life until i have returned the obligation therefore for the present i shall pardon your insulting speeches and actions  but you have also saved my life answered prince marvel for had you not warned me of the robbers return they would surely have caught me  true said the boy brightening up therefore our score is now even but take care not to affront me again for hereafter i will show you no mercy  prince marvel looked at the boy with wonder  he was about his own size yet strong and well formed and he would have been handsome except for the expression of discontent upon his face  yet his manner and words were so absurd and unnatural that the prince was more amused than angered by his new acquaintance and presently laughed in his face  if all the people in this island are like you he said i shall have lots of fun with them  and you are only a boy after all  im bigger than you declared the other glaring fiercely at the prince  how much bigger asked marvel his eyes twinkling  oh ever so much  then fetch along that coil of rope and follow me said prince marvel  fetch the rope yourself retorted the boy bluntly  im not your servant then he put his hands in his pockets and coolly walked out of the cave to look at the pile of senseless robbers  prince marvel made no reply but taking the coil of rope on his shoulder he carried it to where the thieves lay and threw it down beside them  then he cut lengths from the coil with his sword and bound the limbs of each robber securely  within a halfhour he had laid out a row of thieves extending half way across the grassy plain and on counting their number he found he had captured fiftynine of them  this task being accomplished and the robbers rendered helpless prince marvel turned to the boy who stood watching him  get a suit of armor from the cave and a strong sword and then return here he said in a stern voice  why should i do that asked the boy rather impudently  because i am going to fight you for disobeying my orders and if you do not protect yourself i shall probably kill you  that sounds pleasant said the boy  but if you should prove my superior in skill i beg you will not kill me at once but let me die a lingering death  why asked the prince  because i shall suffer more and that will be delightful  i am not anxious to kill you nor to make you suffer said marvel all that i ask is that you acknowledge me your master  i wont answered the boy  i acknowledge no master in all the world  then you must fight declared the prince gravely  if you win i will promise to serve you faithfully and if i conquer you then you must acknowledge me your master and obey my commands  agreed cried the boy with sudden energy and he rushed into the cave and soon returned clad in armor and bearing a sword and shield on the shield was pictured a bolt of lightning  lightning will soon strike those three girls whose champion you seem to be he said tauntingly  the three girls defy your lightning returned the prince with a smile  i see you are brave enough  brave  why should i not be answered the boy proudly  i am the lord nerle the son of neggar the chief baron of heg  the other bowed low  i am pleased to know your station he said  i am called prince marvel and this is my first adventure  and likely to be your last exclaimed the boy sneeringly  for i am stronger than you and i have fought many times with full grown men  are you ready asked prince marvel for answer  yes  then the swords clashed and sparks flew from the blades  but it was not for long  suddenly nerles sword went flying through the air and shattered its blade against a wall of rock  he scowled at prince marvel a moment who smiled back at him  then the boy rushed into the cave and returned with another sword  scarcely had the weapons crossed again when with a sudden blow prince marvel snapped nerles blade in two and followed this up with a sharp slap upon his ear with the flat of his own sword that fairly bewildered the boy and made him sit down on the grass to think what had happened to him  then prince marvels merry laugh rang far across the hills and so delighted was he at the astonished expression upon nerles face that it was many minutes before he could control his merriment and ask his foeman if he had had enough fight  i suppose i have replied the boy rubbing his ear tenderly  that blow stings most deliciously  but it is a hard thought that the son of baron neggar should serve prince marvel  do not worry about that said the prince for i assure you my rank is so far above your own that it is no degradation for the son of neggar to serve me  but come we must dispose of these thieves  what is the proper fate for such men  they are always hanged answered nerle getting upon his feet  well there are trees handy remarked the prince although his girlish heart insisted on making him shiver in spite of his resolve to be manly and stern  let us get to work and hang them as soon as possible  and then we can proceed upon our journey  nerle now willingly lent his assistance to his new master and soon they had placed a rope around the neck of each thief and were ready to dangle them all from the limbs of the trees  but at this juncture the thieves began to regain consciousness and now wultakim the big redbearded king of the thieves sat up and asked  who is our conqueror  prince marvel answered nerle  and what army assisted him inquired wultakim curiously gazing upon the prince  he conquered you alone and singlehanded said nerle  hearing this the big king began to weep bitterly and the teardrops ran down his face in such a stream that prince marvel ordered nerle to wipe them away with his handkerchief as the thiefs hands were tied behind his back  to think sobbed wultakim miserably only to think that after all my terrible deeds and untold wickedness i have been captured by a mere boy  oh boohoo boohoo boohoo  it is a terrible disgrace  you will not have to bear it long said the prince soothingly  i am going to hang you in a few minutes  thanks  thank you very much answered the king ceasing to weep  i have always expected to be hanged some day and i am glad no one but you two boys will witness me when my feet begin kicking about  i shall not kick declared another of the thieves who had also regained his senses  i shall sing while i am being hanged  but you can not my good gunder protested the king for the rope will cut off your breath and no man can sing without breath  then i shall whistle said gunder composedly  the king cast at him a look of reproach and turning to prince marvel he said  it will be a great task to string up so many thieves  you look tired permit me to assist you to hang the others and then i will climb into a tree and hang myself from a strong branch with as little bother as possible  oh i wont think of troubling you exclaimed marvel with a laugh having conquered you alone i feel it my duty to hang you without assistancesave that of my esquire  its no trouble i assure you but suit your own convenience said the thief carelessly  then he cast his eye toward the cave and asked what will you do with all our treasure  give it to the poor said prince marvel promptly  what poor  oh the poorest people i can find  will you permit me to advise you in this matter asked the king of thieves politely  yes indeed for i am a stranger in this land returned the prince  well i know a lot of people who are so poor that they have no possessions whatever neither food to eat houses to live in nor any clothing but that which covers their bodies  they can call no man friend nor will any lift a hand to help them  indeed good sir i verily believe they will soon perish miserably unless you come to their assistance  poor creatures exclaimed prince marvel with ready sympathy tell me who they are and i will divide amongst them all your illgotten gains  they are ourselves replied the king of thieves with a sigh  marvel looked at him in amazement and then burst into joyous laughter  yourselves he cried greatly amused  indeed yes said wultakim sadly  there are no poorer people in all the world for we have ropes about our necks and are soon to be hanged  tomorrow we shall not have even our flesh left for the crows will pick our bones  that is true remarked marvel thoughtfully  but if i restore to you the treasure how will it benefit you since you are about to die  must you really hang us asked the thief  yes i have decreed it and you deserve your fate  why  because you have wickedly taken from helpless people their property and committed many other crimes besides  but i have reformed  we have all reformedhave we not brothers  we have answered the other thieves who having regained their senses were listening to this conversation with much interest  and if you will return to us our treasure we will promise never to steal again but to remain honest men and enjoy our wealth in peace promised the king  honest men could not enjoy treasures they have stolen said prince marvel  true but this treasure is now yours having been won by you in fair battle  and if you present it to us it will no longer be stolen treasure but a generous gift from a mighty prince which we may enjoy with clear consciences  yet there remains the fact that i have promised to hang you suggested prince marvel with a smile for the king amused him greatly  not at all  not at all cried wultakim  you promised to hang fiftynine thieves and there is no doubt the fiftynine thieves deserved to be hung  but consider  we have all reformed our ways and become honest men so it would be a sad and unkindly act to hang fiftynine honest men  what think you nerle asked the prince turning to his esquire  why the rogue seems to speak truth said nerle scratching his head with a puzzled air yet if he speaks truth there is little difference between a rogue and an honest man  ask him my master what caused them all to reform so suddenly  because we were about to die and we thought it a good way to save our lives replied the robber king  thats an honest answer anyway said nerle  perhaps sir they have really reformed  and if so i will not have the death of fiftynine honest men on my conscience declared the prince  then he turned to wultakim and added i will release you and give you the treasure as you request but you owe me allegiance from this time forth and if i ever hear of your becoming thieves again i promise to return and hang every one of you  never fear answered wultakim joyfully  it is hard work to steal and while we have so much treasure it is wholly unnecessary  moreover having accepted from you our lives and our fortunes we shall hereafter be your devoted servants and whenever you need our services you have but to call upon us and we will support you loyally and gladly  i accept your service answered the prince graciously  and then he unbound the fiftynine honest men and took the ropes from their necks  as nightfall was fast approaching the new servants set to work to prepare a great feast in honor of their master  it was laid in the middle of the grassy clearing that all might sit around and celebrate the joyous occasion  do you think you can trust these men asked nerle suspiciously  why not replied the prince  they have been exceedingly wicked it is true but they are now intent upon being exceedingly good  let us encourage them in this  if we mistrusted all who have ever done an evil act there would be fewer honest people in the world  and if it were as interesting to do a good act as an evil one there is no doubt every one would choose the good    6  the troubles of nerle  that night prince marvel slept within the cave surrounded by the fiftynine reformed thieves and suffered no harm at their hands  in the morning accompanied by his esquire nerle who was mounted upon a spirited horse brought him by wultakim he charged the honest men to remember their promises bade them good by and set out in search of further adventure  as they left the clearing by the narrow passage that led between the overhanging rocks the prince looked back and saw that the sign above the gate of the cave which had told of the thieves treasure house had been changed  it now read as follows               wultakim         king of honest men                        his pleasure house              walk in   that is much better laughed the prince  i accomplished some good by my adventure anyway  nerle did not reply  he seemed especially quiet and thoughtful as he rode by his masters side and after they had traveled some distance in silence prince marvel said  tell me how you came to be in the cave of thieves and perched upon the casks where i found you  it is a sad story returned nerle with a sigh but since you request me to tell it the tale may serve to relieve the tedium of your journey  my father is a mighty baron very wealthy and with a heart so kind that he has ever taken pleasure in thrusting on me whatever gift he could think of  i had not a single desire unsatisfied for before i could wish for anything it was given me  my mother was much like my father  she and her women were always making jams jellies candies cakes and the like for me to eat so i never knew the pleasure of hunger  my clothes were the gayest satins and velvets richly made and sewn with gold and silver braid so it was impossible to wish for more in the way of apparel  they let me study my lessons whenever i felt like it and go fishing or hunting as i pleased so i could not complain that i was unable to do just as i wanted to  all the servants obeyed my slightest wish if i wanted to sit up late at night no one objected if i wished to lie in bed till noon they kept the house quiet so as not to disturb me  this condition of affairs as you may imagine grew more and more tedious and exasperating the older i became  try as i might i could find nothing to complain of  i once saw the son of one of our servants receive a flogging and my heart grew light  i immediately begged my father to flog me by way of variety and he who could refuse me nothing at once consented  for this reason there was less satisfaction in the operation than i had expected although for the time being it was a distinct novelty  now no one could expect a highspirited boy to put up with such a life as mine  with nothing to desire and no chance of doing anything that would annoy my parents my days were dreary indeed  he paused to wipe the tears from his eyes and the prince murmured sympathetically poor boy  poor boy  ah you may well say that continued nerle  but one day a stranger came to my fathers castle with tales of many troubles he had met with he had been lost in a forest and nearly starved to death  he had been robbed and beaten and left wounded and sore by the wayside  he had begged from door to door and been refused food or assistance  in short his story was so delightful that it made me envy him and i yearned to suffer as he had done  when i could speak with him alone i said pray tell me how i can manage to acquire the misfortunes you have undergone  here i have everything that i desire and it makes me very unhappy  the stranger laughed at me at first and i found some pleasure in the humiliation i then felt  but it did not last long for presently he grew sober and advised me to run away from home and seek adventure  once away from your fathers castle said he troubles will fall upon you thick enough to satisfy even your longings  that is what i am afraid of i answered  i dont want to be satisfied even with troubles  what i seek is unsatisfied longings  nevertheless said he i advise you to travel  everything will probably go wrong with you and then you will be happy  i acted upon the strangers advice and ran away from home the next day  after journeying a long time i commenced to feel the pangs of hunger and was just beginning to enjoy myself when a knight rode by and gave me a supply of food  at this rebuff i could not restrain my tears but while i wept my horse stumbled and threw me over his head i hoped at first i had broken my neck and was just congratulating myself upon the misfortune when a witchwoman came along and rubbed some ointment upon my bruises in spite of my protests  to my great grief the pain left me and i was soon well again  but as a slight compensation for my disappointment my horse had run away so i began my journey anew and on foot  that afternoon i stepped into a nest of wasps but the thoughtless creatures flew away without stinging me  then i met a fierce tiger and my heart grew light and gay  surely this will cause me suffering i cried and advanced swiftly upon the brute  but the cowardly tiger turned tail and ran to hide in the bushes leaving me unhurt  of course my many disappointments were some consolation but not much  that night i slept on the bare ground and hoped i should catch a severe cold but no such joy was to be mine  yet the next afternoon i experienced my first pleasure  the thieves caught me stripped off all my fine clothes and jewels and beat me well  then they carried me to their cave dressed me in rags and perched me on the top of the casks where the slightest movement on my part would send me tumbling among the sword points  this was really delightful and i was quite happy until you came and released me  i thought then that i might gain some pleasure by provoking you to anger and our fight was the result  that blow on the ear was exquisite and by forcing me to become your servant you have made me for the first time in my life almost contented  for i hope in your company to experience a great many griefs and disappointments  as nerle concluded his story prince marvel turned to him and grasped his hand  accept my sympathy said he  i know exactly how you feel for my own life during the past few centuries has not been much different  the past few centuries gasped nerle  what do you mean  at this the prince blushed seeing he had nearly disclosed his secret but he said quickly  does it not seem centuries when one is unhappy  it does indeed responded nerle earnestly  but please tell me your story  not now said prince marvel with a smile  it will please you to desire in vain to hear a tale i will not tell  yet i promise that on the day we part company i shall inform you who i am    7  the gray men  the adventurers gave no heed to the path they followed after leaving the cave of the reformed thieves but their horses accidentally took the direction of the foothills that led into the wild interior kingdom of spor  therefore the travelers when they had finished their conversation and begun to look about them found themselves in a rugged mountainous country that was wholly unlike the green plains of heg they had left behind  now as i have before said the most curious and fearful of the island people dwelt in this kingdom of spor  they held no friendly communication with their neighbors and only left their own mountains to plunder and rob and so sullen and fierce were they on these occasions that every one took good care to keep out of their way until they had gone back home again  there was much gossip about the unknown king of spor who had never yet been seen by any one except his subjects and some thought he must be one of the huge giants of spor and others claimed he was a dwarf like his tiny but ferocious dartslingers and still others imagined him one of the barbarian tribe or a fellow to the terrible gray men  but of course no one knew positively and all these guesses were very wide of the mark  the only certainty about this king was that his giants dwarfs barbarians and gray men meekly acknowledged his rule and obeyed his slightest wish for though they might be terrible to others their king was still more terrible to them  into this kingdom of spor prince marvel and nerle had now penetrated and neither knowing nor caring where they were continued along the faintly defined paths the horses had found  presently however they were startled by a peal of shrill elfish laughter and raising their eyes they beheld a horridlooking old man seated upon a high rock near by  why do you laugh asked prince marvel stopping his horse  have you been invited  tell mehave you been invited demanded the old man chuckling to himself as if much amused  invited where inquired the prince  to spor stupid  to the kingdom of spor  to the land of king terribus shrieked the old man going into violent peals of laughter  we go and come as we please answered prince marvel calmly  goyes  go if you will  but youll never come backnever never never the little old man seemed to consider this such a good joke that he bent nearly double with laughing and so lost his balance and toppled off the rock disappearing from their view but they could hear him laugh long after they had passed on and left him far behind them  a strange creature exclaimed the prince thoughtfully  but perhaps he speaks truth answered nerle if in fact we have been rash enough to enter the kingdom of spor  even my father the bravest baron in heg has never dared venture within the borders of spor  for all men fear its mysterious king  in that case replied prince marvel it is time some one investigated this strange kingdom  people have left king terribus and his wild subjects too much to themselves instead of stirring them up and making them behave themselves  nerle smiled at this speech  they are the fiercest people on the enchanted island said he and there are thousands upon thousands who obey this unknown king  but if you think we dare defy them i am willing to go on  perhaps our boldness will lead them into torturing me or starving me to death and at the very least i ought to find much trouble and privation in the kingdom of spor  time will determine that said the prince cheerfully  they had now ridden into a narrow defile of the mountains the pathway being lined with great fragments of rock  happening to look over his shoulder prince marvel saw that as they passed these rocks a man stepped from behind each fragment and followed after them their numbers thus constantly increasing until hundreds were silently treading in the wake of the travelers  these men were very peculiar in appearance their skins being as gray as the rocks themselves while their only clothing consisted of gray cloth tunics belted around the waists with bands of gray foxhide they bore no weapons except that each was armed with a fork having three sharp tines six inches in length which the gray men carried stuck through their foxhide belts  nerle also looked back and saw the silent throng following them and the sight sent such a cold shiver creeping up his spine that he smiled with pleasure  there was no way to avoid the gray men for the path was so narrow that the horsemen could not turn aside but prince marvel was not disturbed and seemed not to mind being followed so long as no one hindered his advance  he rode steadily on nerle following and after climbing upward for a long way the path began to descend presently leading them into a valley of wide extent in the center of which stood an immense castle with tall domes that glittered as if covered with pure gold  a broad roadway paved with white marble reached from the mountain pass to the entrance of this castle and on each side of this roadway stood lines of monstrous giants armed with huge axes thrust into their belts and thick oak clubs studded with silver spikes which were carried over their left shoulders  the assembled giants were as silent as the gray men and stood motionless while prince marvel and nerle rode slowly up the marble roadway  but all their brows were scowling terribly and their eyes were red and glaringas if they were balls of fire  i begin to feel very pleasant said nerle for surely we shall not get away from these folks without a vast deal of trouble  they do not seem to oppose our advance but it is plain they will not allow us any chance of retreat  we do not wish to retreat declared the prince  nerle cast another glance behind and saw that the gray men had halted at the edge of the valley while the giants were closing up as soon as the horses passed them and now marched in close file in their rear  it strikes me he muttered softly that this is like to prove our last adventure but although prince marvel might have heard the words he made no reply being evidently engaged in deep thought  as they drew nearer the castle it towered above them like a veritable mountain so big and high was it and the walls cast deep shadows far around as if twilight had fallen  they heard the loud blare of a trumpet sounding far up on the battlements the portals of the castle suddenly opened wide and they entered a vast courtyard paved with plates of gold  tiny dwarfs so crooked that they resembled crabs rushed forward and seized the bridles of the horses while the strangers slowly dismounted and looked around them  while the steeds were being led to the stables an old man clothed in a flowing robe as white in color as his beard bowed before prince marvel and said in a soft voice  follow me  the prince stretched his arms yawned as if tired with his ride and then glared upon the old man with an expression of haughty surprise  i follow no one said he proudly  i am prince marvel sirrah and if the owner of this castle wishes to see me i shall receive him here as befits my rank and station  the man looked surprised but only bowed lower than before  it is the kings command he answered  the king  yes you are in the castle of king terribus the lord and ruler of spor  that is different remarked the prince lightly  still i will follow no man  point out the way and i will go to meet his majesty  the old man extended a lean and trembling finger toward an archway prince marvel strode forward followed by nerle and passing under the arch he threw open a door at the far end and boldly entered the throneroom of king terribus    8  the foolkiller  the room was round with a dome at the top  the bare walls were of gray stone with square open windows set full twenty feet from the floor  rough gray stone also composed the floor and in the center of the room stood one great rock with a seat hollowed in its middle  this was the throne and round about it stood a swarm of men and women dressed in rich satins velvets and brocades brilliantly ornamented with gold and precious stones  the men were of many shapes and sizesgiants and dwarfs being among them  the women all seemed young and beautiful  prince marvel cast but a passing glance at this assemblage for his eye quickly sought the rude throne on which was seated king terribus  the personal appearance of this monster was doubtless the most hideous known in that age of the world  his head was large and shaped like an egg it was bright scarlet in color and no hair whatever grew upon it it had three eyesone in the center of his face one on the top of his head and one in the back  thus he was always able to see in every direction at the same time  his nose was shaped like an elephants trunk and swayed constantly from side to side  his mouth was very wide and had no lips at all two rows of sharp and white teeth being always plainly visible beneath the swaying nose  king terribus although surrounded by so splendid a court wore a simple robe of gray cloth with no ornament or other finery and his strange and fearful appearance was strongly contrasted with the glittering raiment of his courtiers and the beauty of his ladies in waiting  when prince marvel with nerle marching close behind entered the great room terribus looked at him sharply a moment and then bowed  and when he bowed the eye upon the top of his head also looked sharply at the intruders  then the king spoke his voice sounding so sweet and agreeable that it almost shocked nerle who had expected to hear a roar like that from a wild beast  why are you here asked terribus  partly by chance and partly from curiosity answered prince marvel no one in this island except your own people had ever seen the king of spor so finding myself in your country i decided to come here and have a look at you  the faces of the people who stood about the throne wore frightened looks at the unheard of boldness of this speech to their terrible monarch  but the king merely nodded and inquired  since you have seen me what do you think of me  i am sorry you asked that question returned the prince for i must confess you are a very frightfullooking creature and not at all agreeable to gaze upon  ha you are honest as well as frank exclaimed the king  but that is the reason i do not leave my kingdom as you will readily understand  and that is the reason i never permit strangers to come here under penalty of death  so long as no one knows the king of spor is a monster people will not gossip about my looks and i am very sensitive regarding my personal appearance  you will perhaps understand that if i could have chosen i should have been born beautiful instead of ugly  i certainly understand that  and permit me to say i wish you were beautiful  i shall probably dream of you for many nights added the prince  not for many said king terribus quietly  by coming here you have chosen death and the dead do not dream  why should i die inquired prince marvel curiously  because you have seen me  should i allow you to go away you would tell the world about my ugly face  i do not like to kill you believe me but you must pay the penalty of your rashnessyou and the man behind you  nerle smiled at this but whether from pride at being called a man or in pleasurable anticipation of the sufferings to come i leave you to guess  will you allow me to object to being killed asked the prince  certainly answered the king courteously  i expect you to object it is natural  but it will do you no good  then terribus turned to an attendant and commanded  send hither the foolkiller  at this prince marvel laughed outright  the foolkiller he cried surely your majesty does me little credit  am i then a fool  you entered my kingdom uninvited retorted the king and you tell me to my face i am ugly  moreover you laugh when i condemn you to death from this i conclude the foolkiller is the proper one to execute you behold  marvel turned quickly to find a tall stalwart man standing behind him  his features were strong but very grave and the prince caught a look of compassion in his eye as their gaze met  his skin was fair and without blemish a robe of silver cloth fell from his shoulders and in his right hand he bore a gleaming sword  well met cried marvel heartily as he bowed to the foolkiller  i have often heard your name mentioned but tis said in the world that you are a laggard in your duty  had i my way answered the foolkiller my blade would always drip it is my master yonder who thwarts my duty  and he nodded toward king terribus  then you should exercise your right on him and cleave the ugly head from his shoulders declared the prince  nay unless i interfered with the foolkiller said the king i should soon have no subjects left to rule for at one time or another they all deserve the blade  why that may be true enough replied prince marvel  but i think under such circumstances your foolkiller is a needless servant  so i will rid you of him in a few moments  with that he whipped out his sword and stood calmly confronting the foolkiller whose grave face never changed in expression as he advanced menacingly upon his intended victim  the blades clashed together and that of the foolkiller broke short off at the hilt  he took a step backward stumbled and fell prone upon the rocky floor while prince marvel sprang forward and pressed the point of his sword against his opponents breast  hold cried the king starting to his feet  would you slay my foolkiller  think of the harm you would do the world  but he is laggard and unfaithful to his calling answered the prince sternly  nevertheless if he remove but one fool a year he is a benefit to mankind declared the king  release him i pray you  then the victor withdrew his sword and stood aside while the foolkiller slowly got upon his feet and bowed humbly before the king  go shouted terribus his eye flashing angrily  you have humiliated me before my enemy  as an atonement see that you kill me a fool a day for sixty days  hearing this command many of the people about the throne began to tremble but the king paid no attention to their fears and the foolkiller bowed again before his master and withdrew from the chamber    9  the royal dragon of spor  now said terribus regarding the prince gloomily i must dispose of you in another way  for a moment he dropped his scarlet head in thought  then he turned fiercely upon his attendants  let the wrestler come forward he shouted as loudly as his mild voice would carry  instantly a tall blackamoor advanced from the throng and cast off his flowing robe showing a strong figure clad only in a silver loincloth  crack me this fellows bones commanded terribus  i beg your majesty will not compel me to touch him said prince marvel with a slight shudder for his skin is greasy and will soil my hands  here nerle he continued turning to his esquire dispose of this black man and save me the trouble  nerle laughed pleasantly  the black was a powerfully built man and compared with nerle and the prince who had but the stature of boys he towered like a very giant in size  nevertheless nerle did not hesitate to spring upon the wrestler who with a quick movement sent the boy crashing against the stone pavement  nerle was much bruised by the fall and as he painfully raised himself to his feet a great lump was swelling behind his left ear where his head had struck the floor and he was so dizzy that the room seemed swimming around him in a circle  but he gave a happy little laugh and said to the prince gratefully  thank you very much my master  the fall is hurting me delightfully i almost feel as if i could cry and that would be joy indeed  well answered the prince with a sigh i see i must get my hands greased after allfor the blacks body had really been greased to enable him to elude the grasp of his opponents  but marvel made a quick leap and seized the wrestler firmly around the waist  the next moment to the astonishment of all the black man flew swiftly into the air plunged through one of the open windows high up in the wall and disappeared from view  when the king and his people again turned their wondering eyes upon the prince he was wiping his hands carefully upon a silk handkerchief  at this sight a pretty young girl who stood near the throne laughed aloud and the sound of her laughter made king terribus very angry  come here he commanded sternly  the girl stepped forward her face now pale and frightened while teardrops trembled upon the lashes that fringed her downcast eyes  you have dared to laugh at the humiliation of your king said terribus his horrid face more crimson than ever and as atonement i command that you drink of the poisoned cup  instantly a dwarf came near bearing a beautiful golden goblet in his crooked hands  drink he said an evil leer upon his face  the girl well knew this goblet contained a vile poison one drop of which on her tongue would cause death so she hesitated trembling and shrinking from the ordeal  prince marvel looked into her sweet face with pitying eyes and stepping quickly to her side took her hand in his  now drink he said smiling upon her the poison will not hurt you  she drank obediently while the dwarf chuckled with awful glee and the king looked on eagerly expecting her to fall dead at his feet  but instead the girl stood upright and pressed marvels hand looking gratefully into his face  you are a fairy she whispered so low that no one else heard her voice  i knew that you would save me  keep my secret whispered the prince in return and still holding her hand he led her back to her former place  king terribus was almost wild with rage and disappointment and his elephant nose twisted and squirmed horribly  so you dare to thwart my commands do you he cried excitedly well we shall soon see which of us is the more powerful  i have decreed your deathand die you shall  for a moment his eye roved around the chamber uncertainly  then he shouted suddenly  ho there  keepers of the royal menagerieappear  three men entered the room and bowed before the king  they were of the gray men of the mountains who had followed prince marvel and nerle through the rocky passes  bring hither the royal dragon cried the king and let him consume these strangers before my very eyes  the men withdrew and presently was heard a distant shouting followed by a low rumbling sound with groans snorts roars and a hissing like steam from the spout of a teakettle  the noise and shouting drew nearer while the people huddled together like frightened sheep and then suddenly the doors flew open and the royal dragon advanced to the center of the room  this creature was at once the pride and terror of the kingdom of spor it was more than thirty feet in length and covered everywhere with large green scales set with diamonds making the dragon when it moved a very glittering spectacle  its eyes were as big as pieplates and its mouthwhen wide openedfully as large as a bathtub  its tail was very long and ended in a golden ball such as you see on the top of flagstaffs  its legs which were as thick as those of an elephant had scales which were set with rubies and emeralds  it had two monstrous big ears and two horns of carved ivory and its teeth were also carved into various fantastic shapessuch as castles horses heads chinamen and griffinsso that if any of them broke it would make an excellent umbrella handle  the royal dragon of spor came crawling into the throneroom rather clumsily groaning and moaning with every step and waving its ears like two blankets flying from a clothesline  the king looked on it and frowned  why are you not breathing fire and brimstone he demanded angrily  why i was caught out in a gale the other night returned the dragon rubbing the back of its ear with its left front paw as it paused and looked at the king and the wind put out my fire  then why didnt you light it again asked terribus turning on the keepers  wewe were out of matches your majesty stammered the trembling gray men  soho yelled the king and was about to order the keepers beheaded but just then nerle pulled out his matchbox lit one of the matches and held it in front of the dragons mouth  instantly the creatures breath caught fire and it began to breathe flames a yard in length  thats better sighed the dragon contentedly  i hope your majesty is now satisfied  noi am not satisfied declared king terribus  why do you not lash your tail  ah i cant do that replied the dragon  its all stiffened up with rheumatism from the dampness of my cave  it hurts too much to lash it  well then gnash your teeth commanded the king  tuttut answered the dragon mildly i cant do that either for since you had them so beautifully carved it makes my teeth ache to gnash them  well then what are you good for cried the king in a fury  dont i look awful  am i not terrible to gaze on inquired the dragon proudly as it breathed out red and yellow flames and made them curl in circles around its horns  i guess theres no need for me to suggest terror to any one that happens to see me it added winking one of the pieplate eyes at king terribus  the king looked at the monster critically and it really seemed to him that it was a frightful thing to behold  so he curbed his anger and said in his ordinary sweet voice  i have called you here to destroy these two strangers  how asked the dragon looking upon prince marvel and nerle with interest  i am not particular answered the king  you may consume them with your fiery breath or smash them with your tail or grind them to atoms between your teeth or tear them to pieces with your claws  only do hurry up and get it over with  hmmm said the dragon thoughtfully as if it didnt relish the job this one isnt saint george is it  no no exclaimed the king irritably its prince marvel  do get to work as soon as possible  prince marvelprince marvel repeated the dragon  why there isnt a prince in the whole world named marvel  im pretty well posted on the history of royal families you know  im afraid hes saint george in disguise  isnt your name prince marvel inquired the king turning to the boyishlooking stranger  it is answered marvel  well its mighty strange ive never heard of you persisted the dragon  but tell me please how would you prefer to be killed  oh im not going to be killed at all replied the prince laughing  do you hear that terribus asked the dragon turning to the king he says he isnt going to be killed  but i say he is cried terribus  i have decreed his death  but do you suppose im going to kill a man against his will inquired the dragon in a reproachful voice and such a small man too  do you take me for a common assassinor a murderer  do you intend to obey my orders roared the king  no i dont and thats flat returned the dragon sharply  its time for me to take my cough medicine so if youve nothing more to say ill go back to my cave  go go go shrieked the king stamping his foot in passion  youve outlived your usefulness  youre a coward  youre a traitor  youre aaa  im a dragon and a gentleman answered the monster proudly as the king paused for lack of a word and i believe i know whats proper for dragons to do and what isnt  ive learned wisdom from my father who got into trouble with saint george and if i fought with this person who calls himself prince marvel id deserve to be a victim of your foolkiller  oh i know my business king terribus and if you knew yours youd get rid of this pretended prince as soon as possible  with this speech he winked at prince marvel turned soberly around and crawled from the room  one of the keepers got too near and the dragons breath set fire to his robe the flames being with difficulty extinguished and the gold ball on the end of the dragons tail struck a giant upon his shins and made him dance and howl in pain  but aside from these slight accidents the monster managed to leave the throneroom without undue confusion and every one including the king seemed glad to be rid of him    10  prince marvel wins his fight  when the door had closed on the royal dragon king terribus turned again to prince marvel while his crimson face glowed with embarrassment and his front eye rolled with baffled rage as he thought how vain had been all his efforts to kill this impudent invader of his domains  but his powers were by no means exhausted  he was a mighty kingthe mightiest of all in the enchanted island he believedand ways to destroy his enemies were numerous  send for a hundred of my gray men he suddenly cried and a courtier ran at once to summon them  the gray men would obey his orders without question he well knew  they were silent stubborn quick and faithful to their king  terribus had but to command and his will would be obeyed  they entered the room so quietly that nerle never knew they were there until he turned and found the hundred gray ones standing close together in the center of the hall  then prince marvel came to nerles side and whispered something in his ear  will you obey my orders they heard the king ask  and the gray men with their eyes fixed upon their master nodded all their hundred heads and put their hands upon the dangerous threetined forks that were stuck in every one of the hundred belts  prince marvel handed one end of a coiled rope to nerle and then they both sprang forward and ran around the spot where the hundred gray men stood huddled together  then they were pulled closer together than beforecloser and still closerfor the prince and nerle had surrounded them with the rope and were tying the two ends together in a tight knot  the rope cut into the waists of those on the outside and they pressed inward against their fellows until there was scarcely space to stick a knifeblade between any two of them  when the prince had tied the rope firmly king terribus who had been looking on amazed saw that his hundred gray men were fastened together like a bundle of kindlingwood and were unable to stir hand or foot  and while he still gazed openmouthed at the strange sight prince marvel tilted the bundle of men up on its edge and rolled it out of the door  it went rolling swiftly through the courtyard and bounded down the castle steps where the rope broke and the men fell sprawling in all directions on the marble walk  king terribus sighed for such treatment of his gray men whom he dearly loved made him very unhappy  but more than ever was he resolved to kill these impudent strangers who in the very heart of his kingdom where thousands bowed to his will dared openly defy his power  so after a moments thought terribus beckoned to a dwarf who robed in gay and glittering apparel stood near his throne  summon the royal dart slingers he said with a scowl  the little man bowed and hastened away to return presently with twenty curiously crooked dwarfs each armed with a sling and a quiver full of slender sharppointed darts  slay me these strangers exclaimed the king in his gruffest voice  now nerle when he beheld these terrible dart slingers of whom he had heard many tales in his boyhood began to shiver and shake with fright so that his teeth rattled one upon another  and he reflected soon shall i be content for these darts will doubtless pierce every part of my body  the dwarfs formed a line at one side of the gloomy throneroom and prince marvel who had been earnestly regarding them caught nerle by the arm and led him to the opposite wall  stand close behind me and you will be safe he whispered to his esquire  then each dwarf fixed a dart in his sling and at a word from their chief they all drew back their arms and launched a shower of the sharp missiles at the strangers  swift and true they sped each dart intended to pierce the body of the youthful knight who stood so calm before them  prince marvel had raised his right arm and in his hand was a small leather sack with a wide mouth  as the darts flew near him a strange thing happened they each and all swerved from their true course and fell rattling into the leathern sack to the wonder of the royal slingers and the dismay of king terribus himself  again screamed the king his usually mild voice hoarse with anger  so again the dwarfs cast their darts and again the leathern sack caught them every one  another flight followed and yet another till the magic sack was packed full of the darts and not a dwarf had one remaining in his quiver  amid the awed silence of the beholders of this feat the merry laughter of prince marvel rang loud and clear for the sight of the puzzled and terrified faces about him was very comical  plucking a dart from the sack he raised his arm and cried  now it is my turn  you shall have back your darts  hold shouted the king in great fear  do not i beg you slay my faithful servants  and with a wave of his hand he dismissed the dwarfs who were glad to rush from the room and escape  nerle wiped the tears from his eyes for he was sorely disappointed at having again escaped all pain and discomfort but prince marvel seated himself quietly upon a stool and looked at the scowling face of king terribus with real amusement  the monarch of spor had never before been so foiled and scorned by any living creature  defeated and humbled before his own people he bowed his crimson head on his hands and sullenly regarded his foe with his top eye  then it was that the idea came to him that no ordinary mortal could have thwarted him so easily and he began to fear he was dealingperhaps unawareswith some great magician or sorcerer  that a fairy should have assumed a mortal form he never once considered for such a thing was until then unheard of in the enchanted island of yew but with the knowledge that he had met his master whoever he might prove to be and that further attempts upon the strangers life might lead to his own undoing king terribus decided to adopt a new line of conduct hoping to accomplish by stratagem what he could not do by force  to be sure there remained his regiment of giants the pride of his kingdom but terribus dreaded to meet with another defeat and he was not at all sure after what had happened that the giants would succeed in conquering or destroying the strangers  after all he thought my only object in killing them was to prevent their carrying news of my monstrous appearance to the outside world so if i can but manage to keep them forever in my kingdom it will answer my purpose equally well  as the result of this thought he presently raised his head and spoke to prince marvel in a quiet and even cheerful voice  enough of these rude and boisterous games said he with a smile that showed his white teeth in a repulsive manner  they may have seemed to my people an ill welcome to my good friend prince marvel yet they were only designed to show the powers of the mighty magician who has become my guest  nay do not deny it prince from the first i guessed your secret and to prove myself right i called my servants to oppose you being sure they could not do you an injury  but no more of such foolingand pray forgive my merry game at your expense  henceforth we shall be friends and you are heartily welcome to the best my kingdom affords  with this speech terribus stepped down from his throne and approached prince marvel with outstretched hand  the prince was not at all deceived but he was pleased to see how cunningly the king excused his attempts to kill him  so he laughed and touched the hand terribus extended for this fairy prince seemed to have no anger against any mortal who ventured to oppose him  the strangers were now conducted with every mark of respect to a beautiful suite of apartments in the castle wherein were soft beds with velvet spreads marble baths with perfumed waters and a variety of silken and brocaded costumes from which they might select a change of raiment  no sooner had they bathed and adorned themselves fittingly than they were summoned to the kings banquet hall being escorted thither by twelve young maidens bearing torches with lavendercolored flames  the night had fallen upon the mountains outside but the great banquet hall was brilliant with the glow of a thousand candles and seated at the head of the long table was king terribus  yet here as in the throneroom the ruler of spor was dressed in simplest garments and his seat was a rough block of stone  all about him were lords and ladies in gorgeous array the walls were hung with rare embroideries the table was weighted with gold platters and richly carved goblets filled with sweet nectars  but the king himself with his horrid ugly head was like a great blot on a fair parchment and even prince marvel could not repress a shudder as he gazed upon him  terribus placed his guest upon his right hand and loaded him with honors  nerle stood behind the princes chair and served him faithfully as an esquire should  but the other servants treated nerle with much deference noting in him an air of breeding that marked him the unusual servant of an unusual master  indeed most curious were the looks cast on these marvelous men who had calmly walked into the castle of mighty terribus and successfully defied his anger for in spite of his youthful appearance and smiling face every attendant at the banquet feared prince marvel even more than they feared their own fierce king    11  the cunning of king terribus  the days that followed were pleasant ones for prince marvel and nerle who were treated as honored guests by both the king and his courtiers but the prince seemed to be the favorite for at all games of skill and trials at arms he was invariably the victor while in the evenings when the grand ballroom was lighted up and the musicians played sweet music none was so graceful in the dance as the fairy prince  nerle soon tired of the games and dancing for he had been accustomed to them at his fathers castle and moreover he was shy in the society of ladies so before many weeks had passed he began to mope and show a discontented face  one day the prince noticed his esquires dismal expression of countenance and asked the cause of it  why said nerle here i have left my home to seek worries and troubles and have found but the same humdrum life that existed at my fathers castle  here our days are made smooth and pleasant and there is no excitement or grief whatever  you have become a carpetknight prince marvel and think more of bright eyes than of daring deeds  so if you will release me from your service i will seek further adventures  nay returned the prince we will go together for i too am tired of this life of pleasure  so next morning marvel sought the presence of king terribus and said  i have come to bid your majesty adieu for my esquire and i are about to leave your dominions  at first the king laughed and his long nose began to sway from side to side  then seeing the prince was in earnest his majesty frowned and grew disturbed  finally he said  i must implore you to remain my guests a short time longer  no one has ever before visited me in my mountain home and i do not wish to lose the pleasure of your society so soon  nevertheless we must go answered the prince briefly  are you not contented asked terribus  ask whatever you may desire and it shall be granted you  we desire adventures amid new scenes said marvel and these you can not give us except by permission to depart  seeing his guest was obstinate the king ceased further argument and said  very well go if you wish  but i shall hope to see you return to us this evening  the prince paid no heed to this peculiar speech but left the hall and hurried to the courtyard of the castle where nerle was holding the horses in readiness for their journey  standing around were many rows and files of the gray men and when they reached the marble roadway they found it lined with motionless forms of the huge giants  but no one interfered with them in any way although both prince marvel and nerle knew that every eye followed them as they rode forward  curiously enough they had both forgotten from what direction they had approached the castle for whereas they had at that time noticed but one marble roadway leading to the entrance they now saw that there were several of these each one connecting with a path through the mountains  it really doesnt matter which way we go so long as we get away from the kingdom of spor said prince marvel so he selected a path by chance and soon they were riding through a mountain pass  the pleased expectant look on nerles face had gradually turned to one of gloom  i hoped we should have a fight to get away he said sadly and in that case i might have suffered considerable injury and pain  but no one has injured us in any way and perhaps king terribus is really glad to be rid of us  with good reason too if such is the case laughed marvel for mark you nerle the king has discovered we are more powerful than he is and had he continued to oppose us we might have destroyed his entire army  on they rode through the rough hill paths winding this way and that until they lost all sense of the direction in which they were going  never mind said the prince so long as we get farther and farther away from the ugly terribus i shall be satisfied  perhaps we are getting into more serious danger than ever answered nerle brightening one of the giants told me the other day that near the foot of these mountains is the kingdom of the high ki of twi  who is the high ki of twi asked prince marvel  no one knows answered nerle  and what is the kingdom of twi like  no one knows that answered nerle  then returned the prince with a smile if by chance we visit the place we shall know more than any one else  at noon they ate luncheon by the wayside nerle having filled his pouch by stealth at the breakfast table  there were great fragments of rock lying all about them and the sun beat down so fiercely that the heat reflected from the rocks was hard to bear  so the travelers did not linger over their meal but remounted and rode away as soon as possible  when the sun began to get lower in the sky the rocks beside the path threw the riders into shadow so that their journey became more pleasant  they rode along paying little attention to the way but talking and laughing merrily together until it began to grow dark  does this path never end asked prince marvel suddenly  we ought to reach some place where men dwell before long else we shall be obliged to spend the night among these rocks  and then perhaps the wolves will attack us said nerle cheerfully and tear us into pieces with their sharp teeth and claws  but even as he spoke they rode around a turn in the path and saw a sight that made them pause in astonishment  for just before them rose the castle of king terribus and along both sides of the marble walk leading up to it were ranged the lines of giants exactly as they had stood in the morning  nerle turned around in his saddle  sure enough there were the gray men in the rearstepping from behind every boulder and completely filling the rocky pathway  well what shall we do asked the esquire fight  no indeed returned prince marvel laughing at his friends eager face  it appears the path we chose winds around in a circle and so has brought us back to our startingpoint  so we must make the best of a bad blunder and spend another night with our ugly friend king terribus  they rode forward through the rows of giants to the castle where the evercourteous servants took their horses and escorted them to their former handsome apartments with every mark of respect  no one seemed in the least surprised at their speedy return and this fact at first puzzled nerle and then made him suspicious  after bathing and dusting their clothing they descended to the banquet hall where king terribus sat upon his gray stone throne and welcomed them with quiet courtesy  the sight of the kings crimson skin and deformed face sent a thrill of repugnance through prince marvel and under the impulse of a sudden thought he extended his hand toward terribus and whispered a magic word which was unheard by any around him  nerle did not notice the princes swift gesture nor the whispered word but he was staring straight at terribus at the time and he saw with surprise the eye on the top of the kings head move down toward his forehead and the eye in the center of his forehead slide slightly toward the left and the elephantlike nose shrink and shorten at the same time  also it seemed to him that the kings skin was not so crimson in color as before and that a thin growth of hair had covered his head  however no one else appeared to notice any changeleast of all terribusso nerle seated himself at the table and began to eat  it was very kind of you to return so soon to my poor castle said the king to prince marvel in his sweet voice  we could not help it laughed the prince in reply for the road wound right and left until we knew not which way we traveled and then it finally circled around again to your castle  but tomorrow we shall seek a new path and bid you farewell forever  still remarked the king gravely should you again miss your way i shall be glad to welcome your return  the prince bowed politely by way of reply and turned to address the little maiden he had once saved from death by poison  and so in feasting dancing and laughter the evening passed pleasantly enough to the prince and it was late when he called nerle to attend him to their apartment    12  the gift of beauty  the following morning marvel and nerle once more set out to leave the kingdom of spor and its ugly king  they selected another pathway leading from the castle and traveled all day coming at nightfall into view of the place whence they had started with its solemn rows of giants and gray men standing ready to receive them  this repetition of their former experience somewhat annoyed the prince while nerles usually despondent face wore a smile  i see trouble ahead murmured the esquire almost cheerfully  since the king can not conquer us by force he intends to do it by sorcery  marvel did not reply but greeted the king quietly while terribus welcomed their return as calmly as if he well knew they could not escape him  that evening the prince made another pass toward the king with his hand and muttered again the magic word  nerle was watching and saw the upper eye of terribus glide still farther down his forehead and the other eye move again toward the left  the swaying nose shrank to a few inches in length and the skin that had once been so brilliantly crimson turned to a dull red color  this time the courtiers and ladies in waiting also noticed the change in the kings features but were afraid to speak of it as any reference to their monarchs personal appearance was by law punishable by death  terribus saw the startled looks directed upon him and raised his hand to feel of his nose and eyes but thinking that if any change in his appearance had taken place he must be uglier than before he only frowned and turned away his head  the next day the kings guests made a third attempt to leave his dominions but met with no better success than before for a long and tedious ride only brought them back to their startingplace in the evening  this time prince marvel was really angry and striding into the kings presence he reproached him bitterly saying  why do you prevent us from leaving your kingdom  we have not injured you in any way  you have seen me returned terribus calmly and i do not intend you shall go back to the world and tell people how ugly i am  the prince looked at him and could not repress a smile  the two eyes of the king having been twice removed from their first position were now both in his forehead instead of below it and one was much higher than the other  and the nose although small when compared to what it had been still resembled an elephants trunk  other changes had been made for the better but terribus was still exceedingly repulsive to look upon  seeing the prince look at him and smile the king flew into a fury of anger and declared that the strangers should never while they lived be permitted to leave his castle again  prince marvel became thoughtful at this reflecting that the kings enmity all arose from his sensitiveness about his ugly appearance and this filled the youthful knight with pity rather than resentment  when they had all assembled at the evening banquet the prince for a third time made a mystic pass at the king and whispered a magic word and behold this time the charm was complete  for the two front eyes of terribus fell into their proper places his nose became straight and well formed and his skin took on a natural healthy color  moreover he now had a fine head of soft brown hair with eyebrows and eyelashes to match and his head was shapely and in proportion to his body  as for the eye that had formerly been in the back of his head it had disappeared completely  so amazed were the subjects of the transformed kingwho was now quite handsome to look uponthat they began to murmur together excitedly and something in the new sensations he experienced gave to the kings face likewise an expression of surprise  knowing from their pleased looks that he must have improved in appearance he found courage to raise his hand to his nose and found it well formed  then he touched his eyes and realized they were looking straight out from his face like those of other people  for some moments after making these discoveries the king remained motionless a smile of joy gradually spreading over his features  then he said aloud  what has happened  why do you all look so startled  your majesty is no longer ugly replied marvel laughingly so that when nerle and i leave your kingdom we can proclaim nothing less than praise of your dignified and handsome appearance  is my face indeed pleasing demanded the king eagerly  it is cried the assembled courtiers and ladies as with one voice  bring me a mirror said the king  i shall look at my reflection for the first time in many years  the mirror being brought king terribus regarded himself for a long time with pleased astonishment and then his sensitive nature being overcome by the shock of his good fortune he burst into a flood of tears and rushed from the room  the courtiers and ladies now bestowed many grateful thanks upon prince marvel for his kind deed for they realized that thereafter their lives would be safer from the kings anger and much pleasanter in every way  terribus is not bad by nature said one but he brooded upon his ugliness so much that the least thing served to throw him into a violent passion and our lives were never safe from one day to another  by and by two giants entered the hall and carried away the throne of gray stone where terribus had been accustomed to sit and other slaves brought a gorgeous throne of gold studded with precious jewels which they put in its place  and after a time the king himself returned to the room his simple gray gown replaced by flowing robes of purple with rich embroideries such as he had not worn for many years  my people said he addressing those present with kindness and dignity it seems to me fitting that a handsome king should be handsomely attired and an ugly one clothed simply  for years i have been so terrible in feature that i dared not even look at my own image in a mirror  but now thanks to the gracious magic of my guest i have become like other men and hereafter you will find my rule as kind as it was formerly cruel  tonight in honor of this joyous occasion we shall feast and make merry and it is my royal command that you all do honor and reverence to the illustrious prince marvel  a loud shout of approval greeted this speech and the evening was merry indeed  terribus joined freely in the revelry laughing as gaily as the lightesthearted damsel present  it was nearly morning before they all retired and as they sought their beds nerle asked the prince in a voice that sounded like an illnatured growl  why did you give the king beauty after his treatment of us  marvel looked at the reproachful face of his esquire and smiled  when you are older said he you will find that often there are many ways to accomplish a single purpose  the kings ugliness was the bar to our leaving his country for he feared our gossip  so the easiest way for us to compass our escape was to take away his reason for detaining us thus i conquered the king in my own way and at the same time gained his gratitude and friendship  will he allow us to depart in the morning inquired nerle  i think so said marvel  it was late when they rose from their slumbers but having breakfasted the princes first act was to seek the king  we wish to leave your kingdom said he  will you let us go  terribus grasped the hand of his guest and pressed it with fervor while tears of gratitude stood in his eyes  i should prefer that you remain with me always and be my friend he answered  but if you choose to leave me i shall not interfere in any way with your wishes  prince marvel looked at him thoughtfully and then said my time on this island is short  in a few months prince marvel will have passed out of the knowledge of men and his name will be forgotten  before then i hope to visit the kingdoms of dawna and auriel and plenta so i must not delay but beg you will permit me to depart at once  very well answered terribus  come with me and i shall show you the way  he led the prince and nerle to a high wall of rock and placing his hand upon its rough surface touched a hidden spring  instantly an immense block of stone began to swing backward disclosing a passage large enough for a man on horseback to ride through  this is the one road that leads out of my kingdom said terribus the others all begin and end at the castle  so that unless you know the secret of this passage you could never escape from spor  but where does this road lead asked marvel  to the kingdom of auriel which you desire to visit  it is not a straight road for it winds around the land of twi so it will carry you a little out of your way  what is the land of twi inquired the prince  a small country hidden from the view of all travelers said terribus no one has ever yet found a way to enter the land of twi yet there is a rumor that it is ruled by a mighty personage called the high ki  and does the rumor state what the high ki of twi is like  no indeed returned the king smiling so it will do you no good to be curious  and now farewell and may good luck attend you  yet bear in mind the fact that king terribus of spor owes you a mighty debt of gratitude and if you ever need my services you have but to call on me and i shall gladly come to your assistance  i thank you said marvel but there is small chance of my needing help  farewell and may your future life be pleasant and happy  with this he sprang to the saddle of his prancing charger and followed by nerle rode slowly through the stone arch  the courtiers and ladies had flocked from the palace to witness their departure and the giants and dwarfs and gray men were drawn up in long lines to speed the kings guests  so it was a brilliant sight that marvel and nerle looked back on but once they were clear of the arch the great stone rolled back into its place shutting them out completely from the kingdom of spor with its turreted castle and transformed king    13  the hidden kingdom of twi  knowing that at last they were free to roam according to their desire the travelers rode gaily along the paths taking but scant heed of their way  our faces are set toward new adventures remarked the prince  let us hope they will prove more pleasant than the last  to be sure responded nerle  let us hope at any rate that we shall suffer more privations and encounter more trouble than we did in that mountainous kingdom of spor  then he added for one reason i regret you are my master  what is that reason asked the prince turning to smile upon his esquire  you have a way of overcoming all difficulties without any trouble whatsoever and that deprives me of any chance of coming to harm while in your company  cheer up my boy cried marvel  did i not say there are new adventures before us  we may not come through them so easily as we came through the others  that is true replied nerle it is always best to hope and then he inquired why do you stop here in the middle of the path  because the path has ended rather suddenly answered marvel  here is a thick hedge of prickly briers barring our way  nerle looked over his masters shoulder and saw that a great hedge high and exceedingly thick cut off all prospect of their advancing  this is pleasant said he but i might try to force our way through the hedge  the briers would probably prick me severely and that would be delightful  try it the prince returned with twinkling eyes  nerle sprang from his horse to obey but at the first contact with the briers he uttered a howl of pain and held up his hands which were bleeding in a dozen places from the wounds of the thorns  ah that will content you for a time i trust said marvel  now follow me and we will ride along beside the hedge until we find an opening  for either it will come to an end or there will prove to be a way through it to the other side  so they rode alongside the hedge for hour after hour yet it did not end nor could they espy any way to get through the thickly matted briers  by and by night fell and they tethered their horses to some shrubs where there were a few scanty blades of grass for them to crop and then laid themselves down upon the ground with bare rocks for pillows where they managed to sleep soundly until morning  they had brought a supply of food in their pouches and on this they breakfasted afterward continuing their journey beside the hedge  at noon prince marvel uttered an exclamation of surprise and stopped his horse  what is it asked nerle  i have found the handkerchief with which you wiped the blood from your hands yesterday morning and then carelessly dropped replied the prince  this proves that we have made a complete circle around this hedge without finding a way to pass through it  in that case said nerle we had better leave the hedge and go in another direction  not so declared marvel  the hedge incloses some unknown country and i am curious to find out what it is  but there is no opening remonstrated nerle  then we must make one  wouldnt you like to enjoy a little more pain  thank you answered nerle my hands are still smarting very comfortably from the pricks of yesterday  therefore i must make the attempt myself said the prince and drawing his sword he whispered a queer word to it and straightway began slashing at the hedge  the brambles fell fast before his blade and when he had cut a big heap of branches from the hedge nerle dragged them to one side and the prince began again  it was marvelous how thick the hedge proved  only a magic sword could have done this work and remained sharp and only a fairy arm could have proved strong enough to hew through the tough wood  but the magic sword and fairy arm were at work and naught could resist them  after a time the last branches were severed and dragged from the path and then the travelers rode their horses through the gap into the unknown country beyond  they saw at first glance that it was a land of great beauty but after that one look both prince marvel and nerle paused and rubbed their eyes to assure themselves that their vision was not blurred  before them were two trees exactly alike  and underneath the trees two cows were grazingeach a perfect likeness of the other  at their left were two cottages with every door and window and chimney the exact counterpart of another  before these houses two little boys were playing evidently twins for they not only looked alike and dressed alike but every motion one made was also made by the other at the same time and in precisely the same way  when one laughed the other laughed and when one stubbed his toe and fell down the other did likewise and then they both sat up and cried lustily at the same time  at this two womenit was impossible to tell one from the otherrushed out of the two houses caught up the two boys shook and dusted them in precisely the same way and led them by their ears back into the houses  again the astonished travelers rubbed their eyes and then prince marvel looked at nerle and said  i thought at first that i saw everything double but there seems to be only one of you  and of you answered the boy  but see there are two hills ahead of us and two paths lead from the houses over the hills  how strange it all is  just then two birds flew by close together and perfect mates and the cows raised their heads and mooed at the same time and two menalso twinscame over the two hills along the two paths with two dinnerpails in their hands and entered the two houses  they were met at the doors by the two women who kissed them exactly at the same time and helped them off with their coats with the same motions and closed the two doors with two slams at the same instant  nerle laughed  what sort of country have we got into he asked  let us find out replied the prince and riding up to one of the houses he knocked on the door with the hilt of his sword  instantly the doors of both houses flew open and both men appeared in the doorways  both started back in amazement at sight of the strangers and both women shrieked and both little boys began to cry both mothers boxed the childrens ears and both men gasped out  whowho are you  their voices were exactly alike and their words were spoken in unison prince marvel replied courteously  we are two strangers who have strayed into your country  but i do not understand why our appearance should so terrify you  whyyou are singular  there is only half of each of you exclaimed the two men together  not so said the prince trying hard not to laugh in their faces we may be single while you appear to be double but each of us is perfect nevertheless  perfect  and only half of you cried the men  and again the two women who were looking over their husbands shoulders screamed at sight of the strangers and again the two boys who were clinging to their mothers dresses in the same positions began to cry  we did not know such strange people existed said the two men both staring at the strangers and then wiping the beads of perspiration from their two brows with two faded yellow handkerchiefs  nor did we retorted the prince  i assure you we are as much surprised as you are  nerle laughed again at this and to hear only one of the strangers speak and the other only laugh seemed to terrify the double people anew  so prince marvel quickly asked  please tell us what country this is  the land of twi answered both men together  oh the land of twi  and why is the light here so dim continued the prince  dim repeated the men as if surprised why this is twilight of course  of course said nerle  i hadnt thought of that  we are in the long hidden land of twi which all men have heard of but no man has found before  and who may you be questioned the prince looking from one man to the other curiously  we are twis they answered  twice  twisinhabitants of twi  its the same thing laughed nerle  you see everything twice in this land  are none of your people single asked prince marvel  single returned the men as if perplexed  we dont understand  are you all doubleor are some of you just one said the prince who found it difficult to put his question plainly  what does one mean asked the men  there is no such word as one in our language  they have no need of such a word declared nerle  we are only poor laborers explained the men  but over the hills lie the cities of twi where the ki and the kiki dwell and also the high ki  ah said marvel ive heard of your high ki  who is he  the men shook their heads together and with the same motion  we have never seen the glorious high ki they answered  the sight of their faces is forbidden  none but the ki and the kiki has seen the supreme rulers and high ki  im getting mixed said nerle  all this about the ki and the kiki and the high ki makes me dizzy  lets go on to the city and explore it  that is a good suggestion replied the prince  good by my friends he added addressing the men  they both bowed and although they still seemed somewhat frightened they answered him civilly and in the same words and closed their doors at the same time  so prince marvel and nerle rode up the double path to the hills and the two cows became frightened and ran away with the same swinging step keeping an exact space apart  and when they were a safe distance they both stopped looked over their right shoulders and mooed at the same instant    14  the ki and the kiki  from the tops of the hills the travelers caught their first glimpse of the wonderful cities of twi  two walls surrounded the cities and in the walls were two gates just alike  within the inclosures stood many houses but all were built in pairs from the poorest huts to the most splendid palaces  every street was double the pavements running side by side  there were two lampposts on every corner and in the dim twilight that existed these lampposts were quite necessary  if there were trees or bushes anywhere they invariably grew in pairs and if a branch was broken on one it was sure to be broken on the other and dead leaves fell from both trees at identically the same moment  much of this marvel and nerle learned after they had entered the cities but the view from the hills showed plainly enough that the double plan existed everywhere and in every way in this strange land  they followed the paths down to the gates of the walls where two pairs of soldiers rushed out and seized their horses by the bridles  these soldiers all seemed to be twins or at least mates and each one of each pair was as like the other as are two peas growing in the same pod  if one had a red nose the others was red in the same degree and the soldiers that held the bridles of nerles horse both had their left eyes bruised and blackened as from a blow of the same force  these soldiers as they looked upon nerle and the prince seemed fully as much astonished and certainly more frightened than their prisoners they were dressed in bright yellow uniforms with green buttons and the soldiers who had arrested the prince had both torn their left coatsleeves and had patches of the same shape upon the seats of their trousers  how dare you stop us fellows asked the prince sternly  the soldiers holding his horse both turned and looked inquiringly at the soldiers holding nerles horse and these turned to look at a double captain who came out of two doors in the wall and walked up to them  such things were never before heard of said the two captains their startled eyes fixed upon the prisoners  we must take them to the ki and the kiki  why so asked prince marvel  because replied the officers they are our rulers under grace of the high ki and all unusual happenings must be brought to their notice  it is our law you knowthe law of the kingdom of twi  very well said marvel quietly take us where you will but if any harm is intended us you will be made to regret it  the ki and the kiki will decide returned the captains gravely their words sounding at the same instant  and then the two pairs of soldiers led the horses through the double streets the captains marching ahead with drawn swords and crowds of twin men and twin women coming from the double doors of the double houses to gaze upon the strange sight of men and horses who were not double  presently they came upon a twin palace with twin turrets rising high into the air and before the twin doors the prisoners dismounted marvel was escorted through one door and nerle through another and then they saw each other going down a double hallway to a room with a double entrance  passing through this they found themselves in a large hall with two domes set side by side in the roof  the domes were formed of stained glass and the walls of the hall were ornamented by pictures in pairs each pair showing identically the same scenes  this was of course reasonable enough in such a land where two people would always look at two pictures at the same time and admire them in the same way with the same thoughts  beneath one of the domes stood a double throne on which sat the ki of twia pair of graybearded and baldheaded men who were lean and lank and stoopshouldered  they had small eyes black and flashing long hooked noses great pointed ears and they were smoking two pipes from which the smoke curled in exactly the same circles and clouds  beneath the other dome sat the kiki of twi also on double thrones similar to those of the ki  the kiki were two young men and had golden hair combed over their brows and banged straight across and their eyes were blue and mild in expression and their cheeks pink and soft  the kiki were playing softly upon a pair of musical instruments that resembled mandolins and they were evidently trying to learn a new piece of music for when one kiki struck a false note the other kiki struck the same false note at the same time and the same expression of annoyance came over the two faces at the same moment  when the prisoners entered the pairs of captains and soldiers bowed low to the two pairs of rulers and the ki exclaimedboth in the same voice of surprise  great kikakoo what have we here  most wonderful prisoners your highnesses answered the captains we found them at your cities gates and brought them to you at once they are as your highnesses will see each singular and but half of what he should be  tis so cried the double ki in loud voices and slapping their right thighs with their right palms at the same time  most remarkable  most remarkable  i dont see anything remarkable about it returned prince marvel calmly  it is you who are not singular but double that seem strange and outlandish  perhapsperhaps said the two old men thoughtfully  it is what we are not accustomed to that seems to us remarkable  eh kiki they added turning to the other rulers  the kiki who had not spoken a word but continued to play softly simply nodded their blond heads carelessly so the ki looked again at the prisoners and asked  how did you get here  we cut a hole through the prickly hedge replied prince marvel  a hole through the hedge  great kikakoo cried the graybearded ki is there then anything or any place on the other side of the hedge  why of course  the world is there returned the prince laughing  the old men looked puzzled and glanced sharply from their little black eyes at their prisoners  we thought nothing existed outside the hedge of twi they answered simply  but your presence here proves we were wrong  eh kiki  this last was again directed toward the pair of musicians who continued to play and only nodded quietly as before  now that you are here said the twin ki stroking their two gray beards with their two left hands in a nervous way it must be evident to you that you do not belong here  therefore you must go back through the hedge again and stay on the other side  eh kiki  the kiki still continued playing but now spoke the first words the prisoners had heard from them  they must die said the kiki in soft and agreeable voices  die echoed the twin ki die  great kikakoo  and why so  because if there is a world on the other side of the hedge they would tell on their return all about the land of twi and others of their kind would come through the hedge from curiosity and annoy us we can not be annoyed  we are busy  having delivered this speech both the kiki went on playing the new tune as if the matter was settled  nonsense retorted the old ki angrily  you are getting more and more bloodthirsty every day our sweet and gentle kiki  but we are the kiand we say the prisoners shall not die  we say they shall answered the youthful kiki nodding their two heads at the same time with a positive motion  you may be the ki but we are the kiki and your superior  not in this case declared the old men  where life and death are concerned we have equal powers with you  and if we disagree asked the players gently  great kikakoo  if we disagree the high ki must judge between us roared the twin ki excitedly  quite so answered the kiki  the strangers shall die  they shall not die stormed the old men with fierce gestures toward the others while both pairs of black eyes flashed angrily  then we disagree and they must be taken to the high ki returned the blond musicians beginning to play another tune  the two ki rose from their thrones paced two steps to the right and three steps to the left and then sat down again  very well they said to the captains who had listened unmoved to the quarrel of the rulers keep these halfmen safe prisoners until tomorrow morning and then the kiki and we ourselves will conduct them to the mighty high ki  at this command the twin captains bowed again to both pairs of rulers and led prince marvel and nerle from the room  then they were escorted along the streets to the twin houses of the captains and here the officers paused and scratched their left ears with uncertain gestures  there being only half of each of you they said we do not know how to lock each of you in double rooms  oh let us both occupy the same room said prince marvel  we prefer it  very well answered the captains we must transgress our usual customs in any event so you may as well be lodged as you wish  so nerle and the prince were thrust into a large and pleasant room of one of the twin houses the double doors were locked upon them by twin soldiers and they were left to their own thoughts    15  the high ki of twi  tell me prince are we awake or asleep asked nerle as soon as they were alone  there is no question of our being awake replied the prince with a laugh  but what a curious country it isand what a funny people  we cant call them odd or singular said the esquire for everything is even in numbers and double in appearance  it makes me giddy to look at them and i keep feeling of myself to make sure there is still only one of me  you are but half a boy laughed the princeat least so long as you remain in the land of twi  id like to get out of it in doublequick time answered nerle and we should even now be on the other side of the hedge were it not for that wicked pair of kiki who are determined to kill us  it is strange said the prince thoughtfully that the fiercelooking old ki should be our friends and the gentle kiki our enemies  how little one can tell from appearances what sort of heart beats in a persons body  before nerle could answer the two doors opened and two pairs of soldiers entered  they drew two small tables before the prince and two before nerle and then other pairs of twin soldiers came and spread cloths on the tables and set twin platters of meat and bread and fruit on each of the tables  when the meal had been arranged the prisoners saw that there was enough for four people instead of two and the soldiers realized this also for they turned puzzled looks first on the tables and then on the prisoners  then they shook all their twin heads gravely and went away locking the twin doors behind them  we have one advantage in being singular said nerle cheerfully and that is we are not likely to starve to death  for we can eat the portions of our missing twins as well as our own  i should think you would enjoy starving remarked the prince  no i believe i have more exquisite suffering in store for me since i have met that gentle pair of kiki said nerle  while they were eating the two captains came in and sat down in two chairs  these captains seemed friendly fellows and after watching the strangers for a while they remarked  we are glad to see you able to eat so heartily for tomorrow you will probably die  that is by no means certain replied marvel cutting a piece from one of the twin birds on a platter before himto the extreme surprise of the captains who had always before seen both birds carved alike at the same time  your graybearded old ki say we shall not die  true answered the captains  but the kiki have declared you shall  their powers seem to be equal said nerle and we are to be taken before the high ki for judgment  therein lies your danger returned the captains speaking in the same tones and with the same accents on their words  for it is well known the kiki has more influence with the high ki than the ki has  hold on cried nerle you are making me dizzy again  i cant keep track of all these kis  what is the high ki like asked prince marvel who was much interested in the conversation of the captains  but this question the officers seemed unable to answer  they shook their heads slowly and said  the high ki are not visible to the people of twi  only in cases of the greatest importance are the high ki ever bothered or even approached by the ki and the kiki who are supposed to rule the land according to their own judgment  but if they chance to disagree then the matter is carried before the high ki who live in a palace surrounded by high walls in which there are no gates  only these rulers have ever seen the other side of the walls or know what the high ki are like  that is strange said the prince  but we ourselves it seems are to see the high ki tomorrow and whoever they may chance to be we hope to remain alive after the interview  that is a vain hope answered the captains for it is well known that the high ki usually decide in favor of the kiki and against the wishes of the old ki  that is certainly encouraging said nerle  when the captains had gone and left them to themselves the esquire confided to his master his expectations in the following speech  this high ki sounds something terrible and fierce in my ears and as they are doubtless a pair they will be twice terrible and fierce perhaps his royal doublets will torture me most exquisitely before putting me to death and then i shall feel that i have not lived in vain  they slept in comfortable beds that night although an empty twin bed stood beside each one they occupied  and in the morning they were served another excellent meal after which the captains escorted them again to the twin palaces of the ki and the kiki  there the two pairs of rulers met them and headed the long procession of soldiers toward the palace of the high ki  first came a band of music in which many queer sorts of instruments were played in pairs by twin musicians and it was amusing to nerle to see the twin drummers roll their twin drums exactly at the same time and the twin trumpets peal out twin notes  after the band marched the double kiki and the double ki their four bodies side by side in a straight line  the kiki had left their musical instruments in the palace and now wore yellow gloves with green stitching down the backs and swung goldheaded canes jauntily as they walked  the ki stooped their aged shoulders and shuffled along with their hands in their pockets and only once did they speak and that was to roar great kikakoo when the kiki jabbed their canes down on the kis toes  following the kiki and the ki came the prince and nerle escorted by the twin captains and then there were files of twin soldiers bringing up the rear  crowds of twin people with many twin children amongst them turned out to watch the unusual display and many pairs of twin dogs barked together in unison and snapped at the heels of the marching twin soldiers  by and by they reached the great wall surrounding the high kis palace and sure enough there was never a gate in the wall by which any might enter  but when the ki and the kiki had blown a shrill signal upon two pairs of whistles they all beheld two flights of silver steps begin to descend from the top of the wall and these came nearer and nearer the ground until at last they rested at the feet of the ki then the old men began ascending the steps carefully and slowly and the captains motioned to the prisoners to follow  so prince marvel followed one of the ki up the steps and nerle the other ki while the two kiki came behind them so they could not escape  so to the top of the wall they climbed where a pair of twin servants in yellow and greenwhich seemed to be the royal colorswelcomed them and drew up the pair of silver steps afterward letting them down on the other side of the wall side by side  they descended in the same order as they had mounted to the top of the wall and now prince marvel and nerle found themselves in a most beautiful garden filled with twin beds of twin flowers with many pairs of rare shrubs  also there were several double statuettes on pedestals and double fountains sending exactly the same sprays of water the same distance into the air  double walks ran in every direction through the garden and in the center of the inclosure stood a magnificent twin palace built of blocks of white marble exquisitely carved  the ki and the kiki at once led their prisoners toward the palace and entered at its large arched double doors where several pairs of servants met them  these servants they found were all dumb so that should they escape from the palace walls they could tell no tales of the high ki  the prisoners now proceeded through several pairs of halls winding this way and that and at last came to a pair of golden double doors leading into the throneroom of the mighty high ki  here they all paused and the kiki both turned to the prince and nerle and said  you are the only persons excepting ourselves and the palace servants who have ever been permitted to see the high ki of twi  as you are about to die that does not matter but should you by any chance be permitted to live you must never breathe a word of what you are about to see under penalty of a sure and horrible death  the prisoners made no reply to this speech and after the two kiki had given them another mild look from their gentle blue eyes these officials clapped their twin hands together and the doors of gold flew open  a perfect silence greeted them during which the double ki and the double kiki bent their four bodies low and advanced into the throneroom followed by prince marvel and nerle  in the center of the room stood two thrones of dainty filigree work in solid gold and over them were canopies of yellow velvet the folds of which were caught up and draped with bands of green ribbon  and on the thrones were seated two of the sweetest and fairest little maidens that mortal man had ever beheld  their lovely hair was fine as a spiders web their eyes were kind and smiling their cheeks soft and dimpled their mouths shapely as a cupids bow and tinted like the petals of a rose  upon their heads were set two crowns of fine spun gold worked into fantastic shapes and set with glittering gems  their robes were soft silks of pale yellow with strings of sparkling emeralds for ornament  anything so lovely and fascinating as these little maids who were precisely alike in every particular neither prince marvel nor nerle had ever dreamed could exist  they stood for a time spellbound and filled with admiration while the two pairs of rulers bowed again and again before the dainty and lovable persons of their high ki  but it was hard for nerle to keep quiet for long and presently he exclaimed in a voice loud enough to be heard by all present  by the great kikakoo of our friends the ki these darling high ki of twi are sweet enough to be kissed    16  the rebellion of the high ki  the bold speech of nerles made the two damsels laugh at the same time and their sweet laughter sounded like rippling strains of harmonious music  but the two kiki frowned angrily and the two ki looked at the boy in surprise as if wondering at his temerity  who are these strangers asked the pretty high ki speaking together as all the twins of twi did and why are they not mates but only half of each other  these questions your supreme highnesses said the blondhaired pair of kiki we are unable to answer  perhaps then the strangers can answer themselves said the little maids smiling first upon the kiki and then upon the prisoners  prince marvel bowed  i am from the great outside world said he and my name is prince marvel  until now i have never seen people that live in pairs and speak in unison and act in the same way and think the same thoughts my world is much bigger than your world and in it every person is proud to think and act for himself  you say i am only a half but that is not so  i am perfect without a counterpart my friend nerle is perfect without a counterpart and it is yourselves who are halved for in the land of twi no person is complete or perfect without its other half and it seems to take two of you to make one manor one maid  the sweet faces of the twin high ki grew thoughtful at this speech and they said  indeed it may be you are right  but it is our custom in twi to do everything double and to live double then turning to the ki they asked why have you brought these strangers here  to ask your supreme highnesses to permit them to return again to the world from whence they came answered the ki both of them regarding their supreme rulers earnestly  but here the kiki spoke up quickly in their mild voices saying  that is not our idea your highnesses  we the kiki of twi think it best the strangers should be put to death  and we pray your supreme highnesses to favor our wish  the two little maids looked from the ki to the kiki and frowned and pouted their rosy lips in evident perplexity  but nerle whispered to prince marvel  its all up with us  i know very well why her royal doublets always favors the kiki  its because they are young and handsome while the ki are old and ugly  both of her will condemn us to deathyou see if she dont  this seemed somewhat mixed but nerle was in earnest and prince marvel who had not forgotten his fairy lore began to weave a silent spell over the head of the nearest twin high ki  but just as it was completed and before he had time to work the spell on the other twin the kiki grew impatient and exclaimed  we beg your highnesses not to keep us waiting  let us have your decision at once  and the twin maidens raised their fair heads and replied  but the reply was of such a nature that both the old ki and both the young kiki staggered backward in amazement  for one of the twin high ki said  they shall die  and the other twin high ki said at the same instant  they shall not die  had twin thunderbolts fallen through the twin roofs of the twin palaces and struck the twin ki and the twin kiki upon their twin heads it would have created no more stupendous a sensation than did this remark never before had any two halves of a twin of the land of twi thought differently or spoken differently  indeed it startled the two maidens themselves as much as it did their hearers for each one turned her head toward the other and for the first time in her life looked into the others face  this act was fully as strange as their speech and a sudden horrible thought came into the startled heads of the twin ki and the twin kiki the high ki of twi was no longer one but two  and these two were thinking and acting each independent of the other  it is no wonder the shock rendered them speechless for a time and they stood swaying their four bodies with their eight eyes bulging out like those of fishes and their four mouths wide open as if the two pairs had become one quartet  the faces of the two maids flushed as they gazed upon each other  how dare you contradict me asked one  how dare you contradict me demanded the other and not only were these questions asked separately but the accent on the words was different  and their twin minds seemed to get farther apart every moment  im the high ki of twi said one  youre not  im the high ki retorted the other  the strangers shall die snapped one  they shall live cried the other  my will is supreme  its not  my will is supreme returned the other twin  the bald heads of the ancient ki were bobbing in amazement first to one maid and then toward the other  the blond hairs of the two kiki were standing almost on end and their eyes stared straight before them as if stupefied with astonishment  nerle was bellowing with rude laughter and holding his sides to keep from getting a stitch in them while prince marvel stood quietly attentive and smiling with genuine amusement  for he alone understood what had happened to separate the twin high ki  the girls did not seem to know how to act under their altered conditions  after a time one of them said  we will leave our dispute to be settled by the ki and the kiki  very well agreed the other  then i say your half is right declared the kiki both their right forefingers pointing to the maiden who had condemned the strangers to death  and i decide that your half is right exclaimed the ki both their trembling forefingers pointing to the maiden who had said the strangers should live  well said one girl  well said the other  the powers of the ki and the kiki are equal said the first  we are no nearer a settlement of our dispute than we were before  my dear young ladies said prince marvel politely i beg you will take time to think the matter over and see if you can not come to an agreement  we are in no hurry  very well decided the twins speaking both together this time  we command you all to remain in the palace until we have settled our own strange dispute  the servants will care for you and when we are ready to announce our decision we shall again send for you  every one bowed at this command and retired from the room but nerle looked over his shoulder as he went through the doorway and saw that the two high ki had turned in their seats and were facing each other and that both their faces wore angry and determined expressions    17  the separation of the high ki  for nearly a week prince marvel and nerle remained confined to the palace and gardens of the high ki  together with the twin ki who seemed to be friendly to them they occupied one of the twin palaces while the kiki secluded themselves in the other  the pretty high ki maidens they did not see at all nor did they know what part of the palaces they occupied not being permitted to wander away from the rooms allotted to them except to walk in the garden there was no way for them to escape had they felt inclined to for the silver steps had disappeared  from the garden walks they sometimes caught sight of the solemn heads of the handsome kiki looking at them through the twin windows of the other palace and although the expression of their faces was always mild and gentle nerle and marvel well knew the kiki were only waiting in the hope of having them killed  are you nervous about the decision of the pretty high ki asked nerle one day  no indeed said the prince laughing for i do not expect them to kill me in any event  if i felt as sure of my safety returned the boy it would destroy all my pleasure  these are really happy days for me  every moment i expect to see the executioner arrive with his ax  the executioner is double said the two old ki breaking into the conversation  you should say you expect to see the executioners arrive with their axes  then how will they cut off my head with two axes  for i suppose they will both chop at the same time and i have but one neck  wait and see answered the two ki sighing deeply and rubbing their red noses thoughtfully  oh ill wait answered the boy but as for seeing them cut off my head i refuse for i intend to shut my eyes  so they sat in their rooms or walked in the gardens yawning and waiting until one day just as the two clocks on the wall were striking twentyfour oclock the door opened and to their surprise one of the high ki twins walked in upon them  she was as sweet and fair to look upon as when she occupied one of the beautiful thrones but at first no one could tell which of the high ki she wastheir friend or their enemy  even the ki were puzzled and anxious until the girl said  my other half and i have completely separated for we have agreed to disagree for all time  and she has gone to ask the kiki to assist her for war is declared between us  and hereafter her color is to be the green and mine the yellow and we intend to fight until one of us conquers and overthrows the other  this announcement was interesting to marvel and nerle but greatly shocked the aged ki who asked  what is to become of our kingdom  half of a high ki can not rule it it is against the law  i will make my own laws when i have won the fight returned the girl with a lovely smile so do not let that bother you  and now tell me will you help me to fight my battles  willingly exclaimed nerle and prince marvel almost as if they had been twins of twi  and the ki rubbed their bald heads a moment and then sneezed together and wiped their eyes on faded yellow handkerchiefs and finally declared they would stick to her supreme highness through thick and thin  then go over the wall to the cities at once and get together all the soldiers to fight for me and my cause commanded the girl  the twin ki at once left the room and the high ki sat down and began to ask questions of prince marvel and nerle about the big outside world from whence they came  nerle was rather shy and bashful before the dainty little maiden whose yellow robe contrasted delightfully with her pink cheeks and blue eyes and brown flowing locks but prince marvel did not mind girls at all so he talked with her freely and she in return allowed him to examine the pretty gold crown she wore upon her brow  by and by the ki came back with both faces sad and gloomy  your highness they announced we have bad news for you  the other high ki who is wearing a green gown has been more prompt in action than yourself  she and the kiki have secured the silver steps and will allow no others to use them and already they have sent for the soldiers of the royal armies to come and aid them  so we are unable to leave the garden and presently the army will be here to destroy us  then the girl showed her good courage for she laughed and said  then we must remain here and fight to the last and if i am unable to save you who are my friends it will be because i can not save myself  this speech pleased prince marvel greatly  he kissed the little maids hand respectfully and said  fear nothing your highness  my friend and i are not so helpless as you think  we consider it our privilege to protect and save you instead of your saving us and we are really able to do this in spite of the other high ki and her entire army  so they remained quietly in the palace the rest of that day and no one molested them in the least  in the evening the girl played and sang for them and the ancient pair of ki danced a doubleshuffle for their amusement that nearly convulsed them with laughter  for one danced exactly like the other and the old mens legs were still very nimble although their wrinkled faces remained anxiously grave throughout their antics  nerle also sang a song about the king of thieves whom prince marvel had conquered and another about the red rogue of dawna so that altogether the evening passed pleasantly enough and they managed to forget all their uneasy doubts of the morrow  when at last they separated for the night prince marvel alone did not seek his bed there was still some business he wished to transact  so he shut himself up in his room and summoned before him by means of his fairy knowledge the prince of the knooks the king of the ryls and the governor of the goblins  these were all three his especial friends and he soon told them the story of the quarrel and separation of the twin high ki and claimed their assistance  then he told them how they might aid him and afterward dismissed them  having thus accomplished his task the fairy prince went to bed and slept peacefully the remainder of the night  the next morning the blond kiki and all the army of twi which had been won to their cause came climbing up the silver steps and over the wall to the palace of the green high ki but what was their amazement to find the twin palaces separated by a wall so high that no ladders nor steps they possessed could reach to the top  it had been built in a single night and only prince marvel and his fairy friends knew how the work had been done so quickly  the yellow high ki coming downstairs to breakfast with her friends found herself securely shut in from her enemies and the baldheaded old ki were so pleased to escape that they danced another jig from pure joy  over the wall could be heard the shouts and threats of the army of twi who were seeking a way to get at the fugitives but for the present our friends knew themselves to be perfectly safe and they could afford to laugh at the fury of the entire population of twi    18  the rescue of the high ki  after several days of siege prince marvel began to feel less confident of the safety of his little party  the frantic kiki had built double batteringrams and were trying to batter down the high wall and they had built several pairs of long ladders with which to climb over the wall and their soldiers were digging two tunnels in the ground in order to crawl under the wall  not at once could they succeed for the wall was strong and it would take long to batter it down and nerle stood on top of the wall and kicked over the ladders as fast as the soldiers of twi set them up and the graybearded ki stood in the garden holding two big flat boards with which to whack the heads of any who might come through the tunnels  but prince marvel realized that the perseverance of his foes might win in the end unless he took measures to defeat them effectually  so he summoned swift messengers from among the sound elves who are accustomed to travel quickly and they carried messages from him to wultakim the king of the reformed thieves and to king terribus of spor who had both promised him their assistance in case he needed it the prince did not tell his friends of this action but after the messengers had been dispatched he felt easier in his mind  the little high ki remained as sweet and brave and lovable as ever striving constantly to cheer and encourage her little band of defenders  but none of them was very much worried and nerle confided to the maiden in yellow the fact that he expected to suffer quite agreeably when the kiki at last got him in their clutches  finally a day came when two big holes were battered through the wall and then the twin soldiers of twi poured through the holes and began to pound on the doors of the palace itself in which prince marvel and nerle the ki and the yellow high ki had locked themselves as securely as possible  the prince now decided it was high time for his friends to come to their rescue but they did not appear and before long the doors of the palace gave way and the soldiers rushed upon them in a vast throng  nerle wanted to fight and to slay as many of the twi people as possible but the prince would not let him  these poor soldiers are but doing what they consider their duty he said and it would be cruel to cut them down with our swords  have patience i pray you  our triumph will come in good time  the kiki who came into the palace accompanied by the green high ki ordered the twin soldiers to bind all the prisoners with cords  so one pair of soldiers bound the ki and another pair nerle and the prince using exactly the same motions in the operation  but when it came to binding the yellow high ki the scene was very funny  for twin soldiers tried to do the binding and there was only one to bind so that one soldier went through the same motions as his twin on empty air and when his other half had firmly bound the girl his own rope fell harmless to the ground  but it seemed impossible for one of the twins to do anything different from the other so that was the only way the act could be accomplished  then the greenrobed high ki walked up to the one in yellow and laughed in her face saying  you now see which of us is the most powerful and therefore the most worthy to rule  had you remained faithful to our handsome kiki as i did you would not now be defeated and disgraced  there is no disgrace in losing one battle returned the other girl proudly  you are mistaken if you think you have conquered me and you are wrong to insult one who is for the time being your captive  the maiden in green looked for an instant confused and ashamed then she tossed her pretty head and walked away  they led all the prisoners out into the garden and then through the broken wall and up and down the silver steps into the great square of the cities of twi  and here all the population crowded around them for this was the first time any of them had seen their high ki or even known that they were girls and the news of their quarrel and separation had aroused a great deal of excitement  let the executioners come forward cried the kiki gleefully and in answer to the command the twin executioners stepped up to the prisoners  they were big men these executioners each having a squint in one eye and a scar on the left cheek  they polished their axes a moment on their coatsleeves and then said to prince marvel and nerle who were to be the first victims  dont dodge please or our axes may not strike the right place  and do not be afraid for the blows will only hurt you an instant  in the land of twi it is usually considered a pleasure to be executed by us we are so exceedingly skillful  i can well believe that replied nerle although his teeth were chattering  but at this instant a loud shout was heard and the twin people of twi all turned their heads to find themselves surrounded by throngs of fierce enemies  prince marvel smiled for he saw among the newcomers the giants and dwarfs and the stern gray men of king terribus with their monarch calmly directing their movements and on the other side of the circle were the jolly faces and bushy whiskers of the fiftynine reformed thieves with burly wultakim at their head    19  the reunion of the high ki  the twins of twi were too startled and amazed to offer to fight with the odd people surrounding them  even the executioners allowed their axes to fall harmlessly to the ground and the double people soldiers and citizens alike turned to stare at the strangers in wonder  were here prince yelled wultakim his bristly beard showing over the heads of those who stood between  thank you answered prince marvel  and the men of spor are here added king terribus who was mounted on a fine milkwhite charger richly caparisoned  i thank the men of spor returned prince marvel graciously  shall we cut your foes into small pieces or would you prefer to hang them questioned the king of the reformed thieves loudly enough to set most of his hearers shivering  but now the little maid in yellow stepped up to prince marvel and regarding the youthful knight with considerable awe said sweetly  i beg you will pardon my people and spare them  they are usually good and loyal subjects and if they fought against metheir lawful high kiit was only because they were misled by my separation from my other half  that is true replied the prince and as you are still the lawful high ki of twi i will leave you to deal with your own people as you see fit  for those who have conquered your people are but your own allies and are still under your orders as i am myself  hearing this the green high ki walked up to her twin high ki and said boldly  i am your prisoner  it is now your turn  do with me as you will  i forgive you replied her sister in kindly tones  then the little maid who had met with defeat gave a sob and turned away weeping for she had expected anything but forgiveness  and now the kiki came forward and bowing their handsome blond heads before the high ki demanded are we forgiven also  yes said the girl but you are no longer fit to be rulers of my people  therefore you are henceforth deprived of your honorable offices of kiki which i shall now bestow upon these good captains here and she indicated the goodnatured officers who had first captured the prince and nerle  the people of twi eagerly applauded this act for the captains were more popular with them than the former kiki but the blond ones both flushed with humiliation and anger and said  the captains fought against you even as we did  yet the captains only obeyed your orders returned the high ki  so i hold them blameless  and what is to become of us now asked the former kiki  you will belong to the common people and earn your living playing tunes for them to dance by answered the high ki  and at this retort every one laughed so that the handsome youths turned away with twin scowls upon their faces and departed amidst the jeers of the crowd  better hang em to a tree little one shouted wultakim in his big voice they wont enjoy life much anyhow  but the maid shook her pretty head and turned to the prince  will you stay here and help me to rule my kingdom she asked  i can not do that replied prince marvel for i am but a wandering adventurer and must soon continue my travels  but i believe you will be able to rule your people without my help  it is not so easy a task she answered sighing  for i am singular and my people are all double  well let us hold a meeting in your palace said the prince and then we can decide what is best to be done  so they dismissed the people who cheered their high ki enthusiastically returning quietly to their daily tasks and the gossip that was sure to follow such important events as they had witnessed  the army of king terribus and the fiftynine reformed thieves went to the twin palaces of the ki and the kiki and made merry with feasting and songs to celebrate their conquest  and the high ki followed by the prince nerle king terribus and wultakim as well as by the ki and the newlyappointed kiki mounted the silver steps and passed over the wall to the royal palaces  the green high ki followed them still weeping disconsolately  when they had all reached the throneroom the high ki seated herself on one of the beautiful thrones and said  by some strange chance which i am unable to explain my twin and i have become separated so that instead of thinking and acting alike we are now individualsas are all the strange men who have passed through the hole in the hedge  and being individuals we can no longer agree nor can one of us lawfully rule over the kingdom of twi where all the subjects are twins thinking and acting in unison  said prince marvel  your highness i alone can explain why you became separated from your twin  by means of a fairy enchantment which i learned years ago i worked upon you a spell which compelled your brain to work independent of your sisters brain  it seems to me that it is better each person should think her own thoughts and live her own life rather than be yoked to another person and obliged to think and act as a twin or onehalf of a complete whole  and since you are now the one high ki and the acknowledged ruler of this country i will agree to work the same fairy spell on all your people so that no longer will there be twin minds in all this land of twi  but all the cows and dogs and horses and other animals are double as well as the people suggested the old ki blinking their little eyes in amazement at the thought of being forever separated from each other  i can also work the spell upon all the twin animals said the prince after a moments hesitation  and all our houses are built double with twin doors and windows and chimneys to accommodate our twin people continued the high ki  and the trees and flowersand even the blades of grassare all double and our roads are double andand everything else is double  i alone the ruler of this land am singular  prince marvel became thoughtful now for he did not know how to separate trees and flowers and it would be a tedious task to separate the twin houses  why not leave the country as it is asked king terribus of spor the high ki is welcome to come to my castle to live and then she need no longer bother about the land of twi which seems to me a poor place after all  and your sister may come with me to my cave and be the queen of the reformed thieves which is a much more important office than being high ki of twi added big wultakim who had placed the maiden in green upon a cushion at his feet and was striving to comfort her by gently stroking her silken hair with his rough hand  but i love my country and do not wish to leave it answered the yellow high ki  and i love my twin sister and regret that our minds have become separated she continued sadly  i have it exclaimed nerle  let the prince reunite you making you regular twins of twi again and then you can continue to rule the country as the double high ki and everything will be as it was before  the yellow high ki clapped her pink hands with delight and looked eagerly at the prince  will you she asked  will you please reunite us  and then all our troubles will be ended  this really seemed to marvel the best thing to be done  so he led the maid in green to the other throne where she had once sat and after replacing the golden crown upon her brow he whispered a fairy spell of much mystical power  then the prince stepped back and regarded the maidens earnestly and after a moment both the high ki smiled upon him in unison and saidspeaking the same words in the same voices and with the same accents  thank you very much    20  kwytoffle the tyrant  having restored the high ki to their former condition to the great joy of the ancient ki prince marvel led his friends back to the palaces where his men were waiting  they were just in time to prevent serious trouble for the fiftyeight reformed thieves had been boasting of their prowess to the huge giants and tiny dwarfs of king terribus and this had resulted in a quarrel as to which were the best fighters  had not their masters arrived at the right moment there would certainly have been a fierce battle and much bloodshedand all over something of no importance  terribus and wultakim soon restored order and then they accompanied the ki and the kiki to the public square where the people were informed that their supreme highnesses the high ki had been reunited and would thereafter rule them with twin minds as well as twin bodies there was great rejoicing at this news for every twin in twi was glad to have his troubles ended so easily and satisfactorily  that night the ryls and knooks and other invisible friends of prince marvel came and removed the dividing wall between the twin palaces of the high ki repairing speedily all the damage that had been done  and when our friends called upon the high ki the next morning they found the two maids again dressed exactly alike in yellow robes with strings of sparkling emeralds for ornament  and not even prince marvel could now tell one of the high ki from the other  as for the maids themselves it seemed difficult to imagine they had ever existed apart for a single moment  they were very pleasant and agreeable to their new friends and when they heard that prince marvel was about to leave them to seek new adventures they said  please take us with you  it seems to us that we ought to know something of the big outside world from whence you came  if we see other kingdoms and people we shall be better able to rule our own wisely  that seems reasonable answered marvel and i shall be very glad to have you accompany me  but who will rule the land of twi in your absence  the kiki shall be the rulers answered the high ki and we will take the ki with us  then i will delay my departure until tomorrow morning said the prince in order that your highnesses may have time to prepare for the journey  and then he went back to the palaces of the other rulers where the ki expressed themselves greatly pleased at the idea of traveling and the new kiki were proud to learn they should rule for some time the land of twi  wultakim also begged to join the party and so also did king terribus who had never before been outside of his own kingdom of spor so prince marvel willingly consented  the fiftyeight reformed thieves led by gunder returned to their cave where they were living comfortably on the treasure prince marvel had given them and the gray men and giants and dwarfs of spor departed for their own country  in the morning prince marvel led his own gay cavalcade through the hole in the hedge and they rode merrily away in search of adventure  by his side were the high ki mounted upon twin chestnut ponies that had remarkably slender limbs and graceful arched necks  the ponies moved with exactly the same steps and shook their manes and swished their tails at exactly the same time  behind the prince and the high ki were king terribus riding his great white charger and wultakim on a stout horse of jetblack color  the two ancient ki and nerle being of lesser rank than the others brought up the rear  when we return to our land of twi said the high ki we shall close up for all time the hole you made in the hedge for if we are different from the rest of the world it is better that we remain in seclusion  i think it is right you should do that replied prince marvel  yet i do not regret that i cut a hole in your hedge  it was the hedge that delayed us in coming more promptly to your assistance said terribus for we had hard work to find the hole you had made and so lost much valuable time  all is well that ends well laughed the prince  you certainly came in good time to rescue us from our difficulties  they turned into a path that led to auriel which nerle had heard spoken of as the kingdom of the setting sun  soon the landscape grew very pleasant to look upon the meadows being broad and green with groups of handsome trees standing about  the twilight of the land of twi was now replaced by bright sunshine and in the air was the freshness of the nearby sea  at evening they came to a large farmhouse where the owner welcomed them hospitably and gave them the best his house afforded  in answer to their questions about the kingdom of auriel he shook his head sadly and replied  it is a rich and beautiful country but has fallen under great misfortunes  for when the good king died about two years ago the kingdom was seized by a fierce and cruel sorcerer named kwytoffle who rules the people with great severity and makes them bring him all their money and valuable possessions  so every one is now very poor and unhappy and that is a great pity in a country so fair and fertile  but why do not the people rebel asked nerle  they dare not rebel answered the farmer because they fear the sorcery of kwytoffle  if they do not obey him he threatens to change them into grasshoppers and junebugs  has he ever changed any one into a grasshopper or a junebug asked prince marvel  no but the people are too frightened to oppose him and so he does not get the opportunity  and he has an army of fierce soldiers who are accustomed to beat the people terribly if they do not carry every bit of their wealth to the sorcerer  so there is no choice but to obey him  we certainly ought to hang this wicked creature exclaimed wultakim  i wish i had brought my foolkiller with me sighed king terribus for i could have kept him quite busy in this kingdom  can not something be done to rescue these poor people from their sad fate asked the lovely high ki anxiously  we will make a call upon this kwytoffle tomorrow answered prince marvel and see what the fellow is like  alas  alas wailed the good farmer you will all become grasshoppers and junebugsevery one of you  but none of the party seemed to fear that and having passed the night comfortably with the farmer they left his house and journeyed on into the kingdom of auriel  before noon they came upon the edge of a forest where a poor man was chopping logs into firewood  seeing prince marvels party approach this man ran toward them waving his hands and shouting excitedly  take the other path  take the other path  and why should we take the other path inquired the prince reining in his steed  because this one leads to the castle of the great sorcerer kwytoffle answered the man  but there is where we wish to go said marvel  what  you wish to go there cried the man  then you will be robbed and enslaved  not as long as we are able to fight laughed the big wultakim  if you resist the sorcerer you will be turned into grasshoppers and junebugs declared the man staring at them in wonder  how do you know that asked marvel  kwytoffle says so  he promises to enchant every one who dares defy his power  has any one ever yet dared defy him asked nerle  certainly not said the man  no one wishes to become a junebug or a grasshopper  no one dares defy him  i am anxious to see this sorcerer exclaimed king terribus  he ought to prove an interesting person for he is able to accomplish his purposes by threats alone  then let us ride on said marvel  dear us  dear us remonstrated the baldheaded ki are we to become grasshoppers then  we shall see returned the prince briefly  with your long legs added the pretty pair of high ki laughingly you ought to be able to jump farther than any other grasshopper in the kingdom  great kikakoo cried the ki nervously what a fate what a terrible fate  and your highnesses i suppose will become junebugs and flutter your wings with noises like buzzsaws    21  the wonderful book of magic  whatever their fears might be none of prince marvels party hesitated to follow him along the path through the forest in search of the sorcerer and by and by they came upon a large clearing  in the middle of this open space was a big building in such bad repair that its walls were tumbling down in several places and all around it the ground was uncared for and littered with rubbish  a man was walking up and down in front of this building with his head bowed low but when he heard the sound of approaching horses hoofs he looked up and stared for a moment in amazement  then with a shout of rage he rushed toward them and caught prince marvels horse by the bridle  how dare you he cried how dare you enter my forest  marvel jerked his bridle from the mans grasp and said in return  who are you  me  who am i  why i am the great and powerful kwytoffle  so beware  beware my sorcery  they all looked at the man curiously  he was short and very fat and had a face like a puffball with little red eyes and scarcely any nose at all  he wore a black gown with scarlet grasshoppers and junebugs embroidered upon the cloth and his hat was high and peaked with an imitation grasshopper of extraordinary size perched upon its point  in his right hand he carried a small black wand and around his neck hung a silver whistle on a silver cord  seeing that the strangers were gazing on him so earnestly kwytoffle thought they were frightened so he said again in a big voice  beware my vengeance  beware yourself retorted the prince  for if you do not treat us more respectfully i shall have you flogged  what  flog me shouted kwytoffle furiously  for this i will turn every one of you into grasshoppersunless you at once give me all the wealth you possess  poor man exclaimed nerle i can see you are longing for that flogging  will you have it now and he raised his ridingwhip above his head  kwytoffle stumbled backward a few paces and blew shrilly upon his silver whistle  instantly a number of soldiers came running from the building others following quickly after them until fully a hundred roughlooking warriors armed with swords and axes had formed in battle array facing the little party of prince marvel  arrest these strangers commanded kwytoffle in a voice like a roar capture them and bind them securely and then i will change them all into grasshoppers  all right answered the captain of the soldiers and then he turned to his men and shouted forwarddoublequickmarch  they came on with drawn swords at first running and then gradually dropping into a walk as they beheld nerle wultakim king terribus and marvel standing quietly waiting to receive them weapons in hand and ready for battle  a few paces off the soldiers hesitated and stopped altogether and kwytoffle yelled at the captain  why dont you go on  why dont you capture them  why dont you fight them  why they have drawn their swords responded the captain reproachfully  who cares roared the sorcerer  we care said the captain giving a shudder as he looked upon the strangers  their swords are sharp and some of us would get hurt  youre cowards shrieked the enraged kwytoffle  ill turn you all into junebugs  at this threat the soldiers dropped their swords and axes and all fell upon their knees trembling visibly and imploring their cruel master not to change them into junebugs  bah cried nerle scornfully why dont you fight  if we kill you then you will escape being junebugs  the fact is said the captain woefully we simply cant fight  for our swords are only tin and our axes are made of wood with silverpaper pasted over them  but why is that asked wultakim while all the party showed their surprise  why until now we have never had any need to fight said the captain for every one has quickly surrendered to us or run away the moment we came near  but you people do not appear to be properly frightened and now alas since you have drawn upon us the great sorcerers anger we shall all be transformed into junebugs  yes roared kwytoffle hopping up and down with anger you shall all be junebugs and these strangers i will transform into grasshoppers  very well said prince marvel quietly you can do it now  i will  i will cried the sorcerer  then why dont you begin inquired the prince  why dont i begin  why i havent got the enchantments with me thats why  do you suppose we great magicians carry around enchantments in our pockets returned the other in a milder tone  where do you keep your enchantments asked the prince  theyre in my dwelling snapped kwytoffle taking off his hat and fanning his fat face with the brim  then go and get them said marvel  nonsense  if i went to get the enchantments you would all run away retorted the sorcerer  not so protested nerle who was beginning to be amused  my greatest longing in life is to become a grasshopper  oh yes  please let us be grasshoppers exclaimed the high ki maids in the same breath  we want to hop  we want to hop  pleaseplease let us hop implored the baldheaded ki winking their left eyes at wultakim  by all means let us become grasshoppers said king terribus smiling and wultakim added  im sure your soldiers would enjoy being junebugs for then they wouldnt have to work  isnt that so boys  the bewildered soldiers looked at one another in perplexity and the still more bewildered sorcerer gazed on the speakers with staring eyes and wideopen mouth  i insist said prince marvel upon your turning us into grasshoppers and your soldiers into junebugs as you promised  if you do not then i will flog youas i promised  very well returned the sorcerer with a desperate look upon his face ill go and find the enchantment  and well go with you remarked the prince pleasantly  so the entire party accompanied kwytoffle into the house where they entered a large room that was in a state of much disorder  let me see said the sorcerer rubbing his ears as if trying to think i wonder if i put them in this cupboard  you see he explained no one has ever before dared me to transform him into a junebug or grasshopper so i have almost forgotten where i keep my book of enchantments  no its not in the cupboard he continued looking there but it surely must be in this chest  it was not in the chest either and so the sorcerer continued to look in all sorts of queer places for his book of enchantments without finding it  whenever he paused in his search prince marvel would say sternly  go on  find the book  hunt it up  we are all anxious to become grasshoppers  and then kwytoffle would set to work again although big drops of perspiration were now streaming down his face  finally he pulled an old book from underneath the pillow of his bed and crying here it is carried it to the window  he turned a few leaves of the book and then said  how unfortunate  the compound i require to change you into grasshoppers must be mixed on the first day of september and as this is now the eighth day of september i must wait nearly a year before i can work the enchantment  how about the junebugs asked nerle  oh  ah  the junebug mixture can only be made at the dark o the moon said the sorcerer pretending to read and that is three weeks from now  let me read it said prince marvel suddenly snatching the book from kwytoffles hands  then he turned to the titlepage and read  lives of famous thieves and impostors  why this is not a book of enchantments  that is what i suspected said terribus  no one but a sorcerer can read the enchantments in this book declared kwytoffle but he hung his head with a sheepish look for he knew his deception had been well understood  is your own history written in this volume inquired marvel  no answered the sorcerer  then it ought to be said the prince for you are no sorcerer at all but merely a thief and an impostor    22  the queen of plenta  the soldiers of kwytoffle wanted to hang their old master at once for he had won their enmity by abusing them in many ways but prince marvel would not let them do this  however they tied the false sorcerer to a post and the captain gave him a good whippingone lash for each letter in the words grasshopper and junebug  kwytoffle howled loudly for mercy but no one was at all sorry for him  wultakim tied a rope around the impostors neck and when the party left the castle they journeyed all through the kingdom of auriel and at every town or city they came to the reformed thief would cry out to the populace  here is the terrible sorcerer kwytoffle who threatened to change you into grasshoppers and junebugs  but you may see that he is a very common man with no powers of sorcery whatever  and then the people would laugh and pelt mud at their former tyrant and thank prince marvel for haying exposed the false and wicked creature  and they called the son of their old king back to his lawful throne where he ruled wisely and well and the hoarded wealth of kwytoffle was divided among the people again and soon the country became prosperous once more  this adventure was very amusing to the pretty high ki of twi  it afforded them laughter for many days and none of the party ever saw a grasshopper or a junebug afterward without thinking of the terrible sorcerer kwytoffle  they left that disgraced person grooming horses for his board in the stables of the new king and proceeded upon their journey  without further event they reached the splendid southern kingdom of plenta which was the most delightfully situated of any dominion in the enchanted island of yew  it was ruled by a good and generous queen who welcomed the strangers to her palace and gave a series of gay entertainments in their honor  king terribus was especially an object of interest for every one had heard his name and feared him and his fierce people  but when they beheld his pleasant countenance and listened to his gentle voice they began to regard him with much love and respect and really terribus was worthy of their friendship since he had changed from a deformed monster into an ordinary man and had forbidden his people ever again to rob and plunder their weaker neighbors  but the most popular personages visiting at the court of the queen of plenta were the lovely high ki of twi  although beautiful girls abounded in this kingdom none could compare with the royal twins and their peculiar condition only served to render them the more interesting  two youths would approach the high ki at the same time and invite them to dance and in united voices they would accept the invitation and go whirling around the room with exactly the same steps laughing at the same instant and enjoying the dance equally  but if one youth asked his partner a question both the twins would make answer and that was sure to confuse and embarrass the youth  still the maids managed very well to adapt themselves to the ways of people who were singular although they sometimes became a little homesick for twi where they were like all the other people  the baldheaded ki kept watchful eyes on their youthful rulers and served them very cheerfully  but with all their travels and experiences the old men could never be convinced it was better to be singular than double  prince marvel was the real hero of the party and nerle received much attention on account of his masters popularity  he did not seem as unhappy as usual and when the prince inquired the reason his esquire answered that he believed the excitement of their adventures was fast curing him of his longing for something he could not have  as for the pleasure of suffering he had had some experience of that too and it was not nearly so delightful as he had expected  wultakim was not a society man so he stayed around the royal stables and made friends with the grooms and traded his big black horse for two bay ones and a gold neckchain and was fairly content with his lot  and so the party enjoyed several happy weeks at the court of the good queen of plenta until one day the terrible news arrived that carried them once more into exciting adventures    23  the red rogue of dawna  one morning while they were all standing in the courtyard waiting for their horses as they were about to go for a ride a courier came galloping swiftly up to the palace and cried  does any one know where prince marvel can be found  i am prince marvel replied the young knight stepping out from among the others  then have i reached my journeys end said the courier whose horse was nearly exhausted from long and hard riding  the lady seseley is in great danger and sends for you to come and rescue her  the great baron merd her father has been killed and his castle destroyed and all his people are either captives or have been slain outright  and who has done this evil thing asked prince marvel looking very stern and grave  the red rogue of dawna answered the messenger  he quarreled with the baron merd and sent his savage hordes to tear down his castle and slay him  i myself barely escaped with my life and the lady seseley had but time to say before she was carried off that if i could find prince marvel he would surely rescue her  and so i will declared the prince if she be still alive  who is this lady seseley asked nerle who had come to his masters side  she is my first friend to whom i owe my very existence  it is her image together with those of her two friends which is graven on my shield answered prince marvel thoughtfully  and what will you do inquired the esquire  i must go to her at once  when they heard of his mission all the party insisted on accompanying him  even the dainty high ki could not be deterred by any thoughts of dangers they might encounter and after some discussion prince marvel allowed them to join him  so wultakim sharpened his big broadsword and nerle carefully prepared his masters horse so that before an hour had passed they were galloping toward the province of the red rogue of dawna  prince marvel knew little concerning this personage but nerle had much to tell of him  the red rogue had once been page to a wise scholar and magician who lived in a fine old castle in dawna and ruled over a large territory  the boy was very small and weaksmaller even than the average dwarfand his master did not think it worth while to watch him  but one evening while the magician was standing upon the top of the highest tower of his castle the boy gave him a push from behind and he met death on the sharp rocks below  then the boy took his masters book of magic and found a recipe to make one grow  he made the mixture and swallowed it and straightway began to grow big and tall  this greatly delighted him until he found he was getting much bigger than the average man and rapidly becoming a giant  so he sought for a way to arrest the action of the magical draft but before he could find it he had grown to enormous proportions and was bigger than the biggest giant  there was nothing in the book of magic to make one grow smaller so he was obliged to remain as he wasthe largest man in the enchanted island  all this had happened in a single night  the morning after his masters murder the page announced himself lord of the castle and seeing his enormous size none dared deny his right to rule  on account of his bushy hair which was fiery red in color and the bushy red beard that covered his face when he became older people came to call him the red one  and after his evil deeds and quarrelsome temper had made him infamous throughout the island people began to call him the red rogue of dawna  he had gathered around him a number of savage barbarians as wicked and quarrelsome as himself and so none dared to interfere with him or even to meet him if it were possible to avoid it  this same red rogue it was who had drawn the good baron merd into a quarrel and afterward slain the old knight and his followers destroyed his castle and carried his little daughter seseley and her girl friends berna and helda into captivity shutting them up in his own gloomy castle  the red rogue thought he had done a very clever thing and had no fear of the consequences until one of his men came running up to the castle to announce that prince marvel and his companions were approaching to rescue the lady seseley  how many of them are there demanded the red rogue  there are eight altogether answered the man but two of them are girls  and they expect to force me to give up my captives asked the red one laughing with a noise like the roar of a waterfall  why i shall make prisoners of every one of them  the man looked at his master fearfully and replied  this prince marvel is very famous and all people speak of his bravery and power  it was he who conquered king terribus of spor and that mighty ruler is now his friend and is one of the eight who approach  the red rogue stopped laughing for the fame of spors terrible king had long ago reached him  and he reflected that any one who could conquer the army of giants and dwarfs and gray men that served terribus must surely be one to be regarded seriously  moreoverand this was a secretthe red rogue had never been able to gain the strength to correspond with his gigantic size but had ever remained as weak as when he was a puny boy  so he was accustomed to rely on his cunning and on the terror his very presence usually excited to triumph over his enemies  and he began to be afraid of this prince  you say two of the party are girls he asked  yes said the man but also among them are king terribus himself and the renowned wultakim formerly king of thieves who was conquered by the prince although accounted a hard fighter and is now his devoted servant  and there are two old men who are just alike and have a very fierce look about them  they are said to come from the hidden kingdom of twi  by this time the red rogue was thoroughly frightened but he did not yet despair of defeating his enemies  he knew better than to attempt to oppose prince marvel by force but he still hoped to conquer him by trickery and deceit  among the wonderful things that the red rogues former master the wise scholar and magician had made were two large enchanted mirrors which were set on each side of the great hallway of the castle  heavy curtains were drawn over the surfaces of these mirrors because they both possessed a dreadful magical power  for whenever any one looked into one of them his reflection was instantly caught and imprisoned in the mirror and his body at the same time became invisible to all earthly eyes only the mirror retaining his form  while considering a way to prevent the prince from freeing the lady seseley the red rogue happened to think of these mirrors which had never yet been used  so he went stealthily into the great hall and drew aside the covering from one of the mirrors  he did not dare look into the mirror himself but hurried away to another room and then sent a page up a back stairway to summon the lady seseley and her two maids into his presence  the girls at once obeyed for they greatly feared the red rogue and of course they descended the front stairway and walked through the great hall  at once the large mirror that had been exposed to view caught the eye of seseley and she paused to regard her reflection in the glass  her two companions did likewise and instantly all three girls became invisible while the mirror held their reflections fast in its magic surface  the red rogue was watching them through a crack in the door and seeing the girls disappear he gave a joyful laugh and exclaimed  now let prince marvel find them if he can  the three girls began to wander aimlessly through the castle for not only were they invisible to others but also to themselves and to one another and they knew not what to do nor which way to turn    24  the enchanted mirrors  presently prince marvel and his party arrived and paused before the doors of the castle where the red rogue stood bowing to them with mock politeness and with an evil grin showing on his red face  i come to demand the release of the lady seseley and her companions prince marvel announced in a bold voice  and i also intend to call you to account for the murder of baron merd  you must be at the wrong castle answered the red one for i have murdered no baron nor have i any lady seseley as prisoner  are you not the red rogue of dawna demanded the prince  men call me by that name acknowledged the other  then you are deceiving me said the prince  no indeed answered the red rogue mockingly  i wouldnt deceive any one for the world  but if you dont believe me you are welcome to search my castle  that i shall do returned the prince sternly whether i have your permission or not and he began to dismount  but nerle restrained him saying  master i beg you will allow me to search the castle  for this red rogue is playing some trick upon us i am sure and if anything happened to you there would be no one to protect the little high ki and our other friends  but suppose something should happen to you inquired the prince anxiously  in that case said nerle you can avenge me  the advice was so reasonable under the circumstances that the prince decided to act upon it  very well said he go and search the castle and i will remain with our friends  but if anything happens to you i shall call the red rogue to account  so nerle entered the castle passing by the huge form of its owner who only nodded to the boy and grinned with delight  the esquire found himself in the great hall and began to look around him but without seeing any one  then he advanced a few steps and to his surprise discovered a large mirror in which were reflected the faces and forms of three girls as well as his own  why here they are he attempted to say but he could not hear his own voice  he glanced down at himself but could see nothing at allfor his body had become invisible  his reflection was still in the glass and he knew that his body existed the same as before but although he yet saw plainly the hall and all that it contained he could see neither himself nor any other person of flesh  after waiting a considerable time for his esquire to reappear prince marvel became impatient  what have you done with nerle he asked of the red rogue  nothing was the reply  i have been here plainly within your sight every moment  let me go and find him exclaimed king terribus and rushed into the castle before the prince could reply  but terribus also encountered the enchanted mirror and the prince waited in vain for his return  then wultakim volunteered to go in search of the others and drew his big sharp sword before entering the hall  but an hour passed by and he did not return  the red rogue was overjoyed at the success of his stratagem and could scarce refrain from laughing outright at the princes anxiety  marvel was really perplexed  he knew some treachery was afoot but could not imagine what it was  and when the pretty high ki declared their intention of entering the castle he used every endeavor to dissuade them  but the twin girls would not be denied so great was their curiosity  so the prince said  well we will all go together so that the ki and i may be able to protect you  the red rogue gladly granted them admittance and they passed him and entered the great hall  the place appeared to them to be completely empty so they walked along and came opposite the mirror  here all stopped at once and the twin high ki uttered exclamations of surprise and the twin ki shouted great kikakoo  for there in the glass were the reflections of the three girls and nerle and king terribus and wultakim  and there were also the reflections of the twin high ki and the twin ki only prince marvels reflection was missing and this was because of his fairy origin  for the glass could reflect and hold only the forms of mortals  but the prince saw the reflections of all the others and then made the discovery that the forms of the ki and the high ki had become invisible  no one except himself appeared to be standing in the great hall of the red rogues castle  yet grouped within the glass were the likenesses of all his friends as well as those of lady seseley and her companions and all were staring back at him earnestly as if imploring him to save them  the mystery was now explained and prince marvel rushed from the hall to find the treacherous red rogue  but that clever trickster had hidden himself in an upper room and for the present was safely concealed  for a time prince marvel could not think what to do  such magic was all unknown to him and how to free the imprisoned forms of his friends was a real problem  he walked around the castle but no one was in sight the rogue having given orders to all his people to keep away only the tethered horses did he see and these raised their heads and whinnied as if in sympathy with his perplexity  then he went back into the hall and searched all the rooms of the castle without finding a single person  on his return he stopped in front of the mirror and sorrowfully regarded the faces of his friends who again seemed to plead for relief  and while he looked a sudden fit of anger came over him at being outwitted by this red rogue of dawna  scarcely knowing what he did he seized his sword by the blade and struck the mirror a powerful blow with the heavy hilt  it shattered into a thousand fragments which fell clattering upon the stone floor in every direction  and at once the charm was broken each of his friends now became visible  they appeared running toward him from all parts of the castle where they had been wandering in their invisible forms  they called out joyful greetings to one another and then all of them surrounded the prince and thanked him earnestly for releasing them  the little lady seseley and her friends berna and helda were a bit shy in the presence of so many strangers but they alone knew the princes secret and that he was a fairy transformed for a year so they regarded him as an old and intimate acquaintance and after being introduced by him to the others of his party they became more at ease  the sweet little high ki maids at once attracted seseley and she loved them almost at first sight  but it was nerle who became the little ladys staunchest friend for there was something rather mystical and unnatural to him about the high ki who seemed almost like fairies while in seseley he recognized a hearty substantial girl of his own rank in life  while they stood talking and congratulating one another outside of the castle the red rogue of dawna appeared among them  he had heard the noise of the smashing of his great mirror and had come running downstairs from his hidingplace to find his cunning had all been for naught and his captives were free  a furious anger then took possession of the rogue and forgetting his personal weakness he caught up a huge battleax and rushed out to hurl himself upon prince marvel intending to do him serious injury  but the prince was not taken unawares  he saw the red rogue coming and met him with drawn sword striking quickly at the arm that wielded the big ax  the stroke was as sure as it was quick and piercing the arm of the giant caused him to drop the ax with a howl of pain  then prince marvel seized the red rogue by the earwhich he was just tall enough to reachand dragged him up the steps and into the castle the big fellow crying for mercy at every step and trembling like a leaf through cowardice  but down the hall marvel marched him seeking some room where the rogue might be safely locked in  the great curtain that covered the second enchanted mirror now caught prince marvels eye and still holding his prisoner by the ear he reached out his left hand and pulled aside the drapery  the red rogue looked to see what his captor was doing and beheld his own reflection in the magic mirror  instantly he gave a wild cry and disappeared his body becoming absolutely invisible while his coarse red countenance stared back from the mirror  and then prince marvel gave a sigh of relief and dropped the curtain over the surface of the mirror  for he realized that the red rogue of dawna had at last met with just punishment and was safely imprisoned for all time    25  the adventurers separate  when prince marvel and his friends had ridden away from the castle the savage followers of the red one came creeping up to listen for their masters voice  but silence reigned in every part of the castle and after stealing fearfully through the rooms without seeing any one the fellows became filled with terror and fled from the place never to return  and afterward the neighbors whispered that the castle was haunted by the spirit of the terrible red rogue and travelers dared not stop in the neighborhood but passed by quickly and with averted faces  the prince and his party rode gaily along toward the kingdom of heg for nerle had invited them all to visit his fathers castle  they were very happy over their escape and only the little lady seseley became sad at times when she thought of her fathers sad fate  the baron neggar who was nerles father was not only a wealthy nobleman but exceedingly kind and courteous so that every member of prince marvels party was welcomed to the big castle in a very hospitable manner  nerle was eagerly embraced by both his father and mother who were overjoyed to see him return safe and sound after his wanderings and adventures  and have you been cured of your longing for something that you can not have asked the baron anxiously  not quite said nerle laughing but i am more reconciled to my lot for i find wherever i go people are longing for just the things they can not get and probably would not want if they had them  so as it seems to be the fate of most mortals to live unsatisfied i shall try hereafter to be more contented  these words delighted the good baron and he gave a rich and magnificent feast in honor of his sons return  the high ki of twi after passing several pleasant days at nerles home now decided that they had seen enough of the world and would be glad to return to their own kingdom where all was peaceful and uneventful and rule it to the end of their days  so the baron furnished them an escort of twenty menatarms and these conducted the high ki and the aged ki safely back to the hole in the hedge  and after they had entered the land of twi the first act of the high ki was to order the hedge repaired and the hole blocked up and i have never heard that any one from that time forth ever succeeded in gaining admittance to the hidden kingdom  so its subsequent history is unknown  king terribus also bade the prince an affectionate farewell and rode back to his own kingdom and burly wultakim accompanied him as far as the cave where the fiftyeight reformed thieves awaited him  nerles mother gladly adopted the lady seseley and her two companions and thereafter they made their home at the barons castle  and years afterward when they had grown to be women seseley was married to nerle and became the lady of the castle herself  prince marvel enjoyed the feasting and dancing at the castle very much but after the party began to break up and the high ki and the ki had left him as well as king terribus and honest wultakim the young knight grew thoughtful and sometimes uneasy and his happy laugh was less frequently heard  nerle often regarded his young master with a feeling of awe for there occasionally came a look into marvels eyes that reminded him more of the immortals than of any human being  but the prince treated him with rare kindness and always pressed nerles hand affectionately when he bade him good night for he had grown fond of his esquire  also they had long conversations together during which nerle gleaned a great deal of knowledge and received some advice that was of much use to him in his later life  one day prince marvel sought out lady seseley and said  will you ride with me to the forest of lurla  willingly she answered and calling berna and helda to attend them they mounted their horses and rode swiftly away for it was a long distance to lurla  by noon the party entered the forest and although the path they traversed was unknown to the girls who had usually entered the forest from its other side near to where the baron merds castle had stood the prince seemed to have no difficulty in finding his way  he guided them carefully along the paths his handsome warcharger stepping with much grace and dignity until at length they came to a clearing  here the prince paused abruptly and seseley looked around her and at once recognized the place  why she exclaimed in surprise it is the fairy bower  and then she turned to prince marvel and asked in a soft voice  is the year ended prince  his smile was a bit sad as he answered slowly  the year will be ended in five minutes    26  the end of the year  the girls sat upon the green moss and waited  prince marvel stood silent beside his horse  the silver armor was as bright as the day he donned it nor was there a dent in his untarnished shield  the sword that had done such good service he held lightly in his hand and the horse now and then neighed softly and turned to look at him with affectionate eyes  seseley began to tremble with excitement and berna and helda stared at the prince with big round eyes  but after all they saw nothing so remarkable as they expected  for presentlyand it all happened in a flashprince marvel was gone from their midst and a handsome slenderlimbed deer darted from the bower and was quickly lost in the thick forest  on the ground lay a sheet of bark and a twig from a tree and beside them was lady seseleys white velvet cloak  then the three girls each drew a long breath and looked into one anothers eyes and while thus engaged a peal of silvery laughter sounded in their ears and made them spring quickly to their feet  before them stood a tiny and very beautiful fairy clothed in floating gossamer robes of rose and pearl color and with eyes sparkling like twin stars  prince marvel exclaimed the three together  no indeed cried the fairy with a pretty little pout  i am no one but myself and really i believe i shall now be content to exist for a few hundred years in my natural form  i have quite enjoyed my year as a mortal but after all there are i find some advantages in being a fairy  good by my dears  and with another ripple of laughter the pretty creature vanished and the girls were left alone    27  a hundred years afterward  about a hundred years after prince marvel enjoyed his strange adventures in the enchanted island of yew an odd thing happened  a hidden mirror in a crumbling old castle of dawna broke loose from its fastenings and fell crashing on the stone pavement of the deserted hall  and from amid the ruins rose the gigantic form of a man  his hair and beard were a fiery red and he gazed at the desolation around him in absolute amazement  it was the red rogue of dawna set free from his imprisonment  he wandered out and found strange scenes confronting him for during the hundred years a great change had taken place in the enchanted island  great cities had been built and great kingdoms established civilization had won the people and they no longer robbed or fought or indulged in magical arts but were busily employed and leading respectable lives  when the red rogue tried to tell folks who he was they but laughed at him thinking the fellow crazy  he tried to get together a band of thieves as wultakim had done in the old days but none would join him  and so forced to be honest against his will the rogue was driven to earn a living by digging in the garden of a wealthy noble of whom he had never before heard  but often he would pause in his labors and lean on his spade while thoughts of the old days of wild adventure passed through his mind in rapid succession and then the big man would shake his red head with a puzzled air and mutter  i wonder who that prince marvel could have been  and i wonder what ever became of him
